        "# Comprehensive Analysis of Earnings Call Data and CEO Public Appearances\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a detailed analysis of earnings call data in relation to CEO public appearances, including conferences, interviews, and other events. The objective is to identify and analyze correlations between earnings call metrics and the CEO's public statements. The analysis leverages various machine learning and natural language processing techniques to derive meaningful insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Loading and Cleaning Data**: Earnings call data and CEO public appearance transcripts are loaded from CSV files and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy. This includes parsing dates, cleaning percentage values, and standardizing the data.\n",
        "- **Text Preprocessing**: Text data from transcripts is cleaned to remove stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant elements, and is then tokenized to prepare for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Transcript Loading and Processing**: Earnings call transcripts are loaded, sorted, and preprocessed. These transcripts are then converted into a dictionary format for easy access and querying.\n",
        "- **Prompt Template Definition**: A prompt template is defined for querying the language model, focusing on extracting relevant information from the transcripts to answer specific questions.\n",
        "- **Retrieving Relevant Transcripts**: The pipeline retrieves transcripts that fall within the relevant date ranges around each earnings call, generating a context for the language model to produce responses.\n",
        "- **Generating Responses**: Using a language model, responses are generated based on the provided context and prompt, capturing insights from the transcripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Filtering and Embedding Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Filtering Valid Responses**: Responses are filtered to exclude those with empty or irrelevant sources, focusing on meaningful data.\n",
        "- **BERT Embeddings**: The filtered responses are transformed into BERT embeddings to represent the semantic content of the text.\n",
        "- **Embedding and Data Distribution Comparison**: BERT embeddings are compared with the distribution of scaled financial data to assess how well the embeddings capture the data's characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Distribution Comparison and KL Divergence\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Histogram Calculation**: Histograms are computed for both the embeddings and the scaled financial data, normalizing the distributions to facilitate comparison.\n",
        "- **KL Divergence**: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is calculated to quantify the difference between the embedding distribution and the scaled data distribution. This measure helps evaluate the effectiveness of the embeddings in representing the financial data's statistical properties.\n",
        "- **Visualization**: Histograms of the distributions are plotted to visually compare the embedding and data distributions, providing intuitive insight into the alignment between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results and Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Correlation Analysis**: The notebook successfully identifies correlations between earnings call metrics and CEO public statements, revealing how the CEO's public appearances may influence or reflect financial performance.\n",
        "- **Embedding Effectiveness**: The analysis demonstrates that BERT embeddings capture key aspects of the transcripts, with KL divergence providing a quantitative measure of how well these embeddings represent the financial data distribution.\n",
        "- **Visual Insights**: The plotted histograms offer a visual comparison of distributions, highlighting the effectiveness of the embedding representation in capturing financial data characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook effectively combines text analysis and financial data to derive actionable insights, offering a comprehensive view of the relationship between CEO communications and earnings performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Note:* This notebook only correlates the earnings call for `Apple Inc.` with the CEO transcriptions.\n",

        "\n",
        "This code outlines the pipeline for preprocessing text from files, splitting it into chunks, and storing it in a Chroma vector store. The pipeline uses various libraries and functions to handle text extraction, cleaning, and storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline includes the following steps:\n",
        "1. **Library Imports**: Import necessary libraries for file handling, text processing, and vector storage.\n",
        "2. **API Key Initialization**: Set up the OpenAI API key for embeddings.\n",
        "3. **Constants and Global Variables**: Define paths and global variables used in the pipeline.\n",
        "4. **Helper Functions**: Define functions for text extraction and preprocessing.\n",
        "5. **Main Functions**: Implement the core functionality for reading files, splitting text, and storing it in Chroma.\n",
        "6. **Execution**: Run the pipeline to process and store the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Library Imports\n",
        "\n",
        "The code imports several libraries:\n",
        "- **`re`**: For regular expression operations, used to extract dates from text.\n",
        "- **`os`**: For interacting with the operating system, such as file and directory operations.\n",
        "- **`shutil`**: For high-level file operations, like deleting directories.\n",
        "- **`langchain_community`** and **`langchain_openai`**: For document loading, text splitting, and vector storage functionalities.\n",
        "- **`openai`**: For interacting with OpenAI's API to use embeddings.\n",
        "- **`nltk`**: For natural language processing, including stop words and stemming.\n",
        "- **`unidecode`**: For text normalization to handle special characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. API Key Initialization\n",
        "\n",
        "The OpenAI API key is set up for authentication. This key is necessary for using OpenAI's embeddings. The key is stored in an environment variable for secure access during the execution of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Constants and Global Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`CHROMA_PATH`**: Specifies the directory path where the Chroma database will be stored.\n",
        "- **`DATA_PATH`**: Indicates the directory containing the input text files.\n",
        "- **`BATCH_SIZE`**: Defines the number of documents to process at a time.\n",
        "- **`transcripts_`**: A global dictionary to hold processed transcripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Helper Functions\n",

        "### Extract Date\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "This function cleans the text by:\n",
        "- Tokenizing the text into words.\n",
        "- Removing stop words using the NLTK library.\n",
        "- Rejoining the remaining tokens into a cleaned string.\n",
        "- Other preprocessing techniques were purposefully removed because the LLM handles the raw data better than the preprocessed one.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Read Files\n",
        "\n",
        "This function reads files from a specified directory. It:\n",
        "- Filters files containing \"Apple\" in their names.\n",
        "- Extracts the date from the first line of each file.\n",

        "### Data Store Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "This function initializes the process of generating the data store. It calls the `generate_data_store` function to load transcripts, preprocess them, split them into chunks, and save them to Chroma.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Split Text\n",
        "\n",
        "This function splits the text into chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. It handles overlapping segments to ensure the context is preserved across chunks.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "This code outlines the process for retrieving and analyzing earnings call transcripts using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The pipeline involves several key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline performs the following tasks:\n",
        "1. **Load and Preprocess Transcripts**\n",
        "2. **Define Prompt Template**\n",
        "3. **Retrieve Relevant Transcripts**\n",
        "4. **Generate Responses**\n",
        "5. **Display Results**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Load and Preprocess Transcripts\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Load Transcripts**: Read transcript files from a specified directory and convert them into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "- **Preprocess Data**: Convert the 'Date' column to a datetime format, sort the DataFrame by date, and reset the index for a clean DataFrame.\n",
        "- **Reformat Data**: Convert the DataFrame back into a dictionary with dates as keys and transcript content as values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Define Prompt Template\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Prompt Template**: Define a template for the prompt used in generating responses. The template includes instructions for answering questions based on the provided context from earnings call transcripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Retrieve Relevant Transcripts\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Function Setup**: Define a function to retrieve transcripts based on a specified date range and query text.\n",
        "- **Token Counting**: Track the number of tokens to ensure that the context does not exceed a maximum limit.\n",
        "- **Database Search**: Use Chroma vector stores to perform similarity searches and retrieve relevant chunks of text based on the query.\n",
        "- **Context Building**: Assemble a context from the relevant transcripts for use in the prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Generate Responses\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Query Processing**: For each row in the merged DataFrame, build a query and retrieve relevant transcripts.\n",
        "- **Context Preparation**: Append retrieved documents to the context and format the final prompt using the defined template.\n",
        "- **Response Generation**: Use a language model to generate responses based on the prompt.\n",
        "- **Token Management**: Encode and decode tokens to ensure that the prompt length is manageable and analyze token usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Display Results\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Response Compilation**: Collect and format the generated responses along with source information.\n",
        "- **Output Results**: Print the responses to review the results of the RAG pipeline.\n",

        "Comparing the distribution of BERT embeddings with the distribution of scaled financial data provides valuable insights into how well the embeddings represent the underlying data characteristics. BERT embeddings capture semantic features of the text, and their distribution should ideally align with the distribution of related financial metrics if the model’s representations are accurate and meaningful. By comparing these distributions, we can assess whether the embeddings effectively capture the variability and patterns present in the financial data.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Kullback-Leibler` (KL) divergence is a suitable metric for this comparison because it measures the difference between two probability distributions. Specifically, KL divergence quantifies how one probability distribution diverges from a reference distribution, providing a precise measure of the dissimilarity between the embedding distribution and the scaled data distribution. By calculating the KL divergence, we can evaluate whether the embedding space accurately reflects the statistical properties of the financial data, helping to determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in representing the financial domain’s nuances.\n",

        "**Visual Analysis**:\n",
        "1. **Overlap of Distributions**:\n",
        "   - The histogram shows a considerable overlap between the embedding distribution (blue) and the scaled data distribution (orange) in the central region around the mean value (0). This overlap indicates that there might be a similar pattern or trend captured in both the textual data (via BERT embeddings) and the financial data.\n",
        "   - The presence of overlapping areas suggests that certain features or characteristics represented in the BERT embeddings are also reflected in the scaled financial data. This overlap is a visual indication of a potential correlation between the two datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Distribution Shape**:\n",
        "   - Both distributions appear to follow a roughly bell-shaped curve, which implies that they might both follow a normal distribution to some extent. This similarity in shape further supports the notion that the two types of data might be related or influenced by similar underlying factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Divergence Points**:\n",
        "   - The areas where the distributions diverge, particularly on the tails, indicate differences in how extreme values are represented in each dataset. While the central overlap is significant, these divergences might provide insight into specific cases where the textual data does not align well with financial performance, or vice versa.\n",
        "   - These divergence points are crucial for understanding outliers or anomalies in the data, which can be as informative as the areas of overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**:\n",
        "- **Good Correlation Indicated**: The histogram shows a good visual correlation between the BERT embeddings of the CEO's public communications and the scaled financial data. The significant overlap in the central region of the distributions suggests that the text data from the CEO’s communications is reflective of or correlated with the financial performance captured in the scaled data.\n",
        "- **Practical Implications**: If the textual data can reliably predict or reflect financial data trends, this correlation could be used to forecast financial performance based on the CEO's public statements, providing valuable insights for decision-makers and analysts.\n"
