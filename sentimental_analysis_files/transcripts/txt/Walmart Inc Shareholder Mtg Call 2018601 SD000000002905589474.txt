So leaving the best to last. Walmart International, are you out there? Thank you.
Thank you. Let's get this meeting started with a cheer. Let's go. Give me a W-A-L-

Back here with my Walmart, my Walmart extended family. Are we family? Yes. How's
everybody doing this morning? Listen, I'm so excited to spend some time with you
all because this is awesome. Thank you. So much for inviting me. Listen, things have
changed in -- since 2009. I was here in 2009. You remember that? 2009 changed. I

In 2009 -- now when I read this, I was like this must be a misprint. In 2009, you guys
did $400 billion in sales. Give it up for that. But this year, give me a drumroll, this
year, this year, sales are over $0.5 trillion. Make some noise, right. $0.5 trillion, I

I know you're looking at me like Foxx, we got to go. We got to get going, baby.
Doug was the CEO of Walmart International. Give it up for Doug. Not the entire

Look, I'm pretty familiar how this goes. I'm sure how the shareholders' meeting thing
works. We connect with all friends. We make new friends. We're going to laugh a
little bit. We're going to get some music on. We're going to learn about each other.
Ain't that right, Sam's Club? Yes. Indeed. Ain't that right, Walmart? Yes. Indeed. And
listen, we're going to have a lot of great music and have a great time. Anyway, I
promise you we're going to do all of these things and more, all at 8:00 a.m. getting
it down on a Friday morning with 14,000 people in the building right now.
What do you say we get this thing going? To kick this oﬀ, I want to bring up a guy
that I have a lot in common with. We're both very good looking. Got to give (half a

there's a big diﬀerence. One of us just scaled Mount Everest a couple of weeks ago.

don't do a lot of snow. You know what I'm saying? If it was in the Bahamas, you know

scale Mount Everest, the Walmart Chairman of the Board, Greg Penner.
{BIO 5585986 <GO>}
All right. Good morning. Great to have you. Wow, that is a lot of energy. Good
morning. It's my honor, as your Chairman, to welcome you to the 48th Annual
Walmart Associate and Shareholders' Meeting.
As Jamie mentioned, I was actually on Mount Everest 10 days ago. But the most
interesting part of the climb was that it actually took 2 attempts to reach the peak.
And I think there's a powerful story in that. On our ﬁrst try, a few days before, we
were only 1,000 feet from the top when about half of our oxygen regulators failed.
This is a really dangerous situation. It'd be like ﬂying in an airplane in cruising
altitude when suddenly the cabin depressurizes and the oxygen masks don't work.
So we quickly descended 7,000 feet to the safety of camp and prepared to head
home. But over breakfast the next morning, we started to think about our six months
of training, how hard we had worked, how close we came and whether there was anyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 37possible way to make another attempt. We talked through a strategy, cobbled
together the oxygen that we needed and convinced a few sherpa who were a little
superstitious after our ﬁrst attempt to make a run at it. Two days later, the Moosejaw
ﬂag was on top of the world with me.
In that experience, I saw something. And I've seen only one other place and with
only one other group of people: going big, taking risks, never giving up and
succeeding. That's what Walmart, that's what you, our associates, are all about now
more than ever. Please know that I appreciate you. Your board and your leaders
appreciate you. This incredible year that we've had that we'll discuss and celebrate
today is all thanks to you.
At Walmart, the core of our business is strong. We're on a growth trajectory that not
too long ago most people wouldn't have predicted. We're seeing that in the
traditional ways we measure our growth. For example, across our businesses, comp
store sales are at their highest levels in years. But we're also growing rapidly to meet
the changing needs of our customers, take grocery pickup in the U.S. In 2014, we
were still experimenting with this concept and covered only 2% of the population. By
the end of this year, we'll expand access to this innovative, money-saving, time-
saving and some joke life-saving service to as many -- as much as 70% of Americans.
Walmart is transforming and not by making some false choice between being a
store-only retailer or an e-commerce-only retailer because we see the world
diﬀerently. We see it through our customers' eyes. Walmart is a growth company with
the customer at the center of everything that we do.
One of the biggest reasons for our success is our culture of risk-taking. It's vibrant.
And it's back. Think about the last few years. We delivered the largest single-day
private sector pay raise in history to our associates. We followed that up with another
$700 million in raises and bonuses this January. We've made our biggest
commitment ever to e-commerce and have grown at a much faster rate in the U.S.
since walmart.com became Jet-powered. We're also being creative and ﬂexible on
how we reshape the markets that we're in such as with our jd.com investment in
China, combining our business in the U.K. with Sainsbury and our recent acquisition
of the leading e-commerce company in India, Flipkart.
Today, at our company, making bold changes is normal and it's expected. And we're
not going to let up. Being bold will keep us on a growth trajectory and leading the
race to build the retail model of the future. We've seen boldness work in our
company before. And often in ways that few predicted. One of the most important
and meaningful examples is our work to solve big social and environmental
challenges in our world. 13 years ago, Hurricane Katrina devastated the American
Gulf Coast. At the peak of the crisis, we sent nearly 2,500 truckloads of supplies and
made $18 million in donations. We made a diﬀerence that no other company could
make at a moment when it mattered most.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 37Our CEO at the time, Lee Scott, he asked a great question, "What would it take for
Walmart to be that company at our best every day?" Over time, we've turned those
words into massive meaningful value. Take our commitment to double the eﬃciency
of our trucking ﬂeet. We set that goal in 2005 and achieved it, as promised, in 2015.
Over that 10-year period, compared to when we started, we delivered 1 billion more
cases of merchandise, drove 450 million fewer miles and prevented emissions equal
to taking 138,000 cars oﬀ the road. And we saved our company nearly $1 billion
annually in the process.
I'm just as excited to talk about and think about what's ahead with our opportunity to
reduce food waste. It's hard to believe. But about 1/3 of the food produced in the
world is wasted. We've been working on this problem at Walmart. Over the last two
years, with just one pilot program on strawberries in the U.S., we've taken 1.5 days
out of the product supply chain, added 2 to three days of freshness and reduced
inventory in our distribution centers by 70%. Extraordinary. What if we could take
that approach across our entire fresh business? We don't have to think too hard to
imagine what's possible, because last year, Walmart U.S. cut its food waste by 100
million units.
Walmart's opportunity to make a diﬀerence is bigger than with any other company in
the world. But the only way we'll realize our full potential is by ﬁnding more partners
to work with in new ways. I say this especially to suppliers, where I believe we have
our biggest opportunity. Join us to do even more. No partner can help you make a
bigger diﬀerence on the toughest social and environmental issues facing the world
than Walmart.
There's no question that we're leading. Walmart is a growth company again. And
we're doing that while redeﬁning the role that businesses can and should play in our
world. I believe we'll look back on this moment as a time of true transformation for
our company. We went big, we took risks, we never gave up and we succeeded. This
is when we restarted our climb. And the world began to see that Walmart could win
and, I believe, will win the future of retail.
Now I'd like to take a moment to introduce your Board of Directors. This is a truly
outstanding group of individuals. They're diverse with their backgrounds, their
thinking and their contributions. I'd like to ask each board member to stand when I
call their name. And please hold your applause until the end. The Chair of our Audit
Committee, retired KPMG Chairman, Tim Flynn; Square Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Sarah
Friar; Morgan Stanley Vice Chairman, Carla Harris; former American Airlines
Chairman and CEO and our new lead independent director, Tom Horton; former
Yahoo! President and CEO and now the co-Founder of Lumi Labs, Marissa Mayer;
Walmart President and CEO, Doug McMillon; the Chair of our Compensation
Management and Development Committee, former PepsiCo Chairman and CEO,
Steve Reinemund; Founder of RZC Investments, Steuart Walton; and of course, my
predecessor as Chairman of the Board, Rob Walton. Thank you, all. Please be seated.
I'm also excited to introduce one new independent member of the board, Steve

world's great businesses. We're fortunate to have him on the Walmart board. Thank
you, Steve.
Stepping oﬀ the board and not standing for reelection are 2 directors who have
made signiﬁcant contributions to our company. First, Instagram Co-Founder and
CEO, Kevin Systrom. Kevin's brought an entrepreneur's perspective and technology
expertise to our board. Kevin's leaving us a little earlier than we'd like. But we've
enjoyed working with him and beneﬁted immensely from his time with us. Thank
you, Kevin.
I'd also like to recognize Dr. Jim Cash. Jim's rolling oﬀ our board after 12 years of
service, including, most recently, as our lead independent director. Dr. Cash always
seems to strike the perfect balance between being supportive yet very challenging
to our senior management team. If there was a Board of Director Hall of Fame, Jim,
you would be in it as one of the all-time greats. Thank you.
That's your Walmart Board of Directors. Thank you for your service. And thank you to
all of our shareholders for the opportunity to represent you. I'd also like to introduce
one of my heroes who is here today, our former CEO, David Glass.
Now I've just one more piece of business to take care of before we proceed. On
Wednesday, we held a formal meeting where we heard proposals and cast votes.
The preliminary voting results were included in a press release that's now available
on our corporate website. Let me share those with you in person now. All 11 director
nominees were elected. The nonbinding advisory resolution regarding our executive
compensation was approved. The proposal ratifying the appointment of Ernst &
Young as our independent accountants was approved. And each of the shareholder
proposals presented failed to receive a majority vote. The oﬃcial voting results will
be disclosed next week in a ﬁling with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Now let's get on with the meeting. Thank you.
Hi. I'm (Sarah Grunewald) from store 4164 in Kaufman, Texas. I'm thrilled to be here
and honored to introduce our next speaker. Please welcome a fellow Texan and our

Do you think we -- are there some other Texans out here? I wanted to -- you're brave.
There's -- meeting a Texan in Arkansas sometimes has ramiﬁcations. So you're brave
to do this. And I appreciate it. Did you know that Jamie Foxx, his hometown, is like 15
minutes from where you live?
I do.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Maybe you guys can go hang when you get back?
Maybe.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Let me talk to him backstage.
Yes. We should all get together and have lunch sometime.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I'd like that, a Texan thing. It's great to see you. You did a great job. Give it up for
Sarah.
Hi. Walmart. Sam's Club too. Anyone having fun? I wish you could see this view. It's
one of my favorite views. I love this day. It's unbelievable to see the colors and the
lights. Unbelievable. And is this a great time to be at Walmart? It's exciting.
So I'm the numbers guy. I'll try not to make this boring. But I'm going to start with a
number, all right? 3 minutes, 59 and 4/10 of a second? Anyone know what that
number is? Couple of people. So on May 6, 1954, a British medical student named
Roger Bannister did something most everyone thought was impossible. He ran a
mile in less than 4 minutes. So did anyone here ran a mile less than 4 minutes
before? Anyone hate running? Yes. I ﬁgured that would probably be a bigger crowd.
No one had ever been able to run a 4-minute mile. And many, including doctors,
thought it might be impossible. Most thought the only way it could be done was if all
of these conditions existed. You need to be a professionally trained runner. The
runner had to use really short bursts of energy at the right times. You have to haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 37perfect weather conditions. And you needed a crowd like this one to cheer on the
runner. Roger Bannister wasn't even go to run that morning. He had been working at
the hospital all day. And the weather wasn't great. I'm sure that will surprise
everybody from the U.K. that the weather was not great that day. But his coach
implored him to run as others were getting really close to breaking the record. So 30
minutes before the race, he decided to give it a go. That's a great decision because
we're not sitting here today talking about the second guy who broke the 4-minute
mile. But as he came to the ﬁnish line that day, he collapsed. But as he came to, he
heard the announcer say, "A new world record of 3," and no one else needed to
hear anything else. The impossible had been done.
So conventional wisdom was wrong that day. Was Roger Bannister a professionally
trained runner? No. He trained a lot less than others. But he had studied how to run
diﬀerently. Did he use short bursts of energy? No. He medically knew that a steady
pace was the key to being able to do this. Were there perfect weather conditions?
No. Again, surprisingly, it was windy and wet. Was there a large crowd like this one?
No, a really small crowd. So the conditions weren't perfect. And the only way to do it
wasn't quite correct. It rarely is.
Roger Bannister did things diﬀerently. And that's what we're doing at Walmart. Retail
is changing. And we're leading and taking a diﬀerent approach to serving our
customers. We are disrupting retail. We're serving customers in new ways. We're
bringing our stores, our clubs and e-commerce all together in ways that no one else
can. Our assets are unlike any in the world, which allows us to do things our way. And
we are delivering results.
Let's take a look at some of the numbers from our last ﬁscal year. Walmart U.S.,
highest comps in nine years. Unbelievable. I got to do it. Sam's Club. Sam's had over
3% sales growth. And you're leading the company in how we're adopting new
technology to serve our members. Anyone here from U.S. e-commerce? 44% growth
last year. And you guys are making great progress on a number of key initiatives for
us. Thank you. International? International, another unbelievable year. 10 out of 11 of
our markets had positive comps, another unbelievable year.
As a company with operating cash ﬂow of over $28 billion -- so by the way, that is
nearly $60 billion of cash that this business has generated over the last two years.
And in addition to everything we're doing inside this business, we're making sure we
take care of our shareholders. We've increased our dividend for the 45th
consecutive year. And we returned over $14 billion to our shareholders. We have one
of the highest credit ratings in the world. And our company is valued by the market
at nearly $250 billion. Amazing number. Your company, our company is one of the
strongest most successful companies in the world, period.
So recently, I was reading an article about Walmart. And it said things like times had
changed. The retail market has changed. Competition's ﬁerce. A company that's built
on great simplicity is now diversifying. Can they stay ahead of the change? That
sound familiar to you? And the article had a quote from the CEO saying, "We're
laying the pipes to be successful in the future. It's the tuition you pay to get theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 37Jamie Foxx
Brett M. Biggseducation you need to get where you want to be." And you might wonder why I just
said the CEO and I didn't mention Doug McMillon. That's because the quote was
from David Glass. And the article was from 1996. And as Greg mentioned, Mr. Glass
is with us today. Good to see you, Mr. Glass. And this article went on to say things
how's Walmart going to continue to grow? Its sales have doubled to nearly $100
billion. It's risky bet getting into groceries. But you see, Walmart's always been the
disruptor. And we still are. We've done things diﬀerently. We still do. Mr. Glass, I'd
say that was a pretty good idea to get into groceries. Thank you.
So you remember that $100 billion company that might not grow? Your company hit
$500 billion in revenue this year. And that was going to be awesome until Jamie
Foxx told you ﬁrst. Our ﬁnancial strength and our willingness to do things diﬀerently
is going to help us continue to grow, continue to win. And Mr. Sam taught us this
from the beginning. He said ﬁght conventional wisdom. Have the energy to develop
ideas that the world suggests or either not sophisticated enough or far too away
from the way everybody does it. We have all the assets in the world to win. We have
that energy to develop new ideas. And we're doing that. We're disrupting retail
again. We're making decisions to set this business up for the success for decades to
come. We focused on providing returns to shareholders. And we talked about that in
the short term. But winning business is also focused on the long term. We're doing
both.
Take our recent announcement to grow in India by acquiring Flipkart. We have some
of our Indian associates right here in the middle. India is a market with 1.3 billion
people and great growth potential. And Flipkart is an amazing company with great
leadership. And they're changing how people shop in India. We have some of our
Flipkart team with us today. Welcome to the team.
Disrupting and winning. It's in our DNA. We have it all. We have dedicated store and
club associates and so many of them in this room, we have great merchants, we have
the best truck drivers, we have tech engineers, we have data scientists, we have
global business services, we have best-in-class logistics and we have world-class
corporate functions. The main thing is, though, we have the culture, we have the
values, we have the purpose and we have you. No other company in this world has
all these assets that we have to win. No one. But now it's on us. It's up to us to ensure
that this wonderful company thrives now and into the future.
So would anyone would like to go with me and go win? Me, too. Thank you for all
you do for Walmart.

Thank you.
Good morning, Walmart. My name is Dana Hork. And I'm so proud to lead the Social
Media and Content Marketing team for Walmart here in the U.S. It is my pleasure to
introduce to you the President and CEO of Walmart E-commerce U.S., Marc Lore.

Thank you, Dana. Dana has done an amazing job with Walmart's social media

Hello, Walmart. Wow! There's nothing like Shareholders' Week, is there? Makes me
so proud to be a Walmart associate. Of course, I'm really proud of our e-commerce
team. 44% sales growth last year. And this year, we expect 40% again.
We're moving faster than ever before. And moving fast has never been more
important. It feels like life gets more and more hectic every day, especially for aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 12 of 37family. If your family is anything like mine, there's work, there's school, there's soccer
practice or, as most of our international colleagues call it, football practice. Today's
families are busy. They text each other. But the time they actually spend together
never seems to be enough.
Well that's where Walmart can help. This is that place where we can make every day
easier for busy families. One way is with our stores. We pretty much have a store near
everyone. You can get everything you need at a low price, milk, diapers, even a
prepared meal for that extra busy day. And our apps have made shopping easier
and faster. You can use our apps to do returns, to pay or see what aisle something's
in. You can even use the skin and go out to totally skip the checkout line. Right,
Sam's Club? Good to see you guys ﬁred up again this year.
But in addition to our stores, we also have to nail the fundamentals of e-commerce
because busy families love the convenience and selection of shopping online. We
just redesigned walmart.com. Now when you go to the site, you'll see a personalized
homepage showing what's trending where you live. You'll see the option of the
groceries from your local store like store 3278 in Lincoln, Nebraska. You can search
for pretty much anything else you need, whether that's premium brand clothing or a
hand-carved leather saddle. By the way, the horse is not included. The new site
represents a ton of hard work by hundreds of associates like (Ammu) from the
engineering team, (Christine) from the design team and (Uja) from the product team.
Great job.
When a busy family orders something online, they expect to get it fast in a way that
works for their lives. Sometimes, they want 2-day free shipping to their home with no
membership fee. But other times, they need their order even sooner. And because
of pickup and delivery options, Walmart has an unmatched advantage. At some
stores, you can get an online order out of a pickup tower. And others will load the
groceries right into the trunk so you can be on your way. You can even choose to
send something we don't sell in the store to a store. In many cases, we're able to
oﬀer a discount for doing that since we avoid last-mile delivery costs. Like if you
come in and pick up that 32-pound saddle you sell, we'll give you discount.
We're also oﬀering same-day delivery at more and more places. Same-day is the
height of convenience. And there's a huge opportunity in retail for whoever can do it
best. We think we're in the best position because of our 10,000-plus stores we
already have worldwide that are already full of the items families need. We'll be in
100 U.S. markets by the end of the year, covering 40% of the population. We're even
oﬀering 1-hour delivery in parts of China, Mexico and Chile.
Now as we do all of that, we're also focused on the future. And I want you to meet an
associate who's obsessed with how we'll win with customers tomorrow. She
cofounded a website called Rent The Runway. And last year, she joined Walmart.
She's part of what we call Store No. 8, where we're incubating businesses that will
shape the future of retail. Please welcome Jenny Fleiss.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01

Thank you. This is incredible. Hello, Walmart.

Isn't this incredible?
{BIO 17229673 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
We've been talking a lot about busy families. And I know that you can relate.
{BIO 17229673 <GO>}
Oh, my goodness. I have 3 young kids at home. It's deﬁnitely busy in my house.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
So what's the future look like for a busy family like yourself?
{BIO 17229673 <GO>}
Well it's about simplicity, the simplicity of just sending a text or speaking when you
need something and having it show up. So you might be driving in your car and you
just say diapers, dog food and garbage bags. And then later that day, like magic, you
have it. Or it might be canceling or tracking an order with a one-word text or even
just saying, "I need a birthday present for a 7-year-old girl," and instantly receiving a
speciﬁc recommendation.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Jenny leads a team that's been working on that vision. And just yesterday, they
unveiled a new service called Jetblack. Take a look.

we'll get for saddles there. But you never know. The cool thing is to think of how fast
things are moving in this direction all over the world. More and more families are
going to be shopping by just texting or speaking as the years go by. And what

positioned to oﬀer these experiences.

Something I love about Jenny is that she's always thinking about new ideas. Because
of the creativity and energy of associates like Jenny, we've been trying a lot of new
things lately. Our goal isn't to have a perfect track record. It's to make sure we're
moving fast, taking smart risks. We want to continually learn, adapt and push the
limits of what's possible. At the end of the day, everything we're doing adds up to
something really special. We're giving families a little bit more time to spend
together, whether that's going for a hike, reading a bedtime story or sharing some
laughs over dinner. In today's hectic world, those moments mean everything. And
the work we're doing, the work you are doing make those moments possible. Thank
you.

Gisel RuizGood morning. I'm (Arianna Valdez) from club 8167 in Franklin, Wisconsin. I'm proud
to be a Sam's Club associate. It is my pleasure to introduce President and CEO for
Sam's Club, John Furner.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Hello, Walmart. Hello, Walmart. And hello, Sam's Club. I'm really proud of our team.
Now earlier this year, I put out a challenge for us to become a 5% comp business.
And well, as you may have heard, last quarter, we were on a 5.2%. Congratulations.
And we've been working on simplifying our business and getting the business back
on the warehouse model. And that's why our comp was the highest since it's been in
over ﬁve years. So congratulations.
Now I just want to say it's really an honor to be speaking to you here today. I started
my career here 25 years ago at store #100 in Bentonville, Arkansas. Now remember,
on my ﬁrst day. And some of you will relate to this, my supervisor walked in and said,
"Okay, John, just go zone the Garden Center." Okay? I said repeat that, "Zone the
Garden Center?" "Yes, just zone the Garden Center." So I had absolutely no idea
what that meant. So I just acted busy. And then a few minutes later, someone came
up and they said, "Okay, just go grab a Garvey gun." Okay, I got this one. So I ran
back to sporting goods. And it turns out there are no Garvey guns in sporting goods.
But over time, I learned what both of those things meant. And as the years went by, I
learned more and more. And I actually never thought I'd have the opportunity to
stand on in this stage and talk to you. But opportunity, that's what makes this
company so great.
Now so many of us in this room, we have a story. And I want to talk about a few.
(Emma Tsu). Emma grew up in Tianjin, China. And she began her career in Walmart
China as a software engineer. And today, she's the Vice President of Technology and
Club Support here in Northwest Arkansas. And Daniel McGow. Daniel began
working in a temporary position at a supercenter in Las Vegas. He attended a
Walmart Academy. And he's been promoted to be an assistant manager. (Masihisi
Shirakawa). He served in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. And today, he's an
assistant manager at one of our Seiyu stores. Then (Stacy) and (Steven Binkley). They
met while working at one of our clubs in Texas while they're both in college. And
today, they are serving their community as a teacher and a police oﬃcer. So whether
you spent your entire professional career here at Walmart, like I have, or it's a second
career or it's just a place to get a start, this is a place that's full of opportunity.
Now another associate that I'm so proud to work with is Gisel Ruiz. Gisel grew up in
California. And she was the ﬁrst person in her family to graduate college. She joined
Walmart as an hourly management trainee in 1992. And today, she leads 100,000
people as the Chief Operations Oﬃcer at Sam's Club. Gisel. Good morning.

John FurnerWe do. And this is one of the reasons that I am so proud to work for this company, all
of you.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And I know you're also proud of some of the investments we've been making at
Sam's Club this year.
{BIO 15323604 <GO>}
Yes, I am. I am especially proud of what we're doing in the fresh department.
Grocery. You see grocery is such a priority across the Walmart enterprise. Our
members and customers are counting on us to provide quality items like fruit, meat,
baked goods. And it's an area, as we heard before, that we're very well positioned to
win.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And it's so important to us that we announce a new training program for our hourly
fresh associates at Sam's Club this year.
{BIO 15323604 <GO>}
That's right. So here's how it works: associates who complete training and receive
certiﬁcation will be eligible for a 40% to 60% increase in pay.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
So that means that an hourly associate who completes the full program could earn
over $50,000 a year. Now how does that sound?
Now of course, when we talk about investing in our associates, we've also got to talk
about technology because it has changed how we work.
{BIO 15323604 <GO>}
Yes. It has. All over the world. And you heard a little bit about it today, mobile tools
are making work easier for our associates. And that's meant less hours in the back
oﬃce and more hours out on the sales ﬂoor. John, I know, especially, you love the
way that we're communicating on new platforms like Workplace.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
I do. I really love Workplace because it's such a great way to see what's going on in
diﬀerent clubs. We can share new ideas, we share best practices and, importantly, we
can share really special events, like promotions or anniversaries.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01

That's exactly right. In fact if you look on the screen, you could see some of the posts
from our Sam's Club associates this week.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Of course, while technology does create new opportunities, it also brings new
challenges. And the reality is not all of today's jobs will exist in the future. And we
want to prepare our people by teaching them new skills and, in some cases, creating
new roles altogether.
{BIO 15323604 <GO>}
That's exactly right. So John and I want to tell you about Ellen Martinez. Ellen started
out as an hourly associate at Sam's Club. Now four years ago, she moved into
Walmart to manage a new grocery pickup location.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And today, Ellen, she's a regional e-commerce manager who oversees the rollout of
new pickup towers, pickup locations and same-day delivery all across the Northeast
United States.
{BIO 15323604 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And I just love Ellen's story, not only does it show how she's advanced within the
company. But it also shows how we're bringing associates along as the work
continues to change.
{BIO 15323604 <GO>}
That's exactly right. In fact, Ellen's last 3 roles didn't even exist a few years ago. Great
work, Ellen.
So no matter who you are or where you're from or where you might be in your
career, this is that place. This is where opportunity is here for you.

incredible associates from around the world. This year marks what would've been
Sam Walton's 100th birthday. What an incredible legacy he left for us. That includes
the responsibility we all feel as part of Walmart to make a diﬀerence in the world
around us.
Toward the end of his life, Sam thought a lot about this and what our family could do
through philanthropy. But also what the company could do as a successful business.
In his autobiography, Made in America, Sam wrote, "We aren't the least bit naÃ¯ve
about how big a stick Walmart swings in the world of retailing these days. We know
we can be very inﬂuential. And we want to ﬁnd more ways in which we can use our
inﬂuence to give back." That's Sam talking about scale and how we can use it for
good 25 years ago. It's amazing how much he got right and how far ahead he was in
his thinking.
Now it's my privilege to introduce some members of the Walton family who are here
today. First, my father-in-law, Rob Walton and his wife, Melani. Go ahead and stand

Good morning. Today, we recognize another incredible Walmart associate with the
Sam M. Walton Entrepreneur Award. During her career at Walmart, this associate has
built a track record of outstanding performance and reputation for developing and
mentoring future leaders. Last year, she was promoted to lead a business that has
since created signiﬁcant growth and income for Walmart in her home country.
What's most impressive is how she's done it. She created a brand-new store format
of digitally-connected working families. It includes pickup, self-ordering, self-
checkout, kiosks to shop online and numerous other innovations. Result has been an
increase in customer traﬃc, growing customer -- glowing customer reviews and $4
million sales increase for one store. Walmart Mexico has now committed to rolling
out 250 of these new prototypes across the country. What I ﬁnd most amazing is that
this leader is driving innovation and still looking for new ideas after more than 40
years of service to our country. This year's Sam M. Walton Entrepreneur Award
recipient is Mexico's Superama format leader, Lupita Morales. Please come up.

Walmart creates better products, services and experiences for our customers and

{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
You do a fantastic job for us.
Good morning. I'm going to spend some time this morning talking about innovation
at Walmart. And in particular, how we innovate for the customer. But let me start by
giving some context in terms of where the U.S. business is right now.
As you heard from Brett, for FY '18, our comp sales were the highest in nine years.
Fantastic. More customers are shopping with us. And you know we've had 14 straight
quarters of increases in traﬃc. And you, you have improved our customer experience
cores. Thank you. You're doing an amazing job with inventory. And these results tell
me that we're moving our business from ﬁxing to leading in this industry.
Now innovating for the customer is a leadership activity. And when I hear the word
innovation, the ﬁrst thing that comes to my mind is winning. Innovation creates
better items, services and experiences for our customers and our associates. And ifFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 23 of 37you are looking for great innovation, you don't need to look any further than
Walmart. This is that place for great innovation.
We're all merchants at heart. So we have to be innovative with items. It starts by
getting into the details. And we have really gotten into the details with bakery. Our
Marketside ring cakes are a great example. The team tried over 50 cakes from
competitors. And I hear they've been at the gym ever since. But what they found is
that we needed premium ingredients like cocoa, cinnamon and vanilla beans. Our
croissant program underwent a similar reinvention. The team went to France.
Coming out of that, they developed a new process, one that takes 15 hours from start
to ﬁnish. And the result is our product that is on par with the very best that you would
ﬁnd in a French bakery.
Beyond product, we've changed our packaging. Transparent. It sends a message to
the customer. We've got conﬁdence in our products. And the whole section has the
feel of a fresh market. Chalkboard inspired signs, shorter tables, the wicker basket.
And each of these underscores a promise of appealing, well-made items.
Now I want to introduce you to someone, (Victoria) from Store 3382, down the back,
Pueblo West, Colorado. Hi there, Victoria . Victoria runs the bakery. And you know
what? She is an innovator because Victoria saw customers coming into the bakery,
looking for cake designs that went on our list. But instead of telling customers,
"Sorry, we don't have that," she went ahead and created the designs herself. And
you can see some of what she's done. I'm told her unicorn cakes are a big hit. So
Victoria, your story, like everything that we've done in bakery, shows that we're
merchants. And it also shows this is that place for innovative items. Thanks, Victoria.
Another set of innovations are designed to provide customers with better, faster
services. Our Mobile Express services, for example, pharmacy, money, dotcom
returns, innovations designed for low friction and high speed. So take Mobile
Express Returns. Some things that can get sent to us can be tough to take back.
Really tough. So we've developed Mobile Express Returns. The process is pretty
simple. You simply open the Walmart app. Go to your purchase history. You select
the item that you want to return. And then you take that item to the store. You step
into the Mobile Express lane, scan the QR code, hand the associate your item. And
that's it. Refunds get credited to your payment account as soon as the next day. So
like I said, it's as easy to describe as it is to use, which is why this is that place for
innovative services.
Finally, we innovate to create better experiences for our associates and our
customers. How about our fast unloader? It's an innovation that fundamentally
changes the experience that an associate goes through when they unload a truck.
And it improves the customer's experience by reducing outs. You know what, I think
there's someone back here unloading a truck right now. So come on.

{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Amanda, Amanda, thank you. Thank you, International. Thank you. Thank you. In case
anybody didn't know, that was my team over here, Walmart International. They're
brilliant. Amanda's amazing. She's amazing for what she does for our company, for
what she does for our community and what she does for her family as well. So thank
you, Amanda, for the introduction.
I am incredibly proud to be here today, representing Walmart International. But I
would -- and I'd also say, Walmart U.S., I'm incredibly proud of you as well.
In our business, we've seen four years of improving sales growth. We've been
investing in price, in markets like Mexico, China, Canada. And it's driving traﬃc. And
as a segment, we continue to drive our proﬁts ahead of sales. So we are consistently
delivering results. And I just want to say a huge thank you to each one of you who's
here today who helped make that possible. Thank you.
Across our company, we're making bold changes to position our business for the
future. And that's certainly true for our business, where we've recently announced
big decisions in the U.K. and in India. Those were the right decisions, unique
solutions for those markets.
For Asda in the U.K., the proposed merger with Sainsbury's, another leading U.K.
supermarket, will ensure that Asda goes on to even greater success in the future and
beneﬁts both colleagues and our customers as well.
And in India, you've already heard a few folks talk about our India changes. But you
heard Brett mentioned Flipkart earlier. And I want to extend a very personal
welcome to the team from Flipkart to Walmart International as the newest members
of the Walmart family. Welcome. Flipkart is India's leading e-commerce retailer. And
their scale, their momentum and their culture make them a natural ﬁt for Walmart.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01

being here.
They joining our Walmart business, that's truly special. Because it's not just what we
deliver. But it's how we deliver it. At Walmart, we're committed to creating shared
value. And for me, that means doing business for the beneﬁt of everybody,
customers, associates, communities and shareholders. It's at the heart of what we do.
And it's how we earn trust every single day with everybody that we touch.
I want to share a few examples of how we bring this idea of shared value to life, one
of our associates. And one of our top communities.
For associates, it truly begins with opportunity and education. I have a very personal
passion for education. Both my parents were teachers. When I think about growing
up, I think about this photo. This is my dad. This is him at school, carrying his books.
That's how I remember him. And I remember how much he loved teaching and the
pride that he took in getting his students prepared for the future.
When I think about our company, it's the same. I think about great leaders, Sam
Walton, Don Soderquist, David Glass, their passion for teaching and learning. And
today, we're building on that legacy. And we're creating shared value in the process
of doing it.
In the U.S., we're graduating more than 30,000 associates every month through the
academy's training program. I stood in those graduations. And I can tell you
ﬁrsthand how much it means to our associates and to their families.
In Canada, the team there has placed a special focus on the training and
development of women through the Women in Retail program.
And in Massmart, South Africa, we're partnering with academic institutions to equip
our associates to be ready for the future, associates here like (Suan Jones), who's
with us today. (Suan) took the opportunity -- she took the opportunity after 12 years
with Massmart to reskill and retrain. She told us that the store management program
that she has been on has changed her from being a manager to being a leader. And
by the way, since she's been on the program, she's been promoted 3 times and is
now a proud Store Manager in Durban, South Africa. Well done, Suan .
Education and opportunity are available for everybody at Walmart. And we know
that when you feel valued, you create value. So this is the place where we can help
you grow and you help us grow in return. That's what shared value is actually all
about.
So we also create shared value in our communities by taking on some of the bigger
issues that really matter. Greg talked about food waste. The great thing about
Walmart is that our scale, we're uniquely positioned to be able to tackle theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 28 of 37Jamie Foxxproblem. It begins with buying great quality food and then sending just the right
amount to our stores and to our clubs. Around the world, we're using advanced
analytics and data to get better at knowing just how much needs to go to a store
and, more importantly, just when we need it on our shelves. Once we got it into the
store, well, then the simplest way to reduce food waste is by being great merchants.
We've got new training programs like leaders in fresh certiﬁcation in Mexico, our
academy's fresh schools in the U.S. Now great quality, fresh food at everyday low
prices is one of the things that our customers know us for and trust us for. But
increasingly, they care about where the foods come from, how it's sourced. And
that's why we're innovating in using technology there as well. in China, just last week
we introduced a new traceability initiative. Customers can simply scan a QR code on
their pack of vegetables and see exactly where they came from, where they were
grown and when they were processed. It's clever, isn't it?
So technology and training together are working to reduce waste, improve
transparency and create a much more eﬃcient business for us. But at the same time,
we've got the opportunity to ﬁnd safe, aﬀordable and healthier food for our
customers and for all of our communities. When we talk about communities, we're
also talking about our suppliers. They live and work alongside us. And they help us
bring to life shared value. Because we know that when their businesses are good,
then actually the communities succeed as well. And so I'd like you to meet
somebody. This is (Deepti) from Lucknow in India. She has, through her partnership
with us, been able to grow her business to accomplish some incredible things. Take
a look at the story.
(presentation)
Walmart India, thank you for what you're doing to create shared value. We
appreciate it. I can't think of a better way to actually illustrate what shared value
means than that video.
We all work for a company that really cares. It cares about our associates and our
communities and earning the trust of every single person in this business. We don't
choose between what's good for our communities and what's good for our business.
We choose every day to do what's right for both. So thank you to all of you for the
choices that you make. And thank you for truly making a diﬀerence. Thank you very
much. Thank you, (inaudible).

Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 31 of 37to every one for you, I want to say thank you for the feedback and the ideas that
you've shared with us this week. We're following up on them. And we're making
something happen.
This is honestly my favorite week of the year. And I know that Sam Walton loved it,
too. He brought such great energy and passion to these meetings. He loved us all
being together. We are truly blessed to have had him as our founder. He gave us our
purpose, he gave us our values and our culture and they very much continue to
guide us today.
And when he combined his beliefs and behaviors with this disruptive idea that he
could build a good business by providing quality merchandise at aﬀordable prices
to people in small towns, well, he had something special. And he planted that seed
of an idea right here in small-town America. And from that start, we grew. And as we
grew, we became deeply rooted by our purpose, our values and our culture. We
respect one another. We're here to serve our customers. We have high standards of
performance. And we do the right thing.
Acting with integrity is a core value. That's why we pay such close attention to and
invest so much in ethics and compliance. These core values, these roots give us
strength and stability, a strong foundation. Over time, our foundation enabled us to
grow bigger and stronger. We bore fruit, fruit for our customers, for our associates in
the form of opportunity, for the communities we serve and for our shareholders.
We bore a lot of fruit last year, didn't we? We grew revenues by more than $15 billion
to become $0.5 trillion business. First company in history to achieve that milestone.
But our goal was never and isn't to be big. Our goal is to be the best. And that's
measured by our customer satisfaction and our growth. Last year, our revenue was
higher than the -- our revenue growth was higher than the annual growth of Target,
eBay, Netﬂix, Snapchat, Spotify, Twitter and Tesla, combined. So we are a growth
company. We just happen to be a big one.
Just last year, you served 270 million customers a week. More customers are
shopping with us. And our customer scores are improving. As we strive to exceed
their expectations, we create a stronger company. Our operating cash ﬂow of $28
billion enabled us to return more than $14 million to shareholders. The fundamentals
of our business, thanks to all of you, are strong. And the resulting ﬁnancial strength
gives us ﬂexibility.
And we're delivering more than just ﬁnancial results. We believe the business can
maximize value by addressing societal needs. So we're using the strengths of our
business to do that and create share value for our communities. Our communities
are the soil where we live and grow. And we're giving back to keep it rich.
This past year, we were reminded of just how important our role can be. These
natural disasters hit places like Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico. You stepped
up. You gave your time and your heart to help those in your community.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01

Page 32 of 37I want you to meet Dennis Northam. Dennis, would you please stand? Dennis, when
Hurricane Harvey brought over 60 inches of rain to parts of Texas, Dennis braved
major ﬂooding and was among the ﬁrst to arrive at the convention center in Houston
with needed supplies. When many others were leaving, Dennis went in. And he
helped people whose lives had been turned upside down. Thank you, Dennis, for
your service.
Meet Jorge Arroyo. Jorge, please stand. He and his family lost everything in
Hurricane Maria. Their house and all their possessions were gone. With nothing but
the clothes on his back and the shoes on his feet, he went to work the next day
because he knew how much the community needed his store. A few days later, as
Jorge was searching through what was left of his home, he found something that
had remained unscathed, his Walmart vest. It's become a symbol of perseverance to
him as he serves others. And he's become a symbol to us of all of our associates in
Puerto Rico and their ability to overcome. Please help me congratulate and thank
him for his service. Good job.
The people we serve in communities not only trust us to be there for them when
disaster strikes, they also want to feel good about our social environmental impact
every day and trust that the products we sell are good for their kids and the planet.
In our own operations, as a result of new solar and wind projects, we will more than
double our renewable energy use in the United States. Once these new projects are
operational, 35% of our energy globally will be supplied by renewables.
And when it comes to products, did you know that every banana we sell at Walmart,
Sam's Club or Asda is now sourced from a sustainably certiﬁed farm? Last year, in the
U.S. alone, we sold over 1 billion pounds of bananas. That's billions of bananas. Last
year, we launched a commitment to work with suppliers to reduce 1 gigaton of
emissions from our supply chain by 2030. And in the ﬁrst year, our suppliers
reported reductions of more than 20 million metric tons. Thank you, to our suppliers
for helping us make this happen. We appreciate you. Please congratulate and thank
our supplies for their progress.
Our customers care about these issues. And they want to feel good about shopping
at Walmart and they expect us to do the right things. We welcome that. Let's talk
about what else they want. They want value for their money. They want great items.
And they want a shopping experience that's easy, fast, friendly and fun. Our
customers are the boss. Their expectations are going up. And we're transforming to
serve them even better tomorrow.
So what does our transformation look like? Well let's take a look at what we've done
over the last few years. We started out by strengthening our foundation. We
committed that our investments in our people, in our stores and in e-commerce
would lead to a stronger positioning for the company. You've embraced better tools,
better training, improved beneﬁts and wages. And we're seeing a better store
experience as a result.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 33 of 37We acquired Jet. Our e-commerce business is now stronger. And we've made
acquisitions to give our customers even more choice. We've been aggressive with
grocery pickup and delivery, leveraging our expertise from around the world.
Investing in JD.com has opened new doors for us in China. We're adding hundreds
of thousands of Walmart Pay users a month. And Scan & Go has enabled Sam's Club
members to save time by skipping the checkout altogether. And we continue to
expand pickup and delivery capabilities around the world.
Focus is a priority. That's why you see us divesting noncore assets like shopping
malls and banks and investing in new growth areas and technologies. We've
announced bold steps like our investment in India's Flipkart and the proposed
combination with Sainsbury's in the U.K. so that our Asda colleagues are positioned
to thrive.
Meaningful change is rarely easy. But it's essential to set us up for success in the
future. The common thread in this story is that we're positioning ourselves for
sustained growth while at the same time, ﬁnding new ways to serve customers today.
We know we ask our shareholders for patience sometimes so that we can set this
business up for long-term success. We're mindful of how important that balance is.
These results today matter.
Let me introduce you to someone who is delivering great results right now. This is
David Han. David, would you please stand? He leads our digital product team in
China, where we're moving very quickly. David is one of the people responsible for
one of my favorite recent stories about speed.
One of our customers who lives near our new supermarket in Shenzhen placed an
order on the JD Daoija app. And it was delivered from the store in just 9 minutes. 9
minutes from the click on the app to the knock on the door. David and the team are
also connecting digitally with our customers through Tencent's WeChat app. Take a
look.
(presentation)
Now that's easy and fast, isn't it? David, thank you. And thank your team for all you're
doing. Way to go.
We have a talented team of technologists in this company. And they, combined with
entrepreneurial business leaders, are working to get ahead to where customers are
going. We're experimenting with the use of virtual reality to create amazing
interactive shopping experiences. We see a future where we'll use autonomous
vehicles for grocery delivery. What's cool to me is that as we use technology to build
new solutions, you can see people's creativity come to life. It's clear that in the future
that is even more tech-empowered, it will be our human characteristics that set us
apart.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-01

Page 34 of 37You can certainly set that in merchandising. Let me tell you about 1 merchant that
blew me away while I was visiting Mexico City not long ago. I want to introduce you
to Blanca Malvido. And she runs the produce area. Blanca's down here. Would you
come here for a second? I want you to see her. So we return to our store. And we're
in the produce area that she leads and we're standing in front of a pumpkin display.
And I happen to ask her, "How many pumpkins do you think you're going to sell in
the season?" And she looked at me and said, "15."
And I thought, that's a little light. That doesn't seem very many to me. And she could
see the look on my face and so she corrected herself or restated what she meant.
She said, "No. 15 tons, 15 tons." And I thought, that sounds a little high. So we went
back and checked. And during the season, Blanca sold more than 15 tons of
pumpkins in her store. She's a merchant. Thank you. So much. (foreign language)
Sometimes you can sell more than a computer thinks you can sell. Blanca got behind
that item and drove it. Is it fun to be a merchant? It's like a never-ending study in
human behavior. And it's further evidence that we need to keep learning. And we
need to equip -- keep equipping our people for the future.
We want you to fulﬁll your potential. And as you grow, to help you fulﬁll your
potential, we must have strong leaders, creating inclusive environments in every
club, every store, every DC, every part of our business. Diverse teams help us
perform better. And they make us stronger. We want to be that place where you can
ﬁnd opportunity where everyone is included. And we'll keep learning to help us
prepare for the future of work. From apps on our mobile devices to automation in
the back room, we'll keep innovating to help you spend more time with customers
and members.
We'll continue to create new opportunities, new skills and new jobs, like personal
shoppers for grocery, customer host and academy facilitators. From our fresh
certiﬁcation program in Japan that we now have in Sam's Club in the U.S. to our
Women in Retail programs around the world, we are developing new knowledge
and new training.
We're becoming lifelong learners. That's why we're proud to announce this week
that we'll help U.S. associates earn a college degree at accredited universities. Those
of you who graduate from our academies can get college credit towards that
degree. We want to help you.
Let me share the story of a lifelong learner I met earlier this year. Meet Krystal Rivas.

teaches. She was proud to graduate for the ﬁrst time when she completed her
Academy training. Lourdes wrote down her thoughts about that day. We'll read
them.
I'd never experienced a graduation before. I've tried on my gown. And my emotions
were overwhelming. Walking to the stage and seeing my 4-year old son, hearing him
scream my name, having my family there to see was such a life-changing experience
I'll never forget and forever hold in my heart.
This is Lourdes. We're so proud of both of you. You represent a lot of people in this
company. Thank you.
Look at how these 2 partnered together. As the world becomes more digital and
technology continues to change our lives, it will be our associates, our people, the
humanity of Walmart that makes us special. That's what Sam Walton taught us. He
knew people were our edge. This is that place, where we care for one another, where
you can make a diﬀerence and help people live better. We know we believe that. We
heard him say it so many times. I have often wished that those of you that didn't get
the chance to hear him, to be around him in person, to experience him could have
that opportunity.
And the videos we show of him are great. But with today's technology, we're going
to take a shot at going to the next level this morning. As you get a chance to see him
and hear him, please listen carefully to what he says.

values and culture he instilled in us are worth ﬁghting for.
The world is a better place with Walmart in it. The next generation needs this
company. You save people money. So they can take care of their kids, invest in their
education, pay the rent, buy a home. And with people like Dennis and Jorge and
David and Blanca, Krystal and Lourdes and all of you, we can make a diﬀerence.
Sam's original seed of an idea has grown big and strong and tall with a deep root
