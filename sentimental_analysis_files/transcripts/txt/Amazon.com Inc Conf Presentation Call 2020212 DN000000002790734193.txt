Great. Thank you. We will go ahead and get started. My name is Heath Terry, I lead
TMT Research for Goldman Sachs. As a Goldman Sachs employee, it's been a special
point of pride over the last three years as ﬁrst Roy Joseph and then David Solomon
took center stage at the AWS re:Invent opening keynote in front of over 50,000
people. Having been in the audience for every re:Invent conference, it's now a
particular point of pride for me to introduce Andy Jassy, Chief Executive Oﬃcer of
Amazon Web Services. Andy joined Amazon in 1997, straight out of business school.
And in 2003, he led that team in founding AWS, creating the world's undisputed
leader in cloud computing. A company inside Amazon worth, according to our math,
well over $0.5 trillion. Andy is joined in conversation by Goldman Sachs' CEO, David
Solomon. Andy, David, welcome.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
Good afternoon, everyone. And Andy, thank you for being here. You've got it a lot
easier as we start this. When I was at re:Invent, you made me actually work before
you put me on stage.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
They have a DJ before my keynote, it was quite good, by the way. People are still
talking about your set.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
Well, I mean, at 07:45 in the morning, it is not easy to DJ for 10,000 people.

Andrew R. JassyYou had good energy.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
It was 07:45 (Multiple Speakers) try your best. So let's dive right into it. You've been
at Amazon for 22 years. And you founded AWS with little over 50 people in 2003.
You're going to generate over $45 billion of revenue in the business this year and
more than half of the company's proﬁts. And so when you put the ﬁnancials aside,
but you just start to think about the scale of what you've built, kind of quantify for us
a little bit the scale of AWS and how fast it continues to grow?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well, it's been kind of amazing adventure and the business now has a $40 billion
revenue run rate, growing 34% year-over-year and we have millions of active
customers, which we deﬁne as non-Amazon entity that use the platform in the last 30
days, but it's really a very broad and diverse group. It's -- in the early days of AWS, it
was mostly start-ups building their businesses from scratch on top of AWS and these
were companies like Slack and Instagram and Pinterest and Stripe and Robinhood
and companies like that.
But what's happened over the last half dozen years is that the enterprise in public
sector have very rapidly adopted AWS in the cloud and you see every imaginable
vertical business segment now using the cloud, if you're in ﬁnancial services, we
work with Goldman and Capital One and Intuit and the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia and healthcare at Johnson & Johnson and Merck and Pﬁzer and Bristol-
Myers Squibb and manufacturing GE and Shire Electric, and Philips. It seems every
imaginable vertical business segment now is using the cloud in a meaningful way.
And in the public sector, we have 6,500 government agencies worldwide, 11,000
academic institutions and 29,000 non-proﬁts. So very, very broad and fast growing
customer base.
And there are -- other than looking at revenue and the trillions of requests that we
get in the various services all the time, most of the -- it's a little hard to be able to
track everybody's relative market segment share just because we're the only ones
that really publish the full metrics. But we have a pretty signiﬁcant market segment
leadership share. And where we really kind of see the breadth is if you just look at
your everyday life, if you look at ride sharing and if you use Lyft or Uber, Ola in India
or Grab in Southeast Asia or MyTaxi in Europe, all running on AWS in the cloud. Or if
you use media services, Netﬂix runs completely on AWS. And obviously Amazon
Prime and Disney+, and you watch the Super Bowl and you watch the streaming on
Fox Live on top of AWS. And if you use Peloton or if you use -- my son is a very big
orderer of foods, so Postmates and Grubhub and DoorDash. There's just very
pervasive impact every day in your life and yet we always say, and we really strongly
believe it that it's still very early days in people moving to the cloud. And even
though the business is growing fast and is a reasonable size, I think it's going to be
very diﬀerent 10 years from now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Andrew R. Jassy{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
Yeah. So -- and one thing that's fascinating to me to see the big businesses is this
was a signiﬁcant innovation in a large organization. I mean, at the time, Amazon
much bigger now, but it was a large organization, it was a big innovation. What
advice, and I think about this actually, what advice would you give -- Goldman Sachs
is trying to innovate in its business, what advice would you give any larger company
around innovating, building new business lines inside a strong organization?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yeah. Well, there are a few things -- a few things that have been helpful for us that I
think -- it doesn't necessarily mean it'd be helpful for everybody, but I think they're
generally useful principles. The ﬁrst is you have to hire people who want to build. We
disproportionately index in hiring builders and we think of builders as people who
like to invent, people who look at diﬀerent customer experiences and are honest
about what's not working and try to reinvent those customer experiences. And
people who really understand that launch is the starting line and not the ﬁnish line.
There are so many great people in technology who love get to launch and lose
interest. And you really rarely catch lightning in a bottle, you have to keep listening
to customers and iterating. So you got to hire the right types of builders. And then I
think you got to organize them in teams that allow them to move quickly. I think one
of the most important things we did in AWS in the early days was the natural place to
build AWS would have been in our infrastructure team because we leveraged our
data centers and network. And instead, we pulled completely out of that group of
people that had to run the consumer business and that scale every day because the
new businesses will always lose out to the existing surer bets.
So making sure you organize into a separable and autonomous teams as you can,
where they own their own destiny and aren't burdened by having to run the core
business you're running every day. And then you got to give those teams the right
building blocks to be able to move really quickly. So I think one of the interesting
things about Amazon the last 10 years is just how unbelievably quickly our consumer
businesses have moved and they would tell you a big piece of that is being able to
use those AWS building blocks that all our external customers use. And then you
need a culture that encourages innovation. And that sounds fairly obvious like
everybody wants to encourage new things. But I think at a lot of big companies,
especially as you get bigger, the senior people walking into meetings where you're
hearing a new idea are looking for ways to say no. Not because they are ill willed, it's
just you get more conservative, it seems harder to imagine being successful on
something new, it's hard to think about having one more team and eﬀort that you
have to manage.
And I would say that the opposite is really true at Amazon. All the senior leaders will
tell you that their favorite meetings are the ones where we listen to new ideas, and
we don't say yes to everything, but we say yes to a lot more than most. And we
spend most of our energy in those meetings trying to problem solve with the teamFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Andrew R. Jassy
David M. Solomonto get to yes. And I think the last thing is, if you're going to invent, especially if you're
in a signiﬁcant existing business that's had some success, you have to be willing to
tolerate failure. And if you hire great people and achievement-oriented people, it's
sometimes a weird dichotomy. If I think about Amazon, there are a lot of type A
people who hate to fail. And yet, if you're pushing the envelope, you're not going to
get it right all the time.
And I always found our launch of the phone very culturally reaﬃrming. Those of you
who may not have known, we launched a phone and it didn't exactly work. And yet
because we like the inputs, the output was it didn't work. But the inputs were the
team we hired, the plan we built, the customer conversations we had, the technology
that was built, the timing. And because we liked all the inputs, even though it didn't
work, we took the learnings and the technology we could reuse and reapplied it and
then gave people a good landing spot. Because if you don't, all the great people will
fear working on the new things because they'll worry they won't have a spot if it
doesn't work out.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
That's a really good point. You talked about -- you said we were early. There's a lot
more adoption to go. First inning, second inning, I mean, how early are we?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
I would say that maybe, two outs, bottom of the ﬁrst, runners on board. Runs in on
both sides though. So I think that it's -- if you look at the total global IT spend, only
3% of it is in the cloud. But it's moving fast and it's growing fast. And so I think that
it's -- we have this very strong opinion, which we've really seen play out faster than
we imagined that in the fullness of time and I don't know if that's 10 years from now
or 15 years from now or 20 years now. But very few companies will own their own
data centers. And those that do will have much smaller footprints, only for workloads
that just aren't worth moving because they're going to leave a mainframe to die or
something that just has to be close to something like a factory latency wise. And all
of that is moving to the cloud. So it's very early days. And I think that people will
make moves. And when they make those moves, they will choose that time to
modernize a lot of the older software. Look, we have lots and lots of customers who
are moving away from mainframes and we have lots of customers who are moving
away from the older guard commercial grade databases to things like Aurora and
lots of folks that are moving quickly from modernizing from Windows to Linux. So
you see all those types of moves, but you also see this huge explosion of SaaS
providers who are building their products really organically right from the get-go on
top of the cloud. So it's a very diﬀerent world, still early days.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
So you talked about some things that are obviously changing as we move from
bottom of the ﬁrst with two men on and move towards the ninth. What else changes?
What -- how does it look when we get closer to the ninth inning, besides some of the
changes you just mentioned, what else do we see?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

David M. Solomon
Andrew R. Jassy{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yeah. I think for whatever it's worth, I'm not sure that we'll get in the ninth inning in
my lifetime working. I think this is -- we are in a period of unbelievably fast growth.
And if you think about what's changed in the 14 years since AWS launched and the
pace of change has been really rapid. I think the next 14 years is going to be even
more rapid. And so I think what it will look like is I think that you'll have most
companies won't have data centers. I think that you'll see more and more compute
that's done in a server-less model. I think a generation of developers will choose that
as their programming model, so they don't have to think about clusters or servers. I
think you'll see very diﬀerent play with regard to what people use for databases, not
just on the relational side where people are moving away from a lot of the more
expensive and proprietary and punitive old guard providers, but also increasingly
now companies don't use one relational database to satisfy all their database needs,
they use purpose-built databases, it's why you see people using things like key value
stores and in cash database and craft databases and time series databases.
So the databases will be diﬀerent, almost every application will have machine
learning and AI infused in it. There'll be billions, maybe trillions of devices that will
live everywhere in our oﬃces, in our homes, in factories and cars and planes and
ships and oil ﬁelds and agricultural ﬁelds and all those devices are going to be
collecting data and sending them to the cloud and doing analytics on them and then
sending smarter actions back to those devices, so they can be more productive. Lots
of tasks that humans do today kind of mundane tasks will be done by robotics
applications, so humans focus more on higher level value-added activities. I mean,
all kinds of ways, it will be diﬀerent and we're also optimistic in the future that
quantum computing will play a role as well.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
So let's shift and we'll talk about artiﬁcial intelligence a little bit. And I know that it's a
huge area of innovation that you're spending a lot of time on it. I think you have
10,000 people working on Alexa alone. Talk a little bit about kind of your vision for
the direction that AI will play going forward, not just in the context of something like
Alexa and in the context of what we've been talking about, but just more broadly,
let's talk a little bit about the impact of AI?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yeah. I think that we've been working with AI and machine learning for over 20 years
in Amazon. And you can kind of see it everywhere in our business, the
recommendations you see on our retail side are fueled by machine learning. And if
you look at the pick paths, the people in our fulﬁllment centers use to go get
product and box it is used by machine learning algorithms. If you look Prime Air, our
drones eﬀort, if you look at Amazon Go, those are computer vision algorithms that
drive it, if you look at Alexa obviously. So we've been doing it for a long time and it is
deeply embedded in all of our businesses and all of our capabilities and yet we still
have tons more ideas.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 6 of 14David M. SolomonNow, today, there just aren't that many machine learning and AI expert practitioners
out there and a lot of them that exist live at kind of the big technology companies.
And so we're trying to -- I think collectively more and more are getting educated, but
it's part of why in AWS a lot of the services and capabilities we're building there are
to enable more companies to take advantage of that promise. And there -- we see it
as kind of being three macro layers of the stack. That bottom layer is for expert
machine learning practitioners, of which there aren't that many in the world, but
these are people who are comfortable building their own models and picking the
algorithms and training the models and tuning the models and deploying them and
you have to keep running those models over and over again or they become stale.
And we provide lots of ways to use all the popular frameworks and we build chips to
make it faster, do training and to do inference and predictions, things like that. But
because there aren't that many expert machine learning practitioners, the most
important thing that we feel like we have done to make it much more accessible to
every enterprise is to build this middle layer of the stack, which we built a service
called SageMaker there, which enables every day developers and data scientists to
much more easily build, train, tune and deploy machine learning algorithms in
fractions of time before. I mean, if you look at Intuit now trains their fraud models in
less than a week when it used to take them six months. These are big diﬀerences in
what you can do.
And then the top layer of the stack are for people that don't want to have to build
the models at all themselves. They actually just want to plug into a model that we've
built and get answers back through application programming interface calls or API
calls. And so these are things like here is some text, turn it to speech, here is some
audio transcribe it to text. Take this text and translate it into lots of languages, take
this transcribed translated text and tell me what's in it, so I don't have to read it. Let
me do natural language processing, help me do internal search. If you have an
Internet and you try to search on your Internet, it's pretty lousy at most companies.
Can you use natural language understanding and natural language processing to
change that? Help us -- you'll give us your personalization algorithms, give us your
forecasting algorithms, all those are those services at the top layer that companies
are really hungry to just plug into models from companies that are doing at a scale
and have that data.
So I think most companies will operate at all three layers that stack. I would argue
that that middle layer maybe the single most important just because most
enterprises have so much data that they want to use predictive algorithms to get
value out of.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
So the transition we're talking requires signiﬁcant investment. And one of the things,
and I see it, it's obvious you got to build something new. We go build the Apple
Card, we build it in the cloud. But when you're looking at legacy and you're thinking
about upgrading and moving forward, there is a massive investment that's
necessary. How do you talk about that investment to boards, the big companies, the
founders of businesses to people running big business? How do you talk about theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Andrew R. Jassyinvestment and do it in a way that motivates people to make this investment quicker
to move it along faster?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
It's a really good question and it's really relevant right now just the stage of adoption
we're in in the enterprise and public sector, where I feel like we're at the early stages,
the meat of that enterprise and public sector adoption. And I think that almost
always the conversation starter in these discussions is cost. For most companies, if
you can turn capital expense that you lay out for servers and data centers into a
variable expense that you pay as you consume it, that's attractive. And then you get
to turn that variable expense into something lower that you can do on your own
because we have such large scale that we pass on in the form of lower price.
We've lowered our prices on about 75 diﬀerent occasions in the last eight years.
Largely in the competitive -- in the absence of competitive pressure just because the
DNA inside of Amazon is to relentlessly work to take cost out and give it back to
customers in the form of lower prices. So you turn CapEx to variable expense, it's a
lower variable expense to what you could do on your own and then you get real
elasticity instead of having to decide how much infrastructure to provision and either
provision too little and have an outage if you exceed it, which nobody does. So what
everyone does is provision for the peak, but there's a reason they call it the peak and
you sit on all those wasted capital on the cloud. You just provision what you need. If
it turns out you need more, you pay -- you scale up seamlessly. And then when you
don't need anymore, you give it back and stop paying for it.
So cost is very diﬀerent in the cloud than what existed before and that's compelling
to virtually every company. But the number one reason that enterprises and public
sector organizations are moving to the cloud is agility and speed and the ability to
innovate at a much more rapid clip. And unless you operate in a business segment
that has no competition, which is very few people, you have to move quickly and
people are inventing at a rapid rate, not just start-ups, but also your competitors who
are adopting the cloud. And so those are the two most compelling reasons that
boards and leadership teams want to move. And then I think there is -- if you think
about how to really just get oﬀ the dime and get going. A lot of the challenge it turns
out isn't technical. You spend a lot of time talking about the technical pieces, but it's
pretty trackable. A lot of the challenges frankly are leadership. And so the ﬁrst thing
that really has to happen is the senior leadership team has to decide that they really
want to move, they have to have that conviction because inertia is a really powerful
thing inside organizations. And there are often people in the middle of organizations
that aren't as excited about moving as some of the others because they may be
don't know what it means for their job or their scope or they were proud of what
they built. And so you have to have senior leadership teams that are truly convicted
about moving and that set an aggressive top down goal that force the organization
to move faster than otherwise would.
My favorite example of this maybe is GE was making this decision that they really
wanted to move to the cloud and their CIO at the time Jamie Miller decided that she
was going to move 30 -- 50 applications to AWS in 30 days. And she got ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 8 of 14David M. Solomon
Andrew R. Jassytechnology leaders together and said this is what we're doing. And she said for 45
minutes, they all told her how dopey that was and how it wouldn't work and why it
didn't make sense. And she said, I just listened to them and said I heard you, but we
are going to do it. So let's go. And they go to about 42 applications in 30 days. But
in the process, they learnt their compliance model, their governance model, their
security model and they had some successes and the ideas started rolling in, such
that she could set a second really aggressive goal top down, which was to move
about 7,000 applications to AWS in a few years. So you have to have the senior level
conviction and an aggressive top down goal to force the org to move and that you
mean business, where it's just really easy to dip your toe in the water for several
years and wake up and realize your competitors are doing it and you're far away
from it.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
Good point. Talk about the competitive landscape, talk about the competitive
landscape in cloud computing.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yeah. I think that every major technology company either has or is trying to build
some kind of replica of what AWS has built in the cloud computing infrastructure
space. And I've been working on AWS since the very start. So we've been in the
market for 14 years or so and I have been working on it for I guess 16.5 years or so.
And of the many big surprises, and there have been a lots of big surprises, probably
the single biggest one for me is just how long it took for other large technology
companies to build something that was -- that looked like what AWS was trying to
do. And it just -- we were just trying to get to launch without anybody knowing
because at the time, Amazon was really thought of just as a retailer. And we felt like if
we didn't get to market ﬁrst, it'll be harder for us to be successful and Seattle is a
pretty small city. We know a lot of people on the other side of the lake and we were
just trying to get the launch without anybody knowing. But we never imagined we'd
have a six to seven year head start. And so we have a very signiﬁcant market
segment leadership share at this point.
And I think there are a few reasons for it. I think the ﬁrst thing is we just have a lot
more functionality in part because we started earlier and in part because we're
innovating at a faster clip, and that really turns out to matter if you're trying to
migrate all your existing applications on premises to the cloud or if you want to
unleash your builders to build anything they can imagine. Having the right tool for
the right job saves you time and money. And then we have a much larger ecosystem
of partners, and it's not just the thousands of systems integrators that are helping
enterprises move to the cloud, it's most ISPs and SaaS providers will adapt their
software to work on A technology infrastructure platform, some will do two, very few
will do three. And they all start with AWS just because of our leadership position. So
you get to move to the cloud with a lot more of the software you used to using and
want to use.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Andrew R. JassyAnd then I think the maturity of the platforms are in pretty diﬀerent spots. And we
have an expression we use internally that there is no compression algorithm for
experience and that's because you can't learn certain lessons until you get to
diﬀerent elbows of the curve and scale. And with the business that's a couple of
times larger than the next few providers combined, you just learn those lessons of
scale at a much earlier stage, in a way that you can't always convince your builders to
worry about it. In the early days of the business, we used to have arguments about
whether releasing something at a -- whether there was going to be a one in a billion
chance that you would have an error, whether that was okay or not. And if you look
at our scale now, we're in the hundreds of trillions of dice rolls at this point. And
there's just no shortcut for getting there, you just have to get to that scale, it changes
how you think about architecture and infrastructure.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
Yeah. Amazon broadly has initiatives across a range of industries, a range of
businesses. At times, and I see this in our business, that has to create channel conﬂict
with what you're trying to do in some ways as competitors push and push around
working with you. How do you deal with those issues? Would -- does this work better
as an ecosystem inside of Amazon? Would it work better as an ecosystem outside of
Amazon?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
AWS?
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well, not surprisingly, we have a number of conversations about this topic. And what
I always share when I get a chance to speak with customers about it is that there are
really only two existing signiﬁcant industries in which Amazon is disrupted. One is
retail and the other is technology infrastructure. And in both cases, they were models
that were pretty antiquated and customers weren't so happy with those models and
somebody was going to end up reinventing them. And in those cases, it turned out
to be us. But I would also say that if you look at the other companies in those spaces,
it's actually a really great lesson for all of us as people come in and try new things in
our areas. The companies that listen to what customers cared about and watched
what they were reacting to and adjusted have done quite well in this new era. And
the ones that didn't, that poopooed that wished it away that dissed it, but didn't
spend resource on it are struggling.
And so I think if you have a great business with a great customer experience, simply
because somebody else enters that space doesn't mean you're going to have some
kind of business decline if you're listening to your customers and doing right by
them and adjusting and being inspired by whatever is new. And I think alsoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Page 10 of 14David M. Solomon
Andrew R. Jassysometimes people have this, there's this folklore or mythology around, if Amazon
launches a business in a certain area it means that all the other businesses in those
areas are not going to be successful. I just haven't seen it. I think we have some
things we're working on the healthcare space and I think lots of healthcare
companies are having a lot of success. I mentioned we launched something in the
phone space and it didn't seem to have much of an impact on the leaders in the
phone space. We have some things in the payment space and PayPal seems to be
doing quite well.
And so, it's because these segments are so large, they're not winner-take-all, there is
room for several companies to be successful. And again, if you're doing a good job
for customers and you keep evolving, you'll be ﬁne. And I think when you look at
what's -- it's so hard for all of us to build businesses to sustain for long periods of
time. I mean, look at how few companies have lasted. I mean, you guys are an
exception. But looking at how few companies have lasted 50 years, let alone 100
years as being successful, it's so hard. And to me, the number one thing that you can
do by far to give yourself a chance to be successful over the long term is to have
good feedback loops from customers, so you know what they care about and then
have the technology platform that allows your builders to keep evolving your
business and customer experience as quickly as you need to. And there just isn't a
platform that allows you to do that more easily by a long shot than AWS. So that's
usually what we talk about and we talk those things through, people usually ﬁnd
some reason to that.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
Yeah. So you've got an incredibly diverse set of customers on the platform, start-ups,
fortune 500 companies, thousands of other companies, but also government
agencies. And the relationship between technology companies and governments is
getting increasingly complicated, with lots of scrutiny. What do you -- and it's a
broad question, what do you think government's role should be in regulating
technology as technology continues to expand and inﬁltrate business broadly?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Yeah. It's a good question. And I think that we have to keep remembering that
technology has and will continue to completely change our lives and what our
customer experiences are and how we communicate with one another and really
almost everything we do. And the vast majority is great for people, but there are
ways that you can use technology that are irresponsible or that impact people's civil
liberties or they are against the law. And when people use technology in an
irresponsible or unlawful way, they have to be held accountable for it. And yet, I
would say that you shouldn't ban technology just because it could be used
irresponsibly. I mean, just think about -- look at all the evil things that have been
done with computers and servers over the years, look at the Sony hack a few years
ago. But imagine what our world would be like if we didn't allow people to use
computers or servers, it would be a radically diﬀerent world. And so, I think you don't

Andrew R. Jassyourselves included, have terms of service and we suspend people's right to use the
technology if they're using it unlawfully or in a way that impact people's civil liberties,
but there are a number of people who wanted to go further and they want more
clarity and they want more delineation and regimentation, where they want the
government to actually regulate the cases that the technology just cannot be used
for. And we're very supportive of that and eager to work with government agencies
that want to do it. But I think it's important when governments do that, that they are
really thoughtful and targeted about what they're trying to protect against and don't
over-regulate, where you can't get any of the value from the technology because
there's a lot of it there for people.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
It's complicated. I mean, it's hard to argue that we wouldn't beneﬁt in certain areas
from a better or clear framework. But in the history of regulation, generally when it's
responding to something, as you say, it goes too far and it squelches opportunities.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
I agree with you.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
And they've got to swing back in some way, shape or form. Information security, it's
got to be a big focus at AWS, big focus everywhere. How do you think about
information security at AWS and how are you building a culture around it?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well, the way you build a culture around anything is you have to pick the things that
are most important in your culture and then you have to have lots of mechanisms
that reinforce it. And so for us, security is unquestionably our number one priority
and we will drop everything we're doing if we feel like there is something we need
to do there to further buttress it. And I think everybody in our organization from the
senior most leaders to the -- to all of the entry-level people in the organization
understand that and we have a number of weekly and biweekly and monthly
mechanisms, where we're all involved and working on it and thinking about it and
ﬁguring out areas that our customers want us to do more.
And so it's -- for us, it's unquestionably our number one priority. And then we have a
number of mechanisms that we build to back that up. And then we -- there is a
number of things our customers want us to do, expect us to do and ask us to do that
we prioritize. So in the early days of AWS, there were a lot of certiﬁcation people
wanted, they want us to be ISO compliant and PCI compliant and HIPAA compliant
and FedRAMP complaint. So a lot of certiﬁcations that we pursued. And we have all
kinds of monitoring and protections of the infrastructure itself, but then we have very
ﬁne-grained identity access management for people to be able to secure who they
want to use what, at what times, in what locations, in what ways and multi-factor
authentication, web application ﬁrewalls and ways to know if there is any kind ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Andrew R. Jassyanomalous data movement or any unusual access to your account. I mean, all kinds
of services that we continue to build.
And I would say in the early days of AWS, the ﬁrst maybe six, seven years of the
business, the biggest blocker for us in the enterprise was security, not because there
was a problem with security in AWS, but people who have data that matters, it's also
their number one priority. And so they were nervous about it. And I would often say,
well, tell me what you're worried about with regard to security in the cloud. And
they'd say, well, I'm worried I'm going to lose control of my data. And I would say,
well, you know in AWS that you decide where the data goes, it doesn't move unless
you want to move it, it looks just like a blob to us. But if you're extra-worried about it,
you can encrypt it in motion or at rest. And they'd say, okay. And they'd say, well, I
can't go down and touch the iron. And I'd say, well, how often you go down and
touch the iron in your on-premises data centers. And if you go down to data centers,
it's not like you know what you're touching a lot of times.
And so I just think it took time to see customers use it and use it securely and
understand the features and capabilities. And I would say that in over the last ﬁve to
six years, security has been one of the single most important sellers in people using
the cloud. And I think most people come away looking deeply at our security,
believing that they'll have a more secure posture in AWS than they would on-
premises.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
As a company, you've made a big commitment to climate change. Data centers,
obviously, are meaningful consumers of energy and water. Balance the challenges
and the costs with this growth and thinking about a more sustainable future.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well, I think that -- I mean, the climate has always obviously been important, but I
think only increasingly so over the last few years as the crisis deepens. And I think
that it's a big reason why we made the climate pledge that we did several weeks ago
-- a few months ago. And for a company our size, and with our diversity of
businesses, it's not easy, I mean, to -- we said we'd be 80% renewable energy in
2024, 100% renewable energy in 2030 and net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead
of the Paris Agreement. If you look at what -- the scale of Amazon and the diversity of
businesses, it's a lot harder to do that than most other companies that you'll think
about. And it's going to require -- it will for sure be expensive. But I think the way we
think about it is that it will be much more expensive for the rest of the world if we
don't all get behind this and ﬁx this and it'll be a diﬀerent world for our kids and
grandkids if we don't.
It requires a lot of invention, much of which we're going to do the invention
ourselves, but a lot of which we'll also do with third-party partners. And one of the
reasons that we decided to be public about the climate pledge as early as we did
was we really wanted to incent and to hopefully inspire more companies to invent in
this space because we're going to need partners, all of us are going to needFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Andrew R. Jassypartners to make this happen. And so, it's a very important priority. In the data center
space, in the cloud computing space, I think sometimes people forget that cloud
computing is just signiﬁcantly inherently more energy eﬃcient than on-premises
data centers, in large part because our utilization is so much higher. So like if you
look at 451 Research just did this study where they found that running in AWS was
3.6 times more energy eﬃcient than running in the average on-premises data center.
Or if you look at on the carbon intensity side, the electricity consumed, the
renewables purchased to run the same task in AWS is 88% more carbon eﬃcient
than it would on-premises.
So the cloud is a much more environmentally friendly construct for data centers than
most companies who are utilized at 10% to 20%, but still there is a lot that we're
doing and we have to do to continue to be more energy eﬃcient. And we got all
kinds of invention we're doing around how to use water more thoughtfully and in
more scarce ways. And we have over 70 renewable projects that we've funded inside
of Amazon with 1,900 megawatts of power that we're generating. And so we have a
lot that we're doing and a lot more that we're doing and it's an area that we are
investing innovation resources in.
{BIO 1503614 <GO>}
That's great, that's great. So just to ﬁnish. One of the challenges that we all have in
our businesses, but at the scale you're operating at, you have it in spades is
attracting people, retaining people that help make this all possible. How are you
thinking about people management, talent at the scale you're operating at?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
That's a really good question. And, of course, the devil's in the details of all these
things. And we have -- I've been at Amazon almost 23 years at this point. I've
obviously drank the Kool-Aid, but it's kind of remarkable how many people we've
had at the company so long. I mean long for us, we've been around 25-ish years. But
I mean if I just look in AWS, the person who runs product development has been
there for almost 22 years, the person who runs infrastructure has been there for
almost 22 years, the person who runs our demand generation has been there for 14
years. We've had kind of almost a naturally strong retention of our people. And I
think a big piece of it and a lot of what we focus on when we think about how to
keep people hungry and motivated and excited about working at Amazon over a
long period of time is you have to be intentional about what your culture is going to
prioritize and who you want. And for us, as I mentioned earlier, we
disproportionately index in hiring builders. That's who we want at the company.
And so -- and we don't think of builders as just technologists. To me there, you have
people who are unbelievable operators who are inventive in operations and change
the way you think about being able to get something done for the cost structure or
the time frame it takes to get things done. We want builders in everything that we
do. And so, what we try to do in our culture and everything we talk about as a senior
leadership team is how do we build the type of company and the type of culture that
allow builders to build. And that is all the thing -- when we talk about process that weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

that out because we want to make it the world's best place for builders to build. And
I think that there really are a few places like Amazon if you're a builder and that's
what we spend most of our time trying to ﬁgure out.
