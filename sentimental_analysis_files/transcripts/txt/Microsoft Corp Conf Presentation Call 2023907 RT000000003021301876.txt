And I'm really looking forward to this conversation. We got Charles Lamanna from
Microsoft. I'll let Charles introduce him in -- himself in a minute, but Charles looks
over the Dynamics 365 business, which I think is kind of an underappreciated area of
the Microsoft growth story. There's a lot of things to be excited about. But Charles,
ﬁrst, thanks for making the trip out here, surviving the humidity and heat that we
have here in New York. But could you just start oﬀ, share your background. I know
you've been at Microsoft a couple of diﬀerent times, just your history at Microsoft
and then the roles and responsibilities that you have in your current role?
Absolutely. First, thanks for having me. Super excited for the conversation today. I've
been at Microsoft two times, so right out of university for a short stint. Then I did my
own company. I was founder of something called MetricsHub, which was acquired
by Microsoft a little over 10 years ago. That company was focused on public cloud
cost management and health monitoring, let's say in the very early days of IaaS and
PaaS. Worked in Azure for about ﬁve years, integrating that, working on some other
things. But I've been in business applications at Microsoft the last ﬁve and a half, six
years. So that's Dynamics 365, that's Power Platform, and kind of across that journey,
we've seen a pretty broad shift at what that business looks like for Microsoft and I
think an exciting way. And despite all of that, I'd say, I still think of myself as a
developer at heart. That's where I started my career, at least recovering developer.

(Question And Answer)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 2 of 15A - Charles LamannaRight. Recovering, yes. So Dynamics 365, it's obviously a broad encompassing
business, right? There's pockets that are CRM, even some ERP, HR. Could you talk a
little bit about the strategy for Dynamics 365? How it's evolved over time and how
you see it expanding into other application markets?
Absolutely. So I'd say kind of broadly break it into two parts, the answer to that. The
ﬁrst is, we look at Dynamics and business applications in general, and we get excited
because our customers are asking us to help them transform their business
processes. And to do that, you have to know what does it take to run a marketing
campaign? What does it take to run a sales process? What does revenue generation
look like in 2023? Or how do you manage your supply chain? Or how do I manage
my ﬁnancials? So very speciﬁc problems and workﬂows for each line of business in
every single department. And customers look to us, and historically, we have great
platforms to enable them to improve and solve those issues like Azure or you can
use Oﬃce, right? But business applications make it possible for us to have an oﬀ-the-
shelf, ready-made, fast time to value solution in all of those areas. So that's what
business applications have been about for a while.
And we've been able to ﬁnd a lot of success over the last ﬁve years, really by going
through three, I think, main changes in how we think about the strategy. The ﬁrst, we
had to complete our move to the cloud. We weren't really there meaningfully ﬁve or
six years ago, but now Dynamics -- with Dynamics 365, 100% SaaS, 100% hosted in
public cloud, we've been there for a while. And the Dynamics revenue was over $5
billion last ﬁscal year for us. And over 80% of that was in the cloud. That is a big shift
and that happened because of those investments and really modernizing in a
meaningful way. And like when we talk about things like generative AI, the agility
we're seeing in Dynamics born because of that cloud migration. So that's kind of one
big change.
Second thing is in business applications, historically, there's a big focus on big
monolithic investments. Like the full CRM or the full ERP or the full SCM, all the
diﬀerent acronyms out there. And that means there's high cost of adoption in the
enterprise. You frequently are looking for one system for the whole company. And if
you ever want to switch those things, it's a huge budgetary hit, way more in services
than in software. What we've done is we've taken Dynamics and we've decomposed
it into individual modules, which customers can easily adopt at a departmental or
workﬂow level. So you don't have to replace your whole CRM. You can just use this in
the contact center for one business. You don't have to move your entire supply chain
over to us. You can move, say, your parts or your warehouse management and that
type of thing.
So that modularization has allowed us to really break into very established markets
without having to have a huge services cost. I mean the last thing, which is from a
product perspective, the thing which has been the most exciting for us is we really
got comfortable with the idea of being part of Microsoft. And Microsoft is not a
business applications company, just like it's not a cloud infrastructure company. It's a
lot of diﬀerent capabilities under one roof. So we got very comfortable making
Dynamics 365 integrate with the broader Microsoft ecosystem. So if you use OﬃceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07

Page 3 of 15Q - Tyler Radke

Q - Tyler Radkelike Teams or Excel, the best way to connect your business applications to it is to use
Dynamics 365.
Similarly, if you want to go manage your data warehousing or your analytics or an AI
in Azure, Dynamics 365 is the best and easiest way to go do that. So that really kind
of integrated, single Microsoft platform is something our customers have been
hungry for and continue to be very hungry for. No data silos, kind of no walled
gardens, that type of thing. So really those three things, I'd say like those are the big
changes the last few years have really accelerated the business.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Okay. Okay. Yes, and you talked about some of those big changes. One of the
questions we get a lot from investors is just, if you look at the Dynamics 365 growth,
it's actually accelerated. Meanwhile, some of your competitors, certainly in the CRM
space have seen growth slow. So would you mainly attribute it to those internal
investments that you made in the platform or maybe talk about what your -- how
that's impacting your ability to compete and take share in kind of the respective
categories?
Yes, I mean so I'd say kind of that's laid the foundation for sure for the kind of the
growth that we've seen. And I mean, over the last year, there's been a lot of
generative AI momentum, too. And so I think that's also played a major part. But I
think by getting to the cloud and being in the public cloud, just the agility we can
have with updates and features and releases is super diﬀerentiated compared to a
lot of other business application vendors. And if we kind of go look at that
modularization, that's how we found a way to get out of the business of only talking
about replace your whole CRM, replace your whole ERP, but instead let's start with
this department, start with this function. And then we prove and we earn the right to
get more departments and more functions.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. Okay. And that's kind of consistent across CRM or marketing or whatever
kind of application you have.
Absolutely, yes. And I think probably the shape is a little bit diﬀerent. If it's, say, on
the CRM or ERP side, like for CRM, it's much more end-to-end ownership of a
process within a department or line of business. So all customer service, say, in a
consumer business for a bank. Whereas the ERP it's sometimes like we call it like a
multi-tier architecture where you have an ERP for your headquarters, but on the
edge for, say, running your warehouses or manufacturing plants, you may use
Dynamics to just do that and post back to HQ. So slightly diﬀerent shape, but same
idea.

Page 4 of 15A - Charles Lamanna
Q - Tyler Radke
A - Charles LamannaYes. So talking about generative AI. I think it's hard to have a conversation about
Microsoft without not bringing it up. But over the summer, we saw some pretty
interesting demos and announcements around CRM, Copilot. And I know we were
just talking before that we have a lot of events for the fall to look forward to, but how
do you kind of see the -- I guess, what should investors look forward to this fall in
terms of generative AI capability speciﬁc for Dynamics? And then how is the
feedback been from customers since the launch of it?
Yes. So I mean, the biggest thing is, I think we're past the point of -- I mean, we're still
going to do announcements, but we're past the point of just say announcements
and demos and press releases. There's an immense amount of generative AI product
in market, generally available in Dynamics. We shipped our ﬁrst GPT-3 powered
feature even before GPT-3.5 back in early 2021 to market. So we've been at this for a
while and we now have some incredible customer stories, some incredible adoption
examples. And I think a lot of our conversations around Dynamics will be showing
what people have done with the product. And like as one example, a blog post that
we published this morning talking about how we've adopted Copilot for our CRM in
Microsoft and the beneﬁts that we've seen.
So we have one of the world's most complex customer support organizations, tens
of thousands of people, hugely diverse products from Windows to Xbox to Azure.
And we use our Copilot and 100 days of rolling out, we were able to see a 12%
improvement in our department in all productivity. So basically how long does it take
you to work customer support case. That level of productivity beneﬁt in
measurement by economists, statistically signiﬁcant A-B testing type of thing. We
haven't really seen in this area for 30 years since the original digitization in the
personal computer. So -- and that's just kind of early innings. So that and what we're
seeing with other customers adopt, you'll see more and more customer stories
coming out as I think a lot what they'll look forward to. And then from a product
perspective, we're just early innings for generative AI. So there's a lot of exciting stuﬀ
coming.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. And I think the Dynamics business, it's obviously have a ton of diﬀerent
customers, but could you just talk about the demand trends you're seeing? I mean,
you're serving both SMBs with Dynamics, but I think increasingly enterprise, maybe
departmental with enterprises. But how would you kind of compare and contrast
what you're seeing on the demand front, just given the macro environment?
Yes, so I mean one thing we are seeing more of is price sensitivity. And we hear this
from customers that when they go evaluate a CRM or ERP, are they getting the value
they expect for the price they're paying? And if you go look at the market, there's
already very high per user prices, which are getting even higher in a lot of cases.
And also you have things like AI being additional charges on top of that. So
customers are being very discerning as they should be and make sure they're
getting the return they expect from the product. So many of our customerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07

Q - Tyler Radkeconversations start with what's it going to cost and what's the value I'm going to get
from a productivity perspective on the other end. And this is a pretty diﬀerent, say,
environment in the past, or maybe it was, of course, I need a CRM, so I'm going to
get a CRM, or of course, I need an ERP in the cloud, I'm going to get an ERP in the
cloud.
The good news that we've been very encouraged by and inﬂuenced by our
decisions is, we've done things like haven't increased the price of Dynamics 365 in
the cloud. We think it's a very high per-user price already, very reasonable, fair price.
And we've also gone ahead and included our Copilot capabilities for Dynamics in
the existing enterprise license, which is the main license our customers buy.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Like E3--
Exactly, yes. So like if you get Dynamics 365 Enterprise, which is the standard SKU,
that comes with a Sales Copilot or customer service Copilot or ﬁnance Copilot and
so on. And that combination is largely inﬂuenced by kind of these conversations with
customers. And that has allowed us to really nail that ROI. And I think in the entire
time I've been in business applications at Microsoft, I've never seen an environment
like right now where there's such an appetite for switching at a CRM or ERP level for
this reason. So it all goes back to the value I get per dollar I spend.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. That's interesting. And I guess from a sales perspective, I know you're more
on the product and roots are in development, but how are you -- how are kind of
sales incentives structured for the Microsoft go-to-market organization, which
obviously is one of the biggest on the planets? But is Dynamics or CRM getting more
quota retirement or are you incentivizing the Dynamics business in any way to really
drive that even more?
Yes. So I mean, like our mainline sales organization at Microsoft is strongly incentive
to drive business applications, which is Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. And so
it's a mainline investment for us. We also have specialized sales resources globally,
which are focused only on Dynamics 365 or the Power Platform. And I think the -- not
like maybe a huge change from past years, but it's a top-line priority across the sales
organization.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Yes. So if we take a step back and just think about the TAM for Microsoft applications.
I mean, you're touching a lot of diﬀerent front oﬃce, back oﬃce, mid oﬃce, we'll call
it, well over, probably in the hundreds of billions of dollars. How do you kind of think
about, A, the addressability of Microsoft portfolio to capture that TAM? And then
how does generative AI kind of accelerate that or even increase that TAM?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 15A - Charles Lamanna
Q - Tyler Radke
A - Charles LamannaSo when we look at business applications, we've historically thought the TAM
ballpark is $150 billion per year. That's a substantial TAM. And I mean, that spans a lot
of diﬀerent categories, that's CRM, ERP, new CDP, HCM, even increasingly the
blurring of like service management like ITSM and more. So that's kind of a very big
opportunity, but we also include low code in there and RPA. So we kind of view that
all as one business application because they all start by having oﬀerings, which help
our customers transform their business process, so $150 billion.
Within that, we kind of think both Dynamics 365 and Power Platform are key growth
engines for us. And like hopefully, we can talk a little bit more about Power Platform,
but we think that's an area which really has a lot of upside for us, particularly with
generative AI. And if you look at that $150 billion, we're encouraged by Microsoft's
opportunity inside of it because it's extremely fragmented, right? It's very diﬀerent
from a lot of other big software markets and categories that we participate in where
it's very fragmented across that $150 billion. And that really means kind of no one's
run away with it.
We're also very encouraged because it's a very high margin business too, which is
something that is always -- I mean, at that scale and high margin is great. But also we
think it's going through a pretty profound transformation on many diﬀerent fronts. I
mean, the ﬁrst one is you're seeing this big change where buyers are really focused
on ROI, which is diﬀerent. It's not just taken as a fact, you have to go upgrade your
CRM ERP every year. And also our customers are looking for a new value proposition
around productivity. And that's what generative AI is great for, productivity boost. So
kind of the market is changing a lot. So you got high fragmentation, high
opportunity, high margin, a lot of disruption. And we think that Microsoft is
exceptionally well positioned to lead that disruption for this existing market, largely
because it's about generative AI. It's about integrating with your broader IT estate,
that type of thing. So yes, so I think it's big, it's getting bigger. Generative AI will only
increase the technology spent further, but yes.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Great. Well, that's a great segue because I did want to move to the Power Platform,
which I know you're excited about. So maybe it'd be great to just kind of deﬁne like
all the diﬀerent products in Power Platform. I know Power is used in a lot of diﬀerent
Microsoft projects, but kind of how has that evolved? And then certainly with Fabric
announcement out of build and in May, how are you kind of thinking about the next
evolution considering that's kind of this new vision of integrating data analytics,
Power Platform?
Yes. So for folks that may aren't familiar with Power Platform, that's Power BI for self-
service analytics and reporting, Power Apps for web and mobile application
development, Power Automate for workﬂow and robotic process automation, Power
Pages for website development and Power Virtual Agent for chatbots, so
conversational agents. So a whole bunch of diﬀerent capabilities all united by theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Q - Tyler Radke
A - Charles Lamannafact that they're what we call low-code. And low-code basically means, historically,
it's drag and drop, a very visual authoring environment as opposed to having to
drop down and write code, like JavaScript or C-sharp or Java, what have you or
Python. And the beneﬁt of it being low-code is your developers and IT professionals
can be a lot more productive. We have some great studies out there where you can
be 6x or 7x more productive in the solutions you build using low-code than not.
And also, you can start to empower business users to also create solutions. So
someone in the ﬁnance department can use Power BI to analyze the last quarter
without having to go through IT. Or someone in the HR department can create a web
application, which people can use to do HR tasks without having to go turn around
and get IT to do it. Or you can go, say, supply chain and core operations can use
Power Automate to automate tasks. So this idea of full company creation and full
company development is really critical to make it so that our customers can basically
build the solutions they need. And what we've seen over the last decade is, there's
pretty much an insatiable desire to create digital solutions in every single enterprise
everywhere. And I don't think you'll ﬁnd a CIO ever that says, I have enough
resources and enough developers to build all the solutions I want.
Power Platform starts to make that more attainable. So that's kind of what Power
Platform is all about. And -- but we shared it's over 33 million monthly active users,
growing over 50% year-over-year, really just a massive user base, something that we
think is only going to grow further. And we shared in the past, like this is a business
measured in the billions of dollars as well in the cloud. And this Power Platform
concept, we only coined it in early 2019. So very young product for us. And as we go
look to kind of where this space goes to the future, we think this is a very large
market opportunity. And we think it increasingly will be how a lot of IT development
is done, a lot of digital transformation is done. But kind of all of that, though, of my
product portfolio, that's going to be most reimagined with generative AI, it probably
is Power Platform. That's really just because it starts to make it even more simple,
even more straightforward to create solutions.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Yes. So there's kind of three pillars, I guess, to Power Platform. You got Power BI, your
data and analytics. You got the low-code, no-code development tools, and then kind
of the automation or RPA, I guess. Where are you seeing, I guess, the most
momentum from customers? And then how do you kind of think Fabric, which
category kind of gets innovates the fastest with the Fabric announcement?
Yes. So yes, I think that's exactly right. Like probably the biggest three categories are
those three. And I think if you look at Power BI, Power Apps and Power Automate, we
think we have the market leader in all three of those areas by adoption and usage
and kind of lots of great studies out there reﬂecting that as well. So those are
probably the three big categories. If you look at Fabric, Fabric kind of reﬂects what
we hear from our customers. They ask us constantly, can you put more things in the
Power Platform. Take more of these historically dev-only, data science-only concepts
and make them more accessible through low-code. And for example, we exposeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 15Q - Tyler Radke
A - Charles LamannaGPT models through Power Platform now. We expose very complex, say, like
operations around analytics inside of Power Platform so far.
And then Fabric is kind of the next evolution of that. This idea of how do we take
Power BI, great for reporting and analytics, and how do we expand it to encompass
things like data warehousing, data storage, data movement? And how do we make it
easier for developers in IT to work with business users to create these solutions? So
like Fabric is kind of that natural progression. And I would say, you can probably
expect us to keep doing an expansion in Power Platform because that's where
customers come and push us to do. That I can't grow my dev team, I can't grow my
budget, but I want to grow my output. I can do it in Power Platform faster and easier.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Yes. One big driver of Oﬃce 365 broadly has been the frontline worker opportunity.
How do you kind of think about the addressability of the Power Platform? And
maybe you can hit on Dynamics, too, but just in the context of that frontline worker
opportunity, which Microsoft has had a lot of success there.
Yes. I mean, like one of the things that's been interesting is like frontline workers
historically are very underserved market when it comes to digital technology. And
that's because there's not a lot of apps built for them. And if you go look at IT app
dev budget, if you kind of go, do I do back oﬃce development or customer-facing
development or frontline worker development, this kind of always ends up playing
like third ﬁddle. So what we really focused on doing with Power Apps is making it
easy to create those mobile applications for frontline workers because they're really -
- they stand apart because they don't have a PC. They don't wheel around the
computer, if you say work in a retail location or manufacturing plant or inside, say,
like a hospital. So that mobile application development is very and it's very easy to
do on Power Apps.
And we have some amazing stories out there with companies like Walgreens Boots
in their retail location or some great examples like with IKEA for their retail location,
or even say in the manufacturing plant scenario with GSK. So like those are all
examples of frontline applications that historically were pen and paper or data entry,
or I just call someone, become a true standardized mobile application. And we've
kind of seen this renaissance of development focused on frontline workers using
Power Apps. And it's not just the things our customers build, it's also what we ship
out of the box. We have Dynamics 365 Field Service, which is very much focused on
frontline workers, and that can help you do work orders, and track tasks, and has
some mixed reality capabilities.
And what we've seen with Field Service is that together with the back oﬃce, say for
scheduling and management of the workforce, has been a really strong combination
for our customers. And kind of Power Apps plus Field Service, you can start to cover
a lot of those scenarios that are out there that just historically had no digital support
at all.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07

Q - Tyler Radke{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Yes. Certainly it seems like a big opportunity and kind of one that maybe Microsoft is
uniquely positioned to go after. We got about 18 minutes left. I know it's a packed
room. So if there's any questions, feel free to raise your hand, but I'm sure we could
keep going longer than 18 minutes here. One thing I did want to hit on, just given
your background, you've worked on the Azure business and you referenced cost
optimization kind of the original product you built. What's kind of your perspective? I
know that you're not focused on that day-to-day, but what's kind of your
perspective? You're out talking to a lot of customers just in terms of cloud
optimizations. Are we at the tail end of it? Anything that you're hearing, just given
that that's been a focus for you historically?
Yes. I mean like I myself am a large Azure customer, even internally, and like we
always go through constant optimization. I mean, the thing I would say is like,
optimization is probably something that will always exist in public cloud. I mean it's
always existed. I think the big question will be, will it swing more towards more
digital solutions and less on optimization over time? One thing I am seeing and
hearing consistently from customers is generative AI. And I know it's like everything
is generative AI, but it really is changing the conversation because in the past, it was
all about how do I go reduce my VMs, reduce my data warehouse, those types of
things. Now it's much more, how do I bring more workloads to be AI enabled and
how do I transform more functions and responsibilities in my company to be AI
enabled?
And the reason customers are doing that shift is just because the other side has such
a large productivity beneﬁt. I mean, 10% productivity boost. I mean that's something
you don't ever get really from a single technology implementation or single project.
So there are lots of opportunities like that across the board. And the same thing is
true for all the other software companies that build on Azure. They're then trying to
integrate generative AI into their applications. Like every Microsoft product deﬁnitely
has a Copilot today. All of our customers want to have a Copilot like experience as
well. So that's changed the conversation deﬁnitely. So that's kind of one key aspect.
And maybe just the kind of the only thought I would have is like, generally what's
great about the public cloud is the fact that you can do this optimization. It's not like
you buy your servers, you got to wait for them for three, four years to depreciate. You
can actually turn oﬀ servers and book the savings. That is the promise that we've
been making in the public cloud for 10 years. And now customers are beneﬁting
from it. I think when we come out of this, it will only help drive more workloads to the
cloud because people have seen the opportunity there where you can actually kind
of dial up and down as needed.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Yes. You hit on an interesting point just around the ROI and productivity gains,
obviously from Copilot, and certainly when we've talked to customers who are using
Copilot, we hear great feedback, but obviously no one wants to pay more. So in anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07

Page 10 of 15A - Charles Lamanna
Q - Tyler Radke
A - Charles Lamannaarea like knowledge workers where certainly as a user, you can appreciate the
productivity it gives. How are you seeing customers measure or justify that ROI? Is it
in terms of hours or happiness of the organization? Just talk to like the hard
measuring tools they're using to justify these investments in Copilot?
Yes. I would say deﬁnitely not in a climate where I think employee happiness is
maybe the main motivator. Like the -- and it's going to depend from department-by-
department. I think this is one of the great beneﬁts of having like these diﬀerent
business applications is we really understand what does productivity look like for a
seller. I mean that's revenue per head, right? How fast do you close deals and what's
the revenue generated per seller. What does productivity look like for customer
support? How many cases do you work per day and what's the cost per case?
Every -- if I go to basically any company, they know those two metrics and what we're
able to do is, say, rollout Copilot and measure the before and the after. And that's
something that we -- like I mentioned at Microsoft that we've done and we can very
clearly look and say, okay, the kind of the composition of the workforce can change
in terms of expertise because Copilot can really augment new hires and things like
that. And we can also really boost productivity by closing more cases per day. So
that's kind of one example. And then if you go to like ﬁnance or supply chains, how
many ﬁnance employees do you have per dollar of revenue that you generate. Or
for supply chain, what's the -- how much inventory do you keep, how long does it
take to fulﬁll an order, how often do you deliver in full on time? These are all business
metrics that I think if you were to go to any CFO, CRO, CIO, they just know them like
that. And Copilot moves the needle on those.
And I kind of -- maybe I've been a little bit pessimistic to say like, historically, it's very
hard to show the beneﬁt. With Copilot, it's not very hard. With customers that we
work with, we roll these things out, those metrics improve. And I think that when I
talk about that new buying environment of wanting more ROI and more productivity
beneﬁt, that's what you're going to see from customers. I'll only adopt the CRM if
you show me more RPA, more revenue per head, per seller. I'll only adopt this case
management tool if you show me more case resolved per day. So that's kind of the
shift very much across the board.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Okay. Okay. That's helpful color. So your CFO has talked about how AI will be one of
Microsoft's fastest growing or the fastest growing business to $10 billion. How do you
think about the contribution from Dynamics and the Power Platform to that $10
billion target?
Yes. So I think -- so the ﬁrst thing is like, as you could tell, we are very, very bullish on
what AI means to Microsoft. And I think if you go look, like what we hear from
customers, the appetite is just immense. And so if we look at business applications
speciﬁcally, I think it will have like a overweighted contribution to that compared to,
say, historical cloud revenue at Microsoft. What exactly that looks like, there's a lot ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07

A - Charles Lamannathings moving right now, so hard to say. But we're really seeing it happen because of
three things in business applications. The ﬁrst, like I mentioned earlier, we put our
Copilot for Dynamics 365 in our existing applications, not an additional fee. Beneﬁt
of that is we can sell more of our bread and butter. And like we have a lot of share to
gain and we have many years in a row where we've outgrown the market. And we
think this will really help us accelerate our core oﬀerings. So we will just win more
deals, sell more deals, be more competitive, and we're already seeing that. So kind
of just our core products will go faster.
Second, we do have some add-ons where it makes sense, which are AI oriented as
part of Dynamics 365 or Power Platform. So for example, in Power Apps, we have
something called AI Builder, which is how you can use AI models in your application.
And you get a certain amount of credits with it, but if you want to do a lot of AI, you
have to buy AI add-ons. And for that, we now support GPT, which draws down a lot
of that AI capacity. And we're seeing rapid adoption around AI Builder, for example,
inside of Power Apps. So we'll see add-ons and attachments where it makes sense.
And the third thing is we have entirely new AI-ﬁrst products. So Microsoft Sales
Copilot, it's been generally available for a while. That is a product which is not a
CRM. In fact, it works with any CRM, and it just makes your sellers more productive
wherever they work. Whether that's in Outlook, whether that's in Teams, whether
that's Windows, whether that's on the go, Sales Copilot makes them more
productive by having an AI assistant to help them to have better conversations,
prepare for meetings better, understand accounts better, those types of things.
In these new AI-ﬁrst applications, we think are a huge opportunity for us because
they're net new revenue lines and they're also entirely greenﬁeld markets. I go to a
company, they don't have a Sales Copilot today. Not like a CRM where you have to
kind of have that constant, how does it connect to Microsoft CRM, that type of thing.
So we think all three of those will drive a lot of revenue for biz apps in the near term.
Like in the next 12 months, it's primarily going to be our core bread and butter
products selling more and those add-ons. I go to three years, it's going to
increasingly be those AI ﬁrst products. And like GitHub Copilot is a great example of
that.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Right. Right. You hit on kind of some greenﬁeld opportunity maybe with Sales
Copilot. Could you just talk a little bit more about that and kind of how big that
opportunity could be?
Yes. Like so Microsoft Sales Copilot, we charge $40 per user per month if you
connect to a non-Dynamics 365 CRM. And it's included with our $95 per user per
month Dynamics 365 user license. And I think every single seller in a pretty short
period of time will have a Sales Copilot like that. So we think -- so kind of P times Q,
we think that's a big opportunity for us. And that's why like if you see a lot of the
announcements going all the way back to the modern work announcements for
Copilot back in March, Sales Copilot was a major feature in that announcement. So
we think there's huge opportunity around these Copilots, which work with anyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07

the most time, which in the case of a CRM is usually not in the CRM, right? It's
actually inside of Oﬃce.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Right. And ultimately the $40 could be a way to onboard the broader Dynamics
license for that organization.
Yes.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Okay, I guess as you -- I mean, you hit on an interesting point earlier on like, clearly,
budgets are tight. Microsoft I think has really beneﬁted from this environment in
terms of the consolidation potential, like you've seen that in security, you've seen
that certainly across Power BI and data and analytics. But you could argue maybe
you haven't seen that yet in the application side and in CRM or marketing or ERP. I
guess, what's kind of your conﬁdence level that maybe that's what could happen
over the next three to ﬁve years? And I guess, is AI the catalyst to maybe drive that
similar consolidation wave in the application layer like we've seen on the productivity
and Power Platform?
Yes, so like the -- I mean, at a high level, if we look at, say, those modules that I talked
about earlier, say, customer experience, service, ﬁnance and supply chain, we've
been able to do over $1 billion in each of those. And for many years running now,
we've been gaining market share relative to our competition across all of those. So I
think we have something, which is working in market and growing kind of in this
climate in a way which we're happy -- I think we're pretty happy with. As we go to the
future, we think there's real opportunity for a few reasons. The ﬁrst, we think that we
can hit a really great price point for Dynamics that other companies maybe struggle
to hit. And that's just in terms of how eﬃciently we run and how eﬃciently Microsoft
goes to market. So that's -- we think that is going to be a huge asset in business
applications because $95 per user sounds like a lot relative to, say, maybe something
like Oﬃce 365, but that's actually a very low list price compared to a classic CRM or
ERP.
So we do think price is something which is interesting. And the second is, the value
we include in that is we have all the standard cloud-based CRM and ERP bells and
whistles, but now we have a leadership, a pretty clear leadership position for
generative AI in business applications included in that great price. So if you kind of
look at those two things, a great set of prices, a great set of value, really leading the
way on that next generation of business applications. Those two things together, we
think will really help us go drive more standardization and more adoption with
Dynamics. And as we think about Copilot in general, one of the things that we've
talked about a lot is we think Copilot starts to blur the lines between productivity
applications and business applications.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07

A - Charles LamannaAnd you've probably seen that in some of our events where in the past you'd have a,
say, we talk about Outlook and Teams and Excel. And then in a diﬀerent event, we
talk about Dynamics and Power Platform. We now have events where we talk about
both of those things together. And the reason is because with a Copilot, if I'm, say, in
Excel and I want to analyze some ﬁnancial data, I don't want to have to go to my ERP
and export data and go to the web and search information. My Copilot can just bring
that data to me right in context for my analysis inside of Excel. If I'm writing an e-mail
to a customer, I don't want to go leave Outlook to my CRM to look up the accounts
and pricing. I want Copilot to bring that data right where I'm working. And this idea
of less application switching and more data intelligence brought to where I work,
which for most oﬃce and business workers is Oﬃce, is going to be a really big
beneﬁt for Microsoft more broadly. So I'd say, I think there's some price value
considerations, then there's also some product category merging and blurring that's
happening, too.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Got it. Yes. On the competitive side with on the CRM business, you highlighted your
price point and your nearest competitor that is having a big conference next week
also announced a price increase. I guess, have you seen any increased engagement
with customers that maybe have large customers that have renewals on the table for
Q3, Q4? Are you kind of seeing that an increased appetite for customers to re-
platform as a result of the price increases elsewhere and kind of your attractive price
point in the Copilot functionality?
Yes. I mean like the shorter is like, yes, I don't think we've had these level -- like I
mentioned earlier, these level of switching conversations in the entire ﬁve, six years
I've been in business applications, they've never been higher than they are right
now. And I would say like, every conversation that I'm having, say, CEO, CIO, CFO,
boils down to two things. What's the total cost over the next ﬁve years from Microsoft
versus other vendors? And it's a very favorable equation when you do that. I'd say
the CFO really likes that equation in the Dynamics favor. And the second thing is, the
last 20 years were deﬁned by Cloud CRM. The next 20 years will be deﬁned by AI
CRM. Who do I think is actually the leader in AI CRM? Right now, that's Microsoft. So
-- and that's what we have the most products in market, the most usage, the most
adoption. So those two things work really much in our favor to create a moment and
a reason to switch today.
And like just some of the stats to show kind of how much adoption there is. We
shared this last quarterly earnings. We have over 63,000 organizations already using
Copilot in production. That was 75% growth quarter-over-quarter. I mean that -- I
don't know what the other numbers are, but I'm quite conﬁdent that is near the top
of Copilot adoption or of any generative AI features out there. And the reason the
adoption is so large is it's been in market for years. We were early with GPT. We have
great partnership with OpenAI and others for foundation models. And we've
included it in our existing pricing in SKUs. There's no waitlist. There's no gate. You
don't have to pay to use Copilot Dynamics 365. You can use it today. So those three
things have really allowed us to expand that installed base.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-07

Q - Tyler RadkeAnd as you go to the future of AI CRM, we think it's -- that's the only thing we're
going to look at. Just like you don't really evaluate an on-premise CRM today. You
only get like no enterprises. I want to go get an on-premise CRM, the only thing
about cloud CRM. Going forward, people are only going to consider AI CRM. There
will be nothing else. And for that reason, that's why we put it in the existing licenses.
So anyway, so I think there's kind of a few diﬀerent trends happening, but yes,
deﬁnitely top of mind for our customers.
{BIO 20483599 <GO>}
Awesome. Well, maybe in the last two minutes, I did just want to get your
perspective on--
Yes. All right.
The high cost of running these LLMs is fairly widely known. And to some extent, it's
reﬂected in the pricing of Copilot in Oﬃce 365. Can you talk a little bit about the
roadmap going forward? I would assume that we're sort of looking at maximum
costs at the moment because there's only one hardware vendor that can provide the
hardware. Can you talk about Microsoft's anticipation of the future costs as these
LLMs go mainstream across Microsoft's platforms?
Yes, I mean just like the -- so the ﬁrst thing I would say is, it's going to depend heavily
on the business, so like the intensity of usage. So like, if I want to run an LLM for
every e-mail I get, that's very high usage compared to, say, running an LLM for every
sales call that I do. So there is going to be some diﬀerence based on the product,
how much GPU usage you use. The second thing is, one of the things that we've
learned because we've been at this for a while and like, say, in biz apps is like you
don't always need to use the biggest models for everything. So one of the things we
did about a year ago, we did a ﬁne-tuned version of GPT-3.5 for Power Platform so
that we can use basically natural language to create workﬂows and applications.
And that ﬁne-tuned model, we use something called LoRa, low rank adaptation, is
able to run on a GPU skew below the A100. So I think what we're going to see is,
you'll see a proliferation of more models, which work with more diverse set of GPU
SKUs to kind of get that cost equation right. And right now for Biz Apps, very
speciﬁcally where I kind of live and breathe, I would say we think that the work we've
been doing the last couple of years actually puts us in a very unique position to oﬀer
a lot of LLMs at a very low cost because of the ﬁne tuning, because of our unique
open AI partnership, because of the work we've done in the application. So -- yes, so
I think I would just say, things will get faster, things will get cheaper, things will get
more eﬃcient. That's deﬁnitely been the trend the last year and a half.

Q - Tyler Radke
A - Charles LamannaYes. Maybe in the last minute, just talk to the audience about the key events or
product releases expect in the second half of the year, because I know there's a lot,
and then what your three biggest priorities are heading into next year?
Yes, I think we got a couple big events. I think basically every month through the end
of the year as a company, so I'd say, you'll be -- there'll be no shortage of
announcements and capabilities. And if you were to say kind of like the three big
things that we're focused on, Copilot, Copilot, Copilot is probably the half of the
truth. Like I'd say the majority, if not the super majority of all feature work at my team
is in some form Copilot related. And just because even problems, which you
wouldn't think are Copilot enabled, if you kind of look at it still be diﬀerent, are very
transformed and improved if you take that Copilot lens. So yes, so gen AI is indeed
at the heart of what we're doing.
