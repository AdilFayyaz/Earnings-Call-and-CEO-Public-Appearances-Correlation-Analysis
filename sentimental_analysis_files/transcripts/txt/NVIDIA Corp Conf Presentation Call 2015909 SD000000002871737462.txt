Presentation
For those of you who haven't met me, I'm Sean Vocke [ph], one of the
semiconductor analysts here at Citi. And next up, it's my great pleasure to announce
NVIDIA. Here with NVIDIA is their CFO, Miss Colette Kress. And I think, Colette,
you've been here about two years now, in NVIDIA. So I guess, happy second year
anniversary with NVIDIA.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's coming up at the end of the month, yes.
And I guess, for those of you who haven't followed NVIDIA for a long time, it's a
drastically diﬀerent Company than the NVIDIA of yesterday, right? So historically
when we thought NVIDIA, you think of a company that sells GPUs to the Dells and
HPs of the world. Whereas now, they're getting into automotive, they're into the data
center, they're into enterprise, cloud, HPC.
So with us here today is Colette. She's going to kind of walk us through that
transformation from a -- I guess, a PC component company, into an overall solutions
company. And maybe you can start by talking about what your progress is like on
that trajectory. And what stage you're in, and where you see that going.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So thank you for having me. NVIDIA has deﬁnitely worked on transforming
away from that single PC platform. And our concentration has really been on key four
market platforms in order to take that same GPU technology. But do a platform eﬀect
across those four markets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 16Those four markets are gaming, enterprise, high-performance computing and cloud.
And automotive. Following just our Second Quarter results, our gaming and our
gaming PC revenue couldn't be stronger, growing more than 50% year on year, as
the market for PC gaming is quite vibrant out there, with the excitement of new
games, the overall NVIDIA Maxwell architecture, as well as the excitement coming
around the corner for 4K monitors, DX12. And a lot of the virtual reality excitement
that's out there.
Our second market for the enterprise and virtualization again takes that same overall
technology. And leverages that for the enterprise where, again, graphics -- in design
and building, rendering is very, very key.
We've also created the technology for virtualization using GRID, which puts your
actual GPU in the data center, allowing concurrency of that GPU in a streaming
environment for applications.
Our third market, high-performance computing and cloud, focused on the data
center; focus on parallel computing; and focusing clearly on accelerating the data
center for the future. And that would be our Tesla brand -- the same architecture. But
really using a diﬀerent component, versus the visual computing; but using the
overall computing capabilities for that overall platform.
Then our last market, the exciting mobile automotive market. And we are currently
providing infotainment systems to many of the cars that you see on the road. There's
8 million diﬀerent cars right now with NVIDIA's technology on that center
dashboard, or the center console. And the visual computing.
But we are also building work in terms of ADAS for the future and assisted driving for
the future with an overall DRIVE platform that pulls together both that computing
capabilities of the GPU, with that visual computing, together for future self-driving
cars.
And so, those are our four diﬀerent markets. We've been working on this
transformation for several years, both on the investment. But the overall uniﬁcation of
the investment proﬁle on this same type of architecture. But for four diﬀerent
markets.
The key for our market approach, is approaching it with a software -- a solutions
approach. And really surrounding the overall ecosystems of each one of those
markets that we approach, to develop the hold on the market that we have in so
many of these key parts.
As we move forward, we'll continue to concentrate on these four key markets. But
what we've even saw in the ﬁrst 2 quarters of the ﬁscal year -- our overall revenue
growth for the Company for those ﬁrst 2 quarters is about 4% to 5%.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 16A - Sean Vocke

A - Sean VockeBut if you actually just pull out those growth platforms and our focus, that growth
rate is nearly 25%. So our concentration on these markets is working, as we've really
decoupled ourselves from what you saw of the underlying PC market, which hasn't
been a growth market for several quarters. And really concentrating on building up
these businesses as we go forward.
Questions And Answers
All right. Thanks for that very good introduction there. I guess, why don't we start
with the largest opportunity for you guys, which is gaming. Can you maybe just help
us understand how big the gaming business is for you guys today. And what are
your expectations there, as far as long-term growth?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. The gaming business for us is about half of our overall business -- more than $2
billion, concentrated on PC gaming. We have also a very strong attraction of gamers
all across the world. It is not concentrated in actually any one geography.
We have a very strong representation in the US, in the European market, as well as in
the Asia Paciﬁc and even China. Our overall China business represents a good
percentage of the overall gaming market as well. And has been a strong hold for PC
gaming for some time.
When we think about the future and when people think about sizing overall PC
gaming, it's kind of interesting because there's no perfect understanding on how big
this can be. Because that underlying platform is nothing more than the GPU that we
provide. But we provide it with a set of tools, a set of drivers, a set of software, that
connects directly with the overall software that's coming onto the market, the actual
games that hit the market, to where people keep coming back and buying those
overall GPUs.
When we look -- there's outside resources that have looked at this, all the way
through 2018 as a growth market. Probably -- and can be thought of as near double-
digit type of growth.
How fast will we grow over that period of time? Our continued innovation, our
continued work with the developers in the gaming market, would probably be key
for that. But we're very excited for the growth.
Okay. Thanks. And when you look at the gaming business, what do you see are the
biggest drivers for that business? Is it macro? Is it new game launches, like the Call of
Dutys -- the Metal Gears? And is it -- new hardware out there, right? Like, a Skylake
refresh, for example.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

Well there is no confusion that games actually drive the gaming market. The games
have continued to advance themselves over the last several generations -- high-
caliber, high-production-value games continue to come out.
Even in this last quarter, probably two key games drove a signiﬁcant amount of the
gaming time that was leveraged on these overall gaming platforms. We see this
gaming volume continue, probably getting ready for the holiday season. So that's
very important. But not to underestimate the power of the underlying platform and
the hardware.
That hardware is put together with key features through Gameworks that we've
worked with those software developers to enable. Hard things such as water; ﬁre;
hair movement -- these types of things. And features which allow games to look
realistic, as though the game is real, is very important for the underlying gamer. So
our work with that. And the innovation, is very key in producing those.
So time and time, our gamer population comes back because they know that our
innovation is going to be just right on for this -- those upcoming games and the
things that are being developed in the market.
Sure. And do you have a sense for how large the gamer market is today. And what
percentage of that is PC versus non-PC gaming?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Gaming on a PC is probably the largest overall platform in the gaming market.
Gaming occurs on every single diﬀerent platform, though. And everybody could in
some form be using overall gaming. So it stems from a PC. It stems from a console.
Tablets; phones; a lot of mobility in terms of a need [ph].
But those high-caliber, strong gaming platforms found in PC, is one of the popular.
And you'll even ﬁnd people doing gaming on PC platforms as well as consoles. But
the PC has continued to be the higher echelon of overall gaming performance.
Right. Then when we look at the PC gaming base, it largely concentrated in the US?
Is it Asia? Is it Europe? Maybe talk a little bit about --
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. The great thing is, it's all over the world. In the US, we have the love of working
on multiple diﬀerent platforms. So you have PC gamers and console gamers, a lot.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 16A - Sean Vocke
A - Colette Kress
A - Sean Vocke
A - Colette KressIn our Asia-Paciﬁc and China, China is very in love with the overall PC platform for
their gaming experience. And the Europeans have -- also have a very strong hold on
a lot of the higher-end PC gaming as well.
So what we've seen so far in the last several quarters, is strength across all of those
diﬀerent markets, each growing quite nicely around the world.
Okay. Thanks. And when you look at your graphics business, how much of your
success there do you attribute to, I guess, your own solutions versus share gains
against your competition?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It is true that we are in a duopoly for a discrete GPU. Our gamers have been a set of
gamers that continue and consistently come back to the overall gaming population.
So on a discrete GPU, a percentage of that market -- we're now looking at a market
share of close to 80% or more. That is driven by our platform, our platform for
gaming. And our platform for even a regular PC general OEM.
But the overall gamers have been with us for a long time. There have been some
small gains from AMD. But that is not the lion's share of what is driving our overall
growth. The overall value of what we deliver in our platform. And continuing to
maintain strong ASPs over that period of time. And getting gamers to continue to
upgrade to a higher-performer GPU, has been some of the main drivers of our
overall gaming revenue.
Our overall gamers across the world continue to expand. Gaming takes place if there
is strong broadband capabilities. There are still many parts in the world where
broadband is still coming to life. So you see gamers wanting to master what is also
available in some other sister countries.
So we get an expansion of people entering into PC gaming. We get our gamers to
continue to upgrade to higher versions. And really maintaining that value in the
ASPs, has been driving the majority of our overall revenue growth.
Sure. And can you remind us what your ASPs have done over the last year or two?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Our ASPs, remarkably, have grown over that period of time. So our average ASPs for
our gaming GPUs continues to go upward. We'll still concentrate on that to be our
focus. Our focus of -- not on price. But our focus on delivering value in terms of the
platform and what we can do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

A - Sean VockeThen obviously there's been a lot of press and a lot of coverage around virtual
reality. Maybe talk about what you guys are doing in virtual reality, what are your
eﬀorts. And maybe how that helps or doesn't help your own GPU business.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So the excitement about virtual reality, of that next-gen, where does PC gaming
go next for a complete immersion into that gaming experience -- so, a lot of key
vendors coming out in the holiday season or post the holiday season in the
beginning of 2016, with headsets that can take advantage of this virtual reality world.
But they key part of that is not the headsets. But what they need in the infrastructure
to inﬂuence that overall experience. Many of those vendors have come out with
recommendations of what type of GPU you -- will be necessary to take advantage of
that virtual reality experience. They are looking to promote our three top GPUs to
take advantage of virtual reality. It promotes a better experience in that virtual reality
experience. And we're just very pleased that our actual GPUs are being called out as
a key infrastructure component.
Then how do you see the virtual reality market, I guess, playing out over the next
year or two. Obviously it's still very nascent right now. And do you guys seeing that
being a more -- a bigger percentage of your revenue as we look out into next year
and maybe 2017?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I do believe this is the next wave of the gaming market. How fast it grows; how big it
will get -- I think we're going to still have to see some of these vendors really come
to market. And the acceptance of that being the right use and form that they've
pulled together.
So it will continue to advance. And we'll -- I'm sure we'll see generations forward that
will [ph] advance us. So I think it's just a little bit early to say how big that overall size
it is. But I can deﬁnitely attest that it will be a good portion of our high-end gaming.
Okay. Thanks. And I guess, with that, I'll switch a little bit and maybe ask the million-
dollar question -- I guess the reason some of these folks are in the room today.
Maybe get your thoughts on the PC OEM business.
I mean, for you guys it's obviously not what it used to be -- a little bit soft in the
Second Quarter and then -- I just want to get your thoughts on how you see the rest
of the year playing out. We've heard mixed commentary here at the conference so
far. So interested in seeing your take on the PC OEM business today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

Page 7 of 16A - Colette Kress
A - Sean Vocke
A - Colette Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. The PC OEM business -- what we refer to that is just a general-purpose GPU.
And a general-purpose PC and/or notebook. That's where we are generally selling
as a component inside of the PC or in the notebook. Just as little as two years ago,
towards the end of ﬁscal year 2013, this business probably represented in the mid
20% of our overall Company, overall size revenue. So it was a material percentage of
that.
Just ﬁnishing this last quarter, our PC OEM general-purpose business is now almost
at single digits, as a percentage of our revenue. It's just -- and we've continued --
been able to grow the top line as we've concentrated on the markets. It's something
that we're going to focus on. It is going to be something that we are going to
continue to provide GPUs for -- build and design them in.
But we do understand it's going to go through its waves of pockets of stabilization
and what we saw deﬁnitely at the end of Q2, not-so-strong growth, or an actual
decline year over year. But having been able to move to a platform approach has
allowed us to just de-emphasize that piece as our business.
Okay. Thanks. And I guess I want to switch gears a little bit and focus on enterprise.
Another segment for you guys. Obviously it's become bigger and bigger as a
percentage of overall revenue. I think if you look at -- enterprise is a little bit soft in
the ﬁrst half.
Maybe talk a little bit about, why was it a little bit soft in the ﬁrst half? Whether it's
Quadro; whether it's Tesla. And maybe, what are your expectations as we move to
the -- I guess, to the latter part of the year?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So let's focus on the Quadro business. The Quadro business is our product
design for enterprise workstations. This is where probably key parts of the macro
conditions that we had seen in the ﬁrst half of the year, play out on the capital buying
cycle, of a lot of capital in the enterprise.
The business has been relatively steady for many years. And it is in a slightly non-
growth position right now as a lot of the challenges with FX rates around the world,
forcing some challenges on capital purchasing, probably slowed the business down.
We just ﬁnished our SIGGRAPH, where we announced a couple new graphic cards
under our Maxwell architecture. And for [ph] design for that market in the second
half of the year. So we're pretty excited with what we have coming out.
Secondly, our overall Tesla business. Now, our Tesla business is a diﬀerent business,
focused on the data center and focused on high-performance computing as well asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 16A - Sean Vocke
A - Colette Kress
A - Sean Vocke
A - Colette Kressoverall accelerated computing. And some of our key highlights -- workload for deep
learning, for example.
Our overall high-performance computing -- overall channel for high-performance
computing is still strong; is still a growing market.
Where you're seeing tremendous growth in terms of deep learning, we ﬁnished
ﬁscal year 2015 a year ago with 50% growth in our overall data center business,
largely due to key projects in deep learning, associated with Internet service
providers, leveraging GPUs to train overall applications for key workloads such as
image detection, voice recognition, video coding. And also voice translation. So very,
very important workload. And very project-oriented.
So it's not anything to be questioning in terms of where there's growth. It's just really
project spend in there. Because there is tremendous excitement still stemming from
deep learning every day, from research and new workloads that are forming.
True. So let's dig a little bit deeper in Tesla. I think it was $300 million or so -- it's
getting close to $300 million or so this year.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Uh-huh.
And I think you've talked about being ultimately a $1 billion business. Maybe talk
about, what are the key drivers to get you there? And I think you mentioned deep
learning. And what are some of those drivers that will get you to that $1 billion mark?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So we're talking about a very installed base in the data center, of services, which
-- several of them are currently accelerated -- accelerating using GPUs -- the next
wave of workloads for the data center and their expansion. And the need of
acceleration.
The overall needs in the data center for speed, compute, to complete the work of
the future, is going to be truly backed by the overall need for acceleration.
The overall Tesla GPU can be leveraged both for its overall performance and its ease
for programmability. It programs in terms of -- on the CUDA development language,
which is taught in so many high-end universities in more than 500 diﬀerent places
around the world. So those freshly coming out of university research are going into
the business, knowing how easy it is to program on the GPUs.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantSo we're seeing more and more that need to speed up the key workloads that are in
the data center. And we think this will continue to advance. How fast and how soon
will it get to be $1 billion? I think that's a little hard to deﬁne. But that is the next wave,
is the speed of the data center.
Sure. And maybe -- can you assess, I guess, the competitive landscape out there in
terms of GPU acceleration vis a vis an FPGA solution or even, like, Xeon Phi, for
example? Where does the GPU sit relative to an FPGA in terms of acceleration. And
what are, kind of, the workloads that you'd be really good at, in that situation [ph]
space?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So it's always the case that you can solve the problem multiple ways. You can
solve acceleration in many diﬀerent form factors. FPGAs have been around for many
diﬀerent years, focusing on a very simplistic type of programming that may be
necessary for the data center. You get a -- maybe a lower power. But a lower
performance, particularly with an FPGA, versus what you're going to see from a GPU.
You're also going to see an environment of a lot of challenges, with reprogramming
an FPGA for the data center. The GPU is so simplistic in terms of its ability to change
an algorithm on the ﬂy; reset the overall workload; and oﬀ and going and running. It
is, in a software environment, very friendly to those types of programmers.
So we really haven't seen acceleration for some of these very challenging, high-
performing workloads in the data center, with the need of overall FPGAs yet. They
do leverage the GPUs quite consistently in that. But again, there's just diﬀerent ways
to solve the problem. But we're very excited about what we have coming forward.
Sure. And I think one of the things that gets lost among the investment community is,
this is something you guys have been working on for many years now. Whereas I feel
like the FPGA guys have only recently been, I guess, making that push in there. Is
that correct?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think FPGAs have been around for quite a while. I think the recent consolidation has
put a lot more attention to it, on that. But it is -- it will be interesting to see how the
market changes with that awareness now.
All right. Do we have any questions from the audience right now? Okay. Let's move
on to automotive. I think -- sorry, one back here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 16A - Colette Kress
A - Sean Vocke
A - Colette Kress
A - Sean VockeI had one about the virtual reality. What kind of ASPs do you think you could get? I
guess they recommended the three diﬀerent GPUs, right? What sort of -- ?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So they are recommending our retail ASPs for those GPUs. It's starting with our GPU
970, 980 and 980 Ti [ph]. Those overall retail prices for the end-to-end card, not for
the chip component of them, will retail probably close to $300 or more apiece.
Okay. Let's talk automotive a little bit. Another area you guys are all very excited
about. You've put a lot of investment and time into this business. And when I look at
last year, I think it was about $180 million.
And you guys have talked about getting to, I guess -- going from 8 million cars to 25
million cars over time. Maybe talk about over what time you see that growing from 8
million to 25 million cars for your Tegra business.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So just in this last quarter our automotive business is about $80 million a
quarter, in terms of where it's running right now. It grew probably close to 80% this
last quarter, nearly almost doubling for the ﬁrst half of the ﬁscal year. We have 8
million diﬀerent cars on the road today with NVIDIA technology in the infotainment
center.
The 25 million new cars that will hit the road, is really focusing on our pipeline of
design wins that we've already completed. So moving forward, it's just the timing
eﬀect in terms of when those cars will hit the road and work through its
manufacturing cycle.
But we're all ready for those 25 million cars. We continue to work on new design
wins. As the infotainment systems move from some of the original high-end cars into
several of the mainstream lines, you'll ﬁnd us in Audi, BMWs, Teslas, Volkswagens,
Golfs, Hondas. So really kind of moving toward a broad range of diﬀerent cars, as
that becomes a key main feature for selling.
But as we work forward, that pipeline will continue to be advanced as we think about
driver assist and selling our overall DRIVE platform. We announced in Q2 the
availability of our DRIVE platform for over 50 diﬀerent OEM manufacturers, tier ones
and researchers in the industry, for them to take it, work with it, move their overall
software algorithms -- us work together on that -- and we'll come soon with our next
steps in terms of our DRIVE.
Sure. So I think you talked about ADAS. We had a company here yesterday called
Mobileye, talking about them having about 80% of the ADAS market today. MaybeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 16A - Colette Kress

A - Sean Vocketalk about how your solution is diﬀerent from, say -- not just a solution guy, like a
Mobileye. But maybe an embedded solution from a TI or, say, an Intel or Freescale.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. I think this is another situation where everybody's approaching the opportunity
in a diﬀerent manner. So we've approached it, looking at an overall compute
platform for the car -- one that can be complementary to many of those other type of
providers that may be out there. It's able to incorporate a plug-and-play with a -- all
the diﬀerent types of cameras, sensors, or other type of information that will be
feeding to a collective data source.
We're taking our learnings in terms of in the data center, with very complex data
structured. And coming up with solutions for overall ADAS through software
algorithms.
So when I look at how we are diﬀerent than the competitor, we look at it as a
complete computer platform that may be necessary -- that you'll want all of that
function together, looking at it in a place where a car manufacturer will want a single
form of software and be able to manage that software that, is going to be our key
diﬀerentiating piece than some of those other providers.
Okay. Then maybe talk a little bit about how many Tegras do you see per vehicle
now. And do you see that dollar content growing over the next year or two?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So right now, we have several cars on the road, where there's as many as four
diﬀerent type of processors in the car, through front infotainment systems as well as
rear-seat entertainment as well.
As we move forward, the key component of our growth is producing the value
through software and software algorithms, really hoping for a business model where
that value is appreciated, where the overall ASPs can continue to grow in there.
So I think the business model is really about building a software that can be
leveraged across many diﬀerent types of manufacturers; produce increased ASPs;
may or may not be multiple Tegras within their. That's for the auto manufacturer to
deﬁne. But we can do either way.
Okay. Do we have any other questions right now? All right. Let's talk about your
model. And if you look at your proﬁtability, your margins are now -- I think gross
margins are over 55%; operating margins over 20%. Maybe talk about how your
margins and proﬁtability have been able to expand so much over the last couple of
years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

With our focus on the four key markets and focused on a platform position, it really
allowed us to separate from just being a component underneath some other type of
OEM. It allowed us to establish the price points to establish the business model that
we wanted, that we can continue to come back and produce the value, because we
understood that overall customer.
So when you think about our growth platforms, our Tesla business, our GRID
business, our enterprise business. And most of our overall gaming, high-end, is also
better than the Company average gross margins.
Which just really shows that, with these platforms that we have, our opportunity
going forward is not only good to the top line. But can really pay oﬀ in terms of our
gross margins as well. So that's where our overall concentration has been.
When we focus on our operating margin, our focus has been on a leveraged single
technology platform. The Maxwell architecture stems all the way from the GPU to the
SOC. And leveraging the same technology, all engineers working on the exact same
technology. But learning four diﬀerent markets to put that in, has been very helpful
for us to manage our overall investment portfolio, concentrating on the four but
ﬁnding the eﬃciencies that we need across there.
That's really also allowed us to play out in growth in both operating proﬁt, net
income and EPS as we've really played out that strategy. So we're going to continue
to focus on that as we go forward, because I think it's very important that we balance.
But think about those investments for those markets going forward.
Okay. So Icera. I want to touch on that brieﬂy. I think -- obviously you made that
decision to exit mobile. Maybe talk a little bit about what went in that decision to, I
guess, decide to -- you don't need that technology.
And maybe talk about what kind of impact that has on your model going forward. I
mean, there's some puts and takes there, obviously, with your growth vectors like
enterprise. How does that play out with Icera winding down?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So as we focused on the markets and looked at our investment to modem, we
felt we could address the need for connectivity potentially with an outside partner
and not necessarily having to build it ourselves. It was a tough decision. It was an
important part of our overall business.
But after much discussion and needs of our businesses for investments, we decided
it was the best for us to either wind down or sell the operations. So we ended upFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 13 of 16A - Sean Vocke
A - Colette Kress
A - Sean Vocke
A - Colette Kresschoosing to wind it down in the Second Quarter. And we're still working through that
in the last couple quarters of this ﬁscal year to do.
But it allows us to really hone in and focus on areas that will truly drive our growth --
key areas such as deep learning. That focus also takes deep learning to the
automotive and key areas such as virtualization as well; and, of course, gaming,
being such a big part of our business, is really the focus of our investment.
Sure. Then, as I look out into 2017, obviously this has been a lot of concerns on some
of this licensing business that may or may not roll oﬀ. Maybe talk a little bit about
your thoughts on the licensing business. And how do you respond to those
concerns?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So our main piece of our licensing business is with our cross-license with Intel.
That Intel cross-license will take us from a revenue standpoint through the First
Quarter of ﬁscal year 2018 as we will earn out the revenue associated with that.
So there is a lot of questions in terms of, what is that; when will that get renewed; will
it get renewed, in those types of pieces. But keep in mind, it's really under our
overall umbrella of our full IP strategy as we work through our patent litigation
against Samsung and Qualcomm in the ITC core.
So we are currently waiting for the ﬁrst part of that, which will be a ruling from the
judge in the ﬁrst part of October. And that will likely progress to a ruling from the
Commission in the end of January, beginning of February.
So I think it is more of holistic view to look at our overall IP strategy. We're
considering our licensing revenue as a part of that IP strategy. I think all eyes are on
our ITC case -- the next steps either side will take. And how this will play out.
Sure. Then, as far as legal expenses go, I think it took a step up this year. Maybe talk
about where your thoughts are next year for litigation expenses and legal expenses.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. We don't have an outlook at this time for ﬁscal year 2017. For ﬁscal year 2016 it is
an increase as we focus on such an important part of our business, in defending the
IP in our more than 7,000 diﬀerent patents that we do have.
Our range of expenses for this year is about $70 million to $90 million so far for the
ﬁscal year. But that incorporates multiple components of both the oﬀense side of the
ITC. But also our structure on the defense side that we have to do as well. As we go
into ﬁscal year 2017, we'll just have to see the direction of where this goes. We're just
waiting right now for the courts.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

A - Colette KressSure. And -- oh, sorry. (inaudible).
I mean, on the Intel part, are you expecting to have another IP deal with them, or are
you focusing more on Samsung, Qualcomm, with Intel deal being a perpetual deal
that's ending? Or, is that something you hope to -- ?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think we -- I think our focus is on IP as a whole. And many of the diﬀerent players
out in the market that leverage and use our overall IP. The Qualcomm and Samsung
cases are very important in the mobile space and the mobile architectures, that the
monetization of that IP is not seen. And that's where we're focused.
But it -- but I believe that many diﬀerent players, whether they be mobile or non-
mobile, are really focused on that outcome of that case, to really discuss in terms of
licensing. So I think we'll just have to wait and see on that part.
Then, in auto, most of your -- all your wins are for the infotainment -- is it -- are you
basically rendering the graphical pictures of the -- is it basically a -- purely a graphics
kind of a business?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
For the infotainment system, it takes the best beneﬁts of that GPU. And putting
together something that looks nearly real, or materials that may look real. But it's also
about that center entertainment console as well. And putting that all together in a
very user-friendly way to actually visualize that while you're overall driving.
We work on the software content with the OEM manufacturers and the tier one to
customize that throughout all of the diﬀerent cars that we put that in.
I'm sorry. Maybe I [ph] didn't understand. So you're saying the IP legal case has
come to a head between October and the March -- January timeframe? Can you just
go over that again?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. The hearing took place at the end of June and, as we enter in the ﬁrst part of
October, the ﬁrst week of October, we are expected to hear from the judge on that
ruling. Most likely after that single judge ruling, it will move to the Commission in the
January/February timeframe, for them to also make a ruling on the case.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-09

A - Colette KressBefore we ﬁnish up, I wanted to touch on the GRID business real quick. Maybe talk
about your eﬀorts of GPU virtualization -- how large is it today; how large do you
think it could be? And I think that when I look to last week, I think there was GRID 2.0
announced at VMworld. Maybe talk a little bit about that as well.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So our GRID position, again, is our virtualized GPU in a cloud environment. It can
be leveraged for a couple of key things. In the enterprise, it really enables a lot of the
VDI environments.
One of the challenges with the VDI environments is the user interface -- the user
experience, as they want a very clean-streamed application. And if it's very visual-
intensive that's really challenging. We created the technology in the market to create
that virtualization capability of the GPU back in the data center.
Our GRID 2.0 that we announced was the ability to improve the overall performance,
improve the concurrency of the GPU in the data center, essentially doubling it,
depending on the workload. And depending on that experience.
Another key component of GRID is using it for streaming gaming. You'll see a lot of
streaming gaming out there being used where GPUs are being used, back in the
data center, to prove out that.
So our GRID 2.0 was in connection with VMware at VMworld as well, as they have
been a key component for us in terms of their software and virtualization and our
capabilities in terms of improving that end user experience.
At the end of ﬁscal year 2015 we did reach our goal of being in the $10 millions on
our GRID business. And we're continuing to grow that with additional use cases,
trials and projects. It's an enterprise sale. It is in combination with the IT groups and
the business unit groups to put together. So we're excited about those opportunities
but do understand there's a lot of work to do to get those closed.
Sure. And I guess we have time for maybe one more. And I'll ask you about -- one of,
I guess, the stronger points of your business is the capital allocation. I think you're
well over 100% the last couple of years, in terms of returning free cash. And now
you're -- I think it's over about $3 billion in net cash.
What are your long-term plans for cash? How much do you need to run the
business? And are you potentially looking at getting involved in the M&A party out
there?

A - Sean VockeSo our capital return program is a key component of our shareholder value. We
reinitiated our capital return program in our ﬁscal year 2013 at the end of ﬁscal year
2013. And we've continued since then. And even this year we plan to return more
than $800 million to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
So it's here to stay. It is something that's key and important. Over the last couple of
years it has been over 100% as we have balanced our needs for cash, our availability
of US cash, as well as our program for a good amount of free cash ﬂows to be
returned. That's going to be our focus going forward.
We're going to balance out the cost of returning that cash to shareholders, focus on
the investment in the overall business, because that will be our ﬁrst priority.
We will continue to look at M&A. We haven't been a large M&A -- a big company
buying [ph] large catalogs of companies. But we -- again, we still focus on that for
key components of our platform approach.
Sure. I think that's all the time we have for today, unfortunately. But I guess Colette
will be here for a couple of minutes if you have any follow-ups.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you. Excellent.
Thank you very much, Colette.
