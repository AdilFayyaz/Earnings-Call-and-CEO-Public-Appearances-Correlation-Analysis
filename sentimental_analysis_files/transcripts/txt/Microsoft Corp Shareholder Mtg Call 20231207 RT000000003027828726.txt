Hello, I'm Sandra Peterson, the Lead Independent Director of Microsoft's Board of
Directors. Today, we're connecting with shareholders around the world, including a
broadcast with real-time language translation through Microsoft Teams. Wherever
you are, we're glad you're joining us.
After my opening remarks, Keith Dolliver, our Vice President, Deputy General
Counsel, and Corporate Secretary will conduct the business and procedural portions
of the meeting. Then, Amy Hood, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Oﬃcer, will review Microsoft's ﬁnancial results and business highlights. And ﬁnally,
Satya Nadella, our Chairman of the Board and CEO, will talk about Microsoft'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 2 of 25opportunities and responsibilities as a leader in AI at this pivotal moment for
technology.
After Satya's talk, we'll have a live Q&A session with Satya, Amy, and Microsoft Vice
Chair and President, Brad Smith.
It's a privilege to share with you some of the remarkable things Microsoft achieved
this last ﬁscal year. The company once again delivered record ﬁnancial results
despite challenging economic conditions. Microsoft helped customers and partners
around the globe use digital technology to meet pressing business and social
needs. And Microsoft established itself as a clear leader in advancing the use of AI in
productive and responsible ways.
Microsoft's track record demonstrates the company is well-positioned for current
conditions and sustained long-term success. Even amidst geopolitical and economic
volatility, we are optimistic about the future and the opportunities Microsoft has to
create value for our customers, our shareholders, and our many other stakeholders.
Let me now turn to some questions we received in advance of this meeting from
shareholders that relate to the work of the Board of Directors.
First, we received several questions about how the Board designs executive
compensation for Satya and other key executives. The Board has implemented a
pay-for-performance program aligned with Microsoft's strategic goals and the
interests of long-term shareholders. The company has seen tremendous business
results and shareholder returns under the program. The Board regularly reviews the
design of the program to ensure its continued success. The proxy describes this
topic in depth if you would like more details.
I'll also speak to questions we've received on the composition and role of the Board
of Directors. The Board works closely with management to provide oversight and
counsel related to long-term strategy, risks and opportunities, and feedback from
shareholders. We nominate a slate of Directors that's the right size to operate
eﬃciently and eﬀectively as a group and in the Board's four committees. We seek a
diverse mix of Directors with complementary qualiﬁcations, expertise, and attributes
to help us best fulﬁll our responsibilities as a Board.
Microsoft's Board is nominating 12 individuals to serve as Directors this year with
details on each provided in the proxy statement. The nominees include two new
additions, Catherine MacGregor, the Group CEO of Engie S.A., and Mark Mason, the
CFO of Citi Group.
Padma Warrior and John Thompson have decided not to seek re-election. We
deeply appreciate their service and many contributions to Microsoft. Ms.Warrior
served on the Board and as a member of the Compensation Committee for eight
years. During his 11-year tenure, Mr.Thompson served as Board Chair and Lead
Independent Director and Chaired the Governance and Nominating Committee. HeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

Page 3 of 25Keith Dolliveralso led the CEO search and succession process from Steve Ballmer to Satya
Nadella. On behalf of the Board, we want to thank them both and wish them well.
And now, I call the 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting to order.
I'll be serving as the Chair of the meeting and Keith will be serving as the Secretary.
As Chair of the meeting, I've adopted an agenda that will govern the order of
business and the rules of conduct for the meeting. Copies of the agenda and the
rules are available on the virtual meeting site as well as the Annual Meeting page on
the Investor Relations website. The rules of conduct also govern the Q&A session.
Keith will now report the notice of the meeting, the proxies received, and present the
matters to be voted on. Keith?
{BIO 15601400 <GO>}
Thank you, Sandi. I'll walk us through the items for shareholder consideration at this
meeting. The polls are open, and will close following the presentation of our
business matters.
If you've already voted, there's nothing else you need to do, unless you want to
change your vote while the polls are open. We plan to take both pre-submitted and
live questions during the Q&A session later in the meeting. We've collected
shareholder questions since October 19 on the Proxy Vote website. Shareholders can
also submit questions now through the virtual meeting portal.
The company has appointed Broadridge to serve as the Inspector of Election, and a
Broadridge representative is participating by conference call in that role. Beginning
on October 19, 2023, Broadridge mailed the notice of the meeting and the Internet
availability of the proxy materials to all shareholders of record as of September 29,
2023. And as a result, the meeting is being held pursuant to proper notice.
Broadridge has reported that a quorum of shareholders is present to conduct this
meeting based on the shareholder proxies received. Representatives of our
independent auditor Deloitte & Touche are also joining by conference call, and our
Board nominees are attending today's meeting via Microsoft Teams.
Today, we have four management proposals and nine shareholder proposals for you
to consider. They were all described in the proxy statement for this year's meeting.
The ﬁrst item is the election of Directors. The following 12 individuals have been
properly nominated by the board. Reid Hoﬀman, Hugh Johnston, Teri List, Catherine
MacGregor, Mark Mason, Satya Nadella, Sandra Peterson, Penny Pritzker, Carlos
Rodriguez, Charles Scharf, John Stanton and Emma Walmsley. The Board
recommends a vote in favor of each nominee.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 25The Board of Directors also recommends a vote in favor of each of the following
three proposals.
Proposal 2, providing an advisory say-on-pay vote to approve executive
compensation as disclosed in the company's proxy statement.
Proposal 3, seeking input on the frequency of Microsoft's say-on-pay vote with an
annual frequency recommended.
And Proposal 4, asking that you ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche as the
company's independent auditor for ﬁscal year 2024.
The next nine items are shareholder proposals. These are set forth in the proxy along
with the proponents supporting statements. The proxy statement also contains
Microsoft's response to each of these proposals, explaining why the company and
the Board of Directors recommends shareholders vote against each of these
proposals.
We now have presentations by representatives to introduce each of the nine
shareholder proposals.
The proposals are; from the National Legal and Policy Center, a proposal calling for a
report on gender-based compensation and beneﬁt gaps related to reproductive
health and gender dysphoria.
From the National Public Policy and Research Center, a proposal calling for a report
on the risk of Omitting Ideology in our equal employment opportunity policy.
From Martin Matthew Guldner, a proposal calling for a report on government
takedown requests.
From Harrington Investments, a proposal calling for a report on the risks of
Microsoft's involvement and weapons development for training our combat.
From As You Sow and co-ﬁlers, a proposal calling for a report on climate risks to
retirement plan beneﬁciaries.
From AkademikerPension and co-ﬁlers, a proposal calling for a report on tax
transparency.
From Eko and a co-ﬁler, a proposal calling for a report on data operations in human
rights hotspots.
From Tulipshare Capital, a proposal calling for Microsoft to mandate that the trade
associations and other political organizations we contribute to issue their ownFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

And from our Arjuna Capital and a co-ﬁler, a proposal calling for a report on AI
misinformation and disinformation.
Please play the presentations introducing each proposal.
Good morning. In 2019 and 2021, Microsoft shareholders consider proposals that ask
for reports about the company's gaps in pay and beneﬁts quote across gender.
Those proposals seem so antiquated now because they were only concerned about
compensation gaps between men and women. I say they're antiquated because as
we've been told by LGBTQ Advocacy Groups and the tech industry for many years
now, there are more than two genders.
How ignorant everyone was back then. I mean, how can you produce a report about
pay gaps across genders when you don't include all the genders?
In Microsoft's opposition statement to our proposal, the company impugns our
motives by saying our request, 'appears to stem from animosity towards certain
reproductive and gender-related health beneﬁts'.
On the contrary, we're only following previous arguments about discriminatory gaps
in pay regarding gender and LGBTQ deﬁnitions of how many genders there are and
how they function as it pertains to gender ﬂuidity and sex change.
In other words, we're simply following their own arguments, and Microsoft's, to their
logical conclusions. And thanks to the smashing successes of pressure groups like
the pro-LGBTQ Human Rights Campaign, we now have protected classiﬁcations of
gender identity and sexual orientation against pay and beneﬁts discrimination under
U.S. Department of Labor and EEOC codes.
Microsoft proudly boasts that it aﬃrms individuals' ability to change genders and
that its insurance beneﬁts pay for transition surgeries for employees and their
dependents, including their children.
Yet considering all these pro-transition arguments by Microsoft and by LGBTQ
advocates, there's a gaping discriminatory hole in the company's pay and beneﬁts
coverage, as designated under EEOC rules. And that gap omits care for
detransitioners.
Detransitioners are real, they're growing in number, and they are increasingly angry
that they've been told that they can easily change their sex with chemical and
surgical procedures without problems. Unfortunately, a lot of them end up stuck with
more medical problems like chronic pain and sexual dysfunction, but then they can't
get treatments or insurance coverage to reverse those decisions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 25Detransitioners ﬁt under gender identity and sexual orientation as much as any other
EEOC discrimination category, and therefore must be protected. Yet Microsoft, who
apparently doesn't care for employees and their dependents who have been
needlessly mutilated, has the nerve to say that, we as shareholders have animosity
over certain gender-related beneﬁts.
Again, we're only following your own arguments to their logical conclusions. So we
advise Microsoft executives and the Board to look in the mirror when it comes to
accusations of animosity. Please vote for Proposal number 5.
On November 22, 2023, I visited Microsoft's Diversity and Inclusion webpage. This
page proudly proclaims, we believe in the transformative power of engaging many
diﬀerent perspectives. And yet Microsoft provides no protection against
discrimination on the basis of viewpoint or ideology in its equal employment
opportunity policy.
Certainly, this is not a result of wanting to keep that policy concise, since 20
protected categories are already listed. Nor does the fact that political aﬃliation is
included eliminate concerns about discrimination on the basis of viewpoint or
ideology, because discriminating on the basis of political aﬃliation arguably protects
only against discrimination on the limited basis of party registration.
The catch-all category of characteristics protected by applicable local laws is also
unhelpful to the employees working in the half of the country's jurisdictions with no
relevant legal protections. It is particularly concerning that Microsoft fails to include
such protections even after having been notiﬁed, as our proposal points out, of
multiple incidents of apparent censorship of right-of-center perspectives by
Microsoft's subsidiaries and programs.
It should go without saying that discriminating against the views of half the country is
no way to maximize shareholder value, particularly since many of those censored
views have proven to be correct or at least constitute an important part of the civil
discourse necessary for democratic governance.
As we note in our proposal, viewpoint diversity is essential to attracting, hiring, and
fully engaging the employees necessary for a successful business. Accordingly, we
ask you to vote in favor of our proposal requesting an assessment of the risks
associated with Microsoft's failure to protect against discrimination on the basis of
viewpoint or ideology in its equal employment opportunity policy.
I'm Martin Guldner, shareholder of Microsoft, request that Microsoft provide a report
published on the company's website and update semi-annually and omitting
proprietary information and at reasonable cost that speciﬁes the Company's policy,
responding to requests to remove or take-down content, or content-producing
entities from LinkedIn or other platforms by the Executive Oﬃce of the President,
Members of Congress, or any other agency or entity of the United States
Government.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

Page 7 of 25This report should include an itemizing list of such takedown requests, including
name and title of the oﬃcial making the request; the nature and scope of the
request; the date of the request; the outcome of the request; and a reason or
rationale for the Company's response, or lack thereof.
Supporting Statements. In Bantam Books versus Sullivan (1963), and in other cases,
United States Supreme Court has ruled that private entities may not engage in
censorship of speech at the request of government, as it has the same eﬀect as
direct government censorship.
On July 15, 2021, White House press Secretary Jennifer Psaki was asked, "Can you
talk a little bit more about this request for tech companies to be more aggressive in
policing misinformation? Has the administration been in touch with any of these
companies and are there any actions that the federal government can take to ensure
their cooperation, because we've seen, from the start, there's not a lot of action on
some of these platforms."
Psaki replied, "Sure. Well, ﬁrst, we are in regular touch with these social media
platforms, and those engagements are typically happening through members of our
senior staﬀ, but also members of our COVID-19 team. Given as Surgeon General
Dr.Vivek Murthy conveyed, this is a big issue of misinformation, speciﬁcally on the
pandemic."
Circumstantial evidence shows that the Company may have been the recipient of
overtures, possibly from government, to censor. For example, Missouri versus Biden
was ﬁled by the Attorney Generals of Missouri and Louisiana on May 5, 2022. A later
motion for preliminary injunction highlights 1,432 facts showing that the top oﬃcials
in the federal government are coercing and colluding with big tech social media
companies to censor free speech.
Dr.Robert Malone, M.D., M.S., the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology saw his
LinkedIn account, a subsidiary of Microsoft Incorporated restricted and later
reinstated for violating LinkedIn's user agreement because he posted misleading or
inaccurate information about vaccines and COVID-19.
The United States Republican 2024, presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy, said
in May 2023 his LinkedIn account a subsidiary of Microsoft Incorporated was
restricted for sharing content that contains misleading or inaccurate information and
later reinstated the same day.
Shareholders need to know whether the Company cooperates with government
oﬃcials engaged in unconstitutional censorship, opening the Company to liability
claims by victims to know whether the Company fails to disclose these potential
liabilities as material risks in its public ﬁlings.
Microsoft in its argument against our proposal says it has been open about its
principled approach to pursuing military contracts cited in the proposal. There'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 25nothing principled about pursuing a technology designed to kill human beings.
Keep in mind that this technology will not only be utilized by our military, but others
that may seek to destroy us. Technological weapons can be used for defense or
oﬀense, for the United States, for Russia, for North Korea, for Iraq, and many others.
Weapons technology can be used by anyone, anywhere, once it is developed,
released, or modiﬁed. Weapons technology can be hacked, and it will. There is no
going back. Pandora's box has been opened. The black box to kill has been opened.
While shareholders and stakeholders may be impressed by Microsoft's arguments
that the company has a, 'principled approach to pursuing military contracts', in the
end, it is based primarily, if not exclusively, on corporate materialistic self-interest,
not patriotism, not necessarily just in defense of America based upon Microsoft's so-
called continuing thoughtful approach.
Corporations are not patriotic, people are. Corporations have no soul, people do.
Corporations have no morality, people do. Corporations at best are amoral. They will
do business with anyone, any government, democratic, fascist, communist, or any
country in the world in pursuit of cash. There is nothing in our company's articles of
incorporation that supports United States democracy or our military or our country's
defense or, in fact, our Constitution. These commitments are not in Microsoft's
articles or charters, which is the rule of corporate law.
If the board of our corporation was interested in continuing the dialogue about its
participation in developing weapons technology and being transparent, why would
it not support an outside third-party independent report to assess the reputational
and ﬁnancial risk of continuing to be a weapons manufacturer? Ask that question,
why does our Board of Directors and management ask ﬁduciaries fear of report
asking these questions? Thank you.
Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to present this proposal. I'm Grant
Bradski from the shareholder representative, As You Sow. This shareholder resolution
is of the utmost importance as it asks the critical question, how will Microsoft protect
its employees' life savings from the economic consequences of climate change?
Climate change poses material risk to retirement plan beneﬁciaries. The CDP reports
that 215 global companies, including Microsoft, have almost $1 trillion at risk from
climate impacts, with many losses expected within the next ﬁve years. Over one-
fourth of Microsoft employees are invested in the company's target date option,
which is heavily exposed to high carbon and deforestation-intensive industries.
These investments contribute to climate change, create systemic portfolio risk, and
are poor long-term investments for younger beneﬁciaries whose retirement beneﬁts
are likely to be harmed due to climate-related ﬁnancial losses.
Microsoft knows we must address these climate risks head-on. It's why shareholders
are proud of our company's climate goals, including a goal to become carbon
negative by 2030. Yet how will we meet these goals if Microsoft is at the same timeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 25directing over $2 billion of employee 401(k) savings into fossil fuels and burning
down the Amazon? These investments undermine the company's climate goals,
expose employees' savings to ﬁnancial risk, and harm the company's reputation on
climate, which may make it diﬃcult to attract and retain top employee talent and
could expose the company to litigation risk, as occurred recently.
Just as Microsoft has taken operational climate action, shareholders ask that
Microsoft now begin to address the climate impacts of the billions of dollars being
invested in fossil fuels by our company retirement plan. This will not only protect our
company from the economic impacts of climate change, but protect our employees'
life savings from these same risks. Thank you.
Dear fellow shareholders and members of the Board of Directors. My name is Troels
Borrild and I represent the Danish Pension Fund AkademikerPension. Along with our
co-ﬁlers PenSam, Nordea Asset Management, Greater Manchester Pension Fund, OIP
Trust and Merseyside Pension Fund, we have ﬁled shareholder Proposal 10 regarding
the publication of a tax transparency report.
Our proposal calls on Microsoft to align with other leading multinational companies
and use the global reporting initiative GRI tax standard. The GRI is the most widely
used sustainability standard worldwide and is the only comprehensive global tax
reporting standard today. A transition to the GRI standard will not require a drastic
transformation for our company. Microsoft already submits country by country
reporting to OECD tax authorities privately. Any burdens to the company should
therefore be minimal.
The GRI standard provides transparency of our company's approach to taxes, tax
governance, controls and risk management. Stakeholder engagement related to
taxes, and perhaps most importantly, public country-by-country tax reporting. In a
world faced by multiple crises, the scrutiny of corporate tax payments is likely to
increase year-on-year. If investors are to make informed assessments of Microsoft's
tax strategy and evaluations of the company's tax risks, we need accurate, accessible
and transparent data on a country-by-country basis.
We have taken note of the opposition statement from management. Indeed, peers
do not provide tax transparency at the moment. We think this is likely to change in
coming years, and that frontrunner companies stand to beneﬁt from staying ahead
of the curve. We encourage the Board to demonstrate leadership and embrace tax
transparency in the years to come. Thank you.
Greetings, everyone. My name is Ali al-Ahmed. I am a Saudi Arabian national living in
exile. I was 14 years old when the Saudi government began its campaign to silence
me from speaking out against its abuses. Putting me in prison with my parents, the
entirety of my family, and many friends and cousins and relatives over the years. I still
have a brother in prison, 20 years now. I consider myself lucky to have escaped, but
thousands of others have not been so lucky. They lost their lives, many of them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 25Saudi government has only intensiﬁed its crackdown against dissent, even inﬁltrating
into American big tech companies like Twitter, Microsoft, Google, and others, in
order to obtain user data of people who dare to speak out against it. Many activists
were jailed from that data leak, and some were murdered or executed, including my
friend and our national icon, Dr.Al-Hamid, who died in prison a couple of years ago,
who founded the largest human rights organization in the country's history.
Given this grim reality, it's truly alarming that Microsoft plans to build data center in
Saudi Arabia with the help of the Saudi government and its entities. Microsoft claims
to have done human rights impact assessment for that decision. I've never heard of
it. I am here in Washington. I am the longest active human rights activist from Saudi
Arabia in the United States, if not the world. But Microsoft continues to refuse to
provide transparency into its ﬁnding and mitigation eﬀorts.
Absent that, hundreds if not thousands of activists in the region, are now at the risk
of the Saudi brutal abuses. And if they were Microsoft users, people will start leaving
Microsoft and using other services and platforms because to protect their security
from the Saudis. We implore you to put human rights ﬁrst, security, the lives of
people, and people's livelihood before proﬁts, and vote to pass Resolution 11. Thank
you so much. Have a good day.
Good morning. Today, I'm representing Tulipshare and speaking on behalf of
concerned long-term shareholders by introducing Proposal 12, which requests our
company adopt a policy that will support transparency in political spending, aligning
with Microsoft's commitment to responsible corporate stewardship. It is increasingly
evident that we currently live in a world where corporate actions are scrutinized, not
only for their impact on the bottom line, but also for their broader societal
consequences.
As American politics increasingly become more polarized, the risks associated with
corporate political spending have similarly increased. Our company is no exception.
Inevitably, the candidates' issues, outcomes, and policies advanced by corporate
political spending lead to public attention and scrutiny. A prudent way to mitigate
the risks Microsoft faces is by ensuring that its political spending does not conﬂict
with its stated company values.
Corporate political spending is nothing new. Companies seeking to progress their
agendas and gain inﬂuence and support for their objectives will often do so through
monetary contributions to political campaigns and politics-based organizations. One
organization our company ﬁnancially supports is the Republican Attorney General's
Association, which supported the attorney general who argued to reverse the legal
precedent upholding the constitutional right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision.
Despite the ﬁnancial support, after the Supreme Court's decision, Microsoft
committed to pay for employee travel expenses for abortions. This mixed messaging
not only undermines the sincerity of Microsoft's purported values, but can also
damage the company's reputation and aﬀect its bottom line. Consumers andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 25investors alike desire assurance that a company will remain steadfast in its stated
values and commitments.
To avoid this kind of disjointed messaging, the CPA-Zicklin-Model-Code-of-Conduct
for corporate political spending provides a comprehensive framework for guiding
and overseeing political contributions made by corporations. Transparency builds
trust, and trust is the foundation of any successful business. The CPA-Zicklin-Model
requires companies to disclose their political contributions, enabling shareholders to
have a clear understanding of how corporate funds are being used in the political
arena. This transparency not only fosters trust, but also aligns with the increasing
demand for openness and accountability in corporate practices.
Microsoft CEO himself stated in this year's letter to shareholders, to create positive
impact with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use.
Proposal 12 is about upholding the principles that deﬁne Microsoft as a company
and demonstrating Microsoft's commitment to ethical corporate behavior. This
proposal seeks to foster accountability, mitigate risk, and contribute to responsible
corporate citizenship.
As shareholders, you have the power to shape the direction of this company. I urge
you to help uphold the enduring strength and integrity of Microsoft by voting in
favor of Proposal 12. Together, let us reinforce our commitment to excellence,
transparency, and responsible corporate stewardship. Thank you.
Good morning. My name is Krist Novoselic, Microsoft shareholder, Musician, and Co-
Founder of the band Nirvana. I move Proposal number 13 in partnership with
investment ﬁrm Arjuna Capital and co-ﬁlers Open MIC and Eko. We are asking
Microsoft to evaluate the risks posed by misinformation and disinformation
generated and disseminated through artiﬁcial intelligence and to report on plans to
mitigate these risks.
As an activist and author on issues of democracy, I'm increasingly concerned with
how myths and disinformation are being used to destabilize our society. For years,
we've seen a signiﬁcant proliferation of myths and disinformation through social
media platforms, and how the abuse of these platforms has the power to destabilize
our public institutions by fostering election disputes, conspiracies and more.
What happens when society relies on information generated through Microsoft's AI-
powered Bing, a platform bound to produce inaccurate answers 10% of the time.
What happens when deep fakes are created of presidential candidates spewing hate
speech, or deep fake terrorist attacks are created that look real to the eye? We have
already seen Generative AI be abused in these ways, distorting the truth with
potentially extreme consequences for society.
When Microsoft released its generative AI-powered Bing last February, numerous AI
experts and investors expressed concern. Many urged Microsoft to pause and
consider all the risk associated with this new technology, so that the company couldFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 12 of 25Keith Dolliverestablish risk mitigation practices. Yet, our company raced forward, releasing this
nascent technology without the appropriate guardrails. Generative AI is a game
changer. There's no question, but the rush to market seemingly prioritizes short-term
proﬁts over long-term success.
What happens in 2024, an election year, if races around the world are manipulated
using Microsoft technology? What happens ﬁve years from now, 20 years? As a long-
term shareholder, I want Microsoft to succeed over the long run, which means our
company must do what it can today to mitigate the Generative AI risks of tomorrow.
Not only the risk to society, of which there could be many, but to the company itself.
Regulatory risk, legal risk, reputational risk. These are only a few.
Social media companies have been able to hide behind Section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act, which generally provides immunity for third-party
content. But content generated through Microsoft's AI is not third-party generated. It
is generated by Microsoft, and as such could carry signiﬁcant liability. While
Microsoft touts its current reporting, these reports are limited to principles and
platitudes. They do not outline the concrete actions and accountability that we, as
investors, seek. Thank you.
{BIO 15601400 <GO>}
Thank you each for those presentations. Many of these proposals relate to matters
we at Microsoft take very seriously and where we have a long track record of
thoughtful engagement on topics ranging from responsible AI to protecting
fundamental human rights to environmental sustainability. We place great
importance on maintaining the trust of our employees, customers, partners,
shareholders, and the public.
As we explain in the proxy statement, we believe Microsoft is already providing
much of the information that a number of these proposals request. For instance,
Microsoft and our subsidiary, LinkedIn, already issue public reports every six months
on government take-down requests we receive. And we think our public record of
engagement on many of these topics is strong.
Microsoft is proud to be a leader in the ﬁght against misinformation and
disinformation, including risks posed by Generative AI. We're reporting on what
we're doing through in-depth existing and upcoming voluntary reporting, and under
government standards like the EU Code of Practice on disinformation.
We publish reports shining a spotlight on disinformation campaigns. And we've
called out interference from China, Russia, and other state actors intended to disrupt
democratic process elections around the world.
Similarly, we have measures in place to consider human rights impacts, not just in
deciding where to locate data centers, but also to determine what products and
services we'll oﬀer from those data centers, with the privacy of users' data in mind.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

Page 13 of 25Amy HoodAnd for some proposals, we have some fundamentally diﬀerent perspectives on the
issues. And we may not even agree with how the proposals characterize what we are
doing. But whether we agree or not, we recognize the eﬀort these proponents made
to share their perspectives.
We hope you found Microsoft's responses in the proxy statement helpful in making
your voting decisions.
With the proposals presented and with the vast majority of shareholder votes cast in
advance of the meeting, I can now share the preliminary results.
First, all 12 Director Nominees on the ballot are elected. They'll serve until the next
Annual Shareholder Meeting and until their successors are elected and qualiﬁed.
Shareholders approved Proposal 2, the advisory vote on executive compensation.
In response to Proposal 3, shareholders recommended Microsoft maintain its annual
frequency for say-on-pay votes.
Shareholders also approved Proposal 4, ratifying the company's independent
auditor, Deloitte & Touche.
Shareholders did not approve any of the nine shareholder proposals.
The discussion for matters for the shareholder consideration is now closed, and the
polls are also now closed. We expect to post the details of the ﬁnal results on these
matters within four business days on our Investor Relations website and in a Form 8-
K that will be ﬁled with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
And with that, we've completed the formal portion of the meeting, and the meeting
is now adjourned.
Let me now hand it over to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer,
Amy Hood, to discuss our business results.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thank you, Keith. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
As Sandi mentioned, we were able to deliver record results in FY '23. Revenue grew
7%, to over $211 billion. Non-GAAP operating income grew 8%, and non-GAAP
earnings per share grew 7%. We saw strong execution as we delivered diﬀerentiated
customer value and announced new AI capabilities across our products.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 14 of 25To further enhance our talent and capabilities in strategic growth areas, we
completed four acquisitions in FY '23, while continuing to invest in organic growth.
We also maintained our commitment to capital return, which included a total cash
return of $38.6 billion. In September, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly
dividend, and we continue to execute against our current $60 billion buyback
authorization.
Now, I'll share a few highlights from the past ﬁscal year. Our Microsoft Cloud
business surpassed $110 billion in revenue, growing 22% year-over-year with strong
growth across our key services. Azure grew 29%, Oﬃce 365 grew 13%, and Dynamics
365 grew 24%.
We delivered Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage of 72% through the
sustained eﬀorts of our engineering, sales, and marketing teams, even with the
impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand and continued
revenue mix shift to Azure.
Our server products and cloud services business exceeded $79 billion, up 19% year-
over-year, with strong demand for our trusted, diﬀerentiated hybrid oﬀerings. We
continue to help our customers get the most value out of their spend with our high-
value solutions as they digitally transform their businesses.
Now, let's turn to progress across Microsoft 365. Our oﬃce business exceeded $48
billion, up 9% year-over-year, as we helped even more commercial and consumer
users around the world be more productive, collaborative, and secure. We
introduced Copilot for Microsoft 365 and look forward to helping employees unlock
more productivity, starting with our enterprise customers.
Teams' monthly active users exceeded 300 million during the year, and our
Microsoft 365 consumer subscriber base grew to 74.9 million. Windows 11 adoption
continues to grow because of its diﬀerentiated security and productivity value
proposition. The number of devices running Windows 11, more than doubled in the
past year, and we introduced AI-powered features with Copilot in Windows.
We saw continued growth in our search business as we are reshaping daily search
and web habits with Copilot. We are also bringing these new AI-powered
capabilities to businesses with commercial data protection. In Surface, we continue
to innovate across our broad portfolio of devices, including Surface Pro, laptop and
studio.
In LinkedIn, revenue surpassed $15 billion in ﬁscal year '23, up 10% year-over-year,
with LinkedIn talent solutions reaching a new revenue milestone of $7 billion. And
membership grew to more than 950 million professionals during the year. And in
gaming, revenue exceeded $15 billion, as we continued to grow engagement on the
platform and saw more hours played on Xbox Game Pass, which is redeﬁning how
games are distributed, played, and discovered.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

acquisition, a leader in game development and content publishing, which
signiﬁcantly increases our reach of gamers across console, PC, and mobile.
Second, we had a solid start to the ﬁscal year '24 as ﬁrst quarter revenue growth of
13% was driven by Microsoft Cloud revenue, which was $31.8 billion, growing 24%
year-over-year. These results would not be possible without the tremendous
contribution of the more than 220,000 Microsoft employees around the world.
Looking forward, we believe that the highest shareholder value is created by
investing for the future and creating diﬀerentiated, high-value solutions for every
person and organization to achieve more.
We remain focused on delivering three key priorities. First, maintaining our lead as
the top commercial cloud by helping customers use the breadth and depth of the
Microsoft Cloud to get the most out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead
the AI platform wave across our solution areas. And ﬁnally, driving operating
leverage by aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.
With that, please join me in welcoming our Chairman and Chief Executive Oﬃcer,
Satya Nadella.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you very much, Amy, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and for
your continued commitment and investment in Microsoft.
There's no doubt we are living through a time of historic challenge and opportunity.
The world faces ongoing economic, social, and geopolitical volatility. At the same
time, we've entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform productivity
for every individual organization and industry and help us address some of our most
pressing challenges. As a company, we believe we can be the democratizing force
for this new generation of technology and the opportunity to unlock while mitigating
its risks.
As Amy mentioned, we delivered strong results in ﬁscal year 2023, including a
record $211 billion in revenue. To build on our momentum, we remain focused on
three things. First, we will maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud while
innovating in consumer categories, cutting across gaming, device experiences, and
professional social networks. Second, we will accelerate our lead in AI by investing to
infuse this technology across every layer of the tech stack. And ﬁnally, we'll continue
to drive long-term operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue
growth.
Now, I'll highlight examples of our momentum and innovation over the past year,
starting with infrastructure. We have the most comprehensive cloud footprint with
more than 60 data center regions, as well as the most powerful AI infrastructure forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 16 of 25both training and inference, which has been used to build the world's most
advanced models.
With Azure AI, we are making these models available as platforms for our customers.
We oﬀer the best selection of frontier and open source models from both Microsoft,
as well as partners like OpenAI, Cohere, Jais, Meta, Mistral, which customers are
using to build their own AI apps while meeting speciﬁc cost, latency, and
performance needs.
And because safety is the most important feature of our AI platform, we're also
oﬀering best-in-class safety tooling. Every AI app starts with data, so having a
comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. And with
Microsoft Fabric, which we introduced this year, we're unifying compute storage and
governance into a single end-to-end analytics solution.
When it comes to developer tools, GitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming the
productivity of more than one million developers while simultaneously bringing the
joy back to coding. And we're applying AI across Power Platform too, enabling
everyone to use natural language to create apps, build visual agents, and analyze
data.
We're also using the AI inﬂection point to redeﬁne our role in business applications.
With Copilot for Sales and Copilot for Service, we're becoming AI-led business
process transformation layer on top of existing CRM and ERP systems. Across
industries, we are the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real
value from AI.
From our Dragon Ambient eXperience solution, which is helping clinicians
automatically document millions of patient interactions, to our Cloud for Retail,
which is helping companies manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their
physical stores. When it comes to the future of work, Copilot is helping people be
more creative in Word, more insightful in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, and
more productive in Outlook and collaborative in Teams.
In fact, just last month, we shared new research showing real productivity gains that
Copilot is already driving for early users. And with Copilot Studio, organizations can
now tailor Copilot for their speciﬁc needs. We also continue to build momentum in
Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calling. The latest version
delivers up to 2x faster performance while using 50% less memory.
We're also adding diﬀerentiated AI-powered experiences to Windows. Copilot in
Windows brings together the context of the web, work, and the device to provide
better assistance.
As the rate and pace of cyber threats continue to accelerate, security is a top priority
for every organization. Our comprehensive AI-powered solutions give defenders theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

product helping organizations respond to threats at machine speed.
When it comes to LinkedIn, we are also applying this new generation of AI to
transform how one billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We are -- introduced
new AI-driven features including the learning coach, as well as tools to help
employers ﬁnd qualiﬁed candidates and sellers and marketers to attract their buyers.
More broadly, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising. With Copilot, we are
reshaping daily search and web habits, and we look forward to continuing this
journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, web search.
Finally, in gaming, we are doubling down, rapidly executing on our ambition to be
the ﬁrst choice for people to play great games, whenever, wherever, and however
they want. We are thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King this fall,
and look forward to sharing more in the coming months about how together we will
bring the joy of gaming to more people around the world.
As we pursue our opportunity, we're also working to ensure that technology helps us
solve problems, not create new ones. To do this, we focus on four enduring
commitments that are central to our mission. First, we are expanding opportunity
grounded in our belief that access to economic growth and opportunity should
reach every person, organization, community, and country.
To accelerate positive impact with technology, people also need to be able to trust
the technologies they use and the companies behind them. For us, earning trust
spans responsible use of AI, protecting privacy, advanced digital safety, and
cybersecurity.
In an increasingly digital world, we also have the responsibility to protect people's
fundamental rights. This means upholding responsible business practices,
expanding connectivity and accessibility, advancing fair and inclusive societies, and
empowering communities.
Finally, climate change is the deﬁning issue of our generation and addressing it
requires rapid collective action and innovation. To advance sustainability, we are
committed to meeting our own goals while enabling others to do the same.
Our culture is the foundation on which our mission and strategy stand. All of us at
Microsoft will need to embrace a growth mindset and confront our ﬁxed mindset as
we pursue our opportunities and our responsibility. It'll take every day courage to
reformulate what innovation, business models, sales motions look like in this new
era.
To be successful, we'll need to be grounded in what our customers in the world
needs. We need to innovate and collaborate as one Microsoft. We need to activelyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

Questions And Answers
(Question And Answer)
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Welcome to the Q&A portion of the meeting. I'm Brett Iversen, Head of Investor
Relations at Microsoft. I'm joined by Satya, Amy and Brad Smith, Microsoft Vice Chair
and President.
We want to thank you for all the questions you submitted in advance. We'll try to get
to as many as we can. As we reviewed the submissions, there were several questions
on similar topics, so we selected a representative question from those submitted to
answer today.
Let's go ahead and get started. As you might expect this year, AI is top of mind, and
we received a number of questions on the subject. Satya and Amy, investors want to
know why we've decided to focus so much on AI and what our plan is to generate
revenue and growth. Satya, maybe we'll start with you.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Fantastic. Brett, for us as a tech company and a platform company, one of the ﬁrst
things you look for is what's the next big tech wave? And through my career, I've
seen many, whether it's the PC or client server or internet, mobile, cloud, of course.
And AI is this next big inﬂection point and a paradigm shift, which is both going to
be from an -- our investor perspective a massive TAM expansion for us. But from the
world's perspective, going to create great societal beneﬁt, right. Here we are at a
time where we are looking for what's that next big driver of productivity and
economic growth. We fundamentally believe that it's going to be AI.
And so for us, investing -- ﬁrst seeing it early and investing before it's conventional
wisdom is where all enterprise value gets created in tech. And that's what we've
done. And in fact, it's not just -- and it all happened last year, but we've been at work
on it for multiple years. And here we ﬁnd ourselves not just about AI, but the entiretyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

A - Brett Iversenof the tech stack. If you look at it, right, our infrastructure now is built for AI. That
means it's overall much more competitive for any workload. Same thing with data,
same thing with security, same thing with all of our applications and so on.
So the entire tech stack through AI has become much more diﬀerentiated. And that's
why we're investing and you'll see the revenue growth come in all of the customer
solution areas that we participate in, whether it's infrastructure or whether it's the
applications.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And in fact, already over the past couple of quarters, we've talked about the
percentage of our revenue in AI, that's been driven by AI across Azure, and we're
excited to be able to continue to share that growth across Microsoft 365 Copilot,
which really just went into general availability less than a month ago. And so I think
we'll see both that revenue growth, show across every product, and I think can
expect that to build as we head to the second half of our ﬁscal '24.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
And you all know this, but for the audience, we haven't had a single investor
conversation in calendar 2023 that didn't include AI, there's so much interest in it. So
staying on the topic of AI, Carolyn would like to know, what safeguards are in place
to protect against misuse of AI. Brad, could you talk about what we're doing to make
sure AI is developed and deployed responsibility?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Yeah. I think fundamentally, Brett, it's about innovation, moving forward together
with safety and a sense of responsibility. And I think it's something we've long been
keenly focused on at Microsoft. So from a safety or responsible AI perspective, we're
really now working hard on two things. One is continuing to evolve and mature our
own internal practices. And the second is to work with governments on what will
emerge quickly, I think, as a new set of laws and regulations.
Inside the company, we've had for six years a set of principles, six principles to guide
our AI development. We've implemented that in terms of policies. We train
engineers. We have tools. We have systems. Even before something is deployed, it's
reviewed. We look at the training data that's been used. We look at the ﬁlters around
it. We basically have developed an entire AI safety architecture that goes with each
of our applications.
And at the same time, we recognize that in most markets, the public wants to know
that it's relying not only on companies that are responsible, but a legal framework
that, frankly, ensures that every business adheres to some common standards. And
you're seeing that happen quickly in the United States, in Europe, in China, all
around the world, and we're very much engaged in those conversations as well.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 20 of 25A - Satya Nadella
A - Amy HoodYeah. Incredibly important. Thank you for that. Continuing on, investors asked about
how we approach our full AI portfolio? And how we balance working with partners
like OpenAI and our own innovation? Satya, why don't you take the innovation piece,
and then, Amy, you could talk about the OpenAI partnership from a business
perspective.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, a couple of things. One is, again, I always describe Microsoft as a
platform company and a partner company. I've grown up in a company that -- for
example, the PC wouldn't have existed if it was not for the partnership between
Microsoft and Intel. We built our database business, which -- SQL Server with
partnership with SAP.
So in some sense, I'm very grounded in -- again, the enterprise value we can create,
the innovation we can create, and the competition we can bring to the marketplace
by partnering well, and that's something we take seriously. And so the OpenAI
partnership has really been very, very fruitful, where we now have a leading frontier
model that's available on our cloud. We are using it in our applications, but it's not
just for us. It's like every application developer can beneﬁt from this partnership. So
that's sort of what we are doing.
But in parallel, we're building all sorts of other things that are, state of the art. When I
look at what we are doing with small language models with Phi, that's pretty
phenomenal work coming out of Microsoft Research. We're also doing things like
MatterGen for material generation and discovery, or Graphormer for molecular
modeling, so we have many, many capabilities ourselves.
And by the way, we have all the open-source models on Azure as well, and models
as it's Mistral or Llama or Cohere. And so the approach we are always going to take
is a broad tent approach as a platform company. We're going to have deep
partnerships, and at the end of the day, it's going to be about innovation that's
going to make a real diﬀerence to our customers and partners.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And I think maybe just to extend a little bit, not just OpenAI, where we do have a
partnership that we've had dating back to I think maybe 2018, and so we've been
working together for a long time, and I think with all of that, it helps us to push each
other to always be better and innovate at a fast pace.
But I would also say, we're working with lots of other companies and partners in the
AI space, enabling us really to have the broadest portfolio of models available. To
Satya's point, we want developers to be able to come to our platform and be able to
experience the best that the partners of the world have to oﬀer. And I think that's
one of the principles we have. And I think it's terriﬁc for developers -- for companies
of all sizes to be able to come to us and have the conﬁdence that they're going to
the platform that always has the most innovative choices.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

A - Brett Iversen
A - Brad Smith{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yeah, that's right, Amy. And since it's an investor, Q&A, I think a lot of print and a lot
of talk about M&A on one side, and then obviously organic innovation on the other.
And these are appropriate. But the thing in the middle, I think also should be talked
about, which is partnering well. So companies that know how to partner well -- and
which is a win-win long-term stable. This is not about sort of taking advantage of
partners. That's not partnership, by the way. But if you really are really partnering well
and creating value for the partner and for the world, the investors also will be taken
care of.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yeah. It's an exciting space to be leading. It's -- Brad, we received a question about
developing technological skills in education, particularly in any inner cities or parts
of the world that may not easily have access to technology. What are we doing to
invest in building people's tech skills?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
It's an interesting question because I think in some ways it connects with our
fundamental mission which is to empower every person and every organization on
the planet. And we live in a world where I'll say the free market reaches most, but not
every person around the world or even in a country. And so we have a part of our
business, a part of our activities that are say less commercial or even non-commercial
in nature. And fundamentally, they provide a force multiplier.
What we're talking about as the question asked is skills, technological skills. So we
create skilling programs, we create skilling curriculum. The good news is in the world
today you can create something and make it available digitally for free. But you need
force multipliers to get that content and the support needed to help people use it
into the hands of people themselves.
So fundamentally there's three groups we work with. The ﬁrst is teachers in schools.
We have a skilling program that reaches directly into schools across this country and
many other countries. And that enables us to reach, say kids, including in inner cities.
The second is international government organizations, especially parts of the United
Nations. You take an organization like UNICEF. It works with kids around the world.
Partnering with UNICEF we've reached more than 5 million kids around the world.
And the ultimate force multiplier in the world is really non-proﬁts and the volunteers
who spend and dedicate time helping nonproﬁts succeed.
We have roughly 350,000 nonproﬁts running in the Microsoft Cloud. This uses a
diﬀerent business model than the rest of our business. Amy has to sign oﬀ on it every
year. We reinvest a share of the proﬁts in more support for nonproﬁts. And I think
what's extraordinary there is through those kinds of skilling programs, we've reached
80 million people.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 22 of 25A - Brett Iversen
A - Satya Nadella
A - Brett Iversen
A - Brad SmithSo these are all important things that continue to grow, especially as our services
grow, we develop more skilling programs. And right now, the big priority, as you
would expect, is how we provide AI skilling programs to reach more people.
You take Satya's concept of partnership, we're partnering with more groups, and
you'll see more coming from us even next week in terms of some important new
partnerships that will really focus on bringing AI skills to more people.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
It's great to hear about a reach on this topic. Thank you for that. Jacob asks about the
health and future of Xbox. Satya, could you give an update on our gaming business?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yeah. Obviously, we're very, very excited about everything that's going on in gaming,
especially with the close of Activision Blizzard King. We think that now we have the
ability to really do what we've always set out to do, which is build great games and
deliver them to folks across all platforms, right, which is Xbox and consoles, the PCs,
and now even including mobile gaming and cloud gaming. So we're excited about
the future. We want to do our very best work in gaming. It's a core business for us.
But also, I see tremendous synergy between what we're doing up and down the AI
stack. I always say Microsoft's not a conglomerate. We have one platform that we
express through multiple diﬀerent addressable markets, and gaming is one. So when
I think about AI, what we're doing at the infrastructure layer or what we will do at the
Edge, it's sort of the same set of transistors that ﬁrst were reused for graphics, guess
what, are being used for AI. So you can connect the dots and see why gaming is
going to be more strategic to us.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yeah. It's a fun time with the deal closing and getting that reach out there. Brad, we
received a question about the privacy implications of our use of telemetry data. Can
you talk about our privacy commitments for customers using Microsoft products,
both for work and at home?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Sure. I think there's two things really to think about. The ﬁrst is, why do we have
telemetry data in the ﬁrst place? And the second is how we protect people's privacy.
Telemetry data is fundamentally the data that comes back to Microsoft in our data
centers when people are using one of our devices or services, and we use it
fundamentally to manage the service to provide people with what they need. We use
it to protect their security. And I think that's just become something enormously
important. And we do use it so we can learn and improve our products. So those are
the three reasons we have telemetry data in the ﬁrst place.
And especially in a world where there are more cybersecurity risks, to have devices
and services that are managed is really indispensable to our ability to protect peopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 23 of 25A - Brett Iversen
A - Brad Smithfrom cyberattacks. At the same time, it has to go hand-in-hand with our privacy
commitments. Privacy law has become something that has become extraordinarily
complicated. And we do a lot of work to comply with laws around the world.
But fundamentally I think it's about advancing three goals. The ﬁrst is transparency,
so the people know what data is being collected and we provide that in our privacy
statements. The second is giving people choice, meaningful choice, so they can see
and determine what information they share. And the third is control, so that people
have control over what data is being provided and how it's used. And with that, we
have dashboards and the like, so people can see what information is there. They can
correct it if it's wrong. They can delete it if they don't want us to use it.
And I think having these two things go hand in hand in the future is really important
for the future overall of technology. We need to have these connected services to
give people the beneﬁts they need and the protection they need at the same time,
and we need to continue to evolve privacy with it.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Thanks Brad. Several investors wrote to urge Microsoft to keep political ideology out
of business decisions. Brad, particularly in a time of such political divisions here in
the U.S., can you talk about how we come decisions on policy positions we take?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Yeah. This is something that the three of us certainly think about and talk together
about. And I would say we're acutely aware of the fact that leading a company is not
a license to use the company's name or platform to talk about whatever we want.
Everybody has lots of opinions in life. There's really a small set of opinions that I think
it's appropriate for a business to speak about.
And the good news is I think we've had a common set of principles for over a
decade that has served Microsoft very well. The ﬁrst principle, in a way it's the most
important, is we speak out publicly on public policy issues that impact our customers
and their use of our services. We have, I think, a fundamental responsibility to serve
and protect our customers. So if there's a public policy issue that relates to cyber
security or privacy or protection of children, digital safety, responsible AI, we will
lean in and we'll speak out because we think it's important that public policy protect
us and our customers together.
The second thing we focus on is the protection of employees. We need to be able to
recruit and we need to be able to retain people. We need to create a healthy
working environment and a healthy living environment for them. So we'll address
those issues as well.
And the third is other business interests. Think of these as shareholder interests. It
may be tax policy. It may be trade policy. They are typically the issues that
fundamentally impact the company's ability to do business locally, nationally, and
around the world. And if an issue doesn't touch upon one of those three, then weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

A - Amy Hoodmay say this is important, but it's not appropriate for Microsoft to speak out in the
company's name. And so we always use that same framework.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Thank you. Finally, we received a few questions about how we are optimizing our
infrastructure for this new era of AI. Satya, can you talk a bit about how we're working
with our partners to increase performance and eﬃciency for our customers?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, one of the -- the key --
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
This is near and dear to your heart.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
It is. Absolutely. I mean, having grown up, through my career at Microsoft in
infrastructure businesses, the key there, again, is to see the new workloads that are
the Tier 1 workloads that are the scale Tier 1 workloads early, and then optimize the
infrastructure around it. And so for us, if I look at it, we have, what, three, four years of
experience now of seeing these large synchronous parallel training workloads for
next-generation AI.
That's made a massive diﬀerence in how we think about everything from our data
center, the power draw, to the racks, to the silicon, to the network. In fact, every day I
meet with customers who look at -- compare us and other cloud providers when it
comes to training. They just see the diﬀerence. I mean, we lead on it by leaps and
bounds, and that's just because it didn't happen by accident. We saw it ﬁrst, and
then we optimized the infrastructure for training.
In fact, what were great assumptions to make just two years ago or three years ago
by other cloud providers have now become liabilities, whereas for us they've
become advantages. Similarly, same thing with inference. We have one endpoint.
We have at scale the Azure, OpenAI is being used for inference, so we can even
optimize beneath that endpoint. So when we introduced even new silicon like Maya,
guess what, we already deployed it underneath GitHub Copilot because we can take
the entirety of the stack and optimize it and then not even have it show up for our
customers as anything that they have to change.
So there's lots of levers we are exercising. The beauty of the infrastructure business
is, if you see things early and then you scale your know-how across and then keep
going, then you have some great advantages to start a new paradigm.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
