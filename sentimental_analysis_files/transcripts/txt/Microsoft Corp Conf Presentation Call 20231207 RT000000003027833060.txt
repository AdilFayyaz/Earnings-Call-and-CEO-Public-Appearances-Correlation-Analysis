Hey. Welcome to our next session. I'm really happy, Rajesh. And the one thing when
you have a speaker from Microsoft is always like, you're such a big organization,
right? And it's a positive thing. You're always like, well done, and it's amazing.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
It's a positive thing if big elephants can dance.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Maybe to get everyone on the same page, talk a little bit about yourself and
your role in Microsoft.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah. I lead the Experience & Devices in Microsoft. So that would have Microsoft 365
Oﬃce and Teams, Windows and Surface, and then also our search and our browser
eﬀorts.

(Question And Answer)
And so if you think about the last 12 months, it's been like a crazy journey in terms of
new innovation, et cetera, like that. Can you talk a little bit like how did you
experience, like how was these last 12 months for you guys -- for you like kind of
funding it as well?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

A - Rajesh Jha{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, ﬁrst of all, let me just say, as you all know, I mean the last 12 months
have been as exciting a time as any.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
I've been at Microsoft a long time. I came when it was graphical user interfaces, and
we thought that was a big deal, internet, mobile. I mean, this last 12 months, I actually
think generative AI is as big a technology shift, if not bigger than any or all of them
put together. And so for us, in the last 12 months, we got a lot done. When I reﬂect
back, so GPT4 has now been out for -- in production for about in the year. So we -- in
Jan, we had APIs and Azure for that with all the safety and trust that our enterprise
customers expect.
In February, we took the large model, we put that in our SocialNet browser, because
we do think this represented a new way for people to ﬁnd information to reason over
stuﬀ.
In March, we took a step back and we thought about, what about productivity? How
would these generative AI, the power of these things aﬀect or impact the way work is
done? So in June, we brought a private preview of that for a lot of our enterprise
customers. And it's been great to be with them on this journey. November, we
launched the Microsoft 365 Copilot.
But when I reﬂect back, of course, GitHub Copilot was the ﬁrst one that we went after
because it was very clear that we could help the developers be incredibly
productive. So we had that. In the last few months, we've also taken a look at how
business processes and business workﬂows can be re-taught in the world of
generative AI, where you take systems of engagement and you take natural
language and natural language interface and how you bring whether it be a
Salesforce's workﬂows, a service provider's workﬂows, whether it be a doctor's
workﬂows with the Copilot and those things. We've thought about how to extend the
Copilot to allow customers and developers to extend these copilots with speciﬁc
information.
So a lot's happened, and the thing I'll just tell you is a lot of this technology shift also
intersected with the work that we've been doing anyway on Microsoft 365, post-
COVID. We've spent a lot of -- we saw a lot of customer engagement intensity in that
populated what we call the Microsoft Graph, which represents the customer's most
important database, I think, which is the projects, who knows what, in terms of
knowledge, people's calendar, email documents, the right permissioning. So this is
where the generative AI reasoning engine meets the Microsoft Graph to provide
generative AI in the ﬂow of work.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
And you guys must be thinking a little bit more ahead. Like -- and I just wanted to ask
like slightly more bigger picture, like, the thing now, generative AI, what it can do
and you have more insight than us. Like, how does it -- how would you think the way
we work will change over time, like going forward? Is there like a glimpse that you
can give us here?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, look, I'm not a soothsayer on this stuﬀ, but let me just share what we are
already seeing with customers.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
So when we did the early adopter program in June with the Microsoft 365 Copilot,
we had many hundreds of customers jump on the opportunity because they see the
same thing. And 100 to 200 of those, we went really deep. They invited Microsoft to
go deep with them and analyze the impact on productivity. So we looked at three
dimensions of productivity. One is eﬃciency, just how quickly can you get the job
done or how much more can you go do. But if we balance that by taking a look at
both quality of work, so it's not just enough if AI assists in doing something quickly, I
mean, what is the quality of the output in terms of accuracy, in terms of up-level and
the skip-level.
And the third thing I looked at was eﬀort. How much eﬀort, how much grind did we
take out? And the results have been really impressive. And we are going to publish
all of this in the Work Trend Index I think in the coming days. But about 68% or 72%
of people felt it made them more eﬃcient. It improved the quality of work. They felt
they had to put less eﬀort in, so they had more time to do what is innately human,
which is more creative, more reﬂective work, more collaboration. And 70% of them
would say, of course, the Copilot makes me more or the generative AI makes me
more productive. But what's also telling is that more than 55% of people feel that AI
makes them more creative. This is today and here and now.
Now you ask the question, how do I see this move forward? I think workﬂows are
going to have to be re-imagined. So today what it does is the Copilot or AI helps you
in your existing workﬂows. But when a lot of the grinding -- and let me just take a
step back in the Copilot, our vision of the Copilot is not an autopilot. It works on your
agency, it works with your permissions, it works with your context. So today, it's
helping you in your existing workﬂows. So because it's helping everyone, how can
entire group's workﬂows change and be reimagined? And we are starting to see that
both in my team and with customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

A - Rajesh Jha{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Just one -- I want to leave you with one thought. So far AI, prior to generative AI, it
was as if the human beings did all the work, and the AI was the editor. It would show
up in auto-complete, grammar checks, spell checks. But now, it's ﬂipped. The AI is
doing the work. They're doing the ﬁrst draft. They're doing the summarization. And
the human beings are now editors. So we've gone from AI being editors to now
where it should be, which is the human beings are the editors and the AI is the
assistant.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
And Rajesh, do you have any -- like on that reimagining workﬂows, et cetera, do you
have like -- do you have examples to make it slightly more comfortable for us? Like, I
hear you, but I don't hear you, you know what I mean.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah, yeah. It's -- so let me give you just a couple of examples, maybe one -- a
couple of customer examples, maybe one from my own team. So one of the
customers, what they did was -- so when people started using the Copilot, the ﬁrst
thing they tried to ﬁgure out, hey, how should we go do this? They asked us, should I
distribute a few seats to this across diﬀerent departments or should we go all in, in
one department? Then our -- based on our work with them, we tell them, go in into
one function because we ﬁnd taking a peer group and giving them all Copilot helps
reimagine the workﬂow.
So this customer, what they did was they gave it to their service department. And
they're an operational company. And so they had very complicated processes for
long running incidents because hundreds of people -- these incidents would be day
long. This was a core of what the company does. And then they had very
complicated overhead of how -- when people work four-hour shift on the incident
and the next crew came in, who was going to transfer the knowledge, how were they
going to come up to speed and so on.
So they re-imagined this -- re-imagined the entire workﬂow in the context of Copilot
in the meeting. So when a new person would come in, the Copilot would just
summarize. They could just be in, "Hey, can you summarize what happened in the
last six months? Which ones apply to this speciﬁc function?" So they were able to get
rid of a lot of the manual overhead, the human overhead of transferring knowledge
between shifts and so on. That was an example of just reimagining the workﬂow.
We have another drug research company where there's a corpus of a lot of data
around this clinical trials and drug research, but that's in a diﬀerent system. And so --
but what they did was they extended the Copilot. So in the Copilot, people could
summarize quickly when they came in, what were the latest ﬁndings from the lastFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Rajesh Jhaweek from their colleagues in the context of all the emails that have come in around
that, all the chats, the documents, plus what's the message in the record.
In my own team, we saw this super interesting thing. If a product manager wants to
go incubate an idea, the process used to be, he or she would come up with an idea
in the product management team, she'd go lobby for some resources in the
engineering team and design team so they could co-incubate. But now, she just uses
the copilot. So this product manager early in career, she had this incubation idea,
she just used the Copilot to generate, but she doesn't know coding. She's not the
designer. She had an idea. She used the Copilot to create a perfectly workable,
mobile app to incubate a bunch of stuﬀ. Got to try a lot of diﬀerent things, and then,
once the idea was just stated, she brought it up to the core teams to actually then go
and implement it. And so this has saved, in that speciﬁc scenario, months of just time
of coordinating people. So I think what you will see is workﬂows are going to have to
reimagine, in addition to augmenting the human ingenuity and creativity and taking
the grind out.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. And then -- and maybe I should have started actually, if you think about the
Copilot and the productivity gains. And you started on GitHub on the Copilot side.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
And now we have like, the ﬁrst guys using it on the oﬃce side. Like what are you
seeing in terms of productivity gains and seeing just to work behavior coming out of
that one?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
So GitHub, it's the -- the ﬁrst thing, the GitHub Copilot in many ways have blazed the
trail for us in the design language. So we spent a lot of time about how does -- how
should the AI get instantiated for teams and users in organizations. I mean, it's no
secret that the AI can get some things wrong. Now, of course, when you ground it in
your information to a RAG pattern or what have you, then you're using it as a
reasoning engine, not a fact engine.
But what the GitHub Copilot taught us was a design language of it being a copilot,
not an autopilot. It is working on your behalf of making sure that humans were in the
loop to actually accept the changes or to commit the actions. And then when we saw
the GitHub Copilot land up to 50%, 55% eﬃciency for developers, the other thing
that we did was we created the Copilot stack.
What I mean by the Copilot stack is, so if you take a look at Microsoft 365 Copilot, it's
not just a largest model, the most capable model. It's the fact that, that model is
grounded with the Microsoft Graph with all your permissions and it's then broughtFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Rajesh Jhainto a Copilot design language and user experiences that you use. So -- and then
they need to be extensible. So this entire thing is what we call the Copilot stack. So
all the copilots in Microsoft have been built with the same orchestration, same
extensibility, same design language. And we've made this thing available as an
Azure service, whether it be Azure AI Studio or for low-code, no-code with the
Copilot Studio. So I think in many ways, the GitHub Copilot is blazer trail for us into
this one design language.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
And then what are you seeing in terms of the customers that have been working with
the copilots and adoption curves there? And I'm telling you where I'm coming from,
it's like, look, if the productivity gains, we're hearing is somewhere like 20%, 30%,
like 50%. And the people that are working with it are kind of more developers,
white-collar workers, they're expensive. So here you think like, hang on, like
everyone should be rushing out, getting this. Like what are things on their adoption
that we should consider there and like the do you kind of experience so far?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. So, great question. So, it's clear that for the end user, whether it's in the context
of creation, summarization, ﬁrst draft, all of this, the payoﬀ, I mean, this is what we -- I
was just talking about and what are you going to see in the Work Trend Index,
beneﬁts of 50%, 60%, 70%, in terms of meeting, summarization, follow-up tasks
about 80% to 85%. So, it's clear value for the end user.
For now, let's talk the IT admin in enterprises. They're also responsible for security,
regulations, compliance, and so on. So one of the things that we've done with the
Microsoft 365 Copilot is actually built it to be enterprise-grade. What I mean by that
is it understands things like additional access. If IT had a policy in place, which is if
Raimo is outside of this zip code and tries to access code for data, for what do not
allow that access (inaudible) challenges the authentication, the Copilot understands
those policies.
So things like all interactions with the Copilot are discoverable for regulatory reasons
or it generates an audit log. So we've done that work. But IT still has to go through
the validation process for these things. So one of the pieces of feedback we got from
IT early was, hey, we love the notion of Copilot helping in meetings, but we don't
want to create a data retention policy where transcripts have to be retained to
enable the Copilot. So we did the work so you could now get the Copilot to perform
in a meeting without creating a transcript that lasts be on the meeting.
So there is a bunch of IT evaluation and adoption, but we have an adoption guided
Microsoft Adoption, microsoft.com for IT, for those reasons. The other one that we
hear from customers is, how do I know the ROI? So we built a Copilot dashboard. So
they can actually go take a look at the impact of the Copilot. They can join that with
their custom data. So you can bring your HR's custom data, you can bring your sales
performance custom data and join that with the Copilot data and see what the ROI
is. So we've gone and built that too.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

Q - Raimo LenschowAnd then for the end users, we are having to really teach them a new way to do
computing. All of us have grown up keyboard, mouse, white gestures and so on. We
are now using prompts. What is a good prompt as a sales person? What's a good
prompt in this organization, in the manufacturing context? So we have that now in
the Copilot Labs. And the end of the day, the Copilot is going to go through a bit of
the adoption cycle of any enterprise because you got to work through risks, you got
to work through compliance and procurement and make sure there is auto like. But
the time to value for the Copilot, I feel, unlike anything that I've done in the
enterprise space in the last 20 years, is much, much, much faster, think of the
Microsoft Graph already exists, it's built to be enterprise-grade, and it shows up in
the ﬂow of work.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Was that like -- and you mentioned the Microsoft Graph a lot, and actually, I think on
our side, we pay not enough attention to that. Was that before and you just got lucky
or like how did it play out?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Actually, it's super -- both, I would say. So, here's what happened. If you go back to
the Oﬃce business, the Oﬃce business, when we were on premises, was a bunch of
silos. So we didn't understand the user well. We understood the jobs. So with
Exchange and Outlook, we understood the mail and calendar and job. With
SharePoint and Oﬃce, we understood what document management was. With Link
at that time, we understood meetings and tele thing. But they were all stuﬀed pipes.
When we moved to the cloud, we really got to be user-centered. That's what the
Microsoft Graph is. We then -- and the reason we were stuﬀed pipes on-premises
was no customer could deploy all our products at the same time. So every silo had
to be standalone and be able to exist, even if the other pure silos were diﬀerent
versions. So in the cloud, now we had one data structure of customers. We were
doing the job, keeping it up-to-date. So that's what allowed the Graph to get
created. Then what COVID did was it accelerated the use of Microsoft 365, with a lot
of intensity. The more you use Microsoft 365, the better your Graph is.
Now after COVID, what we have now is tons of customers deeply immersed in
Microsoft 365. The Graph is healthy, it is permissioned. And now you get generative
AI, you take the Graph, you ground the generative AI into the Graph context.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
And you say, bring it to the user experiences that people are using today, and that's
what the Microsoft Copilot is. And that's the diﬀerentiation of the Microsoft Copilot.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 12A - Rajesh Jha
Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Rajesh JhaYeah. And I wanted to shift gear a little bit. Like, what does it mean on the way how
you do compute? Like, ﬁrst, fundamentally, but then also, how do you do it in
Microsoft at the moment, because you have so much demand on your side, on the
Copilot, et cetera. But then you have all the external demand on Azure. So, like,
who's getting the GPU?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, ﬁrst of all, I mean, look, this GPT-4 was built on Azure, and we've been
optimizing all layers of the stack for over an year now. That being said, to answer
your question, you should think of it a couple of ways. Of course, the customer, when
you come to Azure, you can use not just the Frontier models from OpenAI, but you
can use models from Hugging Face from Meta. We now have model as a service that
we've announced where you can use Mistral's premium models, Coherence model,
J's model. So you can use lots of models.
But for the large model that we use in our ﬁrst party applications in Azure OpenAI
API, we've done the work to leverage one implementation and one stack. So it's not
that-- so I can optimize the usage of the GPUs across Bing, and Windows, and Oﬃce
and Dynamics in the Azure OpenAI because we all use the same APIs.
And if the third party is using our APIs, you can -- you come and bring your own
model. You can use the plethora of model. But if you use the large model, we are
getting the leverage of the fact that we are all using the same API, same endpoint.
And then, of course, underneath the cover, we are more clearly with close
partnership with NVIDIA, but of course AMD, and we have our own AI-ﬁrst silicon
that we are bringing to the picture.
So you should think about below the waterline on the systems-level work we've
been optimizing for a long time for an year. We have silicon-level work. And then
above the waterline, when you are hitting the large model, we get to optimize the
traﬃc across all our ﬁrst parties, and anybody using the Azure OpenAI API.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Okay. Excellent. And then, I have Investor Relations getting a little bit nervous now,
but I tried to ask like a number -- not a numbers question, but like more a monetary
question. If you think about, you're creating with AI a lot of value for the client. But if
you look at your pricing, it's still like, if you look at the $30 per user, it's still like a very
classic model of like, here's a price, I think it was like with GitHub Copilot, it was like
$9. I tell you, I talk to customers and they're like, that's a steal because 20%
productivity gains and I'm paying $9 for a guy that costs me $150 and I'm getting
20% more out of him, like, give it to me. How do you think about that dynamic going
forward? Like, do you have to rethink or re-imagine that?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Well, I mean, let me just say, early days, yes. The thing that we believe is, take a look
at Oﬃce. Before Oﬃce existed, Word was a business application, Excel was a
business application. And what we did was we said, now, we want to democratizeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Rajesh Jha
Q - Raimo Lenschow
A - Rajesh Jha
Q - Raimo Lenschowthis for all the users. And so Microsoft Copilot, GitHub Copilot is about
democratization of AI for all the users. So we, basically, said, "Hey, we want to take
the core capabilities and what used to be productivity, now AI enhance productivity. I
want to take that to all the users."
Just like we've done with Oﬃce. In addition to the per user, we have lots of other
constructs that we have on top, whether it be E5 construct, whether it be Teams
Premium construct. So right now, really the way we are thinking about AI is let's bring
it to every information worker, every ﬁrst line worker, and get to enhance the
productivity and then I'm sure there will be lots of opportunities for us to add value
and capture value.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yeah. And since you're kind of working on the Experience side for Microsoft, how will
I need to reimagine my UI going forward? Because the classic way, like a good
generative AI system should be more interactive, like what's the work that you're
doing here?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Super good question. For 35 years, computing hasn't changed in terms of the way,
you're on a phone, you swipe. On a PC, or you use a keyboard and mouse, and the
operating system does a very basic job of abstracting away the hardware and
allowing you to get to an application.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
That's going to change. And so the way you'll see us integrate the Copilot, for
example, in Windows, and we think that the lines between the shell, search, browser,
Copilot is going to blur. Because you enable something that understands your intent
at a higher level with natural language. It can take a lot of the grunge out for you.
The application relationship to the operating system, to the copilot, is going to
evolve rapidly, and you'll start to see us do the stuﬀ by bringing the Copilot into
Windows. It's going to be very exciting, but I do think it's a new paradigm for user
experiences.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yeah. And that kind of gets me to the other questions around devices. Like you guys
were always very good of showing your partners what's possible. Like -- and actually,
I remember when your Surface came out, I bought it, I loved it, and it was like, oh,
this is cool, and then you kind of -- in a way, you almost forced innovation on your
partner side. This, in a way -- this, in a way, like you need to kind of almost reimagine
devices, et cetera. I mean, not that you're announcing something with me here now,
but where are you in that thinking?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-12-07

I do think this natural use -- this natural user interface, and these are multimodal, by
the way, this isn't just natural language, but speech and video and all of that stuﬀ. I
do think our existing hardware form factors are going to evolve to accommodate
this. And there will be new form factors.

Yeah. Let's leave it like that.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Let's leave it like that. Yeah.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
I tried. Yeah. Okay. The other thing is like, switching -- shifting gears a little bit back to
kind of adoption -- client adoption that we see on the Copilot side, like what's your
thinking in terms of the speed of adoption you can support with a given shortage of
GPUs, like how do you see that playing out? Do you give like some to every client --
like a limited amount to every client? Is it like one client gets a lot, so you learn a lot
more? How do you think that, that will play out in the ﬁeld?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yeah. Open for business now with customers on Copilot. It's really like the earlier
conversation I was having with, where the customers are going through their
evaluation of the security policies, governance, procurement, and so on. I feel
conﬁdent in our ability to optimize across all our ﬁrst-party usage and third-party
usage. And we have been at this for a while. We know how to go optimize capacity.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Okay. Yeah. So there wouldn't be like -- so if Barclays says, like we are -- I think we're
a big Teams shop for you guys. If we say we want Copilot for everyone, it's not going
to be like, no, you could, in theory.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean -- and the last question for me is like, how do I think about
you guys working as partners? Because, one is like a very Microsoft-centric view, but
on the other hand, like, it's not just you, there's like a whole broader world out there.
Like, how are you seeing that evolving for you guys in terms of working with our
people, bringing other people into the equation going forward?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Super good question. I mean -- and again, back from the days that Bill used to run
the company, I mean I remember being in the meetings with him, he would take
incredible pride that for every dollar that Microsoft would create, we would create $3
through the ecosystem. So, we are really a platform company, and not just at the
Azure layer, but even at the M365 layer.
And so already with Teams, we have more than 2,000 ISVs and countless other line-
of-business applications that extend Teams. And you will see the platform sensibility,
I talked about it in Build and in Ignite and in this coming year Build, we'll talk about
how developers, both line-of-business developers inside of organizations as well as
ISVs can augment the Copilot with their custom logic and their inner activity,
because now all -- productivity is still human in all its various forms. We're not going
to build all the most interesting applications.
And so, we want the Copilot -- Microsoft 365 Copilot is a platform and that is, we are
