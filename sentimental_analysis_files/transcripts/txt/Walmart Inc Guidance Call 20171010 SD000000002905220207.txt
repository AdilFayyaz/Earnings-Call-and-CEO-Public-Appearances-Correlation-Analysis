Presentation
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, everybody. It's about settled now. So good morning. Welcome
to Walmart's 2017 Meeting for the Investment Community. My name is Steve Schmitt.
I lead the Investor Relations team here at Walmart. In behalf of the company, I'd like
to welcome you all to Northwest, Arkansas and Walmart's campuses here. I'd also
like to welcome everyone listening in on our webcast today. We appreciate your
interest in Walmart. And we look forward to sharing our strategies with you today.
So today's meeting is being webcast. It's available on our website at
stock.walmart.com. And the presentations will be posted to the website as they're
completed today.
Today's presentation will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to
future events and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to diﬀer materially
from these statements. Please reference our entire safe harbor statement on our
website at stock.walmart.com as well as any non-GAAP reconciliations.
Now hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release we issued this
morning. I'll take a minute to cover some of the key messages.
First, we reconﬁrmed our ﬁscal year 2018 adjusted EPS outlook of $4.30 to $4.40.
Second, we expect next year, or ﬁscal year 2019, EPS to increase approximately 5%
from this year's adjusted EPS. And third, the Board of Directors authorized a new $20
billion share repurchase authorization, which will replace the current program.
So let's turn to the agenda. So Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO will
kick things oﬀ in just a minute to talk about our global strategy. Brett Biggs, CFO, will
review our ﬁnancial outlook. Marc Lore, our head of e-commerce, is going to give
you an update on our e-commerce progress as well as our strategies in e-comm.
We'll take a short break. Once we get back, we'll go through the segment CEO
presentations. We'll start oﬀ with John Furner in Sam's Club. Dave Cheesewright will
take you through our international strategies. And Greg Foran will bring us home
with Walmart U.S. We'll take another break after that. We'll come back. And you'll
have a Q&A session with Doug and all of the presenters. At that point, probably
around noon, 12:15-ish, we'll end our webcasts and our formal presentation. Then
we'll have lunch. And we'll have another hour or so of interaction with the
management team before you guys head out.
So we're excited to be here. We thank you for your interest in new Walmart. Let's get
going.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

,
Good morning. We're excited that you guys are here. Thanks for making the trip to
come down. I hope you found the store visits yesterday productive. Today, we're
going to share some information about why we're excited about our future, talk
about our plan to win and give you some updates on the progress that we're
making.
First, I want to stop and thank the Walmart leadership team. We have a strong set of
leaders. And not only are they driving change, they're just making a lot happen,
period, around the world. And I want to thank them, I want to thank all of the
associates that we have in Walmart for doing a great job.
We're reconﬁrming our guidance next year because we see signs of the productivity
loops starting to turn, giving us conﬁdence that we'll deliver about 5% EPS growth
next year. We're committed to cost reductions. And we think the timing is right to act
on costs in a more aggressive way. We believe we can do so without harming the
momentum we're driving on the top line. We have strong cash ﬂow. And that
ﬁnancial strength gives us the ﬂexibility we need to navigate this period of signiﬁcant
change. We believe we're striking the right and healthy balance between the short
term and the long term.
So the headlines for today are that we have a plan that plays to our unique strengths.
It's resulting in momentum. We're acting faster as a company. And we're being
disciplined about costs and capital as we go. No doubt we are in a transformational
period of history. Business is transforming. And Walmart is transforming, too.
Creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. Our future looks more digital. We
use technology to serve customers more eﬀectively and eﬃciently. We use
technology to equip and empower our associates.
To prepare for a larger transformation, we started by taking steps to strengthen our
foundation. We committed that our investments in our people and in our stores
would lead to a stronger positioning for the company. And we believe there's
evidence of that happening. We're setting our associates up for success with better
information, tools and training. We're improving the store experience. We're
lowering prices. We're reducing excess inventory. We're improving our e-commerce
oﬀering. And growth has accelerated. We're setting priorities, including divesting
some noncore assets. We're building on this stronger foundation with innovation.
And you can see that we're doing it with more speed. We've been aggressive with
Online Grocery expansion in the U.S., building on our international experience.
We've been experimenting with delivery in the U.S. We created a digital payment
platform in the form of Walmart Pay. And we're trying things like automated towers
to speed the in-store pickup experience. We're digitizing the checkout experience
with Scan & Go. We're making acquisitions to improve our online assortment. We'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 66digitizing experiences in-store, including our pharmacy area. We're learning how to
reward customers for behavior that helps us lower costs and save them money.
Picking things up at store level for a discount is one example. We're expanding our
delivery capabilities in China and other markets. We're enabling easy reorder online.
And we're learning to partner with others in new ways. We've always enjoyed
creating lasting win-win relationships. And that hasn't changed. The common thread
in this innovation story is around the customer experience, especially convenience.
We've made progress on value. Our prices are lower. On assortment, we have even
more choice. And we're focused on saving customers' time and making it easier to
shop with us.
So let's go deep and talk about our strategy. The strongest strategies are built on
unique strengths and assets. And we have many. But some of you may be asking,
"How relevant are they for the future?" We think that depends on how customers will
want to shop and be served in the future. So let's start with that.
We think the future is a combination of digital and physical retail. Customers are
shopping in-store, online, with apps and mobile, a little with their voice and in time,
with AR and VR and whatever comes after that. And they'll do so seamlessly. There
are times when it's easier to sit on the couch and order an item for delivery to your
house. There are times when it's most helpful to order the weekly grocery trip on our
app and pick it up after school without having to get the kids out of the minivan. And
there are times when it's helpful to be in a store and be reminded of what we need
or be pleasantly surprised by something we didn't expect. The same person will
shop in diﬀerent ways without thinking about channels. It's all just shopping at
Walmart.
What makes us think this is how people will shop? We shared our sweet spot with
you a couple of years ago. And what we shared then is still true now. U.S. customers
that shop us in-store and online spend nearly twice as much, almost 2x, as customers
that only shop with us in stores. And when customers that only shop in our stores
become walmart.com customers, they spend more in stores. Their loyalty to Walmart
strengthens overall. And for customers that shop in-store only and begin to use
Online Grocery, they spend more with us in total after becoming an Online Grocery
customer. It's a sweet spot for us. But it's also a sweet spot for our customers.
Let's use the U.S. retail market as a way to explain it. But please note that a lot of
what we're discussing is also true outside the U.S. The U.S. retail market, according to
Forrester, is forecast to be around $3.5 trillion this year for the categories we sell,
which would be 3.8% growth. Their estimates are that brick-and-mortar sales will
make up $3.1 trillion, which will be a little more than 2% growth. And e-commerce at
approximately $450 billion would grow 14%.
Let's click down another level. Look at how big grocery is in each case. Now this is
Forrester's deﬁnition of grocery. And it doesn't include the consumables category,
categories like paper goods that we normally group in our food and consumables
numbers that we share with you in our releases. But the point is the same: Grocery is
underdeveloped in e-commerce relative to stores. Why? Well to grow a national e-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 66commerce food business, it takes a few ingredients. You have to be able to keep
perishable products fresh, available and at the right price. To do that, you need a
perishable supply chain that supports stores that are near customers and great store
associates to run them. To deliver value across a wide basket of goods, it's also
helpful to sell a lot of general merchandise and apparel to help with the margin mix.
It also helps to have a lot of scale because volume helps reduce markdowns and
throwaways, which helps us sell at a lower price. Looking ahead, the combination of
store volume, pickup volume and delivery is key. You need all 3 to achieve max scale.
Let me show you the same thing another way. Let's take a look at e-commerce
penetration by category in the U.S. This shows how e-commerce has grown its share
by category over the last decade. Now we care about all of these categories. But let
me draw your attention to the bottom of this chart, where fresh food, dry grocery
and consumables like health and beauty aids, paper goods and household cleaning
are. Again, let's start with the customer view of all this. They purchase these items in
baskets, not one at a time and eaches because it saves them time. Customers buy
these items frequently. And they care about prices. From our point of view, we can
move these categories more eﬃciently in bulk. Think truckloads, pallets and cases.
And those same assets that I talked about earlier, stores, DCs, people and scale, help
us serve customers with fresher product and lower prices. We can serve them with
stores or with pickup because we can pick from stores like they're a DC. And we're
learning how to do that more eﬃciently. Remember, we've done it in the U.K. for a
long time now. And we do it not only in the U.S. but in China, Japan, Canada and
several Latin American markets. As we learn how to pick eﬃciently from stores, we
can deliver from stores to homes, either with our own associates, as we do in the
U.K., or through third parties like New Dada in China, Uber or Deliv here in the U.S.
The gig economy will play a role in delivery. Most likely, it's some combination of our
own associates, third-parties and platforms with contractors that enable delivery for
us in the future. So you can see the sequencing. It starts with great stores supported
by an eﬃcient supply chain. And then we layer on an e-commerce food business. We
learn to pick in stores, enabling pickup, which enables delivery. We can then deliver
for a fee that covers our cost, which almost certainly falls over time. We use the
nearly 4,000 supercenters and discount stores, over 700 Neighborhood Markets
and 660 Sam's Clubs in the U.S. that are within 10 miles of 90% of the population to
deliver to the home for those that want it all the way into the refrigerator, cabinets or
pantry. The news you may have heard recently about us testing the ability to deliver
all the way into the home was with a crowd-sourced platform through Deliv in
partnership with August Home. In the future, we think we will be able to keep some
of our customers' homes in-stock the way that we keep stores in-stock today.
Customers can choose any of these service levels and pay for the speed they desire.
We know customers want options all the time. They ﬂex in the moment. And we
don't have to perfectly predict what the percentages will be in the future. Instead, we
have to build the capabilities to provide the service they want more eﬃciently than
others. We're seeing delivery via store and dark store pick explode in China, where
the costs are lower. And I believe that grocery pickup and delivery in the U.S. will
drive a lot of growth here because the experience is improving, the cost to do it will
decline over time and some people just ﬂat out love the convenience. At the same
time, I believe the vast majority of grocery volume will be done by customer
shopping in stores for a long time to come. So the volume from the stores helps usFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 66support and grow the rest. As delivery volumes grow and we achieve the density
which will happen in urban areas ﬁrst, dark stores and more automated fulﬁllment
centers will be more eﬃcient. That's what we're doing in the U.K. and we've begun to
do in China. And as it relates to our e-commerce strategy, including e-commerce for
food, as we shared with you last year in this meeting, we're out to build an e-
commerce business that is a basket business. That's why we were attracted to Jet's
smart cart. So we'll win the bottom of the category chart we showed you earlier.
Selling those most frequently purchased items gives us the relationship and the
opportunity to sell items higher on the chart like apparel, toys and television. So our
e-commerce strategy has us adding food and consumables to fulﬁllment centers for
those cases where the economics and shipment timing dictate we should ship it
straight to the home.
Now if you think I'm just trying to make the case for physical retail, I'm not. I'm
explaining how we believe customers will shop. And I'm saying that our assets and
strengths are necessary. In fact, they're foundational. The newer business, where
more growth will come from and where the customer is going, are supported by
them. We are well positioned to win the future of retail. And I wouldn't trade places
with anyone.
Now I'd like to quickly take you through our strategic objectives. We use these inside
the company to focus our work to build more detailed plans and assign targets. The
way we think of it is we're a purpose-driven company. We have a set of 4 core values
and a culture. And we do all those things to create shared value. In the middle all of
that, we've got 4 strategic objectives that we use to focus the team: The ﬁrst one is to
make every day easier for busy families. We want to change how we work. We're
changing from the inside. We want to deliver results and operate with discipline. And
we want to become the most trusted retailer. And I'll click down on each one of
these now.
So let's talk about making every day easier for busy families. Why busy families? Well
it's a big part of the market. And we've learned that what we do to eﬀectively serve
them helps us serve everybody else. So they're the center of the bull's eye. What's
happening with them? Well you know they're more connected. They've embraced
mobile in a big way. In fact, globally, around the world, mobile commerce has grown
by about 80% just in two years. The way that I think of it is that technology is basically
being hired by the customer to do anything that they don't want to do. So imagine
any friction in the shopping experience, technology is going to be aimed at taking
that out of the system. Technology will also help serve up things to customers that
they might want to do. So becoming more of a digital company and learning how to
work with speed is important to us throughout.
When we think about serving this set of customers, we break it into 3 pieces: The
ﬁrst one is price and value. You know we've always been known for price leadership.
Our business is founded on value. That will be the case. It's in our DNA. It's the
purpose of the company. We'll stay committed to that. Secondly, we want to be great
merchants. We want to enable our buyers with improved data and analytics. But we
also want them to be instinctive, intuitive merchants. We can do that with not onlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 66the merchants that buy for all of our stores but also all the way down to store level. A
few days ago, I was in a Pittsburgh store and talking to a department manager
named (Tara). Tara was telling me about her department and which items she had
ordered more of so that she could feature it and drive sales because she knew she
could sell it in her store. Algorithms aren't perfect. And they're not going to be
perfect. Humans can make decisions, drive sales, whether it's store level or here. And
we want to leverage that because we've got a lot of experience in that area.
In the category of merchandising and assortment, we're pleased with our progress
on fresh food quality. It's exciting to see private brands starting to grow. The
Member's Mark brand at Sam's Club is now an $11 billion brand. And on the e-
commerce side, we're adding assortment like crazy so that we're there for choice.
And when customers come to us through the app or some other way, they can ﬁnd
what they're looking for. So that's kind of the focus as it relates to being great
merchants.
As it relates to easy, fast, friendly and fun, I think that starts with engaged people. The
way you feel when you leave a store will inﬂuence how quickly you come back. But
it's also about using technology to improve the experience. And the pickup towers
you saw on the store visits are one example where we can get an item to a customer
in about 40 seconds instead of the minutes it used to take us.
So let's go on to the next pillar, which is changing how we work. And I think this is a
really important part of the future of Walmart. As I mentioned just a minute ago, for
us to be eﬀective on the outside, we have to change from the inside. As it relates to
investing in and empowering our associates, that's happening not only at the store
level but beyond the store level as we help people develop and teach them and
train them. And we're going to continue to make investments not only in academies
but also in technology and training so that our associates are really well prepared to
do a great job.
As it relates to creating a high-performance culture, I mentioned earlier we have 4
core values: One, for example, is respect for the individual. Another one is striving
for excellence. One of the things that built this company was high expectations. And
sometimes, we get so focused on respecting and appreciating people that we let the
bar be lower than it should have been. And so there's just a performance aspect of
our culture that we're dialing up. And all 4 of those core values matter. And we can
do that while still being who we are and being respectful.
As it relates to strengthening diversity and inclusion, we need creativity. We want
innovation. We know that diverse teams outperform those that aren't. We have had
and still have a deliberate program around becoming more inclusive. And we're
learning things about unconscious bias and bias interrupters in our hiring practices
and continuing to mature down this path of becoming an even more inclusive
company. And that's really important to us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 66As it relates to being a digital enterprise, the apps are showing up on tablets at store
level. You probably saw some of those. We have some robots running up and down
the aisles and tests now doing the section work for us, checking to see whether the
phasings are right, looking to see if we're in-stock, eventually helping us with price
changes. That's happening in this country. I was in Chile a few weeks ago. And it's
happening there.
WeChat is being used by our associates in China to share ideas on how to grow
sales. And Sam's Club is using Workplace by Facebook to do the same. It cuts out
the middleman. Things don't ﬂow up to the home oﬃce. It's more of a platform that
enables one club to talk to another and say, "Hi. this works. Try this. It's a source of
pride." So we can use all forms of technology to increase the speed and
eﬀectiveness of the company.
If we go on to the next pillar. As we do these things, we've got to deliver results and
operate with discipline. Strong, eﬃcient growth means to us we're going to rely
more on comp store sales and e-commerce sales than new store growth. And Brett
will talk to you some more about that in a second.
Consistent operating discipline. Obviously, managing costs as we go, learning how
to say no, stopping some things as we want to start some other things. We're
committed to leveraging the company as we grow. We've got to drive top line
growth. But we can do more than one thing at a time.
And as it relates to strategic capital allocation. As the new store number comes
down, we've got a group of new stores that we built years ago that we'll be investing
in, in remodels next year and over the next few years. That, combined with e-
commerce growth and some investments in the supply chain, are where our
priorities are. And we're trying to be very choiceful about that -- the investments that
we make by geography and the other dimensions of our business.
As it relates to building trust, we're all living in an increasingly transparent world. The
things we think about here include global compliance and ethics. And we're all really
proud of the progress we've made over the last few years with talent, process and
systems as it relates to compliance and ethics. We have a stronger program,
increased visibility and ability to detect, remediate issues as they come up. We're
committed to that. And we're going to continue that good work.
As it relates to social, environmental issues, we believe in shared value. We believe
that all the stakeholders that Walmart touches can beneﬁt as a result of the system
that is Walmart.
As it relates to communities, we want to make a diﬀerence on the ground. That really
becomes tangible when we have things like hurricanes and earthquakes and, this
week, ﬁres. And you can see the humanity of Walmart stepping up and making a
diﬀerence. But it happens every day, not just when there is a crisis.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 66And we want to tell our story more eﬀectively. We frequently wish that the world will
look at the company as it is today. The good and the bad. We're not perfect. But
there are a lot of good things going on at Walmart. And Walmart does a lot of good
things for the various stakeholders that we serve.
So let's go a little bit deeper on sustainability if we could.
We set goals a little over 10 years ago, you may remember, to be supplied by
renewable energy, to sell more sustainable products and sustainable packaging and
to eliminate waste. And we've made some progress. We recently announced that we
had achieved our 20 million metric greenhouse gas goal that we had set a few years
ago. In fact, during that period of time, we eliminated 35 million metric tons of
greenhouse gas out of our system. We had set a goal of sourcing $20 billion of
goods from women-owned businesses. We recently announced that we had
achieved that goal. So as things like that are happening, we've set some new ones.
And as it relates to renewable energy, we want to get to 50% by 2025. We're at 26%
now.
As it relates to sustainable products, the Fortune cover that was on the previous slide
was kind of highlighting the work that we've done on high-priority chemicals. But
basically, the buyers are working in an item at a time to make things more
sustainable. One of my favorites these days is this Pristine grape. And on the back of
the package, it talks about how the supplier is using 100% drip irrigation systems on
their farms and pack houses. And they're supplied by 80% renewable energy. All of
their farms are certiﬁed for sustainable agricultural practices. And the grapes taste
good. And they're a good value at $2.28. So this relates to telling our story. It also
relates to sustainability as the buyers are just making progress across the board. I
think we can do a better job of communicating. And I think on pack is one good way
to do that.
As it relates to eliminating waste, we want to get to 4 of our larger countries and get
to 0 waste by 2025. We're at 77% for the total company today. And as it relates to
carbon, we recently set a goal that by 2030 with our suppliers, we would take out
one gigaton of carbon from our system. So progress is continuing here.
Let's go on to the next one.
And as it relates to communities, there's a lot of good work going on. This
commitment to source goods made in the U.S.A., we're on track to achieve the $250
billion number. We had set that goal in 2013. Just last week, Greg Foran was in South
Carolina helping to open a tire factory that's going to create 1,700 jobs. That's fun to
do.
As it relates to veterans, we set a goal of hiring 250,000 of them. We're at 7 --
179,000 now. And 24,000 of them have been promoted already. So that program's in
good shape. We're starting to really scale the academies.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 66Brett M. BiggsAnd as it relates to disaster relief, the company, with all the things that have been
going on recently, has contributed $35 million. The customers stepped up, too. And
they contributed more than $35 million. So we're over $70 million together that
we've contributed. It's, again, an example of Walmart people stepping up and make
a diﬀerent -- making a diﬀerence. And the stories I've heard over the last few weeks
of what our people have done in Puerto Rico, in Florida and Texas are just amazing
stories. And it kind of reminds me of the fact that our people have made the
diﬀerence in this company. And even in a world that's increasingly inﬂuenced by
technology, I think that's what our future looks like. We -- we're still people led. We're
just even more tech-empowered. So it'll be our people that'll lead us into the future.
So the key takeaways I wanted to share with you are that we have a plan. And it really
does rely on the unique assets and strengths that we have. We've got some
momentum. I'm proud of the fact that we're starting to move faster. I think we
probably need to keep going as it relates to getting faster. And we'll be disciplined
with costs and capital as we go.
We look forward sharing some more information with you as we go through the
morning. Thank you.

{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. How are you? Good to have everybody here in
Northwest Arkansas. And for those of you on the webcast, welcome as well.
We want to thank you for your interest in Walmart. It means a lot that you come every
year as we enjoy talking about our company. And we look forward this morning to
share more about what we're doing here.
This is my 17th year with the company. And I'm so excited about what we're doing
and our momentum. We have great opportunities in front of us. And we have the will
and we have the resources to win now and in the long term.
As Doug talked about, most industries are undergoing more changes than we've
seen in a lot of our time and certainly in retail. But I think this gives us great
opportunity. And I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about the future of Walmart. And
part of the reason I'm excited about our future is that we can win with both
customers and shareholders. Now those things should go hand in hand, of course.
And you just heard Doug talk a lot about how we're going to win with customers.
As we win with customers, we're also focused on winning with you, with our investors
and with our shareholders. And that's where I'm going to spend most of my time this
morning.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 66We have so many unique assets and resources that position us incredibly well to win
now and the long term. As you hear each of us speak today, we hope you'll better
understand why we believe that we can do both.
Many of the things I'll cover the next few minutes, you would have seen in our
release this morning. But I'm going to give you a little more color, as you would
expect. And I'll start with an update on our expectations for the current year for EPS,
sales growth and CapEx. Then I'll provide an update on guidance for ﬁscal year '19.
One area we'll always highlight is our ﬁnancial strength. We are rock-solid ﬁnancially.
And that just gives us options that many others don't have. And I'll frame the
discussion today around our ﬁnancial framework, which we laid out with you a year
ago. So let's get started.
So our ﬁrst half performance has been solid. Good top-line growth as well as a slight
increase in operating income for Walmart U.S. and International on a constant
currency basis, which are positive signs that the productivity loop is working. Now
while we have delevered expenses a bit overall as a company so far this year, we
have a leverage in the U.S. stores and in International. We continue to make some
investments, particularly in technology, which has created some expense headwind
in the ﬁrst half.
From a revenue perspective, net sales ex currency increased 2.7% in the ﬁrst half of
the year. However, this number was impacted by the sale of Yihaodian last year as
well as Suburbia this year. Excluding those divestitures, sales growth was over 3%, as
you see here on the slide.
In the ﬁrst half, we continued with really solid comp performance in Walmart U.S. as
well as some of our key markets in International such as Mexico and Canada. U.S. e-
commerce delivered strong sales growth, as you know, of just over 60%. Now as we
start to overlap the Jet acquisition in the Third Quarter, we will see the growth rate
decrease some. But we still expect really healthy growth for the full year.
Our cash ﬂow remains very strong with $11.4 billion in the ﬁrst half of the year. And
we continue to make good strides with working capital management. We also
continue to provide very strong cash returns to our shareholders as we returned $7.5
billion via dividends and share repurchase.
We expect FY '18 to be a solid year overall. And positive momentum really sets us up
nicely for the next year as well. So in short, we're doing what we said we would do.
And as a reminder, we updated adjusted EPS guidance at the end of Q2 to be in a
range of $4.30 to $4.40. And we're reiterating that guidance today. We expect full
year sales growth of approximately 3% constant currency and excluding the impacts
of the divestitures of Yihaodian and suburbia, with sales growth slightly lower on an
actual constant currency basis because of the divestitures. Now while the rate is at
the lower end of where we guided coming into the year, I am pleased with theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 12 of 66quality of the sales growth given the comps and the traﬃc growth that you've seen,
we've seen in many parts of the business. So when we say and talk about strong,
eﬃcient growth, we're heading in that direction. And as you can see, we expect
CapEx, excluding acquisitions, to ﬁnish the year right around the original guidance
of $11 billion.
So two years ago, we provided guidance on some metrics for the following 3-year
period, which is a bit unusual for us. But given the investments that we're going to
be making in the future, we wanted to give as much more forward visibility as we
could. So last year, we updated that guidance. And now you can see where we stand
on the guidance. Now we're always pushing to do better. But it's pretty good
scorecard. And I'm going to go through each one of these brieﬂy.
Now anytime we give guidance, as you know, there are a number of assumptions we
make, such as inﬂation, deﬂation, currencies, tax rates, economic conditions, all of
that staying relatively stable. Obviously, we're monitoring the U.S. tax reform very
closely. And we'll update you if there are any implications for the company as we go
forward. And we know, as always, that you appreciate that we're giving you guidance
as real time as we can and as transparently as we can.
So as we always do, let's start with sales.
We've stated that sales growth would be 3% to 4%. As I said earlier, on a
comparative basis, that's constant currency, excluding Yihaodian, excluding
Suburbia, we'll likely in the lower end of that range this year and expect to be at or
above 3% next year assuming today's currency rates. But that represents still nearly
$15 billion of growth, which, of course, is sizable growth.
While we're on growth, let's talk to e-commerce.
When we gave e-commerce guidance previously, we were referring to a global
number. Since then, we've been discussing on a Walmart U.S. number -- a Walmart
U.S. e-commerce number as we've gone and put out our releases. As I mentioned
earlier, we expect Walmart U.S. growth number to slow a little to overlap the Jet
acquisition but to be about 40% next year, against the pretty sizable sales base this
year of about $11.5 billion. Now keep in mind, this includes all web-initiated
transactions, including those through Walmart.com. So Ship to Home, Ship to Store,
Pick Up Today and Online Grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the
other sites in our family of brands. Now as a point of reference, on a global basis, this
includes SamsClub.com and our e-commerce operations in our international
markets. Our Global eCommerce sales are expected to be about $17.5 billion in the
current year. Now recall that this number is lowered by our divestiture of Yihaodian
last year in China. And we're now partnering with JD.com in that market. GMV, of
course, will be somewhat larger than the numbers that I just mentioned.
So let's talk about expense leverage.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 13 of 66We said last year we would slightly lever expenses. Now we're still in that ballpark.
But it's going to be close, I think. I'm pleased we're starting to see leverage in
International. We talked about that. And Walmart U.S. stores, Judith also leveraging.
Sam's is also making good progress. We have continued to lean in on some back-
end technology. And we've had some additional expenses recently, such as the ones
with the recent hurricanes, that are likely going to make leveraging a close call this
year. I do feel more comfortable, though, that we'll lever expenses next year
assuming the sales guidance I just discussed.
But not all of our costs are captured in SG&A. And I don't want to lose the progress
that we've made in total cost, including cost of goods sold. We have made
improvement in cost of goods through better merchandise costs, better terms over
the past couple years. We have really solid top line momentum and are generating a
lot of growth for our suppliers. This is an important part of what we do in the
productivity loop.
We also talked last year about our investments in e-commerce being the heaviest
this ﬁscal year. We expect our e-commerce losses to be slightly less next year. But we
will continue to invest in a thoughtful way in that business.
Let's turn to operating margin %.
I said a year ago that the operating margin % last year and this year would be
indicative of the range of margin % in the near to midterm. We still believe that to be
the case. Some years could be higher, some can be lower. But in general, the range
of last year and this year.
On EPS, our recent guidance indicates that adjusted EPS will be relatively ﬂat for FY
'18 versus FY '17. And we anticipate it coming in -- and anticipate it coming in this year
as well. Our FY EPS forecast excludes the impact of any change associated with the
debt tender we just announced and would exclude any other impact of other
strategic initiatives that might occur over the balance of the year. I know a number
that has been quite a focus for you guys has been our EPS guidance for next year of
around 5%. We're conﬁrming that guidance today, as both Steve and Doug
mentioned. Now certainly, there are puts and takes. There's headwinds or tailwinds.
But we feel comfortable with the guidance given this current momentum in the
business.
Operating cash ﬂow has been very strong and should exceed $80 billion over this 3-
year period, which we guided, which is an incredible number.
And ﬁnally, CapEx will be around $11 billion this current year, excluding acquisitions.
And we expect next year for CapEx to be in that similar range, again excluding
acquisitions.
I mentioned earlier that we are rock-solid ﬁnancially. And it just gives Walmart more
options than some others. So as you take a look at some highlights, we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 14 of 66approaching $500 billion in revenue. You know all this. I'm going to say them
anyway. Very strong balance sheet. Rated AA. Over 260 million customers every
week. But I want to focus on the right side of the slide. And I think last year was an
excellent example of our disciplined cash management along with our ﬁnancial
strength.
So last year, we acquired Jet, we invested nearly $11 billion in CapEx, we invested in
JD.com, we paid a meaningful dividend, we bought back a healthy amount of shares
and our net debt declined. That's not a statement about ﬁnancial leverage but rather
is a demonstration of our ﬁnancial strength and the options that we have as a
company.
The ﬁnancial framework that we previewed a year ago with you helps guide our
decisions, helps guide our discussions as a company. And there's 3 key elements.
And we'll spend a few minutes on each one.
So just as a reminder, strong, eﬃcient growth. We're going to continue to focus on
our most productive and proﬁtable growth opportunities by prioritizing comp
growth and e-commerce growth versus new stores.
Consistent operating discipline. We need to be at a lower cost to serve. And we
need to move more quickly in this area. And I'll talk more about that.
We continue to make investments where we need to. And we're seeing progress in
taking out costs also where we need to.
As to strategic capital allocation, we have and we will continue to take decisions that
improve our returns over the mid to long term.
So let's go forward and talk about strong, eﬃcient growth.
This will look a lot like last year. And you'll see that we continue to prioritize comp
growth and accelerating e-commerce growth versus new stores. We'll continue to
open fewer new stores overall, particularly in the U.S.. And over time believe that's
going to contribute to an improvement in our returns on our capital, which is
important. We believe this is the right formula, coupled with a robust remodel
program within our stores and clubs.
As you know, over the last several years, we've made investments that are important
to the overall health of the business. But we're not where we want to be from an
expense standpoint. And we have to get better now. But we have to do it in a
thoughtful, process-minded way. As I mentioned earlier, we expect expenses as a
percentage of sales this year to be near our leverage point and leveraging next year.
Now in order to achieve expense leverage going forward, we need to change the
way we work.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 15 of 66During this year, we made a decision to formalize our commitment to cost
transformation. As part of that, we're instituting a 0-based budgeting approach
across many parts of the company above store level. We're going about this in a
thoughtful way, that works inside the company, is consistent with our culture and
ensuring that we manage costs in a very thoughtful way. But we need to make
progress. And we believe this is going to help us in making progress more quickly.
And our teams are already focused on changing how we budget across the
organization, eliminating duplication, utilizing technology in new ways. One of the
great things, though, about our scale as a company is that sometimes, small changes
can result in important reductions in cost. For example, a simple change to our
plastic bags at Walmart U.S. resulted in an annualized savings of approximately $20
million. A decision to shorten the length of the receipts saved over $7 million. We're
also seeing examples across the globe. And Dave will talk about some later, that are
helping markets like Chile, Canada and the U.K. leverage expenses meaningfully.
There are also things we're doing from a structural standpoint that we believe will
lower our cost to serve over time. As an example, earlier this year, we merged shared
services with the back-end technology group to form the Global Business Services
group, which should allow us, over time, to take a more product agile approach to
back oﬃce functions, both in stores and in corporate functions. So in Global Business
Services, we're focused on automating processes, changing procedures. And we're
utilizing bots more than we ever have. The focus on expenses is going to provide
fuel for this business. And we're excited about what we can do with that fuel.
As I mentioned earlier, our business generates substantial cash. We're going to
invest in the business as our ﬁrst priority, which we always have. But we have a
meaningful and growing dividend. 44 consecutive years we're increasing our
dividend. And we're committed to our share repurchase program as we utilize the
excess cash. So this morning, you saw that we instituted a new $20 billion share
repurchase plan.
As we generate the signiﬁcant amount of cash that we do, we feel good about
investing in Walmart. As we mentioned in the release this morning, we estimate
utilizing this authority over approximately two years. The pace of repurchase, of
course, will depend on the continued strong cash ﬂow of the business as well as
other potential or strategic uses of cash. But we feel good about the long-term value
of Walmart.
Now as you know, while we've continued to grow the business and we transformed
for the future, we have returned a signiﬁcant amount of capital to shareholders.
Including what we estimate to return for the remainder of this year, we have returned
over $30 billion to shareholders in last year and this year combined, which is quite a
remarkable feat given the transformation period that we're in as a company.
Now as we continue to change as a company. So is the way in which we allocate
capital. So as you can see over time, our total spend has decreased some and hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 16 of 66shifted toward remodels, e-commerce, supply chain and technology. Now certainly,
what stands out most clearly is the shift in capital from new stores and clubs to
remodels over the past few years. As we look to get more growth from existing
stores, this spending ﬂows with that strategy. So last year, we opened nearly 60
supercenters in the U.S. This year, we're going to open fewer than 40 and expect
next year to open fewer than 15. We will continue to spend capital where we believe
it's going to make the most diﬀerence for our customers as well as how we conduct
our business and how we work in the future. So Online Grocery expansion, pickup
towers, Scan & Go, some of that you would have seen yesterday in your tours. Those
are all examples of what I'm talking about.
So as we look at capital by segment, there are just a couple of notes I would make.
First is that we expect CapEx by segment to be pretty similar to next year compared
to this year. Over a period of time, what you've seen is just a slight decrease in
CapEx at Sam's as well as International over that period of time.
So while we're being opportunistic from an M&A perspective. And you can see it
here on the walls that looks a little bit diﬀerent than it did a year ago, we're also more
focused and open to taking action on assets within our portfolio to simplify the
business. The divestiture of a successful business like Suburbia in Mexico is an
example of that. Suburbia is a really good business. But it's one that just didn't ﬁt as
well with our long-term strategy. So we're going to continue to consistently monitor
our portfolio. We're going to ensure that we have the right mix of assets for our
shareholders long term.
We're also partnering with great companies to move faster and leverage existing
platforms and expertise rather than always investing capital and taking the time to
build it ourselves. The partnerships with Google Home and JD.com are great
examples of that.
And we're going to test some things. We're using Uber to test last-mile delivery in
addition to utilizing our own associates. We're partnering with August Home and
Latch to deliver into customers' homes. Our stores are close to the customer. And we
need to experiment with options to take advantage of our unique footprint. We will
continue to explore creative options to grow the business.
Let me leave you with just a few thoughts this morning.
We're executing our strategy. We're delivering results. The plan is working. We're
going to be more disciplined with expenses, providing even more fuel for this
business. Our plans deliver balance and eﬃcient growth, comp stores versus new
stores. And we continue to be thoughtful on how we allocate capital and making
decisions where to accelerate, which you've seen. But also what to stop. And you've
seen that as well. Most importantly, we are doing this from a base of incredible
ﬁnancial strength.
I'm going to ﬁnish where I started.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Good morning. Welcome. Hope you enjoyed dinner last night. I really appreciated
all the great questions.
It's been a little over a year now. I think last year, I was at this meeting and I was on
the job about 17 days. I had a chance to share some of my early sort of thinking. And
as you can see in the last year, the team has been really busy.
We've got a lot of stuﬀ accomplished and feeling really good about where we are.
We launched the 2-day free shipping with no membership. We launched Easy
Reorder, the Pickup Discount. We acquired 5 companies. We created Store No. 8. We
started to do some innovation around testing associate delivery, testing in-home,
into the fridge delivery. We did a deal with Google to partner with them. We've been
busy on a lot of fronts with respect to trying to do things to improve the customer
value proposition.
But under -- beneath all that, we're working hard to build the foundation and really
build the infrastructure. Spent a lot of time restructuring the organization. We built it
to move faster. It's more customer centric now. I have the head of customer
experience and the head of customer service reporting direct to me. They were
before sort of down low in the organization. We've made some great hires over the
year. And I feel really good about the team we have in place. And I think we're set up
well for success.
First half performance, you know the numbers. 62% sales growth for the ﬁrst half.
That compares to 12% for the same period last year. And as you know, most of that
growth came from organic.
In terms of looking ahead to next year, we see 40%, thereabout, growth next year oﬀ
a base of $11.5 billion. This is $11.5 billion just in the U.S. So next year, approximately
$16 billion will be the number.
In terms of the bottom line, I think Brett said this before. But this year should be the
largest loss in e-commerce. And we'll see slight improvement next year. So we're
happy with the growth. Obviously, e-commerce will scale gains. So we have a lot of
work to do. But we like the direction that we're heading.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 18 of 66What is the direction? We want to be the destination for customers to save money no
matter how they want to shop, whether it be pickup, delivery in two days or delivery
in 2 hours. The idea is to save customers money at any service level.
At the end of the day, Doug said it before, we want to make every day easier for
busy families. That's our vision.
So how are we going to get there? The strategy is actually quite simple. It's got 3
parts. First, we want to nail the fundamentals. We're going to spend a lot of time
doing that. Then we want to leverage our unique strengths. And this is really about
playing oﬀense. And this is the part that gets me really excited. Then also, at the
same time, we're going to be innovating for the future.
So let's focus in on nail the fundamentals. This is where we're going to be spending
the majority of our time.
So how are we going to do it? We've created this index we call the CVI, the
Customer Value Index. And it comprises 5 bellwether metrics that we track
maniacally. Have it, ﬁnd it, display it, price it, deliver it. We call it the 5 its. Do we have
the products that customers want? Can they ﬁnd the products easily when they
search on the website? Are the products displayed with all the content, pictures,
descriptions that were used to make an intelligent decision? Are they priced right?
And are they delivered on time and fast? And so we're sort of maniacally focused on
getting those 5 bellwethers where they need to be in improving the CVI.
When you think about the CVI and those 5 bellwethers, they really break down into 2
separate buckets. They break down inmerchandising and logistics. I think if you were
to ask people what e-commerce is all about, people would say, oh, that's when you
ship products to your home. But for me, when I think about it, that wasn't the step
change. We were delivering product to people's homes for decades before the
Internet through catalog. The step change was really one around merchandising. The
Internet unlocked the ability to merchandise products in a way that could never be
done in a catalog. Basically, millions of products with really rich product content,
descriptions and pictures and reviews from other customers that never could have
been done in a catalog before. So when I -- and dynamic pricing on top of that. So
when I think about merchandising, I think about that as being the step change in e-
commerce. So we're going to be laser focused on ﬁxing merchandising as well as
logistics.
So how are we going to improve merchandising? It's really broken down into 2
separate buckets: the top million SKUs; and the long tail, which is everything else.
And the reason why we break it down into 2 buckets like that is because the tactics
are diﬀerent. With respect to the top million SKUs, it's really more about being
human powered, whereas the long tail is really more about being tech empowered.
So on the top million SKUs, we're taking this very focused eﬀort on bringing in
category specialists that have responsibility for a very narrow set of SKUs. Think likeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 19 of 66500 SKUs. A category could be food storage bags or it could be treadmills. It could
be vacuum cleaners. A very, very narrow category. Today, the average merchant
might have 10,000 products they're responsible for. We're going to sort of narrow
that down to 500.
So the top million SKUs can be covered by 2,000 specialists. And this specialist
basically spends all day every day focused on all the details to perfect the
experience in that category. So it means perfecting the descriptions, getting all the
right images, making sure the attributes and ﬁlters are perfect. We even have the
ability of category specialists now to actually show exactly what the 10 results should
be for any speciﬁc keyword search term. And they can move around the results
depending on the house -- hot, new products come in that maybe aren't recognized
by the search engine right away, products that they want to merchandise because
they have particularly good margin and think customers really like the product. So
we've hired about 250 of these category specialists so far. And we're hiring about 40
to 50 new specialists per month.
We're also investing pretty aggressively in merchandising tools just to make these
category specialists more empowered and be able to do more faster. So that's how
we're going to kill the top million SKUs.
With respect to the long tail, it's really about marketplace. And over the last year,
we've grown SKUs from about 50 million to now over 60 million products. So we feel
good about the momentum we're seeing there.
Also, to help in the long tail, we've made 3 acquisitions in ShoeBuy, Hayneedle and
Moosejaw. All 3 are in these long tail categories where we felt it was easier to
accelerate through acquisition than do it organically. And so what they brought is
really rich product content. Hayneedle has over 1 million home SKUs. They've taken
most of their own pictures. And so the content is really rich. They've got thousands of
relationships with brands and an incredible specialized merchandising team. And so
we'll look as well over the coming year to see if there are opportunities in other long
tail categories to help accelerate growth on both Jet and Walmart.
Cutting across both the top million and the long tail is really the brand. And one of
the things we're going to be really focused on over this next year is to elevate the
Walmart.com brands so we can attract more premium sellers to the site, more
premium brands. One thing we already did, starts to see these boxes ﬂow through, is
we just moved to colored blue boxes on Walmart. They're starting to hit the market
now. We're in the process of redesigning the website to be more modern. And that
should hit in Q1. We're working on some partnerships that you'll see come through
during the year to bring a more premium assortment to the site. And we're also
really focused on creating these vertical shopping experiences that are more about
browse and discovery than just straight transactional. And the focus is going to be
on home and fashion. And we've hired 2 really strong leaders in those areas. And so
expect to see those experiences over the next year or 2 get elevated. And of course,
Jet.com. We're sort of positioning Jet to be more geared toward the aﬄuent, higher-
income, urban millennial customer. And as we do that, we're going to start pushingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 20 of 66up the ability to attract more premium brands. We've already started to attract more
premium brands on there but we will get even more so as we continue to push the
brand more upscale. And that'll help then build a bridge to bring these brands
ultimately to Walmart.com.
On to the logistics.
With respect to logistics, a lot of the groundwork was already laid before I got here.
The warehouses are the right size. They're in the right location. And they had the
right level of automation. And from the network we have today, we can ship 99% of
the country via ground in two days and 87% of the country overnight via ground. So
that's how we're able to oﬀer the free 2-day shipment with no membership. So we
feel really good about that footprint.
The reason why you're not seeing that ﬂow through, if you've shopped in the site
and saw like boxes being split, is because we have not yet mirrored inventory in all
the locations. And that's what's we're focused on doing this year. Get the inventory
mirrored in the diﬀerent locations, make sure that we have high in-stock rates and
make sure that everywhere that it comes in gets out and fulﬁlled and shipped as
soon as it comes in. If we can do that, we're going to be able to create a very magical
experience on Walmart.com.
So that's really how we're going to ﬁx the fundamentals. And we're really focused on
doing that.
This next part of the strategy is what gets me really excited and why I'm so happy to
be at Walmart. It's really about leveraging the unique assets to play oﬀense. And I
think Walmart has a set of assets that can't be matched anywhere. And Greg Foran
and I and our teams are working very closely together. I'm in communication with
Greg on almost a daily basis. And we're thinking about how do we leverage these
assets to create a magical experience for customers.
I think 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart. There's 1.4 million
associates. And Walmart's the largest grocer in the U.S. So when we think about
some of these assets and we think about playing oﬀense, we think about it across 3
dimensions: price, assortment and experience.
So let me start with price. When you're thinking about price and thinking about our
assets, it has to start with the stores. For low price point items, no way to have a lower
cost to serve. That $0.72 baking soda that has just cents of margin, there's no way to
pick that in fulﬁllment center, never mind paying for the cost of shipping. The picking
cost alone is about $1 to pick a unit. So there's no cheaper way to get these products
to consumers than have them come in the store and pick it oﬀ the shelf themselves.
That's a great starting point. But customers don't always want to come into the store
and pick it oﬀ the shelves. That's why we've got 2-day free shipping on all your head
consumable items. And we're able to leverage the smart cart technology on Jet to
empower customers to build bigger, smarter baskets of product so we could pullFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 21 of 66supply chain costs out and give customers even lower prices. So if they want to
come into the store and pick it oﬀ the shelf, save money, that's great. They want it
shipped to their home in two days, we'll give them the best price because we'll
leverage the smart cart technology. Over the next year, you'll see the smart cart
technology on Jet migrate onto Walmart.com. So that's really about the head of the
assortment.
When you think about the long tail, we can also leverage the store assets to bring
lower prices to consumers. Yes. Again, we can ship it to home. But if you're willing to
come to the store to pick it up, we avoid last-mile delivery cost, which is the vast
majority of the cost to delivery. We can share those savings with customers, which
gives them a lower price. And we make the same proﬁt. And at the same time, we're
sending traﬃc to the store. And a virtuous cycle sort of kicks in. So we feel really
good about how we're positioned to leverage our assets with respect to price.
On the assortment side, Walmart has many billion-dollar private label brands. In fact,
3 of the top 5 private label brands in America are Walmart brands. And so it's an
incredible asset. We've already started to leverage that asset. We've just recently
announced that we're launching Uniquely J, which is a private label brand at Jet. It's
going to have hundreds of products, more premium across the entire range of
categories.
Then the digitally native brands. This is part of our strategy. We've bought Bonobos.
Andy Dunn, who's the Founder and CEO, is now running our digitally native brand
strategy that includes ModCloth and also incubating additional brands. We do
believe that when there ultimately becomes parity on the assortment, that this will be
a diﬀerentiator for us. These brands connect with millennial shoppers. And they oﬀer
assortment that you can't ﬁnd anywhere else. And the margin structure is fantastic.
So that's assortment.
Experience, this is the one area that gets me, I think, most excited. This is where we
can really leverage the assets to create an experience that you can't ﬁnd anywhere
else.
So let's talk about grocery pickup. 1,000 stores today. It will be in over 2,000 stores
by the end of next year. Customers absolutely love this experience. The Net
Promoter Score is in the 80 s , which is really unheard of. It's an incredible value
proposition to the consumers. So we know customers love the pickup. But now that
we have picking capability in 1,000 and eventually 2,000 stores, we're suited -- really
well suited, to be able to do same-day or 2-hour delivery. In fact, when you think
about delivery and you think about the cost of doing same-day or 2-hour, there's not
a lot of volatility in sort of the actual cost of doing the delivery. The real diﬀerential
comes from, can you forward-deploy inventory to 4,600 warehouses? And can you
get that product there in full truckload quantities? Well that's what Walmart has,
4,600 sort of warehouses where the product is getting there in full truckload
quantities. So you really can't get a lower cost to serve than that. And these
warehouses, they're proﬁtable. So each marginal dollar that comes out of their ShipFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 22 of 66Steve Schmittto Home is coming at a really attractive marginal rate. That's where the real power of
the omni comes together.
So we're doing tests right now in about 2 dozen stores. We're using Uber, Deliv and
even our own associates. And so we're going to take sort of the best of. In diﬀerent
situations it may make sense to use associates; in others, just straight crowdsourcing.
We've also bought Parcel, which is really going to be focused in urban areas. And
speciﬁcally, they'll start in New York City, which is a nice complement to the 4,600-
store network that we have. In addition, two days ago, we just announced Mobile
Express Returns, which is another big advantage at the stores. It makes it very easy
for customers to return product. And now they can do it in less than a minute. So
we're really excited about leveraging those assets.
So that's it. That's really about how we're going to play oﬀense.
The third part of our strategy is really about innovating for the future. So that's really
about story, a story where incubating businesses across the country that have the
potential to shape the future of retail.
In the future, we believe that shopping will be more personalized, immersive,
interactive and on-demand. So more value in everything from artiﬁcial intelligence,
voice, AR, VR, drones, autonomous vehicles. And we're also looking to redeﬁne the
brick-and-mortar shopping experience of the future.
Story is not a sandbox. It's about incubating businesses that have a clear vision, a
mission, a set of values. We're hiring great people to run these businesses. And the
idea is to set us up nicely for the future.
So again, in summary, the strategy is very simple. We're going to be maniacally
focused on just nailing the fundamentals. We're going to look for ways to play
oﬀense by leveraging unique assets. And we're going to be focused on innovating
for the future.
It's been a great ﬁrst year. I'm really excited to be here. Doug and the board have
really empowered me and the rest of the team. And that has really enabled us to
move fast. I know people don't always believe me when I say it. But it feels like a
startup. We're able to move as fast as we were moving when we were a stand-alone
business. So I couldn't be more excited about next year.
Just a few things I want to leave you with. Expect us to continue to work closely with
the store's team, Greg Foran. We've got a lot of ideas on how to bring the
experiences of both online and these stores together to create a magical
experience. We're going to be maniacal and laser focused on getting the
fundamentals right. And look for us to continue to play oﬀense and continue to
innovate. Thank you.

All right. So we're going to get started here in a couple minutes, if people could
please ﬁnd their way to their seats.
All right. Good. So one of the things that makes me really proud to put my Walmart

for communities when and where they need us around the world.
Our responses to the recent hurricanes is an example of this. Have a look at this

{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
This is John's ﬁrst time to present to you all as the CEO of Sam's Club. So give him
some grief if you want to. But I wanted to jump up and introduce him.
He started with the company in 1993. So he's been with us for 24 years. He's been a
buyer, a divisional merchandise manager, a general merchandise manager, a store
manager, a market manager, led operations. He's led the sourcing areas in Sam's
and private brands. He's worked in Sam's previously in international and in Walmart.
He was our Chief Merchant in Walmart China until we asked him to come over and
lead all of merchandising for Sam's. Then earlier this year, we promoted him to CEO.
So he's had a lot of jobs. He's taking an objective look at Sam's Club. So oﬀ to a
great start, making some changes. And I'm looking forward to seeing what's going
to happen at Sam's under his leadership.

Welcome, John.

Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 24 of 66All right. Good morning. Doug, thanks for the intro. First, it's a privilege to be here
today to represent the team at Sam's Club. We've got a great team. And I'm really
proud of the work they're doing.
And it's great to connect with a lot of you. I see Maggie in the back. And I was
thinking about walking clubs with you 8 or nine years ago in New York. (Simeon), we
got to catch up last night. We got to walk some stores in China a couple of years
ago, just as we're launching mobile e-commerce. But I just want you to know I'm
always impressed with the knowledge you have of our business and how close you
are to the details of our business, which makes it easy to have these conversations.
So let me start with a few numbers. Like you saw on the video, net sales were up
2.6% for the ﬁrst half. Traﬃc increased by 1.6%. And we marked the sixth quarter of
positive growth. So the sixth straight quarter of positive growth. And the Member's
Mark brand is now an $11 billion brand.
Now we think these are good results. But we can do better and we must do better.
And as you know, our trajectory has been relatively ﬂat for several years, even as the
warehouse club has -- the channel has continued to grow.
And so that's why I'm going to call out the question that's probably on your mind.
Will the new team at Sam's Club move the needle in a meaningful way? And I want
you to know, the answer is yes, we will move the needle and we're going to
accelerate growth at Sam's Club in a meaningful way. We've got a clear vision for
where we're going. And we're making progress.
To start with, we've got an experienced leadership team. And we're moving with
speed. Our Chief Operating Oﬃcer, Gisel Ruiz, she's a 25-year associate. She's led
operations all over the country and the world. And she joins us from Walmart
International. Our Chief Merchant, Ashley Buchanan, he was leading a big part of the
U.S. food business before he came over. And Ashley's got a long career in retail, in
merchandising, in consulting. Then, our CEO of SamsClub.com, who's also now the
Head of Membership and our marketing team, Jamie Iannone, has a wealth of
experience in e-commerce and tech. And he's built the team with people like Hsiao
Wang and Eddie Garcia. And they've already made great progress this year, setting
up and leading product acceleration teams that are helping move us forward.
So together, we're thinking diﬀerently, we're working in new ways, we're taking more
risks and we're becoming more agile.
And the result of all this is really a great reinvigoration of the business model. And
while everything we're doing is intended to improve the U.S. club business, these
changes are also beneﬁting Sam's Club all around the world.
So let me share a few examples of things that are giving us conﬁdence.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 25 of 66If you think back a couple of years ago, we started simplifying and then prioritizing
our private brand Member's Mark. And Pam Gaik and her team, they're doing just a
terriﬁc job.
Just two years ago, our private brand penetration was just 17%. And today, the brand
accounts for nearly 23% of our business. So that's a signiﬁcant increase in just two
years. And we believe we've got a lot of room to grow.
We also started to refocus on our fresh food business. And so far, the results, they're
really encouraging. Ed Romero, who you met last night, he and his team, they've
recharged our eﬀorts. Just two years ago, we had negative growth in fresh food. And
recently, we've been running comps as high as 5%. So good progress there.
Our SamsClub.com business, it continues to grow. E-commerce sales are up in the
ﬁrst half by 27%. But I think most exciting for the business is, year-to-date, we're up
over 7 million visits, which tells us we're on the right track.
So we're simplifying everything we do. We've invested in technology, we found new
ways of working. And these are helping us to run a ﬂatter, more eﬃcient
organization. We're making these simple improvements, like not checking cards at
the door. We've changed our checkout process. And in just the last ﬁve months, our
member satisfaction scores for speed of checkouts have improved by nearly 7%. So
we're making some great progress there.
We've also launched a new prototype for the front end. And it's in about 30 clubs.
And the prototype is cutting transaction times at the front by half. So we're cutting
the times in half.
Now our Scan & Go business, which is a completely mobile technology, as you know,
our usage of the device has doubled this year. And it's a really meaningful part of the
business. We've done over $1 billion in sales since launch. And we keep seeing more
and more people use it every week.
Now one example of simpliﬁcation I want to talk to you about is our new
membership sign-up process. And that's something we're going to launch later this
year.
If you go into a club today, it could take anywhere from 8 to 28 minutes for you, as a
new member, to get a card and membership and start shopping the club. It takes 2
diﬀerent systems. It takes 5 pieces of hardware. And so our new process takes about
40 seconds. And it's one piece of equipment. So let's take a look.
So what you see on the right-hand side, our new process, we have an associate with
a new member. The member walks up, quick photo with the iPad. We need a driver's
license, a credit card. She'll swipe the card, hand it over to the member. And then
he's oﬀ to shop. And you can see we have it in 43 seconds.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 26 of 66On the left-hand side, the old process is an exchange between the member, there
are a lot of questions, there's lots of typing. Then you're going to see here in just a
minute, have to move over to another piece of equipment, actually use the POS
system.
So that's an example of how product acceleration can work. So you think about, if we
have an 8-minute process, one approach should be let's try to reduce it to 7. But the
team looked at what's the best way we can do this and make things easy for the
member and they cut it from 8 minutes to 40 seconds. So it's an example of some of
the way that we're trying to move forward.
So now I want to shift to where we're going. And if I can leave you with one point
today, the point that I want you to take away for this business is a point of focus. And
we're focusing the business to accelerate growth. And most importantly, we're
narrowing our target member and we're taking more steps to become special to that
member.
Over the years, we've had at Sam's Club a number of strategic shifts. We try to serve
a wide variety of incomes, some of which was driven by real estate locations. And
we've attempted to serve too many types of small business members.
At one point, we had 16 diﬀerent member segments. And think about that, with a
limited SKU oﬀering, we weren't severing any of the segments very well. And I want
to give you an example.
A couple of years ago, I attended a line review with one of our buyers. And this
buyer was our frozen poultry buyer. And as we started walking her, the item she
chose, she would tell me, well, this item -- the ﬁrst item I want to talk about, this is for
business resellers.
The next item is for our food service members. The next item is for the CEO moms.
This item is for social couples. And this went on and on. Well think about it. They're
just not that many parts of a chicken. So you've got to back up and say, I think we've
complicated this. And what we want people to do by narrowing the focus on
members is taking a signed category and be the very best category bearer they can
be and buy the right items that work for the member.
So moving forward, we're going to be very clear on the member target.
So as you know today and you look at the slide, we've got 2 types of members. We
have Savings members, we have Business members. But when we dug in the data,
what we see is there's a lot of overlap with how they shop.
And for new sign-ups, about 74% of our members, when they sign up, they choose to
be Savings member. But when we look at the data, 95% of what members buy is
actually for the household. It's really a Savings member basket.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 27 of 66Now we do have strong relationships with businesses like restaurants, small oﬃces.
But again, when you take fuel and tobacco out of our business, 95% of the baskets
look like they're purchased for the household.
So we really have 1 member. And I want you to think of them like this. It's a busy
family, typically living in the suburbs of 1 or 2 incomes. They make somewhere
between $75,000 and $125,000 a year. They may own a couple of cars. They may be
employed or self-employed. They may own a small restaurant or run a small oﬃce
and purchase a few things for their business. But this is a big segment of our
business currently. And it's growing. They like us. And the numbers show it. Year-to-
date, they have the highest growth in club traﬃc. And they also have the highest
online sales penetration of any member segment we serve. And we believe if we can
become more special to this member group, we can earn a greater share of their
wallet.
So we're moving forward and we're moving quickly to align the entire business
around this more narrow focus. We're evaluating everything from our membership
oﬀering to our merchandise categories to our locations. And we've got some
important choices to make in the future.
So what's next? It's to improve our value proposition to that member, to present a
unique oﬀering and an experience that works with their lives. And I constantly talk to
our team about 3 priorities: people, product and digital.
And by people, we mean making Sam's Club an even better place to work and
empowering our associates to serve members, how associates are hired, developed
and trained to engage our members is critical to their success and ours. And we're
encouraging curiosity, ownership and new ideas.
By digital, we mean using technology to make Sam's Club an even better place to
shop and a better place work. And whether it's through auto-renewing your
membership or oﬀering easy reorder on the app, we'll continue to reduce friction for
members.
Now earlier, Doug mentioned the Workplace app. We use the app all over the
business. And we use it for collaboration, we use it for communication. And earlier
this year, we expanded the app to our entire fresh food team in the ﬁeld, including
the assistant managers who run fresh food in the business.
And what you'd see is they're using the app for managing inventory, they're sharing
ideas, they're driving competition around sales. And the thing that I say every week
is I'm just so impressed by the pride our associates show in their work. There's
nothing better than coming in on a Monday and see 20 or 30 or 40 photos of the
great things the associates are doing in the ﬁeld and how proud they are of their
work. So it's just an example of how digital can help us accelerate.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 28 of 66But what I really want to focus on today is product. We're a warehouse club. And
think about it, people don't come into us for a fancy environment or the white-glove
service. They come in for items. And having been a merchant at Sam's Club for many
years, I can tell you the way you win in this channel is you have the best items. You've
got to have the best items. And we've got to get that right.
And the key to it is our merchant team. We're raising the bar on talent and we're
getting into the details of every item, every package, every palate. And we're
curating a high-quality assortment that's practical, it's aspirational and it's on trend.
And as I said earlier, we're building momentum in fresh. We know it drives traﬃc. It
has a strong margin. And to win in this space, we've made some big investments
already. We put new team lead positions back into the clubs where we've got new
training programs to develop fresh experts and we're working on direct food
sourcing. And this work really helps us with a broader corporate strategy of Win in
Fresh all around the world.
And as I mentioned earlier, we're leaning into Member's Mark. And this gives us an
opportunity to diﬀerentiate ourselves and oﬀer superior quality, great products that
cement shoppers' loyalty. And the brand resonates well beyond the U.S. So whether
you're in our clubs in Mexico or China or our partnership with JD.com, it's driving
growth through the entire company.
Now last night at dinner, everything you ate from the club -- everything you ate came
from the club, from the beef tenderloin to the crab cakes to the shrimp, it all came
from the club. And your feedback lines up with what we're hearing from our
members. They're delighted about the quality and the scope of the oﬀering.
Now for the holidays, we're focused on getting exciting -- or focused on delivering
exciting items you can't get anywhere else. We've got great items like -- we've got
Member's Mark Christmas decor, the Viking, Copper cookware, cookies from
Europe. Over on the side over here, you see the cozy throw. And I'm telling you, it's a
great lineup. It's one of the best I've seen in years. And that's what's going to make
the diﬀerence for us: great items in a meaningful value that appeal to our target
member, you can't get anywhere else.
So let me leave you with these key takeaways.
First, we've got a focused strategy to accelerate growth. And we have an opportunity
to grow by serving one member. We're going to lead with agile technology. And we
are going to win with merchandising.
So along the way, we'll show you the progress through results. We've got a terriﬁc
team. I know they're up for the challenge. And we're looking forward to what's next.
Thanks for the time. And I'll see you in Q&A this afternoon. Thanks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. It is great to be here. And like Brett, I'm just about
coming up to my 18th anniversary with Walmart, always in international. And I
honestly did not think there's been a better time to be in this business.
If you only remember 3 words from the next 20 minutes or so, I'd like you to
remember strategy, momentum and leverage.
I think you'll see we have a very clear and consistent strategy in international, hasn't
changed that much over the last three years. That's driving great alignment for our
business.
But what I'll talk a bit more about is I think we have a clearer-than-ever
understanding of our role in the portfolio, in the corporate portfolio but also the role
of the individual countries within our portfolio.
In terms of momentum, we've got really good momentum. We've delivered
consistent results. You'll see, we'll talk about it in a bit more detail later. But we're
now on 14th consecutive quarters of seeing our (MAT) comp sales improve. We've
done that proﬁtably and also broad based across most of the metrics.
Maybe the most exciting of the 3 is leverage. And I'll touch on this throughout the
next 20 minutes. But there's more work going on in trying to work out how
international can lever oﬀ our core U.S. businesses and how those businesses can
beneﬁt through having an international portfolio than ever before. And I think that
gives us a unique advantage versus lots of the other competition we have both in
the U.S. and around the world.
So the strategy, you'll remember, is pretty consistent. Four big pillars. So ﬁrst of all,
we actively manage our existing portfolio. We deliver disciplined growth through
diﬀerentiated customer value propositions. We want to be the lowest cost operator
wherever we are. And we want to make sure that we build strong foundations.
We've worked very hard to understand our role in the portfolio. We think of it in
international as doing 3 things. We have access to a lot of high-growth markets
around the world. So we have to be a growth engine. So our ﬁrst and foremost role
is to grow ahead of the business and deliver cash growth. But we also have 2 other
really important roles to play in this corporation.
Second is to deliver talent. And it's one of the things I think we underestimate.
There's a million people working in the international business. We've placed over 25
oﬃces back into the U.S. business. And they may be associates who've gone out and
got some experience in international and come back to the U.S. core businesses or
have started international and gone into the U.S. business. What other businessFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 30 of 66around the world has the opportunity to give people that sort of experience or have
that breadth of talent that they can access from, that's a huge competitive edge.
The third area is in IP and ideas. We run over 60 diﬀerent businesses around the
world. And again, in terms of our core business, where else can you dip into that
diversity of business and expertise? And I always joke with Doug. But quite often, it's
very rare actually there's a problem we face in the U.S. that someone hasn't solved
somewhere out in the international business through those small entrepreneurial
markets. So 3 distinct contributions to the corporation.
In terms of our half year performance, it was a really strong ﬁrst half. Net sales were
up 3.2%. Now that excludes the impacts of some of the disposals, Suburbia and
Yihaodian. It would be1.6% including those.
But we see continued sales momentum. And I'm particularly encouraged that
momentum is coming from both Walmex and Canada. Walmex had a 5.5 comp in
the ﬁrst half. It's their 10th consecutive quarter of outperforming the industry in
Mexico. And that business really does go from strength to strength. If you saw the
releases this month, over 10% comp in the last releases. So very strong in Mexico.
Canada, 2% comp and a much more muted market. But again very strong. I think I'm
most encouraged about Canada is for the last few months, their tonnage growth has
been twice the level of their value growth. And we always like businesses where
we're moving volume ahead of our value growth. So very strong in Canada.
The U.K., as you know, has been a tough, tough market. But we're seeing a really
nice improvement there. First half comps were 1.8% positive. That's running against
minus 7 from last year. And if you've looked at some of the more recent market
shares, you see a very nice shape to it. We've seen really good increases in traﬃc.
We're now generating the most new customers of any of the big players in the U.K.
We're seeing our unit growth ahead of our value growth. And for the last 2 sets of 4-
week periods through Nielsen, we're taking value share again in that market. So
really encouraged by the progress in the U.K. although a lot to do.
And lots of really exciting things happening in China. Our growth is steady there. But
we're really excited about the partnership with JD. We've launched ﬂagship stores
for Sam's Club. We've just opened up our global store, which allows us to ship
product in from around the world and access the huge Chinese market. But
probably most excitingly is the partnership with Dada -- New Dada. And that's our
rapid delivery mechanism.
So there, we have 140 stores across China now, where from the time you press order
on your app to that being in your home is less than an hour. That requires us to pick
in 15 minutes.
And when you start to think about leverage, the amount of learning that we're
getting from China where e-commerce is moving so fast that can apply to ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 31 of 66businesses around the world and the U.S., I think it's going to be a signiﬁcant
competitive edge in the future.
So a really strong ﬁrst half.
I talked a bit about momentum. And this chart should give you an indication of this.
This looks at the 12-month rolling comp numbers. So it takes out some of the
variations with timings. But you can see for the last 3.5, four years now, we've not just
seen positive comp growth in international on a pegged basis. But we've seen that
improve quarter after quarter after quarter. And if you look at the rules there on the
side, they're the kind of things that Brett will challenge us on when he reviews the
business quarterly.
So our growth is coming -- it's good growth. So we're growing our comp sales more
than half of our growth. And that's coming a lot from very strong capital discipline.
If you looked under the hood in international, our overall CapEx has been coming
down high single digits for the last four years. But within that, our new store CapEx
has been reducing almost double that rate. We've gotten much more eﬃcient at how
we use it. And that's driving our comp sales. So comp sales more than 50% of
growth.
Our sales growth is ahead of our expense growth. So we leverage nicely in the ﬁrst
half. We'll leverage again in the second half. And I see that as a trend that we're
going to continue.
Our proﬁt growth is ahead of sales growth. And actually, throughout this 4-year
period, we've delivered proﬁt growth ahead of sales growth. Our sales growth is
ahead of inventory growth. And ﬁnally, our payables growth is ahead of inventory
growth.
So it's not just good momentum. But it's very broad-based momentum across
international, which we're really encouraged by.
So let's say a bit about the strategy and start with the portfolio.
Now you've seen us go through a number of iterations about how we think about
the portfolio. It's a pretty diverse portfolio. We operate in 27 countries around the
world, with over 50 diﬀerent formats but really kind of 12 or 13 core formats but very
complicated.
You remember we did some work three years or so ago, which looked at where is
growth going to come from around the globe. And we have access in the markets,
we're into about 55% of global growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 32 of 66The next 3 markets, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, not particularly attractive. And it then
gets to be a long tail after that. So early on, we've said, look, we're happy with the
markets we're in. We'd rather focus on winning in those markets than going to lots of
new markets.
You've seen us increasingly focus on where it matters and make some tough choices.
So rather than brieﬁng on every single country, we've put resources into the one that
matters. And if you remember, three years ago, Mexico and Canada were having
tough times. They're our big proﬁtable businesses, are adjacent to the U.S. We lent
in hard on those, made some tough choices in terms of investments in other markets
and got those businesses back on track.
What we've looked at over the last year or so is another way of looking at things.
And really, 2 things: what is the role that the markets play in the portfolio, their size,
their strategic advantage? But also looking market by market to say what is the
underlying strategic advantage for that market? So a great market might be one like
Chile. We have a dominant market share. There's a big informal market. So there's
this kind of engine room for growth that's going to keep going, has a really good
balanced portfolio. The portfolio is very well positioned. They have a distinct cost
advantage. That's a market that should be successful for a period of time. And you
can do that exercise across diﬀerent markets.
So we're now thinking of our markets into 4 -- 3 broad buckets. And I'll just take a bit
of time to talk about those over the next few minutes.
The ﬁrst is a strong North American core. And in there, we consider the markets
adjacent to the U.S.. So Mexico, Canada and (CAM). Our Focus there is, number one,
to strengthen our advantage. They're strong businesses. But we want to make sure
they remain strong. And there's none of those markets where we can't do better. So
for example, Mexico has strong market share overall. We tend to be a bit weaker in
the Northeast. So what could we do to address that? Mexico has very good cost
leverage. It's primarily done that by growing very fast. But some of the disciplines
that we've got across our portfolio in markets where growth has been more muted
like the U.K., we can help them be even better at managing the cost and reinvesting
in price. So you'll see us lead into those markets to not be complacent because
we're well positioned. But to get even stronger in those markets.
The second thing we'll do there is focus on leverage. And what you'll hear as we go
through this and hopefully in some of the other sessions, we're building structural
leverage advantages.
So whether it's on private label, the fact that John, Greg, myself, we all use the same
spec-ing system now. So imagine across North America, one database of specs, how
powerful that's going to be to look across the vendor base and see where there are
opportunities in terms of where we source product from.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 33 of 66Our global sourcing operation, we work together now to look at commodity
sourcing. So items that typically come from one place, olive oil, tuna, shrimp, those
sort of things. So you'll see us build structural ways to leverage both into the U.S. and
out of the U.S. on costs. That's the role of the strong North American core. It's a big
chunk of sales. It's above-average proﬁtability but obviously not the highest growth
markets.
I'll come back to the key growth markets in a second.
The rest of the portfolio is that diversiﬁed portfolio. It's pretty important to Walmart.
It's over 50% of the sales. It has access to kind of moderate global growth. It's
slightly below proﬁt.
And what we've looked at there on those markets is 2 things: What's the role of
those markets? What do they play in the business? So if international is about
growth, talent development and IP, what speciﬁcally are those markets doing to
bring value to the company?
And so that's been very helpful in helping the markets focus. So the U.K., for
example, it's not the most proﬁtable market. But it's a big market for us. It can
generate cash. So the work that the team have done there in improving our cash
ﬂow has been phenomenal. In fact, last year, it was our best market in terms of
improvements in cash ﬂow.
So ﬁrst of all, be very clear with those markets about what the contribution they make
to the business are and hold them accountable to that.
Then the second is to look at their underlying strategic advantage or disadvantage
and solve the issues where they have them. So Chile, very strong business. You'll
know -- again, some of the others, there are challenges and we'll look for ways either
to strengthen or look for partnerships as we have done in China to make sure that
those businesses are strong and viable for the foreseeable future.
In terms of the growth markets, I'm just going to focus on China. And really, what
we've tried to do in China and India, which are only 10% of our sales. But accounts
for the vast majority of growth that's going to occur around the globe, is make sure
that we, a, have a very clear strategy to win; and then, b, we put the resources behind
it to make sure that we can execute that strategy.
So 3 things to pick out on China. First of all, we've rebalanced the business quite
signiﬁcantly over the last three years. We used to have a business that tried to be
everywhere in China. We've got a very strong business in the Central South. We have
much better market shares. And not surprisingly, we have better proﬁtability in there.
And you've seen us over the last 2 or three years focus all our investment in new
stores into that area. So now 99% of our new store CapEx is in that south area whereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 34 of 66we are strong, dominant market shares and proﬁtable.
We have a regular cadence of looking at stores that are not performing. And it won't
surprise you to know that the stores that we've addressed in that are primarily
outside the area. So you see that business retrenching into an area where I think we
have much greater chance of winning, much more proﬁtable.
Second thing that we've looked at is our proposition within the market. And we've
made a lot of changes to our portfolio. So our supercenters, we've just opened a
couple of new concept stores (proto 80s). So they're 80,000 square foot just on one
ﬂoor rather than some of the multi-ﬂoor stores that we used to do.
And what we're seeing in those is we're taking somewhere in the region of 40% of
the space out, up to 50% of SKUs. But we're delivering not far oﬀ the sales at the old
(inaudible). So they are signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than the old boxes. And we will
look at diﬀerent formats.
In terms of the proposition, you'll see a relatively standard playbook. So working very
hard on starting to diﬀerentiate on prices. And I'm going to talk about how that's
funded in a minute across the whole international business. But in particular,
focusing hard on fresh and private label.
So in fresh, we've now completed the build-out of our dedicated fresh supply chain
that gives us an advantage versus pretty much anybody else in China in that we can
source together rather from local suppliers.
And since that landed, our fresh sales sequentially growing, now in the high single
digits. And of course the great thing about fresh growth is that brings traﬃc to your
stores and, therefore, drives growth across the rest of the proposition.
Private label is very underpenetrated in China. But you see businesses doing well on
private label. And there, we've lent in very hard, taken a lot of the best practice from
around the globe. We use the Great Value brand there. And we're seeing some very
strong double-digit growth on private label in China.
So we're feeling pretty good about the proposition that we're now presenting in
front of the Chinese population.
Then the ﬁnal one is omnichannel. And we took a decision, as you know, a bit over a
year ago to sell Yihaodian, which was a pretty small, fourth placed. And buy into JD.
And that so far has been a great, great partnership. As I say, we've launched ﬂagship
stores for Sam's Club. Sam's is doing over 5% of its volume online now. And that's
growing pretty dramatically. We've got a global store that allows us to connect
product from around the world into the Chinese market. We have an Asda site on
there. We have a Seiyu site from Japan as a high demand for things like Japanese
diapers in China. So those are giving us great new sources of revenue.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 35 of 66And the partnership with New Dada or in the rapid delivery, which I touched on at
the start, is perhaps the most exciting thing. Last month, we opened our ﬁrst (dark)
store, which is to take the Dada concept, take a very small unit with relatively low
rents because it's oﬀ the retail track, put 1,000 SKUs in there. And again, we're up to
250 orders out of that site in about a month, delivering very high satisfaction rates
and 90% of orders being delivered within an hour. So a real game changer in terms
of service. So we feel good about strategy.
The ﬁnal point on China is talent. And one of our most talented leaders in
international is Dirk Van den Berghe with a lot of experience. He ran the Canadian
market prior to this. We put Dirk in there. And we really have lent in hard to building
a very, very strong team of talent in China.
Okay. So let's move on to the other pillars. So pillar #2 is about disciplined growth
through the value proposition. And what you'll see around the globe is we've lent in
very hard to look at our formats. Now slightly diﬀerent executions as you go from
market to market. But generally, what you'll see is our prototypes are getting
signiﬁcantly smaller. We're making clear choices about where we think the customer
will shop in the future. We're always building omnichannel operations and, in many
cases, they are assortments that used to be in the stores that we believe we can fulﬁll
online and, therefore, make the stores more eﬃcient.
And typically, that would look like 80,000 square foot prototypes are now our norm
rather than 120,000 or 150,000. They tend to have a much more bias towards food
and consumables business than the previous ones. But general merchandise is still
critically important to those businesses. So as the food drives the traﬃc, they'll buy
general merchandise that has higher margin. And that gets the positive mix going.
So you'll see lots of innovation around the world in terms of our formats. But broadly
smaller and much more food and consumables orientated, which I think gives us
much more future prooﬁng around where customers are headed.
The rest is largely the blocking and tackling in retail. We've seen really good
progress in terms of price leadership. And I'm going to talk about the funding of
that. But in all our markets now, we're seeing our price position improve against key
competition. And that's starting to drive traﬃc.
Very focused on fresh. And we took a decision a couple of years ago to start moving
back up the supply chain to take cost out. So across international, we have over 58
food upstreaming facilities. So those are primarily in deli, bakery, meat. And that's
where we go back up the supply chain to look to take cost out. And in some cases,
that's taking out middlemen. In some cases, it's an open-book relationship. In some
cases, we own the facilities and we actually do the meat cutting ourselves. But it's
allowing us to have a much better control on the quality. It's taking labor out of
stores and it's taking out the unpredictability of multiple production facilities in an
area of much more scrutiny on food safety.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 36 of 66And most importantly is starting to strip cost out of our fresh operation. So around
1/3 of our volume on those categories now comes through upstreamed operations;
in places like the U.K., much higher. And that's something we will continue to drive.
We're seeing great progress on private brand. And again, the advantage of our
portfolio, we have penetrations that range from the mid-40s in the U.K. of private
label, down to low single digits in countries like China. And therefore, we're able to
take the best practice of the markets that have been doing this a long time. And our
private label business now is growing in the 20s . And again, really important
because it's high margin, as that grows ahead of the mix, it starts to generate funds
that you can reinvest in price.
Then ﬁnally, very focused on Online Grocery in all our markets around the world for
all the same reasons that Marc shared with you at the start. It allows us to use our
existing asset base, which is a signiﬁcant edge versus most competition. And again,
we're seeing very strong growth in our Online Grocery business across the various
markets.
So we feel good about the value proposition in markets and feel like we're now
starting to build a business that is starting to get positioned for where the consumers
are moving to rather than where they've been.
In terms of lowest cost operations, a couple of things to share here.
We kicked oﬀ a couple of years ago a cost of goods reduction program called cost
analytics, which was essentially a much more fact-based approach to our
negotiations with both vendors, whether they're big-branded vendors or private
label vendors. And we've seen really good success in terms of improving the cost of
the goods that we procure.
So that program is now rolled out to all our markets. And as I say, see really good
progress in terms of how that's helping us reduce our cost of goods.
Sourcing is really exciting. So international runs sourcing for the whole corporation.
And we've kind of split that into a couple of buckets. So on food commodities,
you're seeing a lot more collaboration between Sam's U.S., Greg's business and
international to look at things like tuna, olive oil, where it's largely sourced from one
part of the business and start to get us to buy together. And where we buy together,
not surprisingly, we're seeing signiﬁcant cost savings. And the specs are broadly the
same.
The second then is around private brand. And particularly we're thinking about our
North American core. One of the advantages of that from a synergy perspective is
the vast majority of production is North American. And therefore, our ability to look
and compare prices between Canada or, in some cases, Mexico with the U.S. in our
businesses is starting to throw up lots of opportunities where we can consolidate our
private brand sourcing, take cost out of our business and reinvest in price.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 37 of 66Then ﬁnally, on general merchandise and apparel, we have sourcing oﬃces around
the globe. And again, much more collaboration between those units about the specs
and harmonizing specs.
Now I'll talk to you about structural advantages. Two things that structurally are
driving this: One is all our private brand on a system called the (hive). So we have
one view of specs. So we're able to look and see where there are minor diﬀerences,
what would it take to harmonize those, what's the beneﬁt of doing that. And the
second is a tool called buyer connect, which is a tech-based tool that makes it very
easy for our buyers both in that core but also in other markets to see what everybody
else is buying, look for discrepancies and then start to collaborate. So again, not just
opportunistic. But structural advantage in our sourcing.
On our SG&A reduction. Again, we leveraged ﬁrst half. We will the second half. And I
anticipate that continuing. We're seeing great leverage in the stores. I think we've
done a really nice job at making some of the trade-oﬀs. And often you can squeeze
cost. But if you reengineer out by looking at inventory, by looking at the assortment
we carry, by making distinct choices about categories, we're able to see sustainable
changes that not only give us funds to reinvest in price but also improve the
proposition for customers.
We've done a lot of work with supply chain. We have a global center of excellence
now, which kind of shares best practice across the markets. And over the last three
years, we've taken 20 basis points out of our distribution cost to sell. And that's been
kind of -- from both sides of the equation, we're more productive in our distribution
centers where we do a lot of benchmarking now both within international markets
but also with Greg's team in the U.S.. But it's also on the transportation side where
we've got signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient, again, by sharing best practice.
And you're starting to see more synergy across things like goods enough for resell,
again by thinking about the North American core. And I think the big advantage
about this is we've talked for years, as long as I can remember in Walmart, about how
we leverage. And we tended to ﬁnd it's just too big a leap to go from U.S. to then
incorporate 27 diﬀerent countries that all have their own way of doing things and
often the production facilities are diﬀerent. But that North American core is the bulk
of our volume. It's much easier to start getting some momentum. And it's been much
easier -- and I think with the collaboration we've seen from both Greg and John, I
think this is something you're going to see grow and grow and grow.
Finally, just to touch on then, building strong foundations is our fourth pillar. I'm
really encouraged by the talent in international. Our CEOs speak 15 languages. 75%
of all our CEOs have worked in diﬀerent disciplines, diﬀerent industries. 100% of
them worked in diﬀerent disciplines across retailing. 100% of them have worked and
lived in more than one market. And that brings a breadth of experience and an
open-mindedness to all of that diversity that I think is a huge competitive edge for
us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 38 of 66As I said at the start, we've imported or exported 25 oﬃces back into the U.S.
business, some like John Furner who go away and get some experience of living and
working in a very diﬀerent market like China and some like Judith McKenna who
grew up international and came across to the U.S. business. But in every case, what a
unique competitive edge to have access to over 1 million associates working in all
corners of the world or the opportunity to get people to come and work in one of
your businesses and get a diﬀerent perspective on the way the world is changing.
So I feel really good about the talent we're building. I think most encouragingly,
Doug, is not only we exporting that. But that pipeline is ﬁlling. So we still see more
talent to come.
In terms of building trust, I'll just spend a couple of minutes talking about
compliance. And I know Jeﬀ, sometimes people start yawning when you talk about
compliance. Compliance is not just a protective initiative for us. It's an oﬀensive
initiative. And the progress that we've made in collaboration with Jeﬀ's team to build
processes and talent that make sure we get things right ﬁrst time is a signiﬁcant
competitive edge for this business. And I'll just pick out a couple of examples.
One of our strengths is health and safety. As that's now starting to play out, Mexico,
for example, has seen a 30% reduction in one year on accidents, 30%. Now imagine
what that does for morale in that business. Imagine what it does for cost. Imagine
what it does for productivity. So it's delivering real beneﬁt for the business.
Food safety is the other example, which is really important. And much more high
proﬁle around the globe. On food safety now, we use the GFSI, the Global Food
Safety Initiative, which is a pretty high bar in terms of eﬃciency. And with Jeﬀ's teams
help, we now have -- over 90% of all our private brands are GFSI certiﬁed. Over 85%
of all our manufacturing facilities are GSFI certiﬁed. Those are standards that mean
our customers have more surety, better quality product, more eﬃciently made and,
as I say, is a real competitive advantage.
On sustainability, Doug touched on that at the start. But we continue to see great
progress. Nearly 80% of all the waste that's generate in our stores around the globe
is now recycled. And you think of the fact that we're in a lot of emerging markets,
that's a tremendous achievement. We're 20% more eﬃcient in our stores from an
energy perspective than we were ﬁve years ago. And like the U.S., we do a lot of
good work in terms of making sure that the waste that we do generate can be
recycled and go to our partnerships with some of the food recycling agencies
around the world.
Then the ﬁnal point on our foundations is we're doing an awful lot on automation
and eﬃciency. And I always think there is no better business than retail to take
advantage of what's happening in technology because it's an open-ended business.
Most of our processes have an inﬁnite amount of work. Forecasting has an inﬁnite
amount of work. Assortment has an inﬁnite amount of work. I mean, you could work
24 hours, 365 days a year and never get the work done. But when you take thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 39 of 66Gregory S. Foransweet spot of a business that has years and years of experience about how to do
things and you get technologies to code that experience and deploy it both across
the business to people who are less experienced and make it work for you 24 hours
a day, 365 days a year, you get signiﬁcant improvements.
So key takeaways for you from international. We have a very consistent strategy. I
think we have our clearest view of our role within the Walmart portfolio and the role
of our markets within our portfolio. We have very strong momentum in the business.
It's broad based. All of our metrics are performing well. And I think, increasingly,
you're going to see us as a business that is positioned to win through the talent,
through the diﬀerentiated customer propositions. And I'm probably more optimistic
about international at this point in time than I have been at any stage over the last
four years.
So thank you very much. And enjoy the rest of the day.

{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Good morning. Thank you, all for being here today. There's a lot to share. So let me
get right to it.
I want to begin, though, by recognizing my leadership team. And I also want to
recognize all our associates because I can tell you that nothing happens without
them. And the progress that you're going to hear me talk about is the result of all of
their hard work.
We developed a sound strategy, which we executed extremely well. And of course,
the customer is #1. Serving customers is what we do. That's why we get up every
single morning.
I think if you ask anyone around here what my mantra is, I'm pretty sure they'd tell
you that it's this: you get 1 point for talking. And you get 9 points for doing. And I
believe that, that sums up the story of the U.S. business for the last 2.5 years. Back in
2015, we took a few minutes to tell you about what we were going to do and then
we've spent the rest of the time doing it. And that's working. Customers are
responding. And we have some good momentum.
The core strategy that we outlined in 2015 will continue to guide our future work.
Because our success to this point has opened up new opportunities, we'll reﬁne our
strategy accordingly to ensure that we're positioned to take full advantage of them.
Before taking you through the future plans, let me give you a quick look at our
performance for the ﬁrst half of this year and then how we performed over the last
2.5 years against our broader strategic goals.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 40 of 66In the ﬁrst half, we saw positive metrics -- positive results across key metrics. We
increased net sales, comp sales and comp traﬃc. And our stores, as you've heard,
are creating expense leverage, which is allowing for strategic investments in e-
commerce to continue to gain traction.
We've made signiﬁcant progress on inventory, while at the same time, maintaining
high in-stock levels for customers. We continue to remove friction from the customer
experience by expanding pickup and delivery for Online Grocery and general
merchandise. If I had to summarize these accomplishments in terms of what they
mean for the customer, I'd say this: we're making every day easier for busy families.
And I'm equally happy with our report card for the past 2.5 years. We told you that
we would improve customer experience. We did. Net promoter scores are up 1,100
basis points from 2015. We told you we'd reduce inventory and improve in-stock. We
did. As of Q2, comp store inventory is down approximately 10% on a stacked basis
from two years ago.
Scores for on-shelf customer availability and on time and inﬁll from suppliers is up.
We said we'd increase the quality of the private brands. We did. We invested in
talent and capabilities like the new Culinary & Innovation Center to elevate private
brands. Private brand penetration is growing in both fresh and general merchandise.
We said we'd drive EDLC by negotiating better merchandise costs. We did. We said
we'd invest in price, we did. And we're on track for several billions of dollars of
investment.
Let me be clear, though. We've made a solid start in these areas and we've given
ourselves some momentum. But we're not ﬁnished. And there are a few areas where
we can do better.
Expenses. We've gotten some low-hanging fruit. But there's more headroom. In
comp sales, we're pleased with 12 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales. But I
can tell you we're not satisﬁed, more needs to be done.
So again, I think the results are respectable. And it shows our core strategy is
working and it's given us some momentum. And that strategy will continue to guide
our future.
As I said at the top, the progress we've made to date has put us in a position to take
the next step. So now we must begin moving from a mindset of ﬁxing to a mindset of
leading.
And here's what I mean. Firstly, two years ago, we committed to running great stores.
And we'll continue to do so with a mindset of a leader that knows for us that stores
are the foundation upon which will shape the future of retail.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 41 of 66Secondly, we'll continue to deliver value but with a mindset of a leader who
understands while the deﬁnition of value might change, the underlying principle of
value will not. It's the essence of who we are.
Thirdly, we'll remain true to our purpose of being great merchants. But we'll do that
with the insight that as merchants, we're operating in a new model of retail. And its
currency is trust.
And fourthly, we'll continue to provide convenience but with the mindset of a leader
who understands that for today's customer, the experience we create has to be easy,
fast, friendly and fun. Getting there will require us to remove friction from the
shopping experience by blending online and in-store to create a model of
converged retail.
Now let's take a close look at our plan to win.
Running great stores. Central to the progress we've made has been our focus on
inventory. And before I get into the technical side of what we did in that regard, I
want to quickly paint a picture that underscores the importance of getting inventory
right. By improving inventory, we gave associates a chance to succeed. Doing
section work is almost impossible if you can't walk through a backroom. You have no
motivation to ﬁnd an item for a customer if you think it's head and deep behind 3 or
4 pallets. Fixing inventory breeds life back into the store.
From an operational standpoint, we accomplish this by working on ﬂow from
distribution centers to the store. We've improved processes such as top stock,
customer availability, fast signing. And of course, we've provided associates with
new technologies. So far this year, we've released 12 new or enhanced apps. And
through this combination of new processes, such as those around price changes and
apps like the inventory management tool, we've improved the productivity in stores.
Our volume-producing items, or VPI app, which incentivizes our associates to drive
sales, has been really well received. In the 52 days since it was launched, 150,000
items have been submitted. Now that compares to a total of 146,000 submissions for
all of last year. Each of these areas are important. And we'll keep after them.
But that work was done with a ﬁx mentality. So what does reducing inventory mean
when approached with a lead mindset? Well for one thing, when you improve
inventory, you change the customer experience. Fresh is perhaps an area where this
makes the most visible diﬀerence to customers. Another example is the backroom.
When you have empty backrooms, you've got additional space to do things like
rollout Online Grocery for either pickup or delivery. And it becomes much easier to
accept and handle returns. And you can also think about oﬀering more service
through the box, perhaps expanding things like mobile phone repair or building out
ﬁnancial service oﬀerings.
As Doug mentioned, we're on track to build 200 academies this year. So far, we've
stood up 187 of them. 125 of them were built inside the store using the space freedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 42 of 66up from inventory reductions.
Now let me talk about delivering value. While everything else in retail is changing,
one thing that will not is our commitment to delivering value to the customer.
Price investments are a key part of the plan. And as we said back in 2015, we are
investing several billion dollars in price. We're pleased with how it's progressing.
And we will maintain that approach.
Our ability to sell for less, of course, starts with buying for less and operating for less.
In short, EDLC equals EDLP. And this equation fuels our productivity lead. Now if it's
the ﬁx have gotten the Walmart wheel moving. We've accelerated our front-end
transformation including more self-checkouts. And we're progressing with Scan &
Go. We're increasing automation and robotics in our distribution centers to usher in
the next phase of supply chain eﬃciency.
And we're upscaling our talent right across the business to enable associates to
spend more time serving customers in new ways and engaging them in more
personal interactions.
A quick point on how we're approaching this with a leadership mindset. 50 years
ago when you went shopping, it was a one-to-one relationship. The shopkeeper
knew you. And you knew the shopkeeper. With the inception of the department
store and the grocery store came a shift. And the relationship became 1 to many.
Digitization, however, allows these relationships to become 1 to 1 again but at scale.
So what does leading look like? Well 2 great example. Self-checkout hosts and
personal shoppers in Online Grocery. two years ago, we didn't have any dedicated
self-checkout hosts. We now have over 17,000 of them in 4,192 stores. two years ago,
we didn't have any personal shoppers. We now have more than 18,000. These roles
foster a one-to-one relationship. And they've been made possible by eﬃciencies
resulting from technology.
Next, being great merchants and the currency of trust. Today, through
crowdsourcing, we don't give a second thought to hopping into a stranger's car.
And expecting we'll end up where we want to be, Uber. We think nothing of making
a reservation and sleeping in a stranger's house, Airbnb. Based on a digital image of
a product on a website, we transfer sometimes large sums of money to an account
and expect that the actual product will show up at our house, e-commerce.
And 2 weeks ago, we announced the partnership with August Home to test a service
in which a customer allows a delivery person to enter their homes when they're not
there in order to stock their pantries and refrigerators. That's trust. As merchants
today, we're operating in a marketplace where trust is a currency nearly as valuable
as money.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 43 of 66Now over the years, we have earned the trust of customers by consistently delivering
a great assortment of quality merchandise at a great price. As leaders, however, we
need to push ourselves further on quality.
This is especially so in fresh. And we have a robust program of work in the pipeline.
Through our fresh network speed pilot, we're deepening our relationship, our
partnership with suppliers to move the product through the supply chain faster. The
result of this pilot is an average of 2 to 3 additional days of freshness to the
customer, with up to four days of additional freshness in strawberries.
There's also private brand quality improvement. Through the Culinary & Innovation
Center, we're rigorously testing each of our private brands against all our
competitors and continually bringing innovation to our oﬀerings. In apparel, we're
going to have some new news in the coming months about new brands: simpler
assortments, new layout and signing elements.
And the other big piece of the equation is convenience. As time increasingly
becomes as valuable as money, we have to build trust with customers by letting
them know we're focused on saving them both. We have to let them know we're
making every day easier for busy families. That means providing convenience. And
I'll talk more about that in a moment.
Building trust with associates. The trust associates have in us sets the tone for the
relationships they establish with our customers. We've reinforced this by taking a
number of actions which we believe help empower them. We started with wage
investments. We implemented structural changes like bringing back department
manager roles. Academies are almost fully implemented. We're driving on time and
in full to support our Customer Availability Program. We're improving the
distribution of merchandise to ensure better store response times.
And ﬁnally, as a leader, we're building trust in the communities in which we live and
where we operate.
So we've made it a priority to be there in times of crisis, when they need us and
where they need us anywhere around the globe.
Finally, providing convenience, easy, fast, friendly and fun. The 3 areas that I've
spoken about to this point, stores, value and merchants, they combine to form a new
kind of customer experience.
But in order to assert our position as leaders, we need to build a model of
converged retail in which the online and the in-store experience form a frictionless
interaction with our customers. The goal is to provide customers with a retail
experience that is easy, fast, friendly and fun. But we need to do this at scale. We
have already begun. Over the course of the past year, we have launched a number
of e-commerce initiatives, such as the ones that Marc spoke about previously. And
they're designed to deliver convenience, Free 2-Day Shipping, Pickup Discount,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

Page 44 of 66delivery with Uber. But we're also going to leverage our stores more to expand our
omnichannel oﬀering. Online Grocery will be in 1,100 stores by year's end. And we'll
add another 1,000 locations next year. We're also testing other ways for customers to
use our pickup oﬀering, including towers and lockers. We've nearly got 50 towers up
and running now. And we're on track to have 100 installed by the holiday.
Let me take just a moment to drill down on Online Grocery. It's taking hold.
Customers that use it have a bigger basket size versus customers who only shop in
the store. At the same time, it has a halo eﬀect on the stores. Stores with online
grocery have a higher product availability and sales than stores without it. And it's
also attracting new customers to Walmart, which gives us an opportunity to earn
greater share of wallet.
We're also beginning to have some success making the in-store experience easier
and faster by providing more services through the app. Walmart Pay is now the
second-largest payment service by usage. And we'll continue to focus on it as a way
of helping us drive our digital relationships with customers.
Finally, our Mobile Express Money Services are in all stores and Mobile Express
Pharmacy will be chain-wide by the year-end. Mobile Express Scan & Go is in 25
stores. And as you know, Mobile Express Returns were launched yesterday. We'll
continue to provide convenience by building a model of converged retail through
innovation. Through our 4,741 stores and growing set of online assets, we are in a
unique position to do this at scale. The data point that Doug referenced bears
repeating. Customers who shop with us, both online and in-store, spend around
twice as much as a customer who only shops with us in the store. As we ﬁnd other
ways to extend converged retail solutions for our customers, we're going to
accelerate our eﬀorts.
That brings me to our ﬁnancials and our expectations for FY '19, driving growth
eﬃciently. We want to serve customers how, when and where they want. We believe
that with our current ﬂeet of supercenters and neighborhood markets, combined
with the expanding set of online assets, we're in a strong position to do just that. Last
year, we said we would open fewer new stores in the U.S. As we continue to examine
the landscape and our overall strong position, we now anticipate opening fewer than
15 supercenters and fewer than 10 neighborhood markets in ﬁscal 2019. This is
consistent with strong eﬃcient growth and it allows us to allocate capital more to
remodels, supply chain and technology.
In terms of remodels, we'll continue our focus there by investing in 500 of these
projects next year. They enable us to leverage our store assets more eﬀectively to
meet customers' needs. And ﬁnally, as we've mentioned, we'll accelerate the
expansion of Online Grocery to 1,000 additional locations.
So here's what we're going to do this coming year. We are going to continue our
journey from ﬁxed to lead by building on the successes of the past three years,
running the play, investing in growth and leaning into innovation. Doing these thingsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

I did. All right. So we'll have about 45 minutes or so of Q&A. So when you have a

Pete Benedict.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Peter Benedict, Robert Baird. Doug, want to get your view on the U.S. wage
environment. You guys moved a few years ago, kind of get in front of things. There's
been some movement by others here in the last several months. So just how do you
view the trajectory of U.S. wages and how that ﬁts kind of into the ﬁnancial algorithm
you guys have?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Sure. I'm sure Greg and maybe Judith would want to complement whatever it is I
have to say. But I feel great about the fact that we moved when we did and the
boldness with which we took that action. And I think the way that associates feel
about our level of support for them is diﬀerent than it was before that action. And as
we've moved on to training and creating better tools and things like that, the ground
was prepared for that kind of activity. As we look forward, I think wages are going toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

A - C. Douglas McMilloncontinue to move. And I see that as a good thing. And I think some of the work that
we have underway as it relates to productivity positions us well to be able to thrive in
that kind of environment. I think a lot of information has been shared today about
some ideas that we have on how technology and training can play a role going
forward. Greg, anything you want to add to that?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
It's a competitive market out there. And at any given point in time, we're adjusting
wage rates in order to attract the right talent. And we know that getting the right
talent in our stores is critical to allowing us to win. And Judith, you want to make a
few comments?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yes, can do. That is exactly right. There's not a lot to add from a wage environment
perspective. The other thing that we're working hard to do though, as you've seen
through the academies, is the training part for our associates, which is a diﬀerentiator
for us. But also the fact that we can give opportunity to people to promote and
promote through. And that's another way that we can help people earn more by
working for us as well.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
In case you don't know, Judith is our Chief Operating Oﬃcer for the U.S. business.
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
I was just going to add. As well as the wages, we see the trend around the globe. As
you see growth rates muted, mobility tends to go -- social mobility tends to go
down. So wages are really important. But I think as well, the opportunity that we give
people from whatever background, they come to progress their lives and their
careers is a huge motivator at the moment.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
So I think, Peter, in summary, wages, after we made the change, kept moving in a
more incremental fashion. And we've been adjusting to that market by market and
we'll continue to do that.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. Doug, thinking 3 to ﬁve years, wanted to ask, what
does success look like for Walmart? Is the ﬁnancial picture that you're projecting for

with growing share over time but holding margins ﬂat?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Brett, you can chime in, too, if you want to. I think the ﬁrst thing I would say is that this
is a really ﬂuid environment. And we don't want to paint ourselves into a corner as it
relates to ﬂexibility. And I think we've shared with you how we feel about next year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

A - Brett M. BiggsAs we look beyond that, I think the way that we think about it is, we must make sure
that we're doing what's necessary to earn customers business. Growth in comp
stores and through e-commerce is a real priority for this company. If and as we do
that, we can learn how to manage expenses and we can deliver proﬁtability at an
appropriate rate. So we'll stay ﬂuid. We'll stay open. We'll communicate with you as
best we can. And we're conﬁdent as it relates to next year's plan.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I mean, as an executive committee team, we spend a lot of time talking about how
do we balance out what we're trying to do long term, which is make this business
incredibly successful well past our careers. But then how we can grow the value of
the company, which I talked about this morning over that same period of time. The
good thing for us is, we have a lot of diﬀerent levers that we can use to get to that
answer. So when we -- this morning, I was trying to give you some framework around
operating income margin to give you something to kind of -- to put a framework
around it, there's just a lot of pieces within that. And I think as Doug said, well, we
just need that ﬂexibility, want that ﬂexibility. It could be diﬀerent margins. It could be
diﬀerent SG&A. There's a lot of diﬀerent ways to get to the same place. But we like
the direction we're heading.
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
Okay. Let's go here. We're going to stay on this side of the room and then we'll work
our way over.
{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. So following up on the margin question. You're implying
gross margin down next year a little bit, a little bit of SG&A leverage. It sounds like it
doesn't necessarily have to be that way, you're going to manage the EBIT line. But
can you talk speciﬁcally about the puts and takes in gross margin? Is mix negative? Is
price investment negative? Is supply chain positive? Like how are you thinking about
the diﬀerent variables within it?

Maybe you want me -- you want to start? Let me kick or...

No. I'll go last.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Okay. You'll go last. I'll start, maybe Greg, you might want to talk a little bit about it.
So when we gave you kind of a range of how we think about operating income
margin. As we talked about, there's -- the answer I just gave, there's a lot of variables
that go into how we get there. In almost any circumstance in which we would
discuss, having expenses be in a better place can provide fuel. It just gives us
options to do diﬀerent things within the P&L. So do I think gross margins have to go
down next year? No. And I don't think we imply that. Could they go down? Yes. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

Q - Robert Frederick Ohmeswe want that ﬂexibility to be able to do that. Over time, the customer and the
competitors are going to determine where gross margins, to some degree, need to
be for the company. And we need to be ready for what that needs to be, what we
want it to be and expenses play a big part in that. So we're trying to give you enough
frameworks. But as Doug said, just not get ourselves tied into how we get there as
much. And Greg can talk -- there's a lot of things that go into gross margin. And
Greg can talk a little bit about that.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Brett, it was interesting, Michael and I were going through, because we got a budget
meeting tomorrow. And we were having a look at the plan that we put forward with
Michael, three years ago. And the interesting thing is that the bottom line is almost
exactly where we said we were going to be. But the shape of it, Michael, is a little bit
diﬀerent. So we thought we'd do a little bit better with comp sales. And we didn't.
We were able to do a little bit better with some expenses than what we thought we
could do. And the margin was a little bit diﬀerent. So the point is, we build the plan
and we'd say, this is what we're going to do with fresh throws. And this is what we're
going to achieve in terms of leverage with suppliers. And this is what we think,
Judith, we're going to achieve in terms of unknown shrinkage when we take our
stock. And Steve, this is how much we've got to invest in price and then we work out
how we're going to do that. So we're pretty diligent about how we pull all that
together. Then, of course, you have to deal with the dynamics of the market. And as
you say, there are always puts and takes. Those are the component pieces. And
there're many others, by the way, that goes into it. But we would sit down as a
leadership group, we do it every Monday, actually, every Monday afternoon. And
we'll look at the business and Michael and his team help pull the numbers together
with Steve and Judith and Julie and Greg. And we'll make decisions, not on the ﬂy,
really thoughtful, sensible decisions that take into account longer-term requirements
and shorter-term needs. And that's how we do it.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
It's not a perfect analogy. But Brett and I were talking a little bit ago about what it's
like to ﬂy an airplane. And we're going to land over there and that's about 5% EPS
growth. How we get from there, we know. The winds may change a little bit on us.
And we've got this dashboard with all these variables on it. And I was just thinking
about that actually, there's a big plane, that's the total company. But everybody else
is ﬂying planes in formation and we're all like, hey, how you're doing on fuel over
there? And we're adjusting basically monthly as we think about margins and price
investments and things like that. And as we've said many times now, we just want
enough ﬂexibility in this environment that's changing so much to be able to get
there in a high-quality way.

A - Gregory S. ForanRobbie Ohmes, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Question for Marc and Greg. You
guys are sitting at opposite sides here. But as I listen to all of the presentations, the
key seems to me when you give us that 2x for the person that's omnichannel, the key
seems to be how quickly you can convert store customers to store plus online
customers. So my questions would be, number one, any metrics on that? How
quickly are you getting store-only shoppers to become store and online? Number
two, are there some initiatives that you both are independently and also together
working on to accelerate getting those store shoppers to convert online? And is
there any reason that you've maybe been holding oﬀ? Are you waiting to get
infrastructure to a certain place before you really make a bigger push to do that?
Just any more color you can give us would be terriﬁc.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Going to start that?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. I think if you look at the top line growth that we've seen in the ﬁrst half and what
we're projecting next year, that's really just a function of 2 things, it's getting more
people to shop for the ﬁrst time on the website and then improving cohort behavior.
And we're seeing, on both, positive results. So I think the strategy that we've set out
is working. Yes. There's more we can be doing to market speciﬁcally to the store
shopper. But I feel good about our approach right now.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
We've got a core customer in our business. And I'm talking just stores here. And a lot
of that is location-driven. You know that we're strong rurally in terms of our stores.
And a lot of our focus, Judith and Steve and their teams have been working on is
let's make sure we do a good job of serving them. We also know that there's an
opportunity to attract some new customers into our business. And we quite often
see these people shopping with us when there're events, like Halloween or
Christmas. Or they may come in and buy grocery because they know the price is
really good. But they don't trust us on fresh foods. Or they may come in and buy
gardening. But they don't buy our apparel because they don't like the taste or the
style that we've got. So as we look at that customer base, we're saying to ourselves,
we can do a much better job attracting those. And one of the things that we think is
also pretty powerful with that group is generally they've got a little bit more money
and they are quite strong omni shoppers, they shop in-store and they shop online.
And in some cases, they're shopping online with Walmart. In other cases, they're
shopping with our competitors. We need to get them to become advocates for our
business. And we think that is a powerful idea. So we're working really closely
together. And Doug's involved with us and so are many of Doug's team. So Ashley
down the back there is helping us pull something together. Sloan, who's part of
Marc's team. And we're meeting regularly on this. Now we'll get 1 point for talking
about it, 9 points for doing it. Is it a big idea? Yes. We now have to break that down
into pieces that are digestible and manageable. And it doesn't mean that we haven't
been doing that. But we're now going to sharpen our focus on this and go after it.
And I think it could be quite powerful if we can pull it oﬀ. It will be a number ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

So imagine that Venn diagram that overlaps between stores and e-commerce and
the initiatives that you're seeing so far that fall into the overlap, Online Grocery, use
the app, use the site, pick it up in the store, Walmart Pay, the digitization of the

with your prescriptions. The tire, lube express area being more automated. Someday
you'll be able to digitize the experience at the bakery as you're doing a cake. There's

about fulﬁllment costs generally, the expectation on the SG&A line and where the
opportunities exist as you think about the last mile with the Parcel acquisition and

expense pressure that comes along with the last mile.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Marc, do you want to go ﬁrst?

Sure, yes. I mean, the vast majority of the fulﬁllment expenses right now would be in

processes and invest in additional automation. And we have plans to do that. So I
suspect it will only get better over time. With respect to the last mile and leveraging
Uber and Deliv and even our own associates, currently, with the Online Grocery app,
we're passing those costs on in the form of a fee to deliver. So we don't necessarily
see that being a big increase in costs going forward.

Yes. So it's a big -- as I talked about the discussions we have as a leadership team, it's
a big part of what we discuss and understand certainly from an investor's standpoint
that you want to see our returns grow over time. And it's why -- it's really the genesis
of what we talk about with the ﬁnancial framework and it starts with how we grow,
how we grow makes a diﬀerence. 3% sales growth, when we can get that through e-
commerce or through comps, is diﬀerent than getting it all through new stores. It's a
big diﬀerence from a return standpoint. We're going to continue -- and you saw this
in the slides, Karen, we're going to continue to invest where it makes sense. We're
going to lean in into places like technology. We're going to lean in to supply chain.
We're going to continue to lean in e-commerce. We're going to invest money in
international stores. But as we make -- as we have those discussions and we debate
that amongst the team, return on capital is a big part of those discussions. We do
feel like the direction we're taking gets us to where we want to be and where you
would like us to be in kind of the mid to long term. We're not going to sit here and
say what ROI is going to be next year. But we feel like we're going in the right

big focus for us and we're going to continue to push. And we think we have more
opportunity to continue to reduce inventory throughout the supply chain, what we
buy in our DCs, all the way through to the stores, to make it easier for our associates.
So that's going to continue to be a big focus for us. In terms of working capital, in
general, we continue to work on it. We had a big push on terms allowances with our
suppliers, which made a diﬀerence, quite frankly, in working capital. And there's
more to do there. We're continuing to push on that and continuing to work on that.
But we think we can continue to focus on and drive improvement. But inventory
remains as big a focus today and tomorrow as it was in the past.
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
From an international perspective, we're seeing really good progress this year. So
our inventory in the ﬁrst half was growing less than half the rate of sales. We're also
seeing good working capital management. And Rich, don't know whether you want
to add a few words because you've been leading a lot of good work on cash
management.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Richard's our international CFO.
{BIO 17560921 <GO>}
Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Dave. Yes. We put a big focus on to working capital really
starting in about the middle of last year. We set a pretty tough target this year and
almost exceeded it by the midyear. Probably 2/3 of that improvement is in payables
rather than inventory. But you see, we've been improving on both. Dave talked about
the Q2 results. So we saw inventory actually well below half the sales growth rate
and payables growing signiﬁcantly faster than sales. And while we focus on
payables, I think it's worth saying, we've got some markets doing a great job on
inventories. So Canada would be one example, where with growth in that market,
we've seen dollar inventory down year-on-year. All I would add is that we would see
a signiﬁcant amount of opportunity in the year ahead. So I think you'll see the focus
shift more from payables to inventory across the markets. But I think we've still got
plenty of runway to go.
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
And I think the big thing you've learned, Rich, is the importance of making clear
choices rather just squeezing. So some of the work we've done on assortment
choices, being really, really focused using technology to get much clearer about
what the customer really wants and where they would actually substitute are allowing
us to make good, sensible changes without just simply squeezing this. They're
genuine cost savings that are sustainable.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
And Matt, just on your overall question. So go back last year, we had an operating

especially with Google. So I suspect, although we don't know for sure, that a majority
of the volume is coming from people who already shopped on the Internet who are
now changing and moving to shop on Walmart.com. I'm sure as well that goes for
store shoppers. But most of our marketing is geared to existing e-com shoppers.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
From 1 to 10 in our use of data, I would say we're probably about a 2. We use data to
improve in-stock and replenishment. We don't use data to personalize. And with our
EDLP roots, we made a conscious decision not to do a lot of couponing, either in the
physical world or digitally. I don't personally believe that that builds loyalty and we
want to build trust. And we want to build loyalty. Having said that, I think in this
world, we need to kind of push refresh on our minds as it relates to that, not that we
should do couponing. But we should be very open to personalization. Greg, I
thought, did a nice job describing one-to-many and one-to-one at scale. And so
we've got a lot of work to do. And it's going to be a multiyear journey to get our data
into shape, organized, collected, cleaned so that we can actually use it. And there's
been more discussion as of late about our data strategy. And the way it feels to me is
that we've been taking care of some basics to get the business moving in a diﬀerent
way. And now we're starting to have more advanced conversations about the omni
opportunity and the use of data and eventually, personalization. So you can imagine
use cases that will save customers time and have them actually understand that we
do understand them to an extent, all those things are done in a way that builds trust
with them, which is our ultimate asset. But start to unlock data in the company in
future years. It's not something that I want us to run out and do something in 90 days
to show that we did it. It's not that easy. I think this is going to be more of a slow burn
myself.

some aspect of that model versus the Walmart omnichannel model that it's going to
take that customer away? Then could you tackle that over time? Then the second
question I have, I guess related to online as well. But as you're thinking about the
supercenters and some of the new functionality stores as it relates to online, how
does that labor model switch over time?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
You're going to take the ﬁrst one?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes, I'll take the ﬁrst one. So I mean, I think how we win is with the head of the
assortment. As I was saying before, it starts with fresh, it starts with consumables, just
building that foundation of a relationship with the customer. If you can oﬀer fresh
produce, consumables at the very best prices with a really good experience, whether
it be pickup or delivery, then you have a good chance to build a long-standing
relationship that you could then leverage to sell the rest of general merchandise.
And I think we have an advantage. We've got assets to leverage in that area. And so
we're going to lean in pretty hard, which I think we're doing with Online Grocery
pickup and all the delivery tests that we're doing.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
And on the labor question, could you elaborate a little bit more, switch from what to
what?
{BIO 6638066 <GO>}
So clearly, now with what's going on in your stores and more focused on online sales
within the stores, there must be some functionality switch with the people working
there. How does that continue to evolve over time? Is there more labor that's put in
the store? Does it take some labor out?

What's the language called again?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
English. Anyway, things are going to change a lot. And I mentioned it during my
presentation, this concept of someone personally going around the store and
picking your order. We have to pay for that. And fundamentally, if I get to the heart of
it, what has to happen is that we need to get to a situation where you only touch the
product once in a store. So if you think about that as a principle, that's everything
that we're working towards. So Greg Smith, who runs our logistics and is sitting a
couple behind you, he's got to make sure he delivers products in such a ﬂow, in such
a manner that when they come in that back door, we can basically pick it up and we
can put it on the shelf. That means Steve has got to build a mod, a planogram, which
allows eﬀectively 2 order multiples, 2 cartons to be able to ﬁt on the shelf. And if it's
apparel, then to whatever that particular order multiple is. Judith has got to make
sure that she times her labor to be in the store when the truck arrives. So it's there.

A - Marc E. LoreScan & Go. We continue to look at fresh areas in terms of how much labor is invested
in there, loose versus prepack. All of those things are going to go into an equation
that has got to make us more eﬃcient. And at the end of the day, we're going to
share some of that with the customer through reduced prices. And we'll share some
of that with our shareholders with, hopefully, better returns. And there's no doubt
that I think what you're going to see over the next decade or 2 is you're going to see
more and more people doing both. They're going to stand in the store and they're
going to order online or they're going to sit at home and they're going to order and
it's going to get delivered to home. And we have to deal with that. So the word
ﬂexibility comes to mind. But the principle of touching a product only once, I think, is
a really important principle for us in our entire supply chain to grasp and to deliver.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
I love the Sam's Club example that John shared about the membership desk, too.
Just think about how many people does it take to do the old process versus the new
process and imagine that replicated across our stores and clubs. There's a lot of
opportunities to have the experience for everybody, the associates that are working
there as well as the customers be better and take costs out because the work just
goes away.
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
Let's go here and then all the way over to this side.
{BIO 6006075 <GO>}
Following up on personalization. And actually taking just a step back, I mean,
personalization is nice. But ease of search, how relevant my search results are, just
moving around the app, that's very important, that's part of the secret sauce of why
some companies do well and others don't. How happy are you with the experience
that your customers are getting now shopping either online or within the app? And
what's the risk that if that is still not as good as you want it to be that I try it, I go, oh, I
don't like it. It's too diﬃcult and I never come back. So -- and by the way, Maria from
Harding Loevner.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, that's something that -- that's what I said in my presentation is the #1
focus right now is to get the fundamentals right. We know the fundamentals aren't
where they need to be. And to date, largely been trying to be solved with
technology and technology alone. And that's why we're moving to be more human-
powered and combining both humans and technology to perfect the experience. I
think we can. I think we will. It's going to take a little bit of time. But the top 100,000
search terms represent 2/3 of all searches online roughly. The top 1 million
represents more than 80%. So actually, with humans and if you add 2,000 category
specialists, you can actually do quite a bit of damage in perfecting the search results
very precisely for every keyword search term that people care about and leave the
long tail, all the searches beyond the 1 million to technology and machine learning.
And it's bringing those 2 together is what we're in the process of doing right now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

Why don't we go over here? We're doing it in sections, guys. It's just easier for the
cameras to follow. So we'll get to everybody.
{BIO 7138867 <GO>}
Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Actually had one clariﬁcation on the guidance,
then a question. So on the guidance, it seems like you guys have referenced M&A as
part of the plan. It seems like M&A is not part of that guidance. And so I was just
willing -- wanting to know, most of the acquisitions have been e-commerce lately,
which are slightly dilutive. And is that -- should be that -- be our expectations going
forward? Then my question really goes to the pricing environment in the U.S., both
for Sam's and for Walmart U.S.A. It seems like Costco on their call earlier this week, I
think it was or last week, said that they were going to be investing in price and I think
they have a price gap to Sam's. We've also seen Kroger cutting their pricing, getting
really aggressive, Lidl and ALDI going down even further. So as the U.S. looks at its
business -- and Greg, you kind of said two years ago that you were going to really
drive your price into the market, how should we be thinking about that on Walmart?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Why don't I take the ﬁrst question ﬁrst. So as you look at the guidance this year. So
earnings per share as well as sales growth, that includes things we've already done
obviously. Everything that's on the wall over here that's included. And that's included
in next year. Any further acquisitions we would make would not have been in that
guidance.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
I'll take -- yes, let me take the ﬁrst question on price. The way we look at this is, we
talk about price every week. And we're looking at price in the core of the assortment.
We're also looking at price across the entire box. And what I said earlier is really
important that we reenergize our business in fresh food. Fresh food helps with a lot
of things, like fund pricing in other areas, the improvement in Member's Mark. The
17% we talked about two years ago, that was 17%, that was all of our private brands.
So it wasn't just a shift to the one brand. But we had increased the business from 17%
to 23%. And that business is -- it's great for members. It's great for us. It's helping our
payables. It helps inventory. And all that put together, we see a really good path
being able to be extremely competitive with a competitor you named -- or you
mentioned or anyone else in the market.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
One of our principles is delivering value. That's pretty core to the discussions that we
have every single week in the Walmart U.S. stores business. And Marc and I spend a
lot of time talking about price as well. So we're going to maintain a position that is
true to that particular principle. And what it means is that you then have to work hard
in other parts of your business to work out how to deal with that. It's not just one side
of the equation. You've got to look at the other side of the equation. And that's why

{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
Other questions over here, Chuck and then Paul.
{BIO 1450381 <GO>}
Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. First one is for Marc. You talked about improved
proﬁtability on the digital business. Can you speak to the drivers of that? And can
you foresee a scenario where eventually the digital business becomes breakeven?
Then my second question for the rest of the team is brand perception. You touched
on it brieﬂy throughout the presentation. But it's really hard for a retailer to change
its image from the consumer and you can look back to, say, JCPenney a few years
ago, for example. But you guys are clearly doing that. So I'm curious what you're
doing to capitalize on that momentum, particularly with the millennial customer?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
As it relates to brand and the second question, Tony Rogers, why don't you and Dan
Bartlett both speak to that? Marc, you want to go ﬁrst?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Sure. I mean, what was the ﬁrst question?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
E-commerce proﬁtability.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Oh, e-commerce proﬁtability. Yes, I mean, e-commerce is a scale game. So as we
continue to get scale, the proﬁtability should improve. Next year will prove it a little
bit. Obviously, long term, we do expect at some point to make money. But right now
we're in a heavy investment phase.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
If you break it down a little bit more, you've got the fulﬁllment cost part of the
equation. And we have room to improve to bring that number down, just
improvement through process, et cetera. We've got a margin number that we can
improve through mix. So adding to the assortment, ﬁrst party and then the third
party take rate helps with margin, which is what's driving some of the acquisitions. So
if you do have enough scale and you've got your margin starting to improve,
fulﬁllment center -- fulﬁllment cost coming down, you can then make a deliberate
choice about how much you want to do in terms of marketing to drive the top line.
So that's kind of the way we think about the equation. And we've got opportunities
all over the place.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

A - Daniel J. Bartlett{BIO 18351634 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Doug. And I'm Tony from marketing. I think the question on brand
perception is a really good one. And I think what we see is enormous opportunity as
we shift brick-and-mortar only shoppers to become omnichannel shoppers with us.
And there was a question on that a little earlier as well. The opportunity really lies in
2 camps. One is getting folks that are just kind of coming online that shop our stores.
But are just kind of getting into the e-commerce realm and turning though -- and
capturing their omnichannel volume and keeping it within the brand, I think, is the
ﬁrst group. Then the second group is people that are shopping with us pretty loyally
brick-and-mortar. But they are shopping other websites and they've developed
habits shopping other websites for their e-commerce behavior. And we're seeing
that that's equally fertile ground for us as we go and convert those folks and bring
them back in. We track our shoppers. We break them into 3 diﬀerent groups, folks
that only shop us in the store, only shop us online and then shop omnichannel. And
that percentage of our shoppers that are omnichannel Walmart shoppers grows
every year. And we're sourcing them from both of those buckets. So a big
opportunity for the brand. And I think you see through Online Grocery, Free 2-Day
Shipping and a lot of the other initiatives that we have, customers ready to shop us in
that way. And it's just -- it's really been about us showing up with the oﬀering for
them to take part in.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
I've got 3 direct reports that are not up here. Jeﬀ Gearhart, if you would stand. Jeﬀ
leads global governance, which includes compliance, ethics, legal. Jacqui Canney,
would you please stand up? Jacqui leads the people area and yesterday was her
birthday. So we've all been giving her a hard time about that. And Dan Bartlett, Dan
leads communications, corporate aﬀairs, sustainability, those areas. And Dan, you've
been doing a lot of work on reputation and this overlap between brand and
reputation, anything you would add to what Tony said?
{BIO 3071809 <GO>}
The only thing I would add is that a lot of companies have more of arm's-length
relationship with the public. But Wal-Mart, with 145 million transactions a week, more
than 60% of the public going through our stores in any given month, we have a very
intimate relationship with the public as we talk a lot about a daily referendum on our
reputation. And so the things we're doing to attract new customers through brand
propositions, whether it would be online, are critically important. But I think it also
reinforces the fundamental work we're doing in our stores because those are where
most of the interactions are taking place with the public. We have a real opportunity
not in just solving the day-in, day-out basic issues that customers expect of you. But
also gives an opportunity to tell a little bit more about the company, what we're
doing beyond just the 4 walls -- inside the 4 walls of a store. And so when Doug
talked about earlier that we have an opportunity to tell our story in a diﬀerent way,
that's something that we're going to be leaning into because we have this great
relationship and this access to so much of the public that other stores don't -- and
companies don't enjoy, that we can take a real advantage of it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

Okay. Paul?
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
Paul Trussell, Deutsche Bank. 2 questions, ﬁrst on real estate. We all probably agree
and understand the shift in capital towards technology and e-commerce. But I just
want to make sure I understand the rationalization around the meaningful slowdown
in real estate growth that we've seen over the past few years, particularly in the U.S.
Is it no longer providing the returns? Have we reached the point of saturation?
Perhaps you can just give us a little bit more color on how to think about where you
are right now from a U.S. stores standpoint. Then second, on the e-commerce front,
you outlined the 40% growth in the U.S. If at all, can you give some details on just
how you're seeing those growth rates across the Walmart.com banner versus Jet
versus some of the acquisitions you've made? Then how should we think about the
growth rate for the global e-commerce, the 17.5 billion? Are there any targets on that
front? And if there's any kind of quick comments you can give on the latest with the
JD.com partnership.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Let's start with the e-commerce question, the second one ﬁrst. Marc, you go ﬁrst,
then Dave, if you would chime in. And then Brett and I will take the other one.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. So I mean, we're not giving any guidance on the global number in terms of sales
growth. We're just really talking about the U.S. We also haven't talked about whether
it was coming more from the acquisitions or Walmart.com or grocery. I think it's fair
to say that it's a nice blend between the 3 channels. And yes...
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
Yes. From an international perspective, think of it in 3 broad groups. So the grocery
and shopping business, which leverages these existing assets. We pretty much grow
everywhere. It's very dominated by the U.K., which has had business there for a
while. So that's a huge chunk of our business, relatively mature and kind of high
single-digit growth, whereas we'd be signiﬁcant double-digit growth in the other
markets. The second then is the 2 markets adjacent to the U.S.. So Mexico and
Canada, where without distracting from what Marc's doing in the U.S., we have
ongoing sessions to work out how and when we can leverage those. Both those
markets have their own marketplace set up already. But there's obviously a lot of
synergies that when the time's right, we'll be able to build into those 2 markets. Then
for the rest of the globe, the extended tail, think of it as partnerships like the one we
have with JD in China, where we'll more likely work with a partner who can help us
build the capability in that market and then ultimately open up some channels to
start distributing, what, some unique assets around the globe. So the assortments
that Greg builds are actually a lot of them pretty relevant, a lot of countries around
the globe. So the global store that we've just opened with JD allows a portal that
simply moves products that customers want into other markets. And you ﬁnd someFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

because milk has a real issue with food safety and people believe it's great. So
connecting up countries, I think, is going to be a big revenue source for us in the
future.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
David mentioned grocery and shopping. That's the same thing as Online Grocery,
just another form of English description there. Property, real estate, I think it varies by
country. But the U.S., about the U.S., I think speciﬁcally, Paul, if you think about the
supercenters, they are largely built out. They will still be some opportunities to do, a
few here and there. But that's largely the case within 90% of the population. We have
an opportunity with A-bred markets. And Greg, you can chime in if you want to. But
the choice we're making right now is to put the assets, the investment towards e-
commerce rather than that opportunity. We may be back around to it later. But we're
making a deliberate choice that we're going to go win in e-commerce in this market
and bring omni together in that way. If you expand beyond it. And that applies to
kind of the Sam's Club question too, it's the same situation, I think, as the
supercenters mostly. If you look more broadly than the U.S., I think the supercenter
buildout in Canada looks more like what the United States looks like. But we have
tremendous opportunities for new stores in other international markets that are not
as developed. So Dave, you might put U.K. -- the U.K., Japan kind of closer to the
Canadian bucket. But we've got a lot of great store opportunities throughout Latin
America and Central America.
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
And I was traveling a few weeks ago in South America. And this discount-compact
type that we've got that operates under the Bodega name in more than one country
is a fantastic store format. Financially, a terriﬁc investment. We'll continue to have
new store programs that relate to opportunities like that.
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
Yes. And I think a big improvement, Doug, is we're so much more focused around
where we get good returns. So for example, the Sam's business in China, I mean,
that's a great business. We had 12 Clubs in the ﬁrst 20 years. We've leaned in very
hard to the pipeline because we know that when you have a physical club and you
put an online business next to it, which we now have with the partnership with JD, it
works much better than if you have either in isolation. And so you can see us quite
dramatically improving the number of physical clubs over the next few years. But
well thought through. Then the work that we've been done with Brett's team on the
way we look at our forecasting, our control of capital has made us much better at
everything from what the format is, to what golden principles apply to make sure
we're more conﬁdent in the returns we get. So I think much, much more disciplined.

A - Gregory S. ForanThe other bit is we've got a lot of stores that we opened 2003, 2004, 2005, '06. We
were doing circa 300 on supercenters a year during that period. So a lot of those
need a good remodel. And as we get around the country, you often go into a town
or a city. And usually, the Walmart that's on the corner of Main and Central is usually
a fantastic piece of real estate, 25 acres. And we want to make sure that we keep that
facility up and running and in the best possible condition. And wherever we can,
we're doing things like making sure we get the Online Grocery oﬀer in there, pickup
gets moved to the front, the store gets a really nice remodel. And we like that
approach of keeping our asset really current and up to date. And 500 is an
enormous undertaking in a business like ours. So I don't know how many thousands
we have working on remodels. But it's a lot through just when you put everyone out
there in the ﬁeld doing it. So...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
But one thing I'll add in because I've gotten similar questions even last night and
today, what we're trying to do is to communicate in a way that makes sense with
where the business is going. If you were to look to our presentations 3 or four years
ago, it was, here's Walmart U.S., here's Sam's Club, here's International, here's
square footage growth, here's number of stores. And it's just not how the world's
working anymore. It's not how we're operating anymore. As we look at an
opportunity in the U.S., we may say that's better served with a store, we may say it's
better served with e-commerce. Same thing in countries, there could be delivery in
China versus putting out a new store or partnership with JD. So there're all these
things that are making it a little more challenging to how we frame the business for
you that you can compare a bit to how you would have thought about the company
3 or four years ago.

Let's do one over here and then just get the few people over here. I know we're
running out of time. Go ahead.
Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. In the store tours yesterday and then the presentation
today, we saw and heard a lot of examples of tests around initiatives in stores. I'm
curious, can you help us think about the criteria that you consider in determining
whether a test needs to be abandoned or expanded to a broader set of stores?
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
Yes, Greg, you want to talk about that?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yes. We certainly do and isn't that a great thing. And often, with many of the things
we do, we actually aren't quite sure how big they're going to be or how successful
they're going to be until you start getting them out there. Sometimes, we'll begin
with one store and we'll work hard at that and we see the results. And then we'll say,
in this particular case, let's take that to 5 stores. Sometimes, we don't feel that the
next group should be 5 stores. We think it should be 30 stores. We always will get toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

A - Greg Smitha point. And we have things like pret-a-review meetings and we have a capital
meeting every month, where we will sit down and we'll start asking the questions. So
is this achieving business case? Isn't it? What have we learned? Do we have to
change it? I like the fact that we've got many things happening. There's always a
balance of course. But you can talk about it and you don't execute it. So make sure
that before you abandon it, you gave a really good shot at executing it. But there is a
stringent process. We're not just throwing things at a wall, we think about the team
intimately involved in it. And that's how we make the decisions. But...
Yes. David mentioned that the supply chain was, I think, 20 basis points of
improvement in International. And it seems to me that as the world changes and we
go down the next 10 to 15 years, transportation is going to change markedly. There
are going to be signiﬁcant opportunities. Where are you in what you have done for
the rest of the company in supply chain? What do you think it will be? Then does that
lead down to a thought process or maybe somewhere down the line, as you get
fulﬁllment costs down and other things down to a permanent price reduction and
maybe the shipping threshold, as that happens? Then I've also got a question about
merchandising structures, maybe after you talk about that...
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
You want to do this, Greg?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So Greg Smith, Greg joined us back in January. He joined us from
Goodyear. And proud of that, ConAgra. And he runs the supply chain for the U.S.
stores piece. And I'll hand to him in just a minute. But I -- is supply chain going to be
an enormous competitive advantage? It has to be, doesn't it? When you've got a
business that's doing, in the U.S., $300 billion, you're doing another $140 billion
outside of the U.S., most of that is focused on circa 300,000 SKUs. Your ability to
move that product more eﬀectively than anyone else in the world has got to be an
enormous competitive advantage. And we're focused on that. There's a lot of work
that Greg and the team are doing. And Greg, over to you.
{BIO 1926122 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you, Greg. A lot of work. And we're really excited about this plateau in
opportunities. First of all, it's really the ﬂow of the products and really being at speed
and precise. A lot of focus with our vendor partners and all the way through our
network to get our products moving through quickly and very eﬃciently. Greg
indicated the beneﬁts we have on our product with produce. So it's a key focus
there, also in the way that we leverage transportation and look at our whole network.
We've got a tremendous density in this network. So we're really excited about how
we leverage our private ﬂeet, how we leverage the third-party resource that we have
in transportation and really get to the most eﬃcient model that we can there while
leveraging our overall asset base as well. We're also learning a new technology. So
you'll start to see us just like the stores are testing. We're doing a lot of testing
around robotics and automation. And we're starting to bring a lot of those into ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

of the overall supply chain. So very excited about what the next few years have to
bring and what we have ahead of us in the supply chain.
Any quantiﬁcation?
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
I was just going to say it's another area where I think having a global business is a
real asset because if you look around the globe, with our relationship with New Dada
in China, we have a pure-play crowd-sourced solution. So we're getting a really good
understanding of how that works and how it doesn't. In the U.K., we have our own
ﬂeet that does the last-mile delivery. We understand how that works. And our ability
to work with Greg's team and plug them into the center of excellence and we look at
diﬀerent markets, in some cases, it's unique to the market and it's not going to apply
anywhere else. But we've often got insights that if a business just stood on its own it
just simply wouldn't have. And we can learn very, very quickly.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You had a follow up with it?
Well I was just going to ask, any quantiﬁcation on what you've already gotten out of
supply chain from maybe other parts of the company and other parts of the world?
Then the idea of a permanent price reduction somewhere down the road in the
shipping threshold for e-commerce, does that lead to that -- moving that? Because
you have made a big case about this versus membership plan?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Yes, I think it could. There's basically this big optimization that we think is going to
happen. But as you think about connecting people with product, the more nodes
you have dispersed close to them, the more opportunity you have to kind of run this
big regression across the top and ﬁgure out how to meet demand. And the more
they tell us ahead of time, either with their voice or on an app that they want
something, that's more of an opportunity we have to stage that and provide that to
them in a way that's lower cost. So I think we have a lot of the components. But I
don't think there's going to be this moment in next year's plan where there's a
substantial price reduction because we had some breakthrough in fulﬁllment. I think
it will be more gradual than that.
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
Dan, why don't you bring us home? We've -- for those of you we can't get -- if we
haven't gotten to your questions, these guys will be around for a while during lunch
so you'll have a chance to ask a question too.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-10-10

Dan Binder with Jeﬀeries. Since I'm last, I'll ask 2 questions. One was around friction
online. You've talked a lot about reducing friction. 2 areas I'd like you to address if
you could, is fulﬁllment by Walmart, it doesn't exist today. Does it need longer term
to compete in the marketplace, especially on 2-day delivery? Obviously, because we
can get that, I think, on like 2 million items with Walmart. But probably a lot more
with one of your big competitors. Also, one click, if you could address that. I think
when I go through Walmart checkout, it's probably 5 or 6 clicks right now. It's better
than it used to be. But probably room for improvement. Then the second question
was really around the portfolio of assets. Early in the presentation, you talked about
divesting noncore. We have several examples of that already. Just curious your
thoughts going forward. Is there -- is that largely done? Or is there more to do? Any
color you can provide.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Marc, you want to go ﬁrst?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. You're talking about how many clicks it takes to navigate the website?
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Yes. And I think kind of a pattern...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Those are simmering questions.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
That was to cheat it through...
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
You're getting your money's worth.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
So regarding checkout, I mean, that's one of the things that we're doing. We hired a
new head of customer experience that started about a year ago, right when I was
starting. And he's been really building out the entire customer experience team. And
we've got a really good team. And you're going to start to see a lot of improvements
in the actual on-site shopping experience, which will include the whole checkout
ﬂow. That's an area that we know that we can streamline. So we'll be focused. That's
sort of part of the focus on ﬁxing the fundamentals. So that was the one-click
question and the other one?

A - Steve SchmittFulﬁllment by Walmart?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes, fulﬁllment by Walmart. We've actually got a few 3PL partners that we're using
right now to do fulﬁllment on behalf of our third-party merchants. We are in at a
place now where we want to bring that in-house into our own fulﬁllment centers just
because there's so much opportunity and low-hanging fruit to bring products in ﬁrst-
party, which is really the experience that we're focused on ﬁxing right now. So we'll
see how it evolves. But there are options for 3P sellers right now.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
On the portfolio, there's more work to be done. There are some things that are in the
queue. Obviously, we can't talk about some of those things until they're actually
done. But it's a deliberate piece of work. And we're prioritizing North America. You
can hear us prioritizing omni-channel. We want to make sure that our resources,
people, ﬁnancial resources, everything, are aimed at winning in the most important
places. And that's the way we think about it. Anything you want to add to that? Can I
just say thank you? I mean, I appreciate the engagement that you all have in the
company. A lot of you have invested a lot of your time to understand what we're
working on. I really do appreciate you doing that. I hope you can sense from us
today that our posture is improving. And with what we can see ahead of us, we think
we have a great opportunity to continue to make improvement and we're working
hard to do that. So thanks for investing your time and energy to understand Wal-
Mart.
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
So thanks, everyone, again. This concludes our webcast portion of the meeting.
We're going to have lunch served in a little bit. I'll let you ask some follow-up
questions or some other questions you weren't able to.
