Good day ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Tesla Motors conference call.
(Operator Instructions)
As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would like to introduce your host
for today's conference, Mr. Jeﬀ Evanson, investor relations Tesla Motors. Sir, you may

Thank you, Teria. Good morning everyone. Welcome to Tesla's call to discuss the
rationale for our oﬀer to acquire SolarCity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 2 of 27Todd MaronI am joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla chairman and CEO; Todd Maron, Tesla
General Counsel; JB Straubel, our CTO; and CFO Jason Wheeler. Yesterday we
announced our oﬀer to acquire SolarCity in ﬁlings with the SEC and through a blog
post available at www.Tesla.com.
During our call this morning we will discuss our -- some of our business outlook and
make other forward-looking statements. These are based on our predictions and
expectations as of today. Actual events or results could diﬀer materially due to a risk
-- a number of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in our most recent
Form 10-Q ﬁled with the SEC.
We're going to start today's call with some comments by Todd and then Elon
followed by Q&A. So go ahead and press star one now to get into the queue to ask a
question. And with that I will pass it over to you, Todd.
{BIO 18879554 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Jeﬀ. So I just wanted to brieﬂy touch on some of
the process points and why yesterday's announcement might have looked
somewhat diﬀerent to people who normally see these kind of announcements.
It's actually somewhat of an easy explanation but it is somewhat of a unique
situation. So usually I know that everyone is used to seeing an announcement when
there's actually a deﬁnitive agreement that's reached and not just simply an oﬀer.
And obviously in our situation we are only announcing on oﬀer. Then, as a result, you
didn't receive the same kind of information that you would receive when an
agreement is reached such as the agreement itself and detailed ﬁnancial information
about the combined Company.
The reason for that is that Elon is a 5% stockholder in SolarCity and he's required by
the securities laws to keep the market informed through a Schedule 13D ﬁling about
his plans with respect to those holdings. And because of Tesla's decision to make an
oﬀer to SolarCity and Elon's support for that decision it was appropriate to amend
his Schedule 13D to update the market, even though no deﬁnitive agreement had
yet been reached.
It's obviously our hope to engage in a due diligence process with SolarCity and
ultimately reach that agreement. And all that information that you would customarily
see at that time, including the agreement itself and detailed ﬁnancial information
about the combined companies, would be provided then. But the result of this is
that it this is actually a more transparent process because you're essentially seeing
behind the curtains more than you would ordinarily see in a transaction because you
are actually getting additional information upfront at the oﬀer stage and getting an
advance look at the strategic business rationale for the deal.
So with that I will actually pass it over to Elon so that he can speak more about the
strategic rationale for the deal and why we do think that combining the two
companies makes sense here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

Sure, I did touch on most of this yesterday but I think what this call is mostly going to
be about is getting into maybe some of the detailed questions that people have. As I
said yesterday there is kind of three parts to -- and as I said actually the Powerwall
presentation last year. So just there's quite a ways I think this is really quite an
obviously correct move is that in order to solve the sustainable energy question we
need a sustainable energy production, which is going to come primarily in the form
of solar, overwhelmingly in the form of solar energy.
Then if we combine that with stationary storage and electric vehicle and you have a
complete solution to a sustainable energy future. Those are the three parts that are
needed. And those are the three things that I think Tesla should be providing.
And it just became increasingly obvious that as we are developing the Powerwall
and new versions of the Powerwall, particularly as we integrate more of the inverter
electronics and the intelligence in the Powerwall it really needs to take the solar
panels and solar system into account we're doing that. Otherwise you duplicate a lot
of hardware, that doesn't work together as well, it's more expensive. The installation
cost is substantially higher.
You've got to put the solar Powerwall, the solar panels, if you've got an electric car
you've got to install the wall connector and at home charging system. Those are
potentially three visits or at least two visits.
Then in terms of the sales process itself when we're selling somebody the Powerwall
very often if not almost always they are curious about solar and want to do the same
thing. So then not being able to sell them solar directly at SolarCity, sorry, at Tesla
through our stores is pretty ineﬃcient. But as you look ahead to say Model 3, a
$35,000 car, well, that same person at the same moment we could sell them roughly
an equivalent amount value of solar panels and a Powerwall, eﬀectively doubling or
almost doubling the sale at that time. And then putting it all in at the same time.
So I think the word synergy it is like almost sort of a dirty word. But I think these
synergies are really just common sense. Like, obviously, it's more eﬃcient to do it as
an integrated system at the sale and at the installation and in terms of just general
maintenance and managing the customer relationship. And yes, I think that makes it
kind of a pretty obvious thing to do. And it's quite diﬃcult to create an integrated
product if you're forced to be at an arm's-length and be two diﬀerent companies.
So if we give a special deal to SolarCity and SolarCity is not part of Tesla, then why
are we doing that? So we can do that if SolarCity is part of Tesla. We can't do it if
SolarCity is a separate company.
So it just makes things, the execution, I think, a lot easier and cleaner and more
eﬀective. So that's why I said yesterday I think it's really kind of a no-brainer. Like, if
we didn't do this it would make Tesla's execution harder and worse.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 4 of 27And I think the tide of history very strongly supports -- will be a sustainable energy
future, primarily solar and virtually entirely electric vehicles and maybe things that
temporarily interrupt that tide of history but in the long term it will overwhelm
everything. And our goal is to accelerate the advent of that future as fast as possible
and this helps us accelerate it.
That's the reasoning and yes. So yes and I think there have been some questions
about like does this really increase our debt position or lever up the bank -- our
balance sheet. It really doesn't, I think (inaudible) will take a closer look at SolarCity.
What really matters is the recourse debt. Obviously, the nonrecourse debt is not
what matters. And the cash ﬂow that is generating at SolarCity will generate -- it
covers what's required with the recourse debt.
So they are headed to cash ﬂow positive situation for the next three to six months at
the outside. And that's where the Company has been steering itself, reducing their
growth rate to some degree to achieve that cash ﬂow positive position. But they are
very clearly on their way to getting there in short order.
So actually we expect it to be a net cash generator, not a user of cash, particularly
when taking into account the dramatic reduction in the cost of sales of solar systems
sold through our store. So through our stores. The biggest factor in SolarCity's
increasing cost per watt in Q1 was their sales cost. So as soon as you -- quite a big
increase in sales cost -- that will go radically in the other direction with sales through
Tesla.
Then I'd love to talk more about what's going to happen on the power side.
Obviously, that would be, I think, that would shed a lot of light on this deal and why I
think it makes total sense and really is a no-brainer.
But I can't talk about material, nonpublic plans except to say that I'm very optimistic
about those plans and that while, to date, SolarCity has not been signiﬁcantly
diﬀerentiated on the products side, Tesla solar panels themselves, they certainly will
be in the fairly near future. And actually, if you listen carefully to what SolarCity has
been saying in its earnings calls and its announcements that learning should be also
pretty clear like that Tesla is saying that there's going to be signiﬁcant product
diﬀerentiation.
There's the Silevo acquisition which I think is the best technology out there for high-
eﬃciency, low-cost solar panels and at the same time very signiﬁcantly improving the
aesthetics of the solar panels. I think there is quite a radical diﬀerence between
having solar panels on your roof that actually make your house look better versus
ones that do not. I think it's going to be a night and day diﬀerence.
And the Silevo development allows for that. So we can't go into the details of those
because making kind of future product announcements that are really exciting
obviously aﬀect future product sales and it's -- the full extent of that is not yet publicFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

Powerwall and Powerpack side.
Yes. So we can turn it over to questions at this point.
{BIO 17513488 <GO>}
All right. Thanks Elon. Teria, why don't we go to the ﬁrst question, please?
Questions And Answers
Brian Johnson, Barclays.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you. I have about three questions. One for Elon, well, why don't we start
with the General Counsel and Jason.
For Todd, you know you talked in the letter about two of the directors not voting.
Can you give us a sense, because this will come out in the proxy eventually, of the
discussions between the two companies? Is there actually a committee of
independent directors?
How independent do you consider the remaining directors? Do they have any
personal ownership of SolarCity and the other things that are likely to relate to the
board issues?
{BIO 18879554 <GO>}
So this is Todd. When, this is a little bit tracks back to what I was saying earlier about
this stage of the process that we're in. But when a deal is announced if that happens
all this stuﬀ will come out in terms of exactly what the process was at every point. The
key points now are that Elon and Antonio since they are on both boards have
recused themselves from the board process of voting on the transaction.
And they've also committed to if there's a deal that the disinterested shareholders
would vote on that deal with the majority of those disinterested shares determining
the outcome of the vote. But beyond that it's really too early in the process to get
into all the diﬀerent details but rest assured that will all come out once there is
actually a deﬁnitive agreement that's reached. At this point, it's probably more
appropriate to just focus on the business rationale for why this deal makes sense.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
And just when you say recused from voting does that also mean recused from
discussion and not present in the room when this was brought up?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

Q - Brian Johnson{BIO 18879554 <GO>}
No. It was recused from voting.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Okay. For Jason, given your talks earlier in the year about kind of focusing on cash
and even stipulating perhaps that SolarCity could reach some sort of cash breakeven
by Fourth Quarter, how does this change your view of the pro forma companies in
terms of their cash usage and their need to potentially go back to the capital
markets, either debt or equity, to ﬁnance the ongoing business?
{BIO 19481227 <GO>}
Yes, sure. On the Tesla side I'd just stick with the statements that we made on
previous earnings calls. On the SolarCity side, as Todd has laid out, we're just at the
beginning of the process now.
And the only information I've had access to is what's publicly available. So I don't
have anything to say about the pro forma combined entity at this point. And we will
start to look at it as we get into the full due diligence now.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
And I guess a due diligence question was probably scoped out before you did the
deal. When you survey Tesla owners, what % have solar already, what % are in states
where solar would make sense and sort of what are some of the basic merger
synergies in terms of customer overlap and customer potential that you guys looked
at?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well I think the way to think about this is not to kind of look in the rearview mirror but
to look through the windshield. Like only about 1% of US homes have solar. So you
have a massive addressable market that's unserved. And there's at least 40 million to
60 million households that where solar -- where they could do solar if they wanted
to.
So if the economics were right and they like the aesthetics and it was easy to do,
then they would do it. So the future market there is really gigantic.
And on the cash front we don't expect SolarCity to have a material impact on future
cash needs. We don't think it's going to make much of a diﬀerence really. We should
see positive cash ﬂow really by the end of the year.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
And just ﬁnal, you talked to it a little bit yesterday. But how does this aﬀect -- how do
you make sure that your personal time between this and, of course, a rocket business
given the M&A synergies that you're trying to get given the service overlap, that'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 7 of 27A - Elon Musk
Q - Brian Johnson
Operator
Q - Brian Johnson
A - Jeﬀ Evansonkind of a whole separate line of processes and kind of grunt work on the ground
from launching a new model car. How do you actually get both the integration of a
sales and service system for solar and cars and batteries done at the same time
you've got a, by your own admission, aggressive launch schedule for the Model 3?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well I mean my intuition about this could be wrong. But from my standpoint this
makes Tesla's future execution easier, not harder. Because it's just getting
increasingly unwieldy to work with SolarCity on an arm's-length basis. We really
need to have an integrated product.
The Powerwall and the Powerpack need to be designed together with the solar
system. So it's a one-piece thing. And we really can't do that if we're two separate
companies. We've got to treat SolarCity like they're any other company, which is
extremely unwieldy.
So from my standpoint this makes the execution easier, not harder. And I think
SolarCity has got a great future independent of Tesla but. And obviously Tesla does.
But being able to integrate things at the product level, at the consumer experience
level, at the utility level, at the commercial level it actually makes it easier, not harder.
That's how we're doing this. Why should companies exist at all, what's the point of
having companies? The point is that a given company is going to create a more
compelling, greater service for the end customer.
And so should the companies be two separate containers or one container? And if
they are one container we can make a more compelling product and work together
easier. So that's the reason for it.
So I think that speaks to the fundamental economic goodness of the transaction.
And it would be harder if we remain two diﬀerent companies.

Charlie Anderson, Dougherty & Company. Okay. And our next question comes from
the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.

{BIO 16577213 <GO>}
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
So I wondered if shareholders of Tesla will have a synergies number in mind when
they vote and if you guys have any early look at what synergies could be. And are
you expecting much in the way of cost and just thinking about the incremental cost
of combining the products. What will that be? It sounds like some of the work has
already been done to combine the products. But just any thoughts on that would be
helpful.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. I mean we give estimates because obviously this is still the early stages. And I
mean they are estimates based on kind of what stands to reason. But looking ahead,
particularly to next year selling Model 3 I think kind of something on the order of a
$35,000 car, if we're selling Powerwalls and solar systems of comparable value and
doing so in the same sales footprint with the same person the ﬁrst-order
approximation our cost of sales should drop in half as would SolarCity's
correspondingly.
Maybe it's not entirely in half, maybe it's 30% to 40%. But it's a pretty -- and I think a
very substantial drop on the SolarCity side and also a drop, a material drop on
Tesla's side. You're basically selling, let's say, almost twice as much in a single
transaction as you otherwise would.
Then on the installation and setup side that's one crew instead of and one visit
instead of two to three visits. The ongoing maintenance is kind of one point of
contact and not sort of two or three points of contact. And the cost of the system
itself is lower because we're not duplicating hardware, the hardware level.
So I think that all makes a lot of sense. Yes. So the ﬁnal costs for both companies
would go down materially. And yes, -- I think it's -- one could argue about like is it
sort of 20% reduction, 30% reduction, 40% reduction but it's pretty signiﬁcant and
for sure better than if the companies were separate.
{BIO 16577213 <GO>}
Great. Then just another quick one from me. I wondered why now versus two years
ago versus two years from now?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The reason now is because we've got -- we are really ramping up Powerwall and
Powerpack and we're developing version 2 and then we have kind of our plans forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

Q - Sachin Shah
A - Elon Muskversion 3, version 4 and so forth. SolarCity also is preparing to come out with the
solar panels as a consequence of the Silevo transaction a couple of years ago that
signiﬁcantly improved the eﬃciency and the aesthetics of the roof. And I think the
aesthetics matter a lot.
As you know, Tesla we're super sensitive to aesthetics. And I think SolarCity is -- I
think they are going to get there on their own but I think that journey will be
accelerated as part of Tesla, as well. And it just sort of makes sense that if you had
our solar system that made your house look better, lowered your cost of electricity
and then gave you security with against a power outage with the Powerpack and
allowed you to go potentially completely oﬀ grid then that's kind of a no-brainer, like
why wouldn't you do that?
{BIO 16577213 <GO>}
Thanks so much.
Sachin Shah, Albert Fried.
{BIO 15433972 <GO>}
Hi. Good morning. Congratulations on the oﬀer. A couple of questions I think that
people are kind of trying to digest.
I think strategically Elon that you've made your points clear but I think the valuation is
what the market is having issues with. There are some questions about SolarCity's
balance sheet and you mentioned about the debt. So how do you put that into
context with the change ratio that you have oﬀered kind of not jeopardizing the
future of Tesla while you make this oﬀer?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well I think Tesla is getting pretty good at current share price. I mean Tesla doesn't
decide what their Company's share price mortgage should be but probably the
market does. So we're just, obviously, keying oﬀ of what the public market price is,
which is decided by people other than ourselves.
Then there's a, I think, quite a reasonable neither high nor low acquisition premium
that is being put forward subject to further diligence. And I think it's -- every element
of it is very reasonable. Like there's nothing that's out of whack about the proposal,
it's sort of extremely normal to have an acquisition premium of that size.
It certainly quite a bit lower than, for example, say LinkedIn, (inaudible) premium,
here we're talking about sort of lower 20%s to maybe 30% premium. So it's more or
less in line with the average acquisition premium for any given public market
company. So it's like extremely normal.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

Page 10 of 27Q - Sachin Shah
A - Elon Musk
Q - Sachin Shah
A - Elon MuskThen just overall these, I think when people, when we're down the road, not even far
down the road next year. But particularly as you go further into the future these
numbers are going to seem like very small numbers. I think as a combined
automotive and power storage and power generation Company the potential is
there for Tesla to be a $1 trillion Company, market cap Company. So if we play a
major role in transitioning the world to a new form of energy generation and storage
and transport it's what kind of happens.
So that's I think one isn't going to be worried about whether it's a few hundred
million dollars one way or the other here down the road. It's not going to make a
diﬀerence.
{BIO 15433972 <GO>}
Okay. I appreciate your candor about the $1 trillion market cap. I think that leads to
the future value of SolarCity but I guess the near-term because you're not voting
your shares both on Tesla and on SolarCity from my understanding --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That's correct.
{BIO 15433972 <GO>}
How would you expect the near-term kind of shareholders or near-term focus
shareholders to vote this -- vote in favor of this? I'm assuming it's a simple majority.
And so it's kind of a chicken and egg thing where your future, your expectation of
the future is probably correct strategically but near-term people are having more
time to digest this, not enough time to digest this and kind of looking more near-
term and that's what the concern is getting to the ﬁnish line.
So how do you see this getting to the ﬁnish line where you see shareholders on the
SolarCity side being receptive to the exchange ratio, you reach your merger
agreement and then further along Tesla shareholders being receptive to voting in
favor of this? Because ultimately it's these two or three ducks valuation of the
exchange ratio and then understanding the future opportunity that will get this to
the ﬁnish line on the shareholder side, shareholder vote?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. The exchange ratio, obviously there is some balance on the exchange ratio that
if we exceed the bounds of reasonableness for any party obviously it wouldn't
happen. So except obviously the market cap of SolarCity is decided by the market.
So that's what it is, what investors think it is.
Then the premium, you don't get to acquire companies for zero premium. That's just
not how it works. And so some reasonable premium, obviously, is appropriate in a
situation like this, as it always is.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 11 of 27Q - Sachin Shah
A - Elon Musk
Q - Sachin Shah
A - Elon MuskAnd we're kind of right where premiums normally are and actually lower than some
recent prominent premiums paid, like the LinkedIn one which I believe was on the
order of 50%. So I think it's a reasonable market cap with a reasonable premium.
And one can maybe quibble around the edges a little bit. But I don't think there's
anything like out of whack there.
And at the end of the day this will deﬁnitely be up to you guys who own shares
because like I said, I will recuse myself from the shareholder vote. It has to be a
majority of non-me shareholders. And but like I said I'm doing this because I think it
makes things better in the future, not worse, for everyone.
And so far I'd really recommend voting in favor of this because I think anyone who
doesn't vote in favor of this is going to be voting against their best interest. But we
will certainly abide by the shareholder vote. So if there is a great deal of
unhappiness we want to move forward.
But I just really want to emphasize that I have zero doubt about this, zero. Arguably
we should have done it sooner. But I think doing it now is -- it gives us enough time
to create a compelling, integrated product -- assuming it doesn't take forever to
close, gives us time to create a very compelling, integrated product and bring that to
signiﬁcant scale next year.
{BIO 15433972 <GO>}
Okay. So when you say you have no doubt. So you believe the special committee
independent board when they do their due diligence and reverse due diligence on
both companies that they'll reach -- you'll be able to reach agreement. That seems
very likely --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
At the board level yes. Like the board opinion is unanimous for both companies. So I
mean, unless there's something discovered that like that I have no idea about or just
or that nobody on the board has any idea about, which is extremely unlikely, then
the board would -- the independent board members would recommend in favor of
completing a transaction somewhere in the price range that was mentioned, most
likely.
Then it would be up to the shareholder vote to say, excluding me, to say yes or no.
And so that's -- I think that's about as fair as one could make it.
{BIO 15433972 <GO>}
Great, thank you very much. Congratulations again.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thanks. Yes, I mean, we hear things like hey, there's some better way to do this,

Colin Rusch, Oppenheimer & Co.
{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Thanks so much. At what point are we going to get ﬁnancial details here? Clearly
there has been an awful lot of cross-pollination with the boards: the former CFO of
SolarCity is on the Board of Tesla, JB is on the board of SolarCity.
There's been a lot of sharing. To have a price here without some sort of scope of
return of capital I think would be an incredibly important for us. And so when are we
going to get that information?
And without you're begging oﬀ the detailing on synergies but I think getting speciﬁc
about return on capital for Tesla shareholders would be essential to getting this
done. When are we going to get that information?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I agree. I agree. As Todd was saying, we kind of have to do this in a bit of an
unwieldy way because I'm the largest shareholder of both companies.
If that wasn't the case we could do a lot of this and kind of present you with like the
full and ﬁnal details of the proposed merger. But before -- since I'm the largest
shareholder of both companies we have to tell you at the beginning of the process,
not the end.
So we will certainly have all that done for you. But the reason it's not just all in a neat
package is because this is sort of an odd case where we have to tell you at the start
of the process before we have all the answers rather than at the end of the process.
But we will deﬁnitely get all that information and I'm conﬁdent it will be extremely
compelling.
{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Okay. Then the second question is around Silevo. So there's actually a lot going on in
terms of manufacturing for solar at this point with Asian manufacturers reducing cost
well in excess of what expectations have been. And certainly there's folks that are
getting around the import duties.
Even with the potential savings on installation cost with the extra eﬃciency at Silevo
it looks like there isn't going to be that much of a cost advantage just from a raw cost
perspective when you look at a price point for solar panels coming into the US that
SolarCity would buy. Can you talk a little bit about, you're begging oﬀ some of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

A - Elon Muskproduct details here. But what you're expecting to be able to bring to that
engineering process to improve that cost trajectory?
Because by the time you get that Silevo factory up and running there's going to be, I
think, at least a $0.15 cost disadvantage for their target cost at this point. And I think
there's something that needs to get done there to make that a compelling oﬀering.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. So at Tesla we're putting a lot of eﬀort into becoming the world's best
manufacturer and I really mean that. That's like I'm highly conﬁdent we will be the
world's best manufacturer. And I said we will build the world's best car, we did that.
At SpaceX, I said we will build the world's best rocket, we did that. We're going to be
the world's best manufacturer not by a small margin but by a margin that people
don't even think is possible. I believe in taking a ﬁrst principles, physics-based
approach to analysis and my analysis of the situation is that dramatic improvements
are possible on the automotive side and on the photovoltaic side.
An important advantage of the Silevo technology is that it has signiﬁcantly higher
eﬃciency than the very low-cost Chinese panels. So on the same surface area of roof,
you can get as much as a third more power.
Then aesthetically speaking the Silevo panels look better, they look a lot better. And
if it's done right we can make your roof look better with solar panels than without.
This is a night and day diﬀerence.
And if you've got, let's say somebody's got a $400,000 house, if you make the roof
look ugly then arguably you've made that house worth 5% less or some nonzero %
less valuable. On the other hand, if you make the roof look beautiful you've made
the house more valuable. And maybe that's plus 5% or some nonzero plus % in the
value of the house.
If it is something on the order of 5% then the value delta there is, call it $40,000 or
maybe it's only like 2% or 3%. And it's $20,000, it's like there's -- you have quite a big
value delta.
So being able to have higher power that looks great and I think it cost better, at least
as good if not better than what's coming from anywhere else in the world, that's
obviously a winning outcome. And that's the outcome that we will pursue and I think
we will, I'm conﬁdent we will get there.
{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Okay. I will follow up on that. I think my question was more around the process

{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Yes. The fundamentals of the process technology and where you're going to get the
cost out. I think there are a variety of detailed questions I can come back with you
with.
But my follow-up question on that is just fundamentally SolarCity is a specialty
construction and specialty ﬁnance entity at its heart. And so once you look at Tesla
being a value-added manufacturer of a variety of products and a technology
company moving into what we see is a fundamentally diﬀerent business, where are
you seeing the synergies come back to Tesla other than the sales side?
Is there something to do on the specialty ﬁnance expertise that you would be
bringing in-house? And the actual boots on the ground, the footprint of SolarCity is
incredibly important to actually closing sales and delivering things versus a footprint
of Tesla's customer base which is very diﬀerent than the concentrated footprint at
SolarCity. How are you seeing the value come back to Tesla other than just in the
cost of customer acquisition?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I mean I think the biggest asset that we'd be acquiring is -- are the installers, the
installation team of SolarCity. And a lot of people trained in doing the permitting
and the paperwork and all the complexities that exist and municipalities throughout
the country and understanding how to deal with 37 diﬀerent roof types and having
eﬃcient logistics infrastructure for doing the installations.
Then, I mean I think there's some strength in the SolarCity sales side that we can take
advantage of. And yes. So but I really don't -- I do want to emphasize I think the
Silevo technology is going to make quite a big diﬀerence. And I don't see any kind
of fundamental cost issues that prevented from being at or lower cost per watt than
any other panel in the world.
{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks a lot.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I've spent time in the SolarCity Silevo power plant in the Bay Area and so I'm familiar
with this. And my observation is there are dramatic improvements. There's not some
physical thing that's preventing it from being super competitive, it's actually a
relatively straightforward manufacturing process.

Elon and Todd, it's Jeﬀ. I've had a number of people emailing in questions about
process here, possible timeline. Todd or Elon, if you want to speak to a recap of who
needs to vote, who's recused and how and when diligence disclosure and the
shareholder votes might happen. That might be helpful.
{BIO 18879554 <GO>}
Sure. I can take that if you want. So on the Tesla side, the Board has approved going
forward with the oﬀer, which is why we made the announcement that an oﬀer was
made. Elon and Antonio, being Directors on both Boards, recused themselves from
the vote on that. We're now in a stage where we have delivered the oﬀer to
SolarCity. SolarCity will set up their Board process on their end and decide how to
do this so that it's done, as Elon said, not only legally. But morally correctly, I'm sure
and then we will move into a diligence phase very quickly.
Hopefully, diligence can take place promptly. So in the next two, three weeks and we
can get to a place where everything makes sense, that there's a signed merger
agreement. And at that point, everyone would receive the merger agreement, as
well as the typical disclosures that would be provided at that time, combined
ﬁnancials, proxy statements and everything and we'd move to a shareholder vote.
We're now getting a little bit further out. So it's harder to predict with certainty. But
the hope would be that there would be a shareholder vote on each side in the next
few months.
Joseph Spak, RBC Capital Markets.
{BIO 17457170 <GO>}
Thanks. So I guess I just wanted to get your sense on how much of a play you think
the SolarCity bet is on lower storage costs, meaning we've seen some proposed
changes to net metering laws and if that continues, or there's more of that, how long
does the business model work? Like do you need to see the following storage costs
for it to work and is your conﬁdence in that the reason to go forward with the deal?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. The storage costs are going to drop pretty dramatically with each passing year
and I think with the exclusion of certain situations like Nevada, maybe Arizona, which
we're working to mitigate, it'll be ahead of the net metering situation. Like in New
York, a regional deal has been arranged and basically this gets ahead of the net
metering situation in call it roughly the two to three-year timeframe.
So it's certainly important for long term and although some utilities will exaggerate
the impact of solar on the grid, ultimately, the impact of solar on the grid beyond a
certain localized percentage does have an impact and you do need to buﬀer theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

A - Elon Muskpower. So they have a valid argument; it's just exaggerated. So it's obviously very
important for the long term and, yes, it's going to work together well.
This is what the world needs. This is the ultimate solution for -- it is what we're talking
about here. Solar power, stationary storage, electric cars. This is the solution. And
we're going to try to make that happen as fast as possible and the fundamental
good of SolarCity and Tesla will be measured by the degree to which we accelerate
that transition. So we're going to try to make it happen as fast as possible and I think
we will have a meaningful impact on that timeframe.
{BIO 17457170 <GO>}
Then maybe just two real quick ones. If the deal is consummated, have you given any
thought or plan to provide segmented balance sheet or cash ﬂow just to provide a
little bit more transparency on each line? Then on a technical point -- so you will do
that?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I do think it's valuable to have transparency. So we will want to show that
transparency as much as we can. Of course, in some cases, it's going to be like
where exactly should the cost be allocated. But it won't be great if it's like a black
box that people can't ﬁgure out and then have to parse out what pieces are what. So
we don't want to have an information discount to the start because people aren't
certain. So I think that having clear information gives people a better understanding
of the value of the Company, the various pieces. It will inevitably lead some people
to reach conclusions they maybe shouldn't reach or they are premature. But I do
believe in transparency.
{BIO 17457170 <GO>}
Then from a technical standpoint, you talk about some greater seamlessness
between the entities. Would you also consider allowing vehicle-to-grid support?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We've debated this since the early days of the Roadster. The early proto-Roadsters
that we had were vehicle-to-grid. But you do get a lot of complications with that if
you back ﬂow power through the car into the wall. Like when is the car allowed to do
that, when is it not and then how much do you allow the car battery to be drawn
down and then people, I think, were pretty upset if the lights are on in the house. But
they can't drive their car because all the power in the house shuts down.
So I think the right solution is to decouple it into vehicle, stationary, battery and solar.
Then obviously probably some need to supplement that power at the grid level by
having utility scale, solar battery installations because you don't always have enough
service area on a house or certainly for an apartment building, you don't have the
service area. So you've got to ground mount the utility scale, solar battery system
and feedback to the grid. But if anyone that has seen my power presentation, it's
remarkable how little land you need to power the entire United States. It's crazy. Like
a little corner of Texas or Utah, that's all the United States' power.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

questioners in queue. So I will defer to you as to determine how long you want to
go. But (multiple speakers).
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Let's try to answer everyone's questions and like I said, I really would encourage
people to think about the long term -- where is this all headed and I think if you think
about like the long term, there's really no question about the convergence of Tesla
and SolarCity. It's really just a question of what timing is appropriate for that
convergence. It's basically SolarCity's product roadmap and Tesla's product
roadmap, which obviously is very signiﬁcant (inaudible) information. So I wish I could
tell you about. But I can't.
The timing is, if anything, we maybe should have done this sooner. But I certainly
don't think we're doing it too early. Then what's the long-term picture? Long-term
picture is a world with sustainable power generation, with stationary storage to
buﬀer that power and then electric cars. And Tesla is going to be the leader in all
three. So if you believe that that's the future we're headed towards, which everything
points to that being true. And really like gasoline cars, we are going to have to look
back on gasoline cars like we look back on steam engines. It was like a phase. It was
a bit weird.
And we're going to look back on fossil fuel power generation the same way. It was a
weird phase. Now we want to get out of that weird phase as soon as we can. And this
is all by accelerating us getting out of this idiosyncratic moment in history where
we're digging up Cambrian-level fossils and burning them. I think you will be telling
your grandchildren, yes, you won't believe what we used to do. We used to take up
liquidized remains of dinosaurs and old plants and put them in cars and burn them
to move. And did the same thing with the power plants and the like. That sounds
crazy. That's what it's going to be in the future, obviously. So yes, we're trying to have
the non-weird future get here as fast as possible.

{BIO 16897436 <GO>}
It's actually Ben Kallo from Baird. Elon, I was just wondering, I understand working
together and being cumbersome by separate entities. But could you just talk us
through what the diﬀerence is of actually owning SolarCity versus maybe doing
some kind of JV or some other kind of entity like that to help you guys work through
some issues?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. The problem is I think we hit the -- we don't have a good basis for doing some
special deal with SolarCity because that's eﬀectively a conﬂict of interest. Ironically, a
conﬂict of interest goes away if we're one company. But it doesn't go away if we're
two separate companies. So like I said, it's not very good rationale for just oﬀering a
special deal and only working with one company that I also happen to own. I don't
think we have a good moral or legal basis for behaving a special way to SolarCity
unless it's actually one company.
{BIO 16897436 <GO>}
Got it. Then one more, if I can. Could you just rank some of the things that you talked
about in the order you look at as far as revenue synergies from cross-selling, the
technical synergies of being able to work with on both the panel side, as well as the
battery side and then maybe a third one, bucket, being cost synergies and then if I
forgot any out there, maybe list those as well in kind of the order that you're thinking
of them. Thanks.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I think we'll have a more deﬁnitive answer for you once this process wraps up.
So you have to regard what I'm saying here as anecdotal. But it's kind of the way I
think about it from a gut standpoint is like, ﬁrst and foremost, do we oﬀer -- what
allows us to oﬀer the most compelling product to consumers and businesses and a
seamlessly integrated product that all just works together, that's better. Like you
don't want to have to have a heterogeneous systems integration problem. That's just
basically where the interfaces break down and then people are pointing ﬁngers like
this didn't work; now, your thing didn't work. If it's just one integrated system, there
is no ﬁnger-pointing, you can iron out all the bugs and it just works. And you're not
wondering should I blame the solar company or the battery company or the who
knows. It's just like a pain, a pain in the butt to try to ﬁgure that out if you're the end
customer.
And I think we can guide the integrated product to just be right, to be better. So
that's kind of -- from that standpoint more than anything else and then in addition,
there's obvious cost savings to be had if in the same store we can sell twice as much
dollar volume. Well it's the same store, not selling twice as much stuﬀ. And with theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

than schedule two or three separate visits, that's also way better.
How much better is it? It's deﬁnitely some percentage better that's material, which is
kind of the threshold for making a decision. It's obviously going to be a lot better. If
you just cut the business down from 2 or 3 to 1, you've probably cut your transport
labor and logistics cost maybe in half, something like that. And if you have a
seamless integrated product, you have less servicing costs and things are going to
break down less. It's just the thing you'd want to buy if you were the end customer.
Why would you want to buy anything else?
Brian Brinkman, JPMorgan.
This is (inaudible) on behalf of Brian. Just a quick one from us. Have you had
conversations about this oﬀer already with the largest disinterested shareholders of
Tesla. And what's your sense in terms of do they see the same value in combining
the two businesses as you do? And what's your sense about how they vote on this?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We wanted to make sure everyone heard about it at the same time. So we've not
discussed it with anyone because we wanted investors (inaudible) at large[ph] to
hear about it at the same time. Separate and apart from that, over the years, has this
idea been bandied about with our larger shareholders, institutional shareholders?
Yes. There have been discussions and I think some of them see it as a natural thing to
do. But it is interesting to look at the feedback that I've received since we made the
announcement yesterday. Anyone who is product-focused sent me a congratulatory
note and like why didn't you do it sooner sort of message.
Then people that are sort of more ﬁnance-focused, they were a lot more worried
about it. In the long run, the value of a company is deﬁned by the value of its
products and services. That's real important to bear in mind. It's why companies
exist. They shouldn't exist otherwise. And the value of the Company will follow the
value of the products. A company that starts making lousy products is pretty soon
going to have a lousy valuation. And a product company that makes great products
is pretty soon going to have a great valuation because that's how the system is set
up and that's how it should be set up.

Great. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So look, I think a lot has been laid out
about the strategic vision for this longer term. But I wanted to piggyback on one of
the earlier questions and just get a sense of the possible ﬁnancial sense it makes in
the shorter term. And correct me if I'm wrong, I don't cover SolarCity. But my
understanding is the storage plus solar piece of that business is actually quite small.
You've had places like the Rocky Mountain Institute put out fairly detailed studies on
combining solar plus storage. That suggests the levelized cost of energy won't be
lower than the current available price for maybe call it 5 to 10 years. But you guys
sound very conﬁdent that this makes sense sooner. So I just wanted to get your view
on that.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, deﬁnitely. I think the important thing to bear in mind is it's a big world out there
and there are places where the cost of energy is much higher than other places. Like
for example, in Hawaii, energy costs are very high because they have to ship in all of
the fuel for their power plants. So it's very expensive and the economics of solar plus
battery make overwhelming sense for a place like Hawaii and a lot of actually island
nations out there. And really anyplace that has got expensive energy costs, or even
moderately expensive energy costs. And it's going to make sense for many parts of
Europe, many parts of the United States. Then, over time, it's going to make sense
for everywhere. Everywhere is going to be solar battery.
There will be some wind, of course, some geothermal, hydro and there'll be some
longtail before the ﬁnal coal plant ﬁnally stops operating, the ﬁnal natural gas plant
stops operating. Those might last -- there will be some longtail because it's going to
look like an S-curve as is typical for new technology adoption. So it's like in the
beginning of the S-curve people tend to underpredict what's going to happen and
then it goes to an exponential growth phase then and approximately linear growth
phase.
Usually people overpredict what's going to happen in the steep linear portion of the
growth phase and then it goes back into a logarithmic. So to complete the S-shape.
That's what happened with the Internet, for example, cell phones. Same thing will
happen here, yes.
{BIO 4638109 <GO>}
And I guess within the United States, do you think ﬁve years is a reasonable
timeframe for the economics to start to work?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. Less than that. It just needs to be on a scale that allows our factory to
operate at maximum capacity. So we think the factory is going to be operating at
maximum capacity as far into the future as we can see. This is all about production.

factor that we can.
And I mentioned this whole thing about manufacturing, a machine that builds the
machine. Order of magnitude improvements are what I think can be achieved. Won't
get there right away. But by version 3 of the machine that builds a machine, order of
magnitude. That's compared to car manufacturing, you look at that and it'll seem like
an alien dreadnaught, like (inaudible) what the hell is that.
And (inaudible) people don't realize just how much improvement potential is
possible. And this is thick. We're talking high school level physics necessary to ﬁgure
this out. It's not like mega-complicated. Just go to a factory and say do a volumetric
density calculation. Say what percentage of volume of the inside of this building is
doing useful stuﬀ versus (inaudible) or not doing useful stuﬀ. You'll be shocked at
how tiny that percentage is, like low single digits.
Then what is the velocity, what is the exit velocity of the product? How fast are things
moving out the exit? What's the mass ﬂow or mdot of the factory? It's like really low.
Like the fastest car plants in the world, the car exit velocity is basically grandma with
a walker. It's real slow, point 2 meters per second. That's really, really slow. So we
could do way better than that. Like the fastest person can run 10 meters per second,
faster than 10 meters per second. So why is car exit velocity only 0.2 meters per
second? That's ridiculous.
Then why is the volumetric eﬃciency of a car factory in the -- usually it's in the mid to
low single digits. That's very low. Why shouldn't it be at least volumetric density of
30% or 40%? 30% seems very, very achievable. Nobody would design a chip that
had volumetric eﬃciency of 2%. Would look ridiculous and yet they design factories
that way.
{BIO 4638109 <GO>}
Are these eﬃciencies that you are looking to put in place for your next Tesla plant, or
are these things we can see in Fremont at some stage in the near future?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
You'll see things moving that direction. With Model 3, I think we're -- if we're aspiring
to get to version 0.5 of alien dreadnought level of where -- alien dreadnought level
is like version 3. So you'll certainly see that directionally. Where it's most obvious is in
the cell production. So our engineering teams work very closely with Panasonic to
make dramatic improvements to the cell manufacturing eﬃciency and we think they
are probably approaching 3X the eﬃciency of the best plant in the world. So that's
pretty good. There's still a lot of room for improvement. Cells are going through that
thing like bullets from a machine gun. In fact, the exit rate of cells will be faster than
bullets from a machine gun.

Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of analysts that cover SolarCity are
highlighting major liquidity concerns at the Company. You sounded pretty conﬁdent
that that was going to turn cash ﬂow positive. What do you think they are seeing
diﬀerently and are you concerned at all that the cash burn may increase after the
deal?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think once the deal is done, the cash burn is likely to reduce because of reduced
cost of sales and just general operational eﬃciencies, like there's a lot of things that's
duplicated, that are duplicated. So we'd expect costs to decrease and to increase the
positive cash ﬂow from the SolarCity acquisition. Yes, might take like a few months
for those to come into eﬀect. But they are pretty short order. Let's say six months
after the acquisition is complete, I would expect those eﬃciencies to be there and be
signiﬁcant.

Okay. My second question, everyone is focused on capital and cash ﬂow here. I
guess, Elon, from your perspective, would Tesla be receptive, or would there be any
plans to provide capital to SolarCity in the interim during the pending acquisition?
Obviously, I'm thinking about it more from the SolarCity side. But given what we saw
with Vivint and SunEdison, the pending acquisition disrupted some access to the
capital markets. In the interim, I'm just trying to understand SolarCity's near-term
path and what you'd be willing to do from a Tesla standpoint. Thank you.

Since SolarCity is constrained in the short term from just going out and raising equity
itself, Tesla would provide a bridge loan, if needed. I actually don't think it's going to
be needed, to be clear, because that's something that's only fair and appropriate to
do. So we will be there if needed. But I don't think will be needed.

options on the retail front, actually, now that you mention it.
{BIO 21791854 <GO>}
I'm just wondering whether a car dealer association can say that it's a dealership if
it's selling more than cars, if it's also selling solar panels and power walls and if it's
going to change the look of the stores signiﬁcantly enough that that helps you guys
out with that?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think we'll still be prevented from actually including a car transaction, even if it's
part of a broader store. But usually there is not a limit on having galleries where you
simply display the car and have information about it. And we could look to conclude
transactions for solar and batteries. Yes. So something like that, it does open up
additional possibilities now that you mention it.

I just had a follow-up. So you mentioned the positives of rolling up SolarCity and I
think somebody earlier mentioned in so many words that the analysts have been
saying that this is a bailout of SolarCity. Can you just mention, if shareholders don't
vote for this, what happens? You mentioned that SolarCity in the next 3 to six months
should be a net cash generator. So it's not as bleak as some of these analysts have
been saying. SolarCity would be in a position if they don't vote for the potential
transaction with Tesla. Then, secondly, what does this deal mean for your
Gigafactory? Does it have any change? Timeline has changed because you are
going to have more capacity or not? Thank you.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. I don't know where this bailout comes from because Tesla is not the one
deciding what the market value of SolarCity is. The stock market is. So SolarCity
could certainly raise capital equity on its current valuation and I think without any
problem. So SolarCity is headed to I think a very healthy place from a cash ﬂow
standpoint in short order. So next sort of 3 to ﬁve months getting to cash ﬂow
positive.
So if a company is around the corner from being cash ﬂow positive and has the
ability to raise equity capital on its own, I don't see how an acquisition is in any way a
bailout. That's obviously a false description. Then the Gigafactory proceeds in a
penalty[ph] of SolarCity except that obviously we've geared the product -- the
storage product will be geared towards a SolarCity-type system. And this wouldn't
be something that would be explicitly exclusionary to other solar companies, by theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

Operatorway, it would just be that other solar companies would have to match the SolarCity
product in order to use that battery product most eﬀectively.
So it's not about trying to shut out other solar companies, it's just about being able
to guide the product to where it needs to go and then we'll do the right thing with
other solar companies if they are also guiding their products to match. So we're not
going to basically be a jerk to other solar companies. This is really about being laser-
focused on having the most compelling consumer solution. That's, I think, the right
thing to do.
{BIO 15433972 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you very much. Congratulations again.
Hank Elder, Goldman Sachs.
{BIO 17472882 <GO>}
This is actually Brian Lee on for Hank. I have just three housekeeping questions, more
along the deal itself. And in the interest of time, I'll just run through these quickly.
First is, given SolarCity's relationships with various lenders and tax equity fund
structures, I was hoping you could talk to any visibility into potential change in
control provisions and/or exposure to clawback provisions on solar tax credits that
might exist.
Second question would be, as part of the due diligence, will the Board consider
other alternatives to SolarCity? Then third one, then I will pass it on, is are there any
collars or caps on the stock exchange ratio being proposed. And if not, what's the
rationale for that? Thanks.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
This is kind of the beginning of the analysis, not the end. And normally, we'd be a lot
closer to the end because I'm the largest shareholder in both companies. It's
something we have to talk about at the beginning where we don't have all the
answers. But then we will compile those and present those to shareholders for their
decision in the months to come. So obviously part of that diligence process we'll be
talking to the lenders, making sure they are comfortable. I think it's a good idea.
Pretty sure they will. But we're going to talk to them.
And yes. And then in terms of other companies, we did consider that as part of the
initial diligence process. But we think SolarCity is the best company out there and it's
the leader in the ﬁeld. It has the Silevo technology. The product direction we believe
is correct in terms of making rapid progress towards a highly diﬀerentiated product.
And there's just no other company out there that's like that, at all.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-22

I have a quick question for Elon. I was just wondering, how does this acquisition play
out with the opportunities that Tesla may ﬁnd in micro-grids and grid space?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I think it's always good to productize things. It's like you can click here and buy
your micro-grid versus like having a tailored situation all over the place. If you can
productize it, it can just happen real fast. And so I think productizing the micro-grid.
So it's click here and you get a micro-grid. It just works. I think that's a good way to
go. I think consumers, obviously, appreciate things that are easy, simple, fast. But
actually corporate customers, utilities, they appreciate that too because they don't
want to have to go through a big laborious process that's a pain in the butt for them.
It blows their mind when they can just click a button and then we sold their thing and
it works.
Just because a product is great doesn't mean the whole process needs to be
complex. Bigness and complexity are not the same thing. So I think some of our
utility customers have been quite pleasantly surprised by just how easy it is to
implement. And it's going to get a lot easier in the future.
{BIO 17513488 <GO>}
All right, I think that's the end of the questions. Thank you, Todd and Elon and the
rest of the team. Thank you, Teria and thank you, investors, for all the interest. If you
have any closing remarks, Elon, otherwise we can end it there?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
No. I think those are a lot of great questions. And then obviously we'll have a lot
more information as the diligence process concludes, hopefully in the reasonably
near future. But I think it's easy to get mired in the details. But I think the right thing is
to look up and to the future and say where is this headed; what are the macro
trends; does this action match where the tides of history are going. And that's really
what's going to make the diﬀerence in the long term. So I'd just encourage people
to think in that way.
{BIO 17513488 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, everybody. Have a great day.
