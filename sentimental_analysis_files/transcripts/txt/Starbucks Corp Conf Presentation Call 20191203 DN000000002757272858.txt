Presentation
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. My name is John Glass. I'm the
Restaurant Analyst at Morgan Stanley. And on behalf of all my colleagues at Morgan
Stanley, welcome to our Global Consumer Conference. I was going to say, welcome
to our 25th Global Consumer Conference. It may or may not be, we don't know, but
it's been here a long time and so we appreciate it. Now, we did move it back this
year in the calendar to December to accommodate some of the retail companies, so
hopefully that's productive for you. So I thank you for your attendance. I also
particularly appreciate both yours and companies attendance given the weather and
the challenges that presented.
It's also my pleasure to introduce our ﬁrst Company of the conference, Starbucks. I'm
going to turn over the podium in a moment to Pat Grismer, the CFO. But I've had the
pleasure of following Starbucks nearly from its IPO and watch this Company grow
from a 200 or 300 unit, back then we called it a retailer, to really the global
behemoth that it is today. Pat's going to make a few opening remarks, and then, we'll
sit down and have a more informal chat about the business. So with that, welcome
Pat. Thanks for coming out.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. John, I'm happy to see, you are
proudly displaying your Starbucks cup.
There are a couple of points I'd like to highlight just ahead of our ﬁreside chat. First
of all, this is a global consumer and retail conference. So I'd ﬁrst like to highlight the
unique investment characteristics of Starbucks in the global retail food and beverage
space. And then, secondly, the improved quality of earnings that we expect in our
ﬁscal '20. But ﬁrst, I will draw your attention to the safe harbor statement on the
screen, because I will be making some forward-looking statements this morning.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Page 2 of 13Our proprietary consumer and brand equity research substantiates the strength of
the Starbucks brand maintaining our competitive edge in our two lead growth
markets of the US and China. And we're building on those brand strengths with
focused strategies to drive predictable, sustainable sales growth.
In the US, Starbucks remains the clear ﬁrst choice among retail coﬀee brands,
including independent and local concepts. Our research has also validated that
younger consumers in particular have a strong liking for Starbucks. This includes
millennials and centennials, and this bodes well for the future of our brand. And in
China, Starbucks continues to be customers' ﬁrst choice for away-from-home coﬀee,
leading the competition on all key brand attributes.
Our customers' exceptional aﬃnity for the Starbucks brand is deeply rooted in the
unique connections that our partners make with our customers and we're taking
decisive steps to further elevate the in-store experience to create those best
moments that uplift the every day. Starbucks is further diﬀerentiated on the basis of
our ability to provide premium coﬀee, craft and consistency at scale, often supported
by proprietary breakthrough beverage innovation. Examples include Nitro Cold
Brew as well as Cold Foam Cold Brew, most recently, our hugely popular Pumpkin
Cream Cold Brew and just announced today, our new Irish Cream Cold Brew, a
festive twist on a customer favorite.
And ﬁnally, Starbucks has industry-leading digital platforms that we are continuing to
enhance to accelerate digital customer engagement. In the US, our research
conﬁrms that Starbucks leads in having a mobile app that meets consumers' needs.
This is helping to fuel the growth of our Starbucks Rewards Loyalty program, where
our 90-day active member base grew year-over-year 15% to more than 17 million
members at the end of our fourth quarter. This is an important driver of growth
because we know from our experience that when customers join our rewards
program, their total spend with Starbucks increases meaningfully.
Our digital success has been equally compelling in China, where our loyalty
program awareness and conversion metrics exceed those of our competitors. Our
up-leveled rewards program was launched a year ago and our 90-day active loyalty
base in China grew 45% year-over-year to 10 million members at the end of our
fourth quarter.
The strength of our brand and the eﬀectiveness of our growth strategies are
reﬂected in a superior growth proﬁle. Compared to other large-scale global brands
in the retail food and beverage sector, Starbucks is growing system-wide stores at a
much faster rate. Globally, we're expecting robust net new unit growth at 6% to 7%.
This includes 3% to 4% net new unit growth in the US, which is industry-leading for a
concept of our size. Importantly, Starbucks is the only brand at this scale which has
grown store count in the US in the past three years and still Starbucks is far from full
penetration in our home market, expanding in the Central and Southern regions of
the country primarily with high volume drivers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Q - John GlassThis stronger pace of development for a concept of our scale is enabled by the
substantial investment returns that we realize through new store development. So
let's look at the facts. As a beverage-forward concept, we enjoy a relatively high
product margin coupled with limited kitchen investment. Our margin is further
enhanced by our unique brand stature that generates unpaid media exposure,
reducing our need for advertising expense compared to other concepts. These
unique economic characteristics yield overall investment returns that are very
attractive and act as a catalyst for shareholder value creating Company store
development in our two lead growth markets, as well as asset free license store
development everywhere we operate.
Moving on to our outlook for ﬁscal 2020 non-GAAP EPS growth, where we expect
the quality of our earnings growth to improve compared to ﬁscal 2019. Now, as a
reminder, our non-GAAP EPS growth in ﬁscal '19 was 17%, and it was lifted by several
non-operating items, including unplanned tax favorability with core operating
results, contributing 6 points of growth. At the midpoint of our non-GAAP EPS
guidance for ﬁscal 2020, a more modest rate of revenue growth is expected to more
than oﬀset stronger margin performance, reversing a trend from the last three years.
This yields 9 percentage points of EPS growth from operating results at the midpoint
of our guidance, up 3 percentage points from the prior year. And when excluding
the impacts of various non-operating items like tax and streamline and foreign
exchange, our non-GAAP EPS growth rate in ﬁscal '20 is expected to be 12% at the
midpoint, which is in line with our long-term growth model of at least 10% non-GAAP
EPS growth.
So in closing, with Starbucks exceptional brand strength and superior growth proﬁle,
we are conﬁdent in our ability to deliver our long-term growth algorithm of double-
digit EPS growth, coupled with a dividend yield of approximately 2%, which is quite
compelling for a double-digit grower.
So this concludes my opening remarks and I'm now happy to join John for our
ﬁreside chat and thank you for your attention.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Thanks very much Pat. I wonder if we can start by talking about the US business and
you alluded to success with some of the new beverage innovation. But I think the
question we often get as analysts and investors ask is, you've seen a meaningful step
up in the performance in the US comp store sales in the last two quarters on an one
and two-year basis. And many of the things you've been doing over the past year
have been present all along. So what has really driven that material step up in the
momentum in the business? If you could sort of walk through the two or three things
you think are contributing most to that improved performance relative to, say, three
or four quarters ago?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Q - John Glass
A - Patrick Grismer{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, for us it really has been more of a journey. We are very pleased with the
steadily building momentum in our business on the back of signiﬁcantly increased
focus and discipline across every dimension of our business. This includes the three
pillars that I mentioned previously, the in-store experience, beverage innovation and
digital customer engagement, and it has been a steady stream of activities across
each of those pillars that collectively have yielded this increased momentum.
And I'll cite as an example, the rollout of Nitro Cold Brew. So we were rolling out
Nitro Cold Brew equipment across our Company-owned store portfolio for the last
12 to 18 months. We achieved 80% penetration in the US in August, which gave us
the ability then to go on air to advertise, to build awareness around the Nitro Cold
Brew platform and its unique characteristics. We achieved full penetration by the end
of our ﬁscal year. So that's an example of the type of activity that has been rolling out
over a period of time, providing us with this upward momentum for the last couple
of years following what had been a couple of years of relatively uneven
performance. Our goal in all of this is to lay the groundwork for predictable,
sustainable growth over the long term.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
That's helpful. Can you talk a little bit more speciﬁcally about beverage innovation.
It's beverage-forward Company. So a couple of years ago, I think, there was a pivot
toward food, thinking that food maybe was an answer. And I think maybe one of the
insights maybe more recently has been more focus on beverage. So can you talk a
little bit more about how you see that beverage platform unfolding? And in
particular cold beverages have been driving your business, Is there a concern as the
cold weather months are around the head -- around the corner here now, you're
launching a cold beverage platform, Irish Cream today, does that diminish the
impact of cold beverages or is that not the right way to think about that?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, ﬁrst, with respect to how we have thought about innovating behind beverages
versus the ﬁrst part of your question, there is no doubt that food remains an
important part of what we oﬀer. But as I mentioned before, one of the aspects of our
business that has been instrumental to the overall positive momentum that we've
witnessed for the last 12 to 18 months, has been focus. And we've taken our product
innovation resources and focused them more around beverage as opposed to what
traditionally had been split between food and beverage. We recognize that we are a
beverage-forward concept, beverage is our key point of diﬀerentiation. It
contributed 5 of the 6 points of comp sales growth in the most recent quarter in the
US. And so by applying more focus and more resource to beverage innovation and
driving more consumer research to drive more insights around what is going to
resonate most with our customer base, particularly young customers, we've
identiﬁed those insights that have allowed us to introduce new products that have
performed better than in earlier years. And I would say out of that has come
signiﬁcant insight around cold beverages, which have ﬁgured quite prominently inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Q - John Glass
A - Patrick Grismer
Q - John Glassthe growth of our beverage platform in the last couple of years. And this speaks to
what appeals to young people and also what resonates across all dayparts.
Cold beverages have performed very well for us, not only in the afternoon as you
would expect during the warmer months, but truly year round, and even in the
morning hours, where oftentimes consumers are looking for something that is more
refreshing, not necessarily something that is strictly hot.
In response to your question then around whether we're seeing any pressure on hot
beverages, we continue to see growth in our hot beverage platform and so we're
seeing growth across the entire range of beverages, and we remain very pleased
with the insights that we're gaining that we're able to capitalize in the way that we
introduce new product news. The other thing I would highlight that has changed
from two years ago is that we were previously more reliant on limited time oﬀer
beverages, so what we called Sparks, which drove spikes in our business and caused
a lot of disruption in our store operations. And so the approach that we're taking
today is to land more innovative beverage platforms around which we can innovate
going forward. So Cold Foam would be a perfect example of that. We used Cold
Foam to launch our Cloud Macchiato platform. We introduced Cold Foam with the
hugely popular Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam beverage that was part of our fall lineup
and Cold Foam is the key diﬀerentiator for the Irish Cream Cold Foam that we
launched just today. So those are some examples of how we have introduced
platforms that help us introduce new innovation in ways that don't drive a lot of
disruption in our stores.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
And then, just ﬁnally on that topic, can you talk about the afternoon business, right?
That was a big hole in the business as Frappuccino's appeal waned over the last few
years. Have you recaptured those afternoon sales or is that still a drag on the comp?
How do you characterize how the afternoon business has done in the last few
quarters?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So afternoon daypart had been a challenge for us for many years, in many ways
because of the strength of Frappuccino several years ago. And as consumers, we're
looking to pivot away from the more indulgent beverage, we saw Frappuccino sales
decline and that weighed particularly on our afternoon daypart. What has happened
is two things: number one, the reduction or the decline in Frappuccino sales has
plateaued. It's still a meaningful part of our business, but we're not seeing the rate of
decline that we had seen in previous years, and at the same time, we've been very
successful with what we've launched by way of new cold beverages that have taken
up some of that demand. So not just Nitro Cold Brew or Cold Foam Cold Brew or
Cold Foam Cold Brew, but also our Refreshers line and our line of ﬂavored iced teas.
Those have outperformed really well and it contributed to the turnaround in our
afternoon business for the last few quarters.

Page 6 of 13A - Patrick GrismerThat's very helpful. I want to pivot now to digital, and a couple of questions on
digital. Starbucks really I think pioneered in many ways the digital relationship it has
with its customers through its loyalty program. Now, it's transformed into mobile
order and pay and ultimately to delivery. You have changed that loyalty program
there, which was sort of the keystone a couple of times, right, it migrated from Value
of Stars and now you've changed it again to the redemption levels. I think that was
done in the third quarter, the June quarter, if I got that correct. So how has the
response been to that? Has that gone smoothly, has that actually increased utilization
as you had hoped of the digital and the royalty program?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We could not be more pleased with how our relaunch of Starbucks Rewards landed
in April. So it was the start of our third ﬁscal quarter as you mentioned. And the
structural change that we made was one that increased the ﬂexibility with which
Starbucks Rewards or Stars are both earned and redeemed. Previously, one of the
friction points in loyalty program membership was a green tier, where customers
needed to accumulate 300 Stars to reach gold status and then had to accumulate
another 125 Stars in order to start redeeming. So with the introduction of multi-tier
redemption, or MTR as we call it in April, we removed that green tier and we allowed
customers to start redeeming with as few as 25 Stars and we expanded the range of
products available for redemption. So a range of redemption levels from 25 Stars up
to 400 Stars, including merchandise and at-home coﬀee purchases. And we've seen
signiﬁcant positive customer response to this change, which was exactly what we
had designed for because in fact there was signiﬁcant customer research that went
into the program design and a signiﬁcant eﬀort to educate our partners and
customers about the changes, so that there wasn't a surprise, and so the customers
and partners alike could understand the value that is unlocked by providing this
level of ﬂexibility.
And so on the back of that program, we have seen improved customer engagement
with the loyalty program. We've attracted more, what we call, occasional customers
into the program, which means that they don't visit Starbucks as frequently, which for
us creates signiﬁcant opportunity because we know from our experience that as we
migrate customers from what we call digitally registered into full rewards members,
we see their spend increase substantially. Now, I would highlight this change as
something that has more of a ﬂip-the-switch impact to our business as opposed to
the steady build that I was mentioning earlier, because from the moment we turned
on that program, we saw these positive results start to accumulate.
The other thing I would mention is that when we introduced MTR in April, we took
the opportunity to introduce an enhanced personalized marketing engine into our
technology stack. And the importance of this is that it allows us through machine
learning to gain increasing insights around what matters most to our customers,
which informs the oﬀers that we make to them digitally. And on the back of these
enhancements, we have seen the contribution from digital customer engagement
increase from what had been closer to 1% comp to 2 points of comp in the last two
quarters.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 13Q - John Glass
A - Patrick Grismer
Q - John Glass
A - Patrick Grismer{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
And just to be clear on that, you said it was an immediate impact when you changed
and that was a result of new non-users of the loyalty program coming in or was it the
spend increase? I think one of your observations early on about loyalty was your
loyalty users were spending more and that was driving a lot back when traﬃc was
more scarce, check was really driving your comp and check impact was driven by
loyalty members. Is that still the case, or are you seeing this new program actually
resulting in traﬃc or some other -- manifesting itself in some other way in comps?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We are seeing both. So we are seeing, as in the last quarter, a 15% increase and
acceleration in the growth of our membership base and we are seeing increased
frequency.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Before leaving the US, I want to ask about delivery. It's obviously an important topic
in the industry. I think there is still a debate as to what delivery ultimately yields to the
restaurant industry. In particular for Starbucks, provide us where you are on delivery?
And more importantly, how do you think about this business? Or is this a -- we're
going to see -- (inaudible) to see because we don't really understand what the use
case may or may not for delivering coﬀee?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So I'll talk about delivery with respect to our two lead growth markets, because we're
seeing a diﬀerent proﬁle of delivery business in the US versus China. In the US, it's a
slower build. I think in part because compared to food and beverage delivery
generally, we are at a lower ticket and so the delivery charge is a higher percentage
of ticket and probably acts as a bit of a barrier to utilization of delivery for beverages
only. So we are very pleased with the program that we've established in partnership
with Uber Eats. We selected Uber Eats because of their national coverage and we do
expect to achieve national coverage of our stores with delivery in ﬁscal '20. But it has
been a slow build. So we aren't seeing it mix at a very high rate. What we are getting,
we are seeing incrementality, which is important because delivery transactions on
the margin are margin dilutive because they include additional costs, both the
delivery commission, as well as packaging. But if the delivery transactions are highly
incremental then we're growing total proﬁts even at the expense of our margin
percentage. But it's early days in the US. As I mentioned, we're seeing a slow build,
but we expect that over time, this could increase as consumers are increasingly
looking for convenience.
The other thing I would highlight is that we are seeing with our delivery transactions
a signiﬁcantly greater average check and that's because with delivery, we see higher
rates of food attach than we see in our stores and we're also seeing a higher average
party size, particularly in an oﬃce environment, where if one individual, if one
customer is sending out for Starbucks, chances are others will hop on to the order.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Q - John Glass
A - Patrick Grismer
Q - John Glass
A - Patrick GrismerSo I contrast that with China. China, we launched delivery a little over a year ago in
partnership with Alibaba and we've seen a nice steady build in that business. In the
most recent quarter, delivery mix did about 7% of our total sales. And we're seeing
that in China as opposed to the US, consumers perceive this as oﬀering even greater
value because of the value they place on convenience and having the beverages
brought to them. So I think it's a more established use case, it's a more established
customer behavior and we're seeing that in the way that our business is building
there. But as in the US, those transactions come at a slightly lower margin for the
reasons I mentioned, but we're seeing nice incrementality to an extent that builds
our total proﬁts.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
I want to pivot to China, but just as we think about the diﬀerence in delivery between
the US and China, how diﬀerent are the economics both to you and the consumer? Is
it popular or growing faster in China because it's just a better value proposition to
the consumers, relative to the size of the check and how are the economics looking
to Starbucks delivery US versus China?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So from a consumer perspective, I would say that the value proposition given the
commission structure is more attractive than in the US. And I would say from a
Company perspective, there are also diﬀerences in the commission structure such
that the proﬁtability of those delivered transactions is longer in China than in the US.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
I want to now talk about China as a whole. And before maybe getting into the
details, the competitive landscape in China has been a subject of debate right, large
market obviously, and attractive category, usually attracts competition, and you've
got one competitor in particular, it's grown rapidly and the results recently have
been relatively strong. Your results by the way, at least through the last couple of
quarters, have also been strong. What have you learned, what has Luckin taught you
about the business in China? What lessons do you take from their successes to the
extent you observe them and how is that reﬂected diﬀerently now in your business?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So the way I think about it is that Luckin has validated what we have known for years,
which is that the specialty coﬀee retail category in China is very attractive and has
signiﬁcant growth potential. And I think that this is particularly striking for a culture
like China that is based in tea drinking. But for many years now, Starbucks has
demonstrated the growing appeal of premium coﬀee. When you look at the statistics
in the US, per capita coﬀee consumption is around 300 cups. In China, it's fewer
than four cups. So there is signiﬁcant headroom for growth and Starbucks has
demonstrated again the appeal and the growth potential of that category. And that
has attracted -- our success has attracted a lot of competitors, Luckin being one.
I think it is also important to put Luckin's performance into perspective. They
frequently highlight the number of points of distribution that they have opened inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 13Q - John Glass
A - Patrick GrismerChina, but they also I think clarify that more than 90% of those points of distribution
are pickup locations. They're very diﬀerent from the third place environment, the
premium experience that Starbucks oﬀers. We feel very good about the position that
we've staked out competitively in China, the ﬁrst mover advantages that we've
gained with our strong brand awareness and brand aﬃnity. And we believe that the
space is large enough today and in the future to accommodate this competition. In
many ways, the competition has helped to build further awareness of the specialty
retail coﬀee. It has grown the category and we believe that with our points of
diﬀerentiation around premium coﬀee and a premium third place experience, that
we will continue to thrive.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Do you think though -- I mean they do -- it's not just that they are in the category,
would you -- they approach the consumer relationship diﬀerently, right, it's all digital,
a lot of it's pickup and delivery itself. There is a lot -- it's a diﬀerent -- and the pricing
is very diﬀerent, there isn't really a set menu pricing. Has those experiences changed
the way you think about how you want to engage consumer? And I guess to that
point you've changed, so that you've got more order and pay now in China, you
hadn't had it really before, like materialized, you've been doing I guess what
Starbucks Now stores which are these more pickup. So maybe can you talk about the
things that are -- you are evolving maybe it's just that the consumer is there and how
Starbucks has responded to those changes in the consumer?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We feel very good about our track record of innovation in China. We have continued
to evolve as a concept and innovate along with the Chinese consumers and their
growing and evolving tastes and preferences. Yes, it's true, in the last year, we have
made signiﬁcant progress on the digital front. It was, as I mentioned, a little over a
year ago that we established our partnership with Alibaba and used that as a basis
for launching delivery, which has added meaningful layer to our business. It was
about a year ago that we also relaunched our loyalty program, moving to a spend-
based loyalty program. And as I mentioned earlier, in the most recent quarter now
lapping nearly the one year launch of that program, 45% growth in our loyalty base.
And then, ﬁnally, as you mentioned, more recently, I think starting in the month of
May, we rolled out our mobile order and pay. And through the end of September,
we were already in two-thirds of our stores across the market. And we're seeing nice
customer acceptance of that oﬀer. And in the summer we innovated our very ﬁrst
Starbucks Now pick up and go location. We opened our second location recently in
Beijing and we expect to open many more in the coming ﬁscal year. So I think that
this is more of a continuation of what has been a long rich history of innovation and
evolution of the concept to meet the evolving taste of customers.
The other thing I'd want to say again just to put Luckin's business in perspective and
as much as they have talked about their points of distribution in the most recent
quarter, and of course, this information is now available to all, their total sales were
about one-third of Starbucks' total sales. So yes, increasing points of distribution, but
signiﬁcantly lower average unit volumes. And I think it's fair to say based on what it isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Q - John Glassthey oﬀer customers, they're going after a diﬀerent customer, they're going after a
diﬀerent occasion. We feel very good about the position that we've staked in
premium coﬀee and a premium experience and we believe that we are well
positioned to further capitalize on that as the category continues to grow.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
And then just ﬁnally I'm trying to -- you framed your comp guidance for this year and
long-term still at 1% to 3%. You've been running 5% to 6%. What is the hesitation?
And whereas I think your outlook for the US, although that range maybe can change,
obviously, it's been emboldened by recent trends. What is the hesitation, is trying to
just less certain around where the outcomes could be, or do you see something you
get concerned about as you looked into the back half of 2020?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
There has been variability in the performance of our China business in the last
couple of years. In the most recent two quarters, we were lapping some weaker
performance arguably. And we feel that a target of 1% to 3% in the current
environment is prudent for three reasons. We've highlighted before that our overall
rate of comp sales growth has been impacted by three things. And that explains why
we're guiding to the low-single digits as opposed to what had traditionally been
mid-to-high single digits.
Number one is that we have picked up the pace of new unit development. And with
that comes cannibalization. And we're doing that because again we see the
signiﬁcant growth potential in the market and the opportunity to capitalize on the
strength of our brand position. So the ﬁrst piece is, we're eﬀectively doing it to
ourselves by doing it intentionally in the interest of growing total transactions and
total sales.
Number two is, as I mentioned before, our success has proven the attractiveness of
the category and has drawn a lot of competition. That's impacting us on the margin.
No one particular competitor, but the competitive set in the aggregate has
intensiﬁed, has grown and it is impacting us. And the third is in the last two to three
years, the rate of economic growth in the market has slowed. It's still pretty healthy at
around 6%, but that's down from where it was previously. And that is impacting retail
footfall and that is another contributing factor to a low-single digit comp sales
growth, which we feel is a prudent long-term guidance for that business.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
I wanted to ask brieﬂy now on the Global Coﬀee Alliance, an important part of your
business in the CPG, or Channel Development business. And that is,18 months ago,
you sold or you licensed the business to Nestle to distribute your packaged coﬀee
around the world. Can you talk just about where you are standing now 18 months
later in terms of the growth of that business? And I know there is a dynamic in 2020
on revenue growth. I just want to make sure we understand what the headwinds and
tailwinds are in '20, and how we should think about the growth of the CPG of Global
Coﬀee lines going forward?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

So we could not be more pleased with how the Global Coﬀee Alliance with Nestle
has landed in terms of what it has done to accelerate the penetration of the
Starbucks brand in international markets. In the ﬁrst year of the alliance, we
expanded to more than 30 markets and we expect to get up to 50 markets in the
ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2020. That is much faster than we could have ever penetrated those
markets on our own. So we're pleased with how that is building the awareness and
the presence of our brand globally in CPG channels.
It isn't showing up in our revenues in ﬁscal '20 the way that we expect it to show at
much longer term because there is a headwind from some of the inventory building
that was done in ﬁscal '19. So we're overlapping that in ﬁscal '20. And we do expect
that as we accelerate the pace of international market penetration, our royalty
income will grow. So we had outlook for the Channel Development business in our
long-term model, revenue growth of 4% to 6%. The way I would segment that is in
the near term, it's more 4% to 5%, and in the medium-to-long term it's 5% to 6%.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Got it. That's very helpful. And then, ﬁnally, let's talk a little bit about the ﬁnancials.
You highlighted the earnings model that the Company has of at least 10% earnings
growth and how you're going to see higher quality earnings growth in 2020. I think
your comment was around margins. Can you talk about what you think the margin
potential in this business is? I think a year ago, you framed it at 17% to 18% operating
margin, but historically it's been higher. And there has been some changes in the
structure of the business. But what is the longer-term opportunity in margins? Is this
the kind of business where you'd like to manage it to those margins, the
reinvestment and reinvest continue sort of competitive advantage or maybe talk a
little bit about where you think those targets can be?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Absolutely. Where we start is around what is necessary in order to sustain long term,
healthy top-line growth. And one of the things we know about our brand is that, it
requires a level of investment to maintain clear points of diﬀerentiation around our
partners and technology. And so that does come at the expense of margin. I still feel
very good about the margin guidance of 17% to 18% for the next three years. That's
not to suggest that we don't have the potential to move beyond that, but it really
comes down to how we think about balancing the need to invest, in particular
behind partners and technology, to sustain top-line growth that provides us a sales
leverage that helps to pay for those investments and cover inﬂation. I would also say
that we continue to be very diligent in ﬁnding productivity opportunities at store
level and above store to create more capacity for the investments that, again, we
know are instrumental to our ability to sustain that predictable, sustainable top-line
growth.

Can you just talk a little bit more speciﬁcally about where the margin opportunities
are? I think a year or so ago G&A was a target and you had a hard number of, I think,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Q - John Glassit was $1.7 billion by 2021. And now it's changed a bit, maybe part of it's the re-
segmenting of the business, part of it is maybe you've just explored other options
around supply chain. So where do you see the biggest buckets in terms of
opportunity as we look at your P&L?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So, the opportunities remain in G&A and we remain committed to delivering those
eﬃciency gains that were identiﬁed a couple of years ago, and that will play out
through the end of ﬁscal '21. You're right, the re-segmentation has clouded that a
little bit, but nonetheless in the guidance that we provide, we continue to expect
signiﬁcant eﬃciency gains in G&A. That will show up in our P&L in ﬁscal '20. And as
we've re-segmented and changed some of the line and classiﬁcations we've applied
that historically and retroactively. So the like-for-like percentages of G&A relative to
revenue will demonstrate in ﬁscal '20 that improvement.
We're also expecting, as you mentioned, supply chain to continue to deliver. We've
been very successful over the years through our increasing scale and through the
relationships we have with our suppliers, as well as through the work that we're
doing on product innovation to optimize gross margin. We do expect that will
continue to be a source of margin improvement.
And then, ﬁnally, I would highlight what we're continuing to do at the store level.
Even as we continue to invest behind partner labor and behind technology, we're
ﬁnding those opportunities to realize eﬃciencies in the way that we operate to
create more capacity for those investments in ways that enable us to manage
through that 17% to 18% a year in the near term, while still having the potential to go
beyond that depending on how we balance sales growth against those investments
in any particular year.

Fantastic. Thanks very much for coming out this morning. We really appreciate your
time and for those of you want to follow-up on this conversation, we're going to
breakout immediately following this. So, thanks.
