Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to lululemon's Annual
General Meeting, our 11th Annual General Meeting. And by the way, for a fun fact,

you've ﬁgured out by now, we're holding a virtual meeting. All shareholders are
going to vote online and we'll be taking questions at the end of the meeting. So it's
all being done through webcast. The board is all here today with me as well as some
key members of management. So from the board, which is -- as representing your

Page 2 of 7So here is our agenda for today. I'm going to make a few remarks on behalf of the
board. And then I'm going to hand the call over to Shannon, who's going to go
through the formal part of the AGM. Then, Stuart is going to give us the results for
the full year 2017, with some color to that and talk about Q1 2018, the results, by the
way, which we put out last Thursday. And for all intents and purposes, were very well-
received by analysts and investors.
So my ﬁrst time as Chairman of the Board. And let me just set the context of the
comments I'd like to make and then we'll get through the formal agenda. So it's clear
to the board and I'm sure to people on the phone that 2017 got oﬀ to a bit of a slow
start. But the board was really proud of the management team who took all the
corrective measures they need to take and actually demonstrated to us and
hopefully the people on the phone a high level of grit and determination by taking
those corrective measures. And when the year was done, we were able to produce
revenue growth of 13% and EPS growth of 21%.
So the board is very supportive of the management team's view of the strategic
direction of the company. So representing the shareholders on the phone, we spend
a lot of time with management. We spent time with them yesterday as well as today.
And the strategic framework that we're supportive of that's going to create
incremental shareholder value for all shareholders. The foundation of the work the
management team is doing is really grounded in this commitment to continuous
improvement. I mean, any great business understands they're going to have
strategic initiatives to put forward. But if your foundation isn't strong, you can't layer
on new ideas on top of foundation that isn't continuously being improved upon. And
our management team understands that.
On top of that foundation, some of the initiatives that the board is very supportive of
is the need for the company to extend the categories beyond its core. We see a real
opportunity to create value in that area of looking at categories like beyond
accessories into maybe footwear down the road, extending categories beyond the
core of the company. Secondly, we believe that we have a business that can be taken
globally. We're just in the early stages now in some countries in Europe. And
obviously, we are in China and Japan and Korea and Australia. But we see a real
opportunity for this brand to be taken around the globe.
I'd say, thirdly, we have embraced the use of data analytics in the business. And as
we're going to create more shareholder value, one of the ways is to embrace new
tools to drive that shareholder value. And that's going on in the company right now.
And lastly, the management team really wants to create competitive advantages.
And competitive advantages for us are in a couple of areas, everything else I talked
about on strategic initiatives but some competitive advantages for us are in digital
and in channel innovation.
So those 5 initiatives, again, layered on top of a ever-strengthening foundation for
the company, are critical for us creating shareholder value. So I'm looking forward to
coming back next year at this time and reporting on how exactly did the
management team do, what areas do we feel good about, where do we still needFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

Page 3 of 7Shannon Higginsonimprovement because the one thing you need to know, even though Q1 was an
indicator of a business that's gaining momentum and starting to gain market share,
that the Board of Directors and the management team believe there is so much
more to do at lululemon.
With that said, let me pass the call over to Shannon Higginson, who will take us
through the formal part of the meeting. And I'll come back afterwards to answer
some of our questions.

{BIO 17615686 <GO>}
Thanks, Shannon. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that a reconciliation of
GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and our
earnings press releases. Fiscal 2017 is a strong year for lululemon, with our results
keeping us on track to achieve our ambition of $4 billion in revenue in 2020.
Key ﬁnancial highlights for 2017 include a 13% increase in revenue, a 7% increase in
total comparable sales and a 100 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin
to 19%. These results were driven by new stores and new store formats, product
innovations and enhanced e-commerce oﬀering supported by our strong brand
momentum and successful community and brand activations. With regard to stores,
we opened 46 net new lululemon-branded company-operated stores, including 30
in North America, 14 in Asia Paciﬁc and 2 in Europe. In product, I highlight -- I'd likeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06

Page 5 of 7A - Glenn K. Murphyto highlight the launch of our Everlux fabric and light bra for women and the
expansion of our ABC pant franchise for men. In digital, we successfully improved
our online experience through upgraded visuals, added video content, more
intuitive navigation, enhanced storytelling and integration of our ivivva business.
Turning now to Q1 2018, we are very pleased with our performance. Just last week,
we reported our strong results for Q1. And I direct you to our investor site for all the
details.
I'll just highlight a few headlines from the quarter now, including -- the results have
included a 25% increase in net revenue to $650 million, a total comparable sales
increase of 19% on a constant dollar basis, comprised of a comparable store sales
increase of 6% and e-commerce increase of 60%. A 400 basis point increase in
operating margin compared to the adjusted operating margin for Q1 2017 and
diluted earnings per share of $0.55.
In Q1, we celebrated International Women's Day with events in key cities around the
globe, including Washington, D.C., Melbourne and London. Also in the quarter, we
delivered on a commitment we made last year to achieve pay equity for women and
men across our organization by the end of 2018, nine months early. Nearly 80% of
our workforce is comprised of women and we knew this was simply the right thing to
do and we intend to maintain this standard moving forward.
We're successfully executing on our strategies and seeing consistent results across
several key parts of the business that are now extending into Q2 and further setting
the stage for us to achieve our 2020 goals.
The path we're taking to achieve these goals includes product innovation across
categories with signiﬁcant opportunity remaining in the men's area in particular;
expanding the lululemon footprint in both North America and our international
markets; and continuing to accelerate our digital business.
At this point, we will take questions from shareholders. Please submit your questions
through the virtual meeting portal.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 3227772 <GO>}
Thank you, Stuart. We actually have 2 questions in the meeting portal. The ﬁrst one is
regarding the selling of products with down in them. So lululemon does sell
products with down, it's 1% of our products, by the way. But the question is, lulu
knows -- "Does lulu know that animals suﬀer in the production of its down items. So
when will it stop selling them?" So as I said at the beginning, we have 1% of our
products in down. We actually are certiﬁed today with responsible down standards.
So the company has been certiﬁed. With that said, we're not the kind of company
that hides behind certiﬁcations. I think we always try to either engage withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 6 of 7Operatorstakeholders or in some cases NGOs and listen to what people's concerns are. While
it is only 1% of our assortment, we are actually certiﬁed and we stand beside the
certiﬁcation we have. I think this is still a conversation we're willing to engage with
any shareholders to understand exactly what their concerns are. Could we do better?
We make no promises but we're willing to have members of management, which
we're willing to talk to the person who submitted the question, engage with people
in our supply chain, understand what their concerns are. But I don't want to again
overset an expectation, we do believe we're doing all the right things and have
gotten the proper certiﬁcations when it comes to our products that have down.
The second question comes from our founder. And I just want to get to the crux of
the question, which is the company has not had a functional CEO for 11 months in the
last ﬁve years and no CEO pipeline for eight years. And this is the board's #1 job.
What actions has the board taken to ﬁx this? Thank you. And that's from Chip Wilson.
I don't think anybody around this table would disagree that one of the top priorities
for the board, certainly in the top 3, is succession planning. It's funny that the
question came up today, as we just ﬁnished spending the better part of the morning
with the management team going through succession planning. Obviously, part of
that is CEO conversation, which I'll get to in a second. But I think any good board
doesn't entirely focus on the CEO, wants to make sure that every part of the
organization that we are committed to succession planning, developing people,
getting them ready for the next opportunity, stretching people with projects. I think
any good board understands that. When it comes to the CEO, I don't think anybody
here feels good that, recently, as our CEO resigned on February 5, that we were not
in a position to appoint somebody internally right away. So I think the search is
going well. We're going to ﬁnd somebody that I think all shareholders, including our
founder and our employees and our educators are going to feel very comfortable
with and proud that they're the new leader of the company.
With that said, the board has taken the situation very seriously. And as we engage
our new CEO, I've actually doubled down our eﬀorts to make sure, going forward,
God forbid. And as our new CEO comes in, for some reason, is not here for the
extended period of time which we want our new leader to be here, we will be
putting all the steps in place, including developing people who will be working for
the new leader of our new CEO down the road, getting them ready to step into the
new role. There's many tactics we can use to make sure we keep them engaged in
the company. Keep them motivated and get them ready to run this amazing brand at
some point in the future. So we take that responsibility very seriously, as all boards
do. And we plan on making sure the steps are in place for the future.
With that said, we had 2 questions today, which we're always happy to take more but
we only had 2. That concludes the actual Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of
lululemon for 2018. And we look forward to speaking to everybody (sometime) --
well, (it won't be sometime,) we'll speak to you quarterly, for all our shareholders, as
we put out our results. We'll have the oﬃcial Annual General Meeting in June of
2019. Thank you, everybody.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-06
