Alright, let's start. I know people are still kind of ﬂocking in, because we have the --
the changing overs [ph] are tight here, at our conference. Chris, good to see you
again.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Good [ph] to see you.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
It's -- now in a diﬀerent role. Maybe let's start with, actually, what's the current role for
you? How would you deﬁne it?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Sure, sure. And thank you Raimo for having me here. It's good to see you -- good to
be back in the saddle as I was telling Mike earlier today. So I've been in the current
role for two years -- just about two years, and currently I am the Head of Finance or
the CFO for our Cloud and the AI division. I think most of you will be more familiar
with that as largely synonymous with the external reporting segment, we call the
Intelligent Cloud. That encompasses certainly Azure, which gets a lot of attention,
but also our portfolio that includes Windows Server and SQL Server, as well as
business applications, which actually gets reported in a diﬀerent segment, but that's
also under my responsibility area. And then as you alluded to, the ﬁve years previous
to that I was doing the Head of IR job, and so it's good to be back out here.

Chris SuhYes. Okay, perfect. And then as you know now from before, but also now like -- so
Azure is a big -- it was one of the big growth opportunities for Microsoft and
everyone is kind of excited about it. But the problem that everyone has is, is to kind
of frame it. Like what's the ultimate opportunity. Have you -- now that you're kind of
on the other side, in a way, have you come up with like a better way or like or a way,
actually, to kind of help us on that one?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Sure. It is. It's such a unique business. It's such a unique -- maybe it's not so unique.
It's a unique time in the industry. And I think I feel super fortunate to be able to
participate in it. Every company on the planet is sort of thinking about this, what to
do with their digital state and how to think about transforming and moving their
work ﬂows to the cloud. And so it's sort of the -- really once in a generation sort of
time to like ﬁnd itself.
And I think Microsoft uniquely is beneﬁting in a couple of ways. Obviously, there are
the secular trends that I talked about. So you have this sort of big population of
customers who are thinking about how to move to the cloud, for both cost savings,
but also to access services and sort of modernize their IT environments and think
about accessing security and management features in a way that maybe wasn't
accessible to them previously, and so you have these structural tailwinds, if you will,
and so you have this growing market. We uniquely then continue to be very --
continue to deliver a great value proposition by having this very sort of end-to-end
cloud solution story, and by providing sort of the digit -- all the assets and all the
partnership that we've had for many, many years and that structurally is helping us.
And so the TAM is very large. We can sometimes try to put dollars on it, but I would
just say, we're not gated by anything from a market standpoint, it's just our
opportunity to execute on it and to capture that.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
That's a German trying to do -- trying to do baseball now. Like, how do you do it --
like, how will you think about that? Like, it seems like -- I think we (inaudible) last
week at the re:Invent, talked about like 4% workloads are actually in the cloud versus
kind of 96% still on-premise. Like where do you see that kind of that point in the
journey?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
I wouldn't disagree with the sentiment, which is the vast majority of workloads
remain not yet in the cloud. And so we are in the early days of the transition. As I
said, we feel like we're in a great position, because of the rich, longstanding, trusted
relationship that we've had with the vast majority of these companies who still are
running predominantly on-premises, and so as they think about who their most
trusted strategic IT partner will be, I think we have a very good shot at being that
partner. I think we're in the best position to do so. And so, we are very much in the
spur, the long game, and as a result I think we feel great about our market position.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-12

Chris Suh{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yeah. And then talk a little bit about the evolution of Azure over the last few years,
because you know like -- someone had -- the AWS guys had a little bit of a headstart.
Whereas if I look at customer conversations I'm having now, over the last few years,
things are really changing, and now your customer relationship is coming through,
but from you being on the inside now, like how has that evolved or how is that
evolving?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yeah. It's interesting. The market has evolved. And as I said, I think we feel very good
about our position and the momentum in our business. And now we are at
signiﬁcant scale and still growing at a very high rate, 63% as you know, in the last
quarter. But in some sense, like our value proposition and our diﬀerentiation hasn't
changed so much. So from the start we viewed ourselves as a very strategic partner,
as I said, to these customers. And that means the ability to oﬀer this very sort of
broad stack of cloud solutions, whether that's from Azure on the infrastructure side,
through applications and oﬃce dynamics, and all the way through our M365
oﬀerings. And so, we have this ability to help customers solve solutions in a very
comprehensive way.
Secondly, the cadence of innovation. I mean, we continue to launch new products
and continue to expand the portfolio, to solve all the problems that we talked about.
But thirdly and maybe most importantly has been our commitment to a hybrid
approach, and that's been very consistent since day one. And I think you've seen a
lot of our competitors sort of embrace hybrid, which I think is a validation that -- our
view of the world is the one that's playing itself out in that way. But hybrid to us has
always meant, like hybrid to the core means it's informed the way that we built and
architected products. It's informed the way that we've brought services to market. It's
really about the consistency of that experience from on-prem to the cloud, to the
edge, and because we've been sort of embracing and committed to hybrid from day
one, I think that's a real diﬀerentiator. I think we're really the only true hybrid provider
out there that can provide that consistency and the set of solutions from on-prem to
cloud to the edge, and I think that continues to resonate with customers, and as we
sort of continue to have these long strategic conversations with enterprise customers
that tends to be our number one diﬀerentiator.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
And then talk a little bit about, as well, on the Azure side and (inaudible). On the
Azure side, like, we call -- such as -- kind of sometimes call it the premium services.
Can you talk a little bit about the mix that you see, because we have some of the -- I
think the mobile product is part of that like, how is Azure evolving from like the
diﬀerent product oﬀering?

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10Raimo Lenschow
Chris Suh
Raimo LenschowIt's a good question and we get this one with some frequency. Azure as a product
family, it's going to continue to evolve. In some sense, it's like you've -- I think of an
analogous to Oﬃce in some ways, right, because Oﬃce historically was synonymous
with Excel, PowerPoint, Word. And then over time now it's -- this Oﬃce365 oﬀers
expansive things like collaboration and communications, as well as productivity. And
so, in that sense, like there are some analogies that say Azure will continue to evolve.
Today, I think it's most commonly thought of as sort of the core services within Azure,
or our infrastructure and our IaaS and TaaS oﬀerings. That has been the fastest
growing part of the number that you see, when we talk about our Azure growth
externally, that's the faster growing portion of it, it's the larger dollar contributor. It
continues to be consumptive based, and so you will see growth within customers
like year-on-year, like they continue to move more workloads, they continue to build
applications and consume more services. And so that continues to grow with some
sort of less limited by, let's say, number of employees or number of seats or number
of users. And so the consumptive part of the businesses is a part we are really
excited about, obviously.
And then we have another category of revenue within that Azure business that we
call either SaaS or we call it per user at times. Most commonly thought of as EMS, as
our Mobility -- Enterprise Mobility suite and Power BI, that's all part of that. That's a
per user construct that is sort of gated by diﬀerent dynamics in the consumptive part
of the business. It's still seeing good -- great momentum, and we saw seat growth
this last quarter in the 30 -- 35% plus, I think 36% this last quarter and a very big
base. And so -- but that usage growth -- we like that business, we have many per user
models outside of Oﬃce, within the Oﬃce -- outside of Azure, within the Oﬃce
business and the Windows business. But you'll see that growth continue to moderate
with seat growth, if you will, that's diﬀerent from consumptive. But really the whole
thing is important to us, and that's sort of the beneﬁt of being this very
comprehensive cloud provider.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yeah. And then the -- I mean if you look like IaaS, PaaS I think in the long run will
probably be the bigger partners to users, because they have -- you have like a ﬁnite
number. Like -- so, over time, like that should give you like a positive mix eﬀect.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
It does, it does. It's larger today and it's growing faster and so it's weighted heavily
toward the consumptive part of the business. As it continues to grow faster than the
per user base, the mix will continue to mix up, to your point. And so if you fast
forward X number of years, three, ﬁve years or whatever the number is, then --
because a good part will be even a bigger portion of it. It will start to replicate that.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Can you talk also like -- a little bit about the premium services. Like where are we -- I
would assume like, you have advantage over some of the other corporates [ph],
because you have already so much from your heritage as a software company, whereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 10Chris Suh
Raimo Lenschoweveryone else is like, either trying to steal it from an open source vendor and trying
to make money out of that or just try to develop it. Where are we on that journey on
premium services for you guys?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yeah. It is a journey. Right. It's an interesting sort of space, because as I talked about
before, like customers really, they are not trying to solve one problem. They are not
trying to solve for like, hey, how do I move my compute environment and that's sort
of the only thing that they're trying to solve for, as we think about these long-term
relationships, like when we -- when a customer commits to Azure for ﬁve, seven years
for multi-billion dollar, they are thinking very holistically about all the services,
whether we can internally call them core or premium, it's sort of indiﬀerent to the
customer. They have things that they're trying to solve for. And so we're seeing there
-- the core -- the infrastructure side of the business is our more mature businesses,
it's the larger business just naturally. And therefore it's reﬂecting growth rates that
are more mature. And then -- but we are seeing very fast growth in sort of our data
services, our -- all these premium services that we talk about.
And so I'd say that we're starting to -- they are still much smaller, but they are mixing
that way, because of the growth rates that you're seeing. I mean if we really think
about where customers are in that journey, and I talked about like sort of the multi,
sort of billion dollar type commitments. I mean it is, it is a long-term journey. They
don't move everything at once. They move sort of slowly in a sense. They move a
workload or we work with them to migrate something. They evaluate what that is, we
optimize. And so you see this curve that goes like this and then it sort of optimizes
and then we ﬁgure out like what they were going to use and what they're not going
to use and how they then grow. And so you see the curve go like this. It's not a
straight line and up to the right. And so from that context, it's very early days. And
migration is sort of the ﬁrst play for customers, when you think about all the
Windows and SQL environments that are running outside of the cloud, migrating
that into Azure. We've got these great hybrid oﬀers that let them preserve their value
and then migrate that. And then after they move their environments in, then sort of
the next step of the innovation, where they're doing app modernization or legacy
modernization or literally building new native cloud applications, like that seems to
be the next phase. And then of course innovating on higher scale things, like SAP
workloads and Kubernetes and all of the things that we're seeing. And so those are
like sort of phases in the customer journey and they're all sort of part of the
customer engagement that we have.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
I mean you touched on migration, that was my next question actually. It's funny like,
as you are becoming like a -- or maybe you or (inaudible), you always have been a
trusted partner for many of your clients, and it seems to be coming through, because
we are tracking like the incremental dollar that you gaining and that number is
actually increasing, if you look at the bigger ﬁeld there. And we saw like one of your
competitors last week kind of trying to point out like oh please, you need to adopt
more like, a better scale. Like how is that relationship kind of working into that, youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-12

Chris Suhknow that trust (inaudible) you have with your clients and do you see that coming
through in terms of how the contracts are looking, like size of the contracts, how
they're getting structured etcetera?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
We seen a lot of positive momentum there. I think you've heard Amy Hood, our CFO,
talk about during our earnings calls. We talked about the number of -- let's say $10
million plus deals that are being signed by customers. It's a great sign of trust in us,
and the intent to be a long-term partner. And we use $10 million sort of an arbitrary
line, but there is deals I think that you all are familiar with, that is exceeded into the
nine ﬁgures. And so those are -- those aren't, they're not buying a solution, they're
buying a partner, or they are buying into a partnership, strategic partnership, which
is fantastic.
So we are seeing, like I said, we are seeing great momentum there. I think we feel
great about that. It is -- it's so early, that's the thing. I mean like we've signed billions
of dollars of commitments from customers, and the real work still left in front, is to
then partner with those customers, ﬁgure out what their roadmap is for their
transformation, and work with them, both from an architecture standpoint and
technical standpoint to either migrate something or to spin up a new project and to
get those, what we call internally, we talked about getting meter spinning, because
that's how we measure consumption, but to get the meter spinning, there is a lot of
real work to be done with the customer, and it's fantastic that they're committed to
us, to work with them on that journey.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yeah. Okay, perfect. Let's shift gears a little bit. When you bought GitHub, it kind of
ﬁtted right into kind of the Microsoft DNA, because it was always being steep [ph]
almost it was all about the developer. I think that gets you kind of deeper in there.
Now the question is more like around, Azure and development, have you seen an
impact from GitHub being part of the organization, how does that feed into Azure,
help us there a little?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
I like the way you frame that Raimo. Developers have been a really important and
rich part of our history. Our success to date has been in partnership with a very rich
developer ecosystem. And so you're exactly right. It is a really important priority for
us. We've had success with our -- before GitHub, we've had a very successful
developer ecosystem writing in Azure initially. But I think what GitHub brings -- by
the way get GitHub operates independently. I think you know that as well, like this is
part of -- sort of the new model that Satya and Amy have sort of implemented with
companies like LinkedIn then and with GitHub, they operate independently. And yet
there is still obviously a connection, because Nat, who runs GitHub, reports to Scott
Guthrie, and the LinkedIn business reports directly to Satya.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 10Raimo Lenschow
Chris Suh
Raimo Lenschow
Chris SuhSo there is strategic alignment, and yet they operate independently. And so I think
that's a really nice symbiotic balance between the two, because get GitHub at its
core, continues to be about their developers and their developer ecosystem and
that has been really healthy, we've continued to see I think -- Satya talked about it in
our last earnings. We continue to see momentum growth there, the number of
developers have grown approximately 30%, in the time that -- just in the one year
that we've -- they've been part of the Microsoft family. So the momentum there as a
standalone is really fantastic.
Now as we think about -- like in some sense in the last year, what I think the biggest
beneﬁt to Microsoft has been, more cultural than anything. Meaning like this notion
that Microsoft is an open platform. This notion that we're a great partner, even with
companies that we compete with. We can compete with the customer and go to
market together, and I think we can do that in a way that is graceful and makes sense
to us now. So I think the notion that, we've opened Microsoft up, and we've opened
ourselves up to a whole population of developers that previously weren't really
thinking about writing in Azure, predominantly, I think is a super positive move
forward on sentiment, and sort of the health of the ecosystem. And so that's what's
important.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
I need to be careful on time. (inaudible). So the one thing that where you started to
move ahead of the competition, is like in terms of the international buildout. You
mean you have more data centers. I know it's still true, but you have more data
centers and then (inaudible) group combined internationally. Talk a little bit about
that strategy and now that you have the footprint, what does it mean in terms of like
adoption?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yeah. So we do have more data center regions. And so I think that's a very -- we
don't actually know how many datas like...
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yeah, sorry. Yeah, in terms of application.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
But that has been our consistent strategy from the beginning. We've been very
broad globally, thinking about our data center footprint. We've always been of the
belief that, in the long run putting the data centers into places where customers want
to consume the data and provision the services, is a strategic advantage. And so
we've built out that datacenter footprint broadly, with 54 regions around the world,
that is more regions than all of our competitors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 10Raimo Lenschow
Chris SuhWe think that's a long-term strategic advantage, we think that it's important right to
do that. That also though means, it does add complexity to the build-out, when we
think about the ability to provision those services, though, even though it's more
complex and it takes -- the interesting challenge of course is that, we always -- it
takes good signal, because it takes months of lead time to build the data center. And
so you have to have good signal, and you're in more geographies and you are -- so
you have to get precise in that signal of what -- where you're going to be in terms of
capacity needs, six months from now, 12 months from now, 24 months from now, you
have to do that in a sort of -- in a very disperse geographic way. And so those are --
just makes the execution of it more of a challenge, but I think we've done a pretty
good job.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
The like -- as now, CFO I need to kind of ask you a couple of ﬁnancial questions as
well. You do get the questions around the gross margins a lot, and we talk about the
substantial increases or improvements over last couple of quarters. What do you
think, what are the factors that investors should look at, as you think about your gross
margin proﬁle in the long run?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Sure. I think ﬁrst and foremost, we try to be fairly transparent about the progress of
our commercial cloud gross margins all up. That's the most important -- as a
company, that's the most important measure that we have on gross margin, and
you've seen those continue to march up consistently over time, which reﬂects the
progress we've made across all the businesses. That said, as you know, the Oﬃce
businesses -- Oﬃce 365 businesses at a more mature growth phase, and a more
mature phase of its lifecycle, and therefore its margins are closer to their north star.
And so, when you see the commercial cloud numbers continuing to improve, that's
really largely driven right now, by the improvement that you're seeing in Azure, just
where we are in our lifecycle. And it's 61% which I think is our last quarter for the
commercial platinum, I mean that's a pretty healthy number across the whole stack.
That said, we still think that there is continued room for improvement. It really is
predicated on the things that we've talked about, which is our -- sort of our ability to
continue to expand the data center footprint globally, and how much ahead of
demand and how good that signal is in all the geographies, so that you sort of
optimize having enough capacity months down the road, but also, not over capacity
and that gets expensive and ineﬃcient. It's also our ability to continue to make
improvements on the eﬃciency of the stack, between the hardware and the software.
And then there is a bunch of decisions that are more tactical in nature build versus
leased, how you sort of do eﬃciency of power management, etcetera, etcetera, that
all goes into the -- how you drive real margin improvement. I would say that, given all
those moving parts, we're still conﬁdent in our ability to say, structurally our margin
structure -- we have no like -- we don't believe a diﬀerent world exists between us
and other hyperscalers, in terms of our ability to reach industry leading margins. It's
just the path that it may look a little diﬀerent for us and for others, but yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-12

And then on that subject like as you talk to kind of tech hardware vendors, god bless
them, the -- do you kind of -- on the last few quarters, started to complain about like,
oh the hyperscalers pulling back a little bit, and it was like a negative kind of
demand signal for them. But then if I look at your CapEx numbers, there is no
change. Actually, you continue to kind of keep investing at a very healthy pace. Is
that kind of more a factor of that, you kind of understanding better, like how to build
your data centers, and it's going to be more white label and stuﬀ like that? Or how
are these two comments correlated?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
It's a great question, and I can't really speak to sort of -- pretty much. I could tell you
what we see from our side. Like, we continue to invest in all the stuﬀ that we just
talked about, in terms of our expansion. We continue to invest ahead of the demand
signals and so there is no sort of waning of demand, let's say, there's plenty of
demand. We're always going to try to optimize -- we are always going to try to
optimize the way -- the eﬃciency of our spend. And so that means, sort of that could
mean, investing in our own sort of capabilities to build out data centers in a diﬀerent
way, and our eﬃciency in doing so. So from our standpoint, I can't reconcile the
comments, I could just say that, CapEx continues to be a big investment for us. We
see plenty of demand out there on the horizon, that lets us continue to make those
investments.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Perfect. And I will see you at 22nd place. So, wow, good timing.
