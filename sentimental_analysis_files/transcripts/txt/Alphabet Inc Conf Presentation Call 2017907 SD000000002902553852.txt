Welcome, everyone. And thanks for attending Citi's Global Technology Conference.
I'm Mark Mahaney (sic) (Mark May), the Internet analyst at Citi. Today, our pleasure to
welcome Alphabet to the conference and Diane Greene. Also, joining me on stage
today will be my colleague, Walter Pritchard, who heads up our coverage of the
software sector. Again, my pleasure to welcome Diane Greene as our keynote today
at the conference. Diane doesn't really need any introduction. But as everyone
knows, Diane founded VMware in 1999 and company was acquired in 2004.
Alphabet, Google was fortunate enough to be able to hire Diane two years ago to
help lead their eﬀort in Cloud. And the company has really established itself as one
of the leading Cloud providers in the world in a fairly short period of time. We look
forward to talking with Diane about some of the key accomplishments over the last
couple of years, how key technologies like machine learning and analytics are really
helping them to win business with key clients around the world. And how her
conversations with customers have evolved in what is still a fairly nascent and high-
growth market.
So with that, Diane's going to kick us oﬀ with a few introductory slides. Then Walter
and I will get into the Q&A session. We will have time at the end to take your
questions. So please be prepared. Although, let's stick to the Cloud. Although, sure,
they're a lot of questions around search and advertising, we want to keep the
conversation to the Cloud.
So with that, Diane, thanks again. Appreciate it.

Great. Thank you. Hello, everybody. This mic is on, yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-07

Page 2 of 12So it's great to be here. Cloud is just getting more exciting by the minute. I've been
on the Alphabet board for seven years and then 20 months ago joined Google full-
time to run the Cloud. And we're still at the beginning of the Cloud. I mean, the
Cloud was originally a place for startups, a place for surplus capacity, sort of, a cost
savings thing. And now with every business becoming a data business, the Cloud,
people are moving to the Cloud to be secure. And they're moving to the Cloud to
gain competitive advantage.
And Google, for the last 20 years -- 17 years, has been building out data centers all
over the world, developing data analytics. You could argue, we've invented most of
the major advances and modern big data processing, machine learning, security and
also developer environments for our some-30,000 engineers. We've got over
100,000 miles of ﬁber optic cable. We're adding a new data center region about
once a month, just this -- in the past few months, we opened London and Sydney.
And next week, we'll open Frankfurt and that will be followed by SÃ£o Paulo.
We've got -- we run approximately 1/3 of the world's Internet traﬃc. And in over the
last three years, we spent $29 billion in CapEx, continuing to build out, keeping up
with the enormous growth we're seeing.
So I want to start with security because I strongly believe that is the most pervasive
problem every company has. The data breach is so expensive, I think, our health
record is $400 a health record if you get breached. And so Google, with all the
information we have and the need to keep our customers' data private, has had to
be a pioneer. And we feel pretty good about where we are in security, not that we
aren't vigilant with our 800-plus dedicated security engineers every day. But I would
say, all of Google's some-30,000-plus engineers are kind of security engineers. And
we've built security into every layer of the system. From proprietary purpose-built
chips like Titan that say that the hardware hasn't been tampered with and you're
running a binary you think you are to every layer of the stack on up to the software
that detects a phishing attack and then in your mail and then says if someone tries --
if you gave the password and someone tries to use it, it says, "Are you sure this
person should have your password or do you want to change your password?"
And we've also developed perimeter-less security, because if you just have a ﬁrewall
protecting everything, if someone gets inside, you're kind of in trouble. And so we
can look at what you're doing, where you're coming from and what call you're
making. So that many, many of our services, Google services are just out there on the
open Internet, because we can protect them much better than we could with a
ﬁrewall.
And you take something like a Chromebook with its -- the Chrome OS tiny attack
surface updated in the Cloud constantly. You don't get a Ransomware attack then or
something like Heartbleed a few years ago. Google had that patched before it was
publicly announced.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 12We've also internally developed a very modern programming environment so it can
be agile and separate the layers and engineers can move quickly. And so we
developed -- we have -- we launched -- everything runs in containers at Google, we
launched over 2 billion a day, Gmail, every service we have, Maps and so forth. Our
sort of 8 billion-plus active user services. And we brought that to the Cloud. We open
sourced it with its Kubernetes. And it's now becoming the de facto way to run your
services. And you combine that with the containers, where everything's taken care of
for your software. And then API management with Apigee. And your developers can
move very quickly, take advantage of the APIs out there, take advantage of the
infrastructure, automating everything underneath. And so we're pretty excited about
what's going on in the last few months, everybody's announced support for
Kubernetes', a very active data analytics and machine learning. You take something
like BigQuery, our data warehouse, when Spotify moved from one of our
competitors, their 1.5 petabytes, I think, of -- 1.5 billion ﬁles over, they got a 35x
speed up using BigQuery. Or you take something like Spanner, where we've
combined our hardware expertise with atomic clocks in every data center to make it
so you can do transactions, distribute it all over the world. So if someone's is
withdrawing on either side of the world, we won't let an overdraft happen, for
example.
Then machine learning, Google's been doing machine learning, really, Larry got it
going right when he founded the company, pretty much. And now we have built all
these data models that we give to the -- share with the world through APIs. And so
there's all the language APIs, there's even a Jobs API, we just recently announced 30
more languages. For example, for the Translate, we have natural language, video
recognition, very popular.
Then, ﬁnally, (Alan K) said, if you're serious about software, you're going to build
hardware. We have our own processor, we open sourced how we do our machine
learning, TPU's, Google's really pushing the world on openness. And the TPU is a
processor that is for TensorFlow, Google's open source, which is the most active
machine learning project on GitHub.
Then, ﬁnally, is how we support people and if -- they'll taught in our Cloud for
workplace collaboration and productivity. People are increasingly discovering the
huge transformative eﬀects it has on their companies to collaborate. I know a public
company whose board of directors collaborates in Google -- a large public company
collaborate in Google Docs to ask questions and work with the CEO. And you can do
things like search everybody's documents and see who's working on what. And it's
proven to be an amazing suite. And we've got 150,000 users of Verizon moving over
there, Nielsen with 60,000 using Hangouts all the time, Colgate-Palmolive. And so
really getting big enterprise customers moved over to gain that agility in their
company, that collaboration. Pretty proud of what we've been, massive eﬀort to
infuse it with machine learning, which is you see in things like Smart Reply and in the
Calendar.
So that is just a -- I hope, about a 5-minute quick overview of Google Cloud. I'll look
forward to your questions. One other little fun thing I'll just mention is, if you tookFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-07

Q - Walter H Pritchardone of our big data center buildings and overlaid the Stanford Stadium, you'd still
see a little bit of the building. These things are massive. It's a very exciting area to be
in from the basic data center up to working with all these customers to share

Questions And Answers
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
Thanks, Diane. Google's Cloud business, kind of, been moving faster than the Cloud
market overall in the last couple of years. I wonder if you could think about your time
so far at Google in stages and maybe talk about some of the key areas of focus that
you'd look to build out maybe in, I don't know, if you want to go up the ﬁrst year, the
second year. Then what are the areas of focus for you going forward? So we can get
a sense of how the business is evolving over time?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Sure, sure. I think when I came in, we were mostly focused on startups. And
obviously, the enterprise opportunities, at least, the slide deck -- I mean, the
enterprise opportunity is what we're going after and we've made huge strides. So
we had to really get all the table stakes functionality and things like identity and
access controls and networking conﬁgurations and all the compliance and
regulatory. So we got that done. That's -- it's all there. Any enterprise customer can
be fully deployed on us now. Then we had to buildout the go-to-market, which --
certainly, it's the direct sales force and an immense number of customer engineers,
Google quality customer engineers, which our customers really value. We set up
professional services. We set up an oﬃce of the CTO, Customer Reliability
Engineering and advances. We set up a lot. Then it was partnering, because we
really -- the most important thing is our ecosystem. So we have big global strategic
partnerships where people run on our Cloud and we integrate technically and we
go-to-market together. Then just go-to-market partners. So building out our
ecosystem has been a huge priority. So we got all that done. Then we started
looking at verticals. And now -- and taking our machine learning and applying it to
verticals. Then taking Kubernetes and now we can support hybrid and lift and shift.
And we bought Apigee to facilitate the API management. Then, I would say, a big
milestone, we gotten the top -- Google Drive gotten the top right-hand quadrant of
Gartner and Forrester named us as the leader in PaaS, Platform-as-a-Service. So
clearly, when I came in, basically, every customer partner discussion was, is Google
really serious about the enterprise. And I haven't heard that in months now.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Just a follow-up to that, Diane. You've, obviously, run a large enterprise software
company in the past. I think you probably know very well what it takes to have the
presence from a go-to-market perspective to be able to compete. You have a couple
of competitors in the space, obviously, Microsoft has tens of thousands of sales and
marketing professionals just by virtue of their legacy in that market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-07

They did when I was running VMware. So...
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Right, exactly right. So and then Amazon's been building that out. Do you feel like
the go-to-market is kind of the great limiting step in Google's Cloud growth? Or are
there other factors as you look going forward? Or -- I guess, I want to focus in
particular on the go-to-market and how much of a limiter is that on where you want
to be in the next several years?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes. Well it is deﬁnitely an opportunity-rich environment. And we are working hard
and it's kind of all hands on deck because we don't turn anybody away. We do -- we
work with them and it's very exciting for us. But we're building the leverage, we build
out training and certiﬁcation so we can train our partners, we can certify our partners.
And we've started -- we announced a very deep strategic partner with SAP, which is
going to give us a lot of leverage. And both SAP and Google are pretty excited
about that partnership. And also, some of the advanced data trustee things that we'll
be doing. Then we're -- you'll see more and more partnering announcements. We
recently announced Nutanix for the hybrid support. And so I -- we don't have as
many feet on the street, we're growing very rapidly. I recently brought in a very
seasoned sales executive, run double-digit billions of revenue somewhere else. And
so we'll continue that buildout. But it's really focused on our partners and making
them successful.
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
And just on -- you mentioned SAP. So your -- you have the G Suite, which is a set of
applications. You're market leader in PaaS, you're very competitive on the IS side.
Sort of moving up the stack, how partnering with SAP, having some ﬁrst-party apps,
how do you think about that long term in terms of the mix of business that Google
wants to have in cloud? And the importance of the Apple-era in SaaS?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well so G Suite is very strategic to us because you can do things like between
BigQuery and Sheets and it's -- Drive is a great place to put your ﬁles, getting greater
all the time with all the machine learning and then Gmail with over -- well over 1
billion users, it's a pretty commonplace. So G Suite is the communication mechanism
that go with the Cloud. But -- and the storage -- individualized storage, team
storages. But the SaaS vendors we're partnering with, we just announced a huge win
with Marketo and that was a big deal, that's an example of the kind of partner we're
going to -- SaaS vendors that will run on Google Cloud and take advantage of what
we have. And so we -- we want to work with every SaaS vendor. And we think it's a
huge advantage for them to be on our Cloud. Every time one of them moves, they
go, oh, this is fantastic. And they talk about all the things that have been improved
for them and all the advantages. So with SAP, it's up and down the stack. I mean all
of SAP -- well, HANA runs on Google Cloud. And more and more of SAP is runningFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-07

A - Diane B. Greeneon Google Cloud. We are integrating G Suite with them, we're working on with them
on machine learning. Then, what people don't know is, we're doing a data trustee
relationship. We did announce it. But I'll just reiterate it, where they, over time, it'll be
their data center, we're the supplier. So that when they're running in Germany,
running our data center, running any workload, it will be a German company who
has the data and not a United States company, which is a key milestone for us.
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
Interesting. Just on hybrid, you brought up Kubernetes, which I think maybe two
years ago there were a lot of these standards out there, that one has deﬁnitely gelled
as the leading container manager, container orchestrator. What I don't see from
Google is, there's products in the market that leverage Kubernetes from other
vendors. There's not a sort of hybrid Google oﬀering. What is the hybrid? Because it
does seem like also in parallel to hybrid Cloud, you've got enterprises with large
data centers, you have large data centers, everybody sees the advantage of what
you've built. But getting there and sort of mixing what they have with what you have
is diﬃcult. So what is the hybrid strategy with potentially Kubernetes as a big part of
that look like?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well we want Kubernetes to run extremely well on-premise, to run extremely well in
every Cloud. We are pretty certain it's going to run the best in our Cloud. I mean, we
invented it and developed it. And we did announce a partnership around hybrid
with Nutanix. There is a solution there. And we've built solutions with our customers
where they're running Kubernetes on-prem and in our Cloud. And I would just say
stay tuned, a lot more to come.
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
It's -- and then we're taking -- we're also doing some new development that take it to
the next level and that will be open source too.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Maybe a question on machine learning. Talk about how important that is to winning
business today? And any examples that you can provide about how that's actually
being used by enterprise customers today?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Sure. Yes, machine learning is the -- one of the major disruptions going on in that --
once you get in-site, I always cite Google itself, which has been -- which is the most
carbon neutral data center in -- set of data centers in the world, we've always
prioritized that. So we optimized our data centers' energy usage as much as humanly
possible. Then we applied machine learning and then our cooling got a 40%
advantage and humans are getting 2% or 3%, 40% advantage from the machineFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-07

Q - Walter H Pritchardlearning, it's kind of amazing. So we are working with, basically, every customer on
machine learning. And we can even bring them into our advance system labs and
work with them. The public customers I can talk about are like Airbus that did use the
vision to build a model to take the clouds out of their images, something they've
never been able to do in 20 years. Or Ocado, the biggest online retailer in the U.K. --
they're based in the U.K. And they were able to use our machine learning to detect
customer sentiments and know how to handle calls in their call center. Or FamilyMart
over in Japan use -- it's this huge chain of neighborhood grocers where they stock at
3 times a day and they can -- they're using our analytics and machine learning to
ﬁgure out how to stock things, to predict what to do. And there's a lot more of that,
as you might imagine, I can't talk about.
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
Sure. Just on the earlier days of cloud, I think it still gets some airplay, price
reductions were a focus and everybody in the market was reducing price a lot.
Google actually had some sort of a headline making price reductions a couple of
years ago. Can you talk about what impact price reductions are having now on the
market? And how does that drive your strategy around pricing in your -- especially,
the infrastructure as a service, kind of, the more commodity-type services that you're
oﬀering?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
So the question is about pricing and putting words in my mouth saying our services
are a commodity.
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
Well I'm saying we've seen price reductions at -- I think we'd all agree that maybe
the basic compute storage services are -- they've been around for the longest,
they're mature. And they're the ones that have seen the greatest price reductions.
I'm just wondering your view on maybe price elasticity of demand in the market and
how that drives your strategy around pricing versus what some of your competitors
may be doing.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
One thing is, we've been a pioneer in the model for pricing. And so when customers
look at the total cost, we end up being quite a bit less expensive partly because we
charge by the minute, partly because we give automatic price reductions, the more
you use, then we don't require reserved instances. And partly because we have such
great performance. I forget the name of the group, CloudHarmony or something like
that just published a study that showed us the #1 performing Cloud in our services.
And so we do have a very low total cost. And it is becoming companies' biggest cost
item. So companies care. Then, when you get into the big deals, there's a lot of work
because everybody's sort of this -- got some custom -- there's a lot of work that goes
into a contract, that's a large team of people for us. And so there's a lot that goes on
as you develop a proposal for a customer.

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantI guess along those lines, given how transparent and how segmented your pricing is,
how many of your customers are actually on the sort of rate card, if you will. And --
versus more contractual pricing and how it varies dramatically.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well we certainly have a very big self-help online business, right? And maybe, as
those people get bigger and bigger, we might come back and discuss what they're
doing and how to optimize it. Then -- but the top Fortune 5000, when they're doing
a full-on Google Cloud, we get together and talk or a snap, formerly SnapChat, we
get together and talk about where they're going to run. And how much are they
going to know ahead of time where their loads are going to be. And how spiky is it
going to be and we work with our customers.

We have more partners, we have Salesforce, Box, we have more partners and more
coming.
And I think everyone recognizes your -- the amount of money you guys have spent
and you guys are leaders in technology. But to Walter's point, his point is, do need
an upgrade in your enterprise sales force? Let's say, two years down the road, if
Google Cloud is kind of still maintaining its current trajectory, Walter will probably --
Walter and Mark will ask the same question, do you need more traditional enterprise
sales force? So...
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well I think the Cloud -- so we are hiring incredibly aggressively. Alphabet is
investing in Cloud. So it's -- we're not, sort of, saying, "Oh, we're done with our sales
force and they're very Googlely." We are building out a serious enterprise sales
force. But I would argue that Cloud demands are diﬀerent approach. It's a very -- if
you think about what's going on, when a company moves to the Cloud, this is
something they had in-house where they run it all and now they're just building
these -- assembling almost these applications and putting them in containers and
we're kind of doing everything else. That's where it's going. And so we need to
partner with them. And so you do need the salespeople to drive a contract and sort
of project manage, if you will. But it's -- you also want a lot of technical people
involved. That's what the customers need. How do they take advantage of our data
analytics and machine learning? How do they transform to be a more of an agile
container-based development? How do they migrate things? So -- but we are
building out serious enterprise people. I think it's really -- the way I translate that is,
we've become extraordinarily customer-centric. Everybody in Google Cloud is so
focused on our customers. And it's what we talk about every -- and our partners,
every single day and share a lot of information about what's going on with our
customers and partners and that's how we're driving the business. We have our
SLAs. And we track how we are doing very carefully. And I would say, we're getting
some pretty high-quality people. And one advantage of the many advantages to
Google Cloud, one advantage that I see is, we really don't have any trouble hiring.
People really like to come to Google. So that's been very helpful.
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
I think there's a question there towards the middle.
Diane, you did a good job in describing a lot of the IP that has been developed
inside of Google over the last 5 or 10 years. And Kubernetes, for example, I think if
that were commercial software that would probably worth the entire enterprise value
of VMware at its peak.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Diane B. GreeneYes, I sometimes say we have 80 company-sized products.
Yes. So can you just describe the decision to open source all that software and IP
rather than monetize it internally? And what goes into that decision and what's the
kind of the longer-term monetization opportunity for all that open source IP that's
created?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
It's somewhat of a principled approach where we feel if this is -- if the beneﬁt of this
will be far greater if it runs everywhere, then it should be open sourced. And so you
take a Kubernetes, it -- it's -- we're driven by creating customer value, we really are.
And if Kubernetes is available to everybody to run anywhere, it really ampliﬁes its
value. And that's why Kubernetes has won. And we feel that we know how to do it
better than anybody else and that's our advantage. And so -- and TensorFlow was
the same way, we want to build the ecosystem, we wanted to get a huge community.
But we can -- we'll continue accentuating the advantage to running it on our Cloud.
But we want to make it available everywhere. So wherever there is something that is
open source-able and its advantage gets hugely ampliﬁed by being available
everywhere, we'll open source it.
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
There's a...
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
And I think this game of trying to lock people into your Cloud, we'll see. But it's not a
great customer decision to do that. And as the advantages, I think, of Google Cloud
become more and more apparent. And we are so open, I am seeing customers ﬁnd
that pretty appealing. Go ahead -- I'm sorry.
Can you talk a little bit about the decision to build hardware for machine learning?
Then kind of how do you see in the future use cases that will be better run on your
TPUs versus GPUs?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well we -- ﬁrst let me just be really clear, we have a lot of GPUs in Google Cloud.
And we work very well with NVIDIA. And the TPU -- so Google does an immense
amount of machine learning internally as well as externally. And so for the big data
machine learning, training and using the models, we saw an opportunity to build a
custom chip that would give an order of magnitude performance advantage, which
actually saves us a lot of money and also lets us do a better job on the machine
learning because you could turn things around so quickly. Then it's natural to put it
in our cloud for our users. So the really exciting thing about Google Cloud is, we
now have a vehicle to take Google's, really, ongoing technical innovations and share
them with the world, with every company and every geography of every size. That'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-07

advantage of all the innovations coming out of NVIDIA as well.
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
Maybe time for one more. Go ahead, (inaudible).
Yes. Two quick questions. One, how would you compare you experience at VMware
versus Google Cloud where VMware you're leading from the front and here it looks
like you're coming from behind? Then second, do you think you need to make any
acquisitions to accelerate your enterprise adoption?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes. How do I compare being ahead at VMware to being behind in number of
customers, I wouldn't say we're behind in every category. And so -- I mean, there is
actually a similarity, if you think about it, because when we came out with
virtualization at VMware, nobody ran it. And it was the best way to run your system.
But people didn't see the value in it. And there were a lot of operating systems
running native on every machine out there. So we were behind in a certain way. But
we -- once we got it out there and people realized the value, we were deﬁnitely
ahead. And I think in a -- you could say there's the same thing going on at Google
where we have the technology that's going to really automate things for people and
give them a competitive advantage and on an ongoing basis. But we're behind in
terms of people saying, "okay, I'm going to be here," although it's -- I've never seen -

for any size acquisition. We have -- we're constantly revisiting our strategy. And we
will acquire if we can ﬁnd a way to make them help us accelerate things. Yes.
