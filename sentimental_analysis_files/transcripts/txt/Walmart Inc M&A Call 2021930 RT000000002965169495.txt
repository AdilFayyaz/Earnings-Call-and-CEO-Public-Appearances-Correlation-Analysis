Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's ESG Webinar on Human Capital. My
name is Dan Binder and I lead Walmart's IR and corporate FP&A teams. I'm joined by
my colleague Kathleen McLaughlin, Chief Sustainability Oﬃcer and President of
Walmart Foundation. This is the ﬁrst thing, what we hope will be a series of
discussions on Walmart's ESG priority issues, and today Kathleen will speak about
Walmart's human capital strategy.
Kathleen and her team are responsible for the ESG strategy and disclosures,
including working with subject matter experts across the business to make sure
we're focused on the right ESG priorities.
Before I turn the call over to Kathleen, let me remind you that today's webinar is
being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are
subject to future events and uncertainties which could cause actual results to diﬀer
materially from these statements. The information discussed in today's meeting
should be viewed in conjunction with our ESG reporting and other public
documents, including our 10-K and earnings materials. These documents and our
entire safe harbor statement can be found on our Investor Relations website
stock.walmart.com. We will post today's webinar under the Events section of our
Investor Relations website.
As you can see from the agenda on your screen, Kathleen will spend about 20
minutes providing an overview of our human capital strategy as outlined in our ESG
reporting. That will be followed by a 30-minute Q&A session, and at the end of that
session, our meeting will conclude.
We received questions from several people in advance of today's meeting. So, we'll
begin with those and then move to the questions in the queue. You can ask the
question at any time today by using the Q&A button at the bottom of your screen.
We're hoping to address other priority ESG issues in future webinars. But for today's
session, we request that you keep your questions focused on human capital. If you
have additional questions following today's webinar, please submit them to ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Kathleen McLaughlin.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody, and thank you so much for joining us. As Dan said, this is
our ﬁrst ESG webinar. So, we really appreciate your participation. We welcome your
feedback on whether this format is useful to you that's our intention, that's the
purpose we're having this discussion today. There's been so much interest in ESG
strategies that we felt, it was important to create these opportunities for more
dialogue, more back and forth in Q&A to understand what's on your minds and help
us disclose things that are really relevant for you.
I want to just start oﬀ my remarks by saying that our approach to ESG is very much
rooted in shared value. In other words, corridor enterprise strategy is the view that
the way we maximize value for shareholders, is by addressing the needs of our
stakeholders eﬀectively. So obviously our customers and delivering on our
proposition to them, but also delivering value to our associates, our suppliers, the
communities where we operate, other stakeholders. If we do those things well, we
maximize long-term value for the company, and we can help bring the assets of
business to bear on important issues that end up strengthening the systems that all
of us rely on in society including business.
So, for us there are four key themes that we have set out as priorities for us in ESG,
these are based on our priority assessment feedback from you and other
stakeholders about what are the issues that you believe are most relevant for
Walmart to address. Second, our view on what is relevant for our business. And third,
issues where we believe we can make a diﬀerence on those issues. So those are the
three screens and that's how we ended up with this priority set, and they're pretty
evergreen. Obviously, as things develop and so on, we can adjust these as we go,
certainly COVID response has become a major factor under our serving
communities approach. But consider this a fairly evergreen list of priority
environmental, social and governance issues where we believe at Walmart, we can
make a diﬀerence.
Now for each of these, what we have is an investment thesis. In other words, if you're
an investor and you care about these issues, why would you want to put a dollar into
Walmart; how is our engagement in these arenas going to create value for our
company; and how is it going to create value for society and address those issues.
And so, our disclosures are really centered around those investment theses, and I
would welcome you and invite you to go to our Investor website and take a look at
the issue briefs that we posted there for each of these issues. We have pretty in-
depth briefs where we've laid out what's our shared value, aspiration with respect to
that issue; what are the target goals, public commitments, metrics; what are the
strategies that we're pursuing and the progress we're making; and then ﬁnally the
challenges that we're encountering.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 19So, we've designed these to be pretty comprehensive and welcome your feedback
on any of them. There are a couple of issue briefs there that I'll call to your attention
that are relevant to what we're going to talk about today. One is, around good jobs
and advancement for associates, our human capital strategy. The other is related,
and it's the equity and inclusion at Walmart and beyond brief.
So certainly, our human capital strategy is a really important part of our equity
strategy, but our equity strategy goes beyond that. It considers how we can use our
sourcing to advance equity, our investments as a company, initiatives that we're
taking through other assets we have, our products, our services and so on, to
address disparities for women, for people of color, for other underserved groups.
So, that goes beyond human capital. I'll touch up a bit on it today. But today, we're
really focused on the one that's underlined here, which is our human capital strategy,
really centered around good jobs and advancement for associates.
And the last thing I'll say before we go on, to dive into that is, for each of these
issues, our aspiration is to do more than just run a good company. We're actually
trying to shift the systems that underlie each of these in fundamental ways.
Obviously, in collaboration with many others, where this big in the grand scheme of
things. But we do have assets we can bring to bear. So, our aspiration is to shift the
underlying systems in terms of the way business works for environmental, social and
economic outcomes and we talked about that a fair amount in our brief and I'll touch
on that a bit today, as it pertains to workforce development.
So, let's dive in. So human capital, our aspiration is this dual-sided aspiration. So, for
society, we are very committed to making retail a place for opportunity for people
entering work, they can get a good start, get the skills they need, the experiences
they need to advance into a whole variety of career paths whether that's at Walmart
or beyond and that's an aspiration we're trying to bring to the sector. And I'll talk
about that a bit in terms of getting employers and others to focus on developing
talent that maybe starting out as hourly people, put the same kind of investment into
that part of the workforce as companies do in other parts of the workforce and that's
a really important focus of ours.
And then for our own company, we create value by doing this because it allows us to
attract and retain and develop outstanding talent at all levels of our company and
that's really what we're focused on. So, we can meet the needs of our customer and
also, build a great company. So that's the dual aspect of our aspiration.
And when we go on to the next our strategy, just to give you an overview, has ﬁve
parts to it. So, ﬁrst of all, we want to be a leader in inclusion. We think that retail
oﬀers an outstanding entry point for people regardless of their background and
what we're trying to do is really make that a reality, have retail be a springboard for
advancement and ultimately build a company where our entire workforce from entry
level to the c-suite reﬂects society, and I'll go into that in more detail and what our
current results are.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 19Second, growth. Another aspect of retail is it's not your grandfather's retail anymore.
So, we have career paths in technology, healthcare, supply chain, as well as retail
management. So, starting out in one of our stores or clubs or fulﬁllment centers is a
great way into a whole range of paths and so, we have focused in the last ﬁve, six
years on building one of the largest private-sector upskilling operations in the world
in terms of the magnitude and what we're trying to do around skill-building and I'll
share some examples.
And then, well-being, and that's not just ﬁnancial, it's also emotional and physical. So
competitive wages, best-in-class beneﬁts, healthcare packages that are aﬀordable
and innovative high-quality. We're trying to lead in this area and I'll share where we
are, and what we hope to continue to do.
And then ﬁnally, digital. Using digital assets not only to improve the job experience
of our associates, but make it easier for them to serve the company and to serve the
customers day-in day-out and deliver our proposition, and also using digital assets
to help with our human capital strategy, so making it easier for folks to get skills on
the job, bite-sized credentials that can be delivered online in a 60-second video,
those kinds of things.
So, those four are really core to our strategy for our own associates. And then as I
said, we try to go beyond that. So, through additional actions at Walmart business
initiatives as well as philanthropy. So, Walmart corporate giving Walmart Foundation.
We have a substantial program that we call Retail Opportunity that we've been
running since 2015, where we're trying to make what we do the norm in the industry.
So, we'll talk about that some more.
So, let's go into each of these pieces. So, ﬁrst of all inclusion. As I said, we're trying to
build a Walmart for everyone and have our associate base be reﬂective of the
communities where we operate. So, let's go on and talk about some of the
components there. So, ﬁrst of all, building diverse and inclusive teams, that's a really
important part of our broader inclusion and equity strategy. And as I said, we have a
separate issue brief on that broader strategy, please have a look at it.
But with respect to this one piece, so building diverse and inclusive teams. There are
few things that we prioritize. So, ﬁrst of all, access to employment. We are trying to
remove artiﬁcial barriers to work. So historically, employers have relied on two-year
degrees, four-year degrees as credentials evidence of a pedigree, evidence of
certain skills, even if they're not really necessary to have those skills we have
removed that.
Things like banning the box, we were one of the ﬁrst retailers to do that, and have
invested over the years through philanthropy and engaged other employers through
business to do -- to consider the same thing. So that people's records of previous
incarceration shouldn't have any bearing on their future employment most of the
time. So that's been quite important.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 19And then, in COVID, we became a bridge employer for many people to get them
through. People who lost their jobs as other businesses closed, could come to
Walmart. We hired about 500,000 people last year in the midst of the pandemic,
and that was a really important source of work for many people, and many of those
folks ended up staying.
Pay equity, this is also a critical component of our talent strategy and we believe in
pay equity, we have practices in place to protect it. I'll talk about some of those later
perhaps in the Q&A. And importantly, as we've done our analysis to look at gaps,
racial gaps, gender gaps, and so on, we don't have them. So, we're conﬁdent that
the things we are putting in place are actually bringing this to fruition and it's
something we continually re-evaluate, monitor and extend.
Third is the pipelines themselves and work that we do in hiring, in development, in
promotions, in reviews, in the kind of culture we're trying to create to help see into
the pipeline and advance women, people of color, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities,
any population that historically has been underrepresented, underserved, removing
barriers and helping people succeed. And I'll show you some stats around that in a
minute.
And then really importantly is engagement, voice, feedback, dialogue, amongst all
of us as associates. So, we have a number of mechanisms in place to capture
people's ideas, suggestions, and voice directly through formal channels, through
informal channels, in-person, digital, conﬁdential, tabs[ph], we have multiple arenas
so that we can really encourage and draw out people's ideas and engagement. And,
for -- systematic set of approaches and to act on the feedback. And I'll share some
examples of that later perhaps in the Q&A.
One thing that I would like to underscore is respect for freedom of association. That
is a matter of policy and practice at Walmart. Sometimes people are surprised to
hear that. That's really important to us, we respect the rights of associates, all of us to
join or not join a trade association, a union, some form of representation. And in fact,
in the majority of the countries where Walmart operates, our associates have elected
to be part of some sort of trade union or representation. That's really important to us.
We invest in training to systematically ensure our managers in the ﬁeld understand
that and that's the way we operate.
So, let me just show you some of the stats around our talent pipelines, if you can go
to the next page, thanks. And, as I said, the business case is really clear in all of these
things that we're doing. For this one, I think it's well documented now that diverse
teams do correlate with outperformance in the market and it makes sense. You're
getting the best ideas, you're getting a diversity of ideas, people feel comfortable to
bring their whole selves to work, their complete set of talents. And there are number
of practices that we have in place to advance people, remove barriers to
advancement all through the pipeline.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 19So, one is culture, tone at the top, just the culture of Walmart, this goes back to the
days of Mr.Sam himself, that we're all associates. 75% of our management in the ﬁeld
began as hourly associates. Doug McMillon began as an hourly associate. Our Chief
Merchant, Scott McCall began as an hourly associate. So, we have lived to
experience in all facets of our business, it's very deep in our culture, we're all
associates.
And then, speciﬁcally removing barriers at the point of hiring, expanding our sources
in terms of diverse sources of talent. Having diverse slates, diverse interview panels,
posting every job that's VP or lower internally ﬁrst to draw out our own talent and
create that pipeline and help people move up, before we go outside, if at all
needed. Lots of resources invested in developing capabilities of our leaders to lead
in inclusive manner. So, awareness, but also skills to be a better leader and create a
safer, more welcoming open environment where folks feel free to be themselves.
And then, we're a pretty data driven company. So internal dashboards, individual
accountability, the performance on diversity and inclusion is baked into the
leadership expectations and our individual evaluations. I have a dashboard for my
own team that shows exactly where I am. And, I work with that with my team. So,
these are all practices that we have in place to have this be quite systematic.
So, how are we doing? Well, like pretty much all parts of society, we have a long way
to go in terms of our representation, but here are some stats for you. And one of the
commitments we made was to disclose our progress at a pretty granular level in our
job categories at every kind of front-line, to management, to C-suite, even the Board,
twice a year. We just came out with our most recent update, our mid-year FY  22
updates, we are showing you that here relative to our FY  21 disclosures. You can see
what's up, what's down.
And, obviously, in the short-term you're going of have ups and downs, but the long
arc is going in a good direction. But I'll just call out a couple things here. You can see
that woman, there's been a lot of talk about this. We have a 1% decline of women in
our workforce. We think there may be something happening in the broader
economy based on what we're reading, but obviously we see that and that's
something that we're on and saying, okay we'll --is there something diﬀerent we
ought to be doing.
I would highlight on the other hand oﬃcer representations gone up a click. So, ups
and downs, but the whole thing is moving in the right direction. If you look over a
three-year stack. And then people of color, similar thing, we're looking at things like
hourly promotions and asking ourselves of, why did that slip a point, yet our oﬃcer
representations gone up. So, we have diﬀerent puts and takes along that pipeline
and we use this data to dig in and see, okay, the practice is working, is there
something else we need to do.
Let me go to the next one. Okay, so let's talk about well-being, and for us it's a broad
concept. Financial obviously, incredibly important, but physical and emotional well-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 19being as well.
And so, our strategy, if you want to go on to the next page there. So, we look at it
holistically, and our aspiration is to be absolutely competitive when it comes to
compensation in local markets for apples-to-apples comparison of the type of job in
the part of our business. And we believe we are, and I'll show you some stats around
that. And then we aspire to diﬀerentiate ourselves on many of the other things here.
So, let's talk about that. We have a majority full-time workforce. That's unusual for
many retailers. Many retailers have a majority part-time work force. With the full-time
workforce, we end up having people have higher take-home pay, because they're
getting more hours and that's important.
Financial beneﬁts we believe are pretty distinctive. I'll show you those in a second.
Scheduling practices, this is another one that's very important. We do not do on-
demand scheduling. So, people have multiple weeks' notice of their schedule if they
want a ﬂexible schedule where they're setting their shift for a period and then
changing it based on life needs and so on, and they also have an option to opt into
ﬁxed scheduling. So, for a quarter at a time, they have a ﬁxed schedule, which many
of our associates have adopted because that helps them arrange childcare and
things like that. So, you've got your option and with this device, which we've given or
oﬀered to all of our associates so about 600,000, 700,000 of our associates have
phones that we have given them, everything they need for their job is on here and
they can use it personally as well. They can trade shifts with each other, swap in and
out, pick up a shift, trade one with their friend, that sort of thing.
Paid time oﬀ. This is another one that there is maybe some misinformation about. We
have a really robust paid time oﬀ program for part-time and full-time associates. And
people earn that paid time oﬀ as they work. A full-time associate who's been here
less than two years can accrue two weeks' worth of paid time oﬀ, so 120 hours which,
if you divide eight hours a day, that's about 15 days of PTO. And that can be used for
anything sick leave, take the kid to the dentist, vacation, whatever people want to use
that for.
We also have something called protected paid time oﬀ, that's 48 hours of protected
paid time oﬀ, so about six days' worth on an eight-hour day basis, that means people
don't have to schedule that in advance with their boss. You normally can take paid
time oﬀ; you work it out with your boss when you're going to take a vacation and
that kind of thing. But that's for -- guess what, somebody came down with strep
throat overnight and can't show up tomorrow, so that's protected paid time oﬀ.
So, we've had that in place for a long time. And then with COVID we layered on an
additional leave that we call emergency leave. And that's time oﬀ for exposure,
obviously for illness, over and above this paid time oﬀ, for exposure and so on. And I
can answer questions about that if people want to talk about that.
Let's talk about physical beneﬁts. So, aﬀordable quality healthcare $30.50 a pay
period. That's much more aﬀordable than typical healthcare packages out there. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 19it gives people access to state-of-the-art services. And we have a team that is really
trying to be at the vanguard around healthcare. We've been written up in a case
study by Harvard Business School for this. One of the programs for example, is
centers of excellence. So, our associates regardless of where you work in the
company, get access to Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, the best facilities for
procedures like hip replacement, heart surgery, these kinds of procedures, state-of-
the-art and the healthcare coverage includes not only covering that procedure, but
ﬂying you to the site with a caregiver, your spouse or friend or whoever is going to
take care of you, that's all part of this for hourly workforce.
So, we think these things are really important. We are using digital to deliver things
like Grand Rounds, Doctor on Demand, even ﬁtness passes in local communities to
subsidize your going to the gym and that sort of thing. And then ﬁnally emotional
services. So, Thrive Global resources for living. We saw a 5% uptick in usage of
emotional beneﬁts, services and supports counseling services during the pandemic.
So, let me just show you some of the numbers on pay, I hit on some of these other
points around beneﬁts. We go to that next page, just if we look at the left. A lot of
times people focus on are absolute lowest starting wage in the country, which is $12
for a job. But that doesn't mean everybody has started at $12. If you're a personal
shopper in Tucson, Arizona, you are starting at $13.90. If you are in our Sam's Club
facility, you are starting at least at $15 and perhaps, higher depending on the role. If
you're in our fulﬁllment centers, it's at least $15 start, if not more.
So, this varies by role and it varies by market. And then the average wages you can
see in the second column, our goal as I said, is to be absolutely competitive with
what others are oﬀering for that same role in that market or more. So, for example, if
you look at our Walmart US jobs relative to grocers, we would be $3, $4, $5 premium
in some cases to what people are paying, because in many places folks are, in some
cases still at the federal minimum. In some cases, they've gone above that. We've
seen recent reports of contract getting negotiated coming in at $10.50 or $11, where
we are starting at $12 regardless of where you write it as a minimum.
And then what's important to note is, the ﬁnancial take-home pay for Walmart is
higher than the hourly wage, because we have non-wage sources of ﬁnancial
compensation and that's what's in this other column. So, about $20 for Walmart US
and Sam's and closer to $30 in our DCs and FCs. And that's because some of the
other things listed on the far-right. The discounts people get on purchases, the 401k
match, the stock purchase plan, we have something like almost two-thirds of our
people participating in some type of stock purchase plan. And that's across the
associate base.
So, these things are used by our folks and appreciated. And we've been really, really
focused. Since 2015, when we launched all of this human capital strategy that we call
Retail Opportunity on all of these pieces. And, I just point out, we've raised wages
65% since 2005 -- 2015, our starting wage at a time when federal minimum hasn't
budged. So, we're trying to lead on this. We're trying to move forward. We're tryingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 19to invest in the jobs and in the places where it matters for our customer and our
business and our associates.
Okay. Let's go on. I'm going to just hit touch quickly on growth, and I do want to get
to Q&A. So, growth is a really important part of our strategy, if we click forward, as I
said, this is one of the places where we're trying to diﬀerentiate. So, we have
invested in redesigning our jobs, putting people into teams, creating career paths
with stepping stone advancement, so that folks can promote from within. So,
wherever you start, you can get the skills you need to go to the next click and have a
diversity of career paths.
We've also provided a signiﬁcant on the job training program through the day-to-
day coaching that everybody gets, as well as Walmart Academy, our specialized
training for advanced roles. We had 95,000 people go through that last year and
people can earn college credit for the courses they do at Walmart Academy. We're
using VR and AR as well to augment the academy and bring it into the stores and
train people in diﬀerent ways. Soft skills, hard skills et cetera. And then, access to
education. It's been important for us and for our associates and this was an idea that
came from associates to oﬀer access for adult working learners that is job relevant,
it's aﬀordable, it's free, and we focus on completion.
So, we provide coaching, and we track ourselves based on how many people are
actually completing this. So, it is two-year and four-year degrees that are job-relevant
supply chain management, retail management, computer programming, that sort of
thing, but also certiﬁcates in optical, in pharmacy, we have people go through this
and then get a promotion into the pharmacy department or into the optical
department or into our technology department.
We also added trades based on feedback from our associates. And obviously, we
don't hire construction workers ourselves, but in the markets where we operate,
we're in 2,000 counties in America there are -- there is demand for people in the
trades and some of our associates choose to go that path. What we're most excited
about is the uptake among women and people of color. And I'll just show you some
stats on the next page on this one. If you look at the far right in terms of what we call
Live Better U, that's the education program, you can see the completion. So, we've
got about 3,500 folks that have actually completed. And some of these programs
are new. We just started them a year ago, two years ago, three years ago. So, we're
excited about that progress.
The people who go through this, as we've had studied from the outside by Lumina
Foundation, get promoted more often and have higher performance ratings. So,
we're excited about what this shows, and what's I think the best part of this is, the
participation of Black and African-American associates, women and so on, reﬂects
our total associate base. And just to give you one stat, Black and African-American
people going through LBU are twice as likely to stay and get promoted as people --
average associate. So, we think it's also a great springboard for inclusion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 19A - Daniel Binder
A - Kathleen McLaughlinLast thing, I'll mention on this is that, we typically promote about 200,000 people a
year, and we're working on raising that number. Most of our roles are ﬁlled by
people from within. And as I said before, 75% of our management started as hourly
people.
Let's talk about digital real quick. So, as I mentioned, this is really important to make
the quality of the job better, serve our customer better, drive our productivity all of
these things. And we've also created new roles because of digital technology. A lot
of people have written about future of work and will automation take away jobs and
so on. What, we've found so far, is it just changes the nature of the job, it actually
creates some better jobs. So, these personal shoppers 160,000 people, new jobs
that we added to be personal shoppers and other things that are using technology
to serve our customers better. And as I mentioned before, we've given our
associates phones to use as productivity devices in the store but also for themselves.
So those are just a couple examples.
Last point and then let's go to Q&A. We are working in the broader ﬁeld to try to
improve workforce development for hourly people in general. There are three parts
to where we've been investing. We've invested over $130 million in philanthropy, in
giving, as well as bringing other assets to bear our leaders and our committee and
so on, advocacy, around innovative learning models, so experimenting new ways for
adult working learners to pick up new credentials and skills. Engaging employers to
make this a movement and then building a broader system of badging and
credentialing and so on.
So, let me stop there. I ran a little bit over on time. I apologize. I tend to be long-
winded, those of you who know me, so I apologize. And Dan, let's go to you, let's get
to the Q&A.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Great. Thanks, Kathleen. So, our ﬁrst question is around diversity. And the question is,
are you seeing the kinds of results you want to see on diversity? What are your
success metrics?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. So, as I said, yes and no. I mean, I think pretty much everything we're working
on, whether it's human capital, racial equity, climate, we see signs of success. We are
making progress in society, in general. We all have a long way to go and Walmart's
no exception.
So, what we're tracking is what we're disclosing every six months, which is the data,
on representation, on promotion rates, by level in the company and by diﬀerentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30

A - Daniel Binderclass. So, women Asian Americans and so on. So, please have a look at that you can
see. We're looking at three-year trends and then we also look at the interim, and
where we see wobbles. We type in and see, okay, there's something diﬀerent
systematic that we got to work on here.
So, that's what we're tracking. But we also track on a qualitative basis, which is
culture. We do the associate engagement survey, which gives us data on how people
are feeling and inclusions of big important thing as well. And that actually is pretty
positive. So, it's both qualitative in terms of the culture and do people feel that they
belong as well as the data that shows the outcomes. And we're encouraged by the
progress. But yeah, we have -- we've got ways to go for sure.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Our second question is on wages. And the question is, what are your plans to raise
wages, particularly with some of your competitors starting at $15 per hour? Are you
engaging with peers, trade associations, and other organizations to help raise the
wage ﬂoor, especially for low wage workers in the grocery retail sector?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. Well, as I was saying earlier, our goal is to be competitive for speciﬁc roles in
speciﬁc markets, and be at least at the level of what the market is at, if not above, so
that's our focus. And you can see, based on what I took there before that, what that
means then is the $12, that people often talk about for Walmart. It's not like the
average wage or what everybody starts at. That is the lowest starting wage for any
job in the country, and that has come up 65%, since we started all of this back in
2015.
Many other jobs have higher wages, you could see our average across our whole
ﬂeet is $16.40, for the hourly wage. And then we have these additional components
of compensation over and above that. So, goal is to be competitive. We do think that
the ﬂoor needs to go up in the United States. We said that many times, Doug has
talked about that. He chairs the Business Roundtable and the Business Roundtable
has stated that as well. I think Doug, Dan, as recently is the ICM talked about that, in
the investor community meeting earlier this year. That is a policy goal of ours to see
happened. And we do engage folks in it.
There's a lot of work that we have done as well on workforce development. So, the
multiple pathways initiative at the Business Roundtable, the Rework America,
Business Network and so on. We're trying to work both sides, have a higher ﬂoor,
but get people focused on mobility as well and scale building and helping people
realize their dreams because it's about compensation, but it's also about purpose
and where can people go in their careers.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Our next question is on Labor Relations. And the question is, we have taken note of
your poor ratings from certain ESG raters on labor relations, and wonder what yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 12 of 19A - Kathleen McLaughlinresponse is? What steps are you taking to help make sure of associates feedback is
heard and that management is responsive to it?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. So, our scores on diﬀerent ESG ratings tend to vary pretty widely, depending on
the methodology and what people are focused on. So, we ﬁnd is, on the instruments
that are focused on benchmarking of practices or outcomes, we do really well. Some
of the things that I think people maybe alluding to, there are some ratings schemes
that are heavily reliant on what people call "controversies." And that methodology is
challenging for a large company in general and for us in particular, I think for a few
reasons.
So, the controversy methodology tends to go out and scrape media mentions and
social media and so on, it just gather up on an absolute basis, mentions of a
company in an unfavorable light. So, a larger company just by virtue of the scale is
going to have a lot of mentions, regardless of what's happening on a percentage
basis. So, you just to take and you feel for it with 1.5 million associates. 10 -- if you just
said, 1%. 1% of our 1.5 million people, that's 15,000 individuals. So, I just love big
numbers there.
And another challenge with that is, it's pretty susceptible to manipulation by
campaigners. So, there are lot of groups out there that have goals around social
outcomes or environmental outcomes, many of which we completely agree with.
But, there are approaches to campaign, and it's easier and more beneﬁcial to target
a big company, because you'll get the medium inches, you'll get the get the press
and so on. And we've had that happen to us a number of times and happy to go into
some speciﬁc examples. But that's challenging and sometimes in these instances,
campaigners will gen[ph] up allegations that are false or they'll talk about things that
they think are going to happen, that never do happen. But it generates articles, it
generates press coverage and then that shows right up into the controversies for.
And if you look at the actual records on some of these things around labor relations,
you just take NLRB. We have a tiny, tiny fraction of what you'd expect we'd have, just
given our scale in terms of anything that ever gets brought before the NLRB. And the
vast majority of things that do get brought up in that small number of cases are
dismissed or withdrawn very quickly.
So, again, I'd say, look at the facts versus what's the basis for the controversy rating. It
is something that we are taking on, some of you, and investors et cetera, have said,
hey, why don't you sit down with these guys and go through. We will, but it's sort of
litigating every single article that's ever been written that someone else, it's going to
take some time. So, we're working through that.
And then, I would just say in terms of labor relations in general, a few things I didn't
mention in the overview. This is really about culture and practices and policies, and
this goes back to Mr.Sam, and he has always been true that Walmart it's a company
of associates, like we're all associates, who work together. And the mechanisms that
we put in place to engage and get ideas from associates, get suggestions, draw outFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 13 of 19complaints, all of these things, they are many, many. So, there are in person one-on-
one modes of engagement based on the morning huddle and getting together with
your teams and those happen day in, day out in the stores. And those are a big
mechanism to capture people's ideas and suggestions.
Then we have what's called an Open Door policy and practice that goes back years,
which is, if for whatever reason associate feels that what they raised they didn't land
well, or didn't get responded to, an associate can go to anybody else in the
company and raise that issue right up to Doug McMillon and no retaliation that is a
policy, we enforce it, people are free to raise issues through the Open Door process.
We have the Associate Engagement Survey, which I mentioned earlier that's a formal
mechanism where we capture scores.
We had 600,000 people participate in that last year and we get right in responses
and those are reviewed and acted on and so on. And, I've worked in retail a long
time. I passed life before Walmart, the kind of scores that we're getting on our AES
or as good or better than anybody in terms of engagement and happiness of our
associate base. And then we're testing a lot of digital mechanisms too, I talked about
the phone, we've got an internal workplace and other forms of social media that
people can express their views and so on. And then we have anonymous channels.
So, the Ethics Hotline is an example. 24/7 multiple languages, people can call in and
say, hey listen, this happened. And it tells conﬁdentially it's considered triage,
investigated depending on the nature of the issue.
So, those are multiple, multiple mechanisms. And then what we have in place is the
whole set of mechanisms to take in that feedback and act on it. So, listening towards
by our leadership teams in the ﬁeld and by executives, ways to bring in the feedback
from the AES, and each of us, like I do this with my own team. We have management
action plans that come out of the AES, the Associate Engagement Survey, where we
get followed up on. This is the feedback, how did you action and so on.
And just some examples of feedback from associates that have landed in policy. One
would be Thanksgiving is now holiday at Walmart, this year, last year that was an idea
from an associate that somebody raised with John Furner adoption beneﬁts. We
provide $5,000 and other things to help people adopt. That was an associate idea.
Updating our code of conduct. There was a lot of input from across our associates
base around that and we put that in.
So, these are all important ways to just stay with the ﬁnger on the pulse and always
have dialogue going across associates in the company. And then ﬁnally, we recently
emerged, our Labor Relations and Associate Relations teams, used to have them
separate, but then we realized it's coming all the same thing, right. It has to do with
engaging with each other and lifting the culture and responding to ideas and
suggestions and so on. And so, that's now led by an integrated team. And a big part
of their mandate is training, out there amongst our leader. So, they delivered
150,000 trainings of supervisors just this year so far, around all matters of associate
engagement including what I was talking about before, which is freedom ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30

creating that culture throughout the company of engagement and response.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Great. Next question is related to COVID workforce trends. And the question is, there
are few macro trends falling out of COVID, including women leaving the workforce
and a tight labor market at the entry level? What are these impacting Walmart?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. So, I think, in terms of the women's engagement in the workforce, we've
probably all been reading the same articles and this discussion of the great
resignation and so on. We haven't seen it come through for us in terms of general
hiring, but I showed you that stat about women's participation in our workforce, it's
down a percent. I haven't seen stats for the country as a whole for the workforce as a
whole. So, I'm eager to look at those and just understand the comparison. I can say
for myself as a woman I have struggled this pandemic, because I've been at times
having more around the home and at work and challenging ways of working and so
on.
So, I think, it is an issue in society overall, and one that we're really paying attention
to and obviously engaging women and others within our company to understand.
Okay. So, what is the is the experience, what can we learn having gone through this
pandemic, and then what might be put in place going forward. Our focus are all of it
really remains and having the best value proposition we can for associates, all
associates and in any time, whatever the trends listening to what some people's
minds and how can we take that into our proposition and make our proposition
more compelling and more eﬀective for our associates.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Our next question is regarding investing. And the question is, how do you balance
investing in human capital, with investments you are making in technology and
automation?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Right. Well, so our CapEx and our OpEx for technology, for automation for our
associates, the wage investments we are making and so on, obviously are factored
into our guidance. So, they're baked in. And they're really of a piece. These things
are all related. So, I actually wouldn't even do them as trade-oﬀs. A lot of the things
that we put in place through technology are the things that have allowed us to create
exciting new roles for our associates and new jobs. I talked about the personal
shoppers, one example, but even roles in the fulﬁllment centers and distribution
centers, other parts of our business because of the technology, the automation, it's
made the work better.
It's allowed us to lift up certain roles and move them up the ladder in terms of
compensation and so on. So, we see these things is quite interrelated. We did pull
forward some investments on technology and automation into this ﬁscal because ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30

Page 15 of 19A - Daniel Binder
A - Kathleen McLaughlinthe strength of the company and are feeling that now is the time to invest in further
strengthen our competitiveness. But it's done in quite an integrated way and we
think that together, they make our company even stronger in terms of customer
service and growth.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Next question is a COVID-related question as well. We want to understand the
impact of COVID on Walmart's human capital strategy, including which short-term
and long-term changes were introduced to protect associates. And whether any
beneﬁts were enhanced over the long-term as a result?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. So, in terms of the COVID beneﬁts that were introduced a whole variety of
things. And we have a very in-depth issue brief just on COVID, on our investor
website. So, please do have a look at that, and if you have trouble ﬁnding anything, I
think it's pretty prominent, but let us know.
There's a bunch of things we put in place. So, our ﬁrst concern was the safety and
well-being associates like can we even operate in this environment? And so, we did a
lot of things in terms of creating this emergency leave for COVID. As I said, it's
couple weeks oﬀ, if you've been exposed or told to isolate its paid, and you can use
it multiple times. So, if you had an incident in April, and then something else
happened again in June, it's like you run out of that. So obviously, to keep people
safe, that's been quite important.
And that's on top of the regular paid time oﬀ, that I talked about earlier, that has
continued, of course, throughout all of this. Lots of physical things that we put in
place, sanitizing and cleaning overnight, physical barriers, diﬀerent points
depending on local guidance from health authorities. There has been metering and
other physical changes to the stores. Health screenings, temperature checks and
masking, all of that. And throughout, we've been following the guidance of the CDC
and local authorities, which really do very from place to place.
We eliminated co-pay for things like doctor on demand. We started oﬀering free
virtual counseling to folks, as I mentioned, there was a click up and demand for
mental health services in general. And then we also gave incremental pay to people
in the form of bonuses and the reason we did that is, we didn't want people to feel
they had to come in to work to earn the money. We didn't want to make an hourly
thing, because the whole point was to recognize people for the extra eﬀort and so
on. Not have them feel that they have to come in, if they don't want to right. So, we
did all of that.
Those things were all based on the pandemic and related to the conditions of
having to operate in this time in terms of what might carry forward, I think there's a
couple things. One is this whole experience is absolutely reinforced the importance
of aﬀordable healthcare. And our team that works on that package, I told you about
some of the innovations, the eﬀorts are redoubling like that is important and the factFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 16 of 19A - Daniel Binder
A - Kathleen McLaughlin
A - Daniel Binderthat we oﬀer that to people, that's really important and it's something we'll double
down and continue.
Second, obviously, reinforce the importance of our PTO, pre-COVID and the need to
continue that and give people that ﬂexibility, the importance of mental health
services. And then from a business perspective, COVID dramatically accelerated our
plans for grocery pickup, contactless delivery of things in people's homes, and so
on, validated the opportunities that we have in healthcare and so on. So, I think in
terms of work force, it's going to end up creating even more exciting career paths for
people, diﬀerent kinds of jobs that are available and diﬀerent career paths.
And then ﬁnally, I would just say reinforcing the importance of ﬂexibility and balance
in work. So, our approach is to scheduling, our approach is to these other beneﬁts.
They, I think it become an even more compelling part of our proposition for
associates.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Great. Our next question about Board oversight. And so, the question is, how is
Walmart's Board overseeing human capital? What visibility does it have today? And
what future challenges does it anticipate rapidly?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. So, the compensation and management development committee oversees our
human capital strategy. And, the way that our Board meetings tend to work is just
kind of a ﬁrst day with committees, and second day full Board. So, they go in depth
on the human capital strategy and issues, and it's everything we talked about today,
right. So, its oversight around the paying the beneﬁts on inclusion of diversity,
strategies and performance, the education, the investments we've made and things
like Live Better U, the COVID practices and policies and so on. So, all of those things.
And then those get brought to the full Board for discussion and there have been
times on speciﬁc decisions and so on that the full Board is provided perspective. So,
certainly the COVID approaches in the education investments, the wage investments
and so on.
So, it is a high, high priority issue for our Board, they get updates and reports from
management from Donna Morris and her team around people strategy and so on. At
each of the meetings from our teams that work on diﬀerent aspects of this, not only
within Walmart, but beyond in society, it's a topic of conversation at every committee
meeting, that's one of the primary focuses that set out in their charter, their terms of
reference, so.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Okay. Our next question is around KPIs. And the question is, how are you thinking
about future KPIs around human capital? Are you considering turnover rates
generally or turnover rates for the racial groups or by gender? We do have a lot of
questions on turnovers and we are trying to capture all that one question that's
submitted.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 17 of 19A - Kathleen McLaughlin
A - Daniel Binder
A - Kathleen McLaughlin{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes, turnover, you know that's wrenching before I came to Walmart. I worked with a
lot of diﬀerent retailers as a consultant for well over 20 years. And yes, turnover, it's --
the challenge of turnover is, it's a pretty noisy metric depending on whether your
ring fence it for people of a certain tenure, or certain kind of roles and so on,
especially retail. There could be a lot of noise, especially in the ﬁrst couple of months
because sometimes people seek out retail as a bridge employment or for a variety
of factors.
So, it is something that we're looking to see how our people deﬁning a turnover
metric that would be apples-to-apples, considering a very diﬀerent retail formats,
grocery format versus club format versus say DCs and FCs and so on. So, it is a
better to segregate, it's better to look at it overall, I don't know. So, we're looking at
SASB obviously looking at the way other people are starting to deﬁne it. Some folks
George Serafeim, is a good example at Harvard, doing interesting work in the whole
human capital metrics arena.
So, we're looking at it. We're trying to ﬁgure out what would be the most
representative number that wouldn't be noisy and just mislead people in terms of
what's going on. And then, we do track diﬀerent versions of turnover internally,
obviously. And one of the things that we found that's exciting is, for example, these
investments that we've been making over the last few years in human capital. So, the
wage investments, the Walmart Academy, Live Better U, the healthcare beneﬁts and
so on. We can disaggregate them and see some correlations to turn over.
And for example, we just had Lumina Foundation did a third-party assessment of
Live Better U, just as one piece of our program and found that people, who have
gone through Live Better U or in the middle of it, have 4x lower attrition than the
average associated. And that's phenomenal. So, it gives us conﬁdence in pieces of
what we're doing. Another one is people have gone through Walmart Academy,
80% of the people, who go through Walmart Academy have an extra year of tenure,
an extra year of longevity retention. So, this is something we look at, the question is,
what version of it would be disclosed, so that it would be meaningful to all of you?
So, happy to take feedback on that, if folks have thoughts and recommendations on
that one.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Next question is regarding pay equity disclosure. The question is nothing that the
company has made a pay equity disclosure and has committed to including
international markets in the future. Has Walmart considered doing a pay gap report,
similar to the UK gender pay gap report?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. So, pay equity is important priority for us because it's a bedrock of the inclusion
strategy, and pretty vital to get the outcomes you want. So, as I mentioned, the way
we've come at it there is a couple ways. One is practices we're putting in place to
preserve pay equity. And then the other is disclosing how we're doing on an apples-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-30
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 18 of 19A - Daniel Binder
A - Kathleen McLaughlin
A - Daniel Binderto-apples basis. So, in terms of the practices, some of the things that we put in place,
are -- for example, interview training removing any questions about salary history,
when folks are interviewing.
Having the diverse slates for positions and diverse interview panels, as well we think
these are all important in terms of the hiring stage and then even the evaluation of
development stage, looking to ensure we don't have systematic diﬀerences in how
people are being rated and promotion decisions and so on. So, those are all the
practices. And then on the disclosure part, we think the most valid important way to
look at this is, job for job, level for level, market for market. So, that's why we're trying
to do the analysis of pay equity on that basis.
And as I mentioned, when we done that in the U.S., we showed no systematic
discrepancy. And then disclosing, how we're doing on representation at the diﬀerent
levels in the company. So, entry level management, oﬃcer rank, C-suite and the
Board, what's the representation? So, that's how we're coming at it. And yes, I
recognize that some companies especially in Europe have done this more kind of
aggregated basis, but we don't think that's as useful as looking at it on the job for
job, kind of apples-to-apples basis, which is where we're focusing.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Kathleen, that brings us up on the our here. We're going to conclude the meeting
and want to thank everybody for joining us today.

that we didn't get to, please do follow them through to the Investor Relations team.
It'll be helpful feedback for us. And also, if you have any feedback on this format as
well that would be great for us to know, because we will take it into future webinars
