All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Before we get started, I am going to read a
safe harbor statement. So for those of you who've been at Goldman Sachs events
before, you know what I'm doing. But good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to a
conversation with Diane Greene, CEO of Google Cloud and Alphabet board
member.
Some of the statements that Diane may make today may be considered forward-
looking. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to diﬀer materially. Any forward-looking statements that Diane
makes are based on assumptions as of today and Alphabet undertakes no obligation
to update them. Please refer to Alphabet's Form 10-K for a discussion of the risk
factors that may aﬀect its results.
Then, Diane, she needs no introduction. But I'm going to give her one anyhow. She
is the CEO of Google Cloud, as I mentioned. She is also a member of Alphabet's
Board of Directors. Prior to joining Google, Diane founded and successfully scaled
VMware as well as 2 other software companies. She holds multiple degrees,
including advanced degrees in computer science and naval architecture. She's a
recipient of many professional awards that would be too long to list and also is an
avid sailor, lifelong sailor. And a fun fact would be that in -- I'm not going to state the
year. But she was the Women's National Dinghy Champion. So everybody, thank you.
Welcome, Diane. You're going to start with a presentation.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
All right. Hello. Thanks so much for having me here, Heather. And I'm going to
quickly go through an update on Google Cloud and then we'll get into questions.
Okay.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 2 of 12So just to level set what Google Cloud is, when we say Google Cloud, it's our secure,
open, leading technologies, Google Cloud Platform and all its services, all the way
up to G Suite, our secure productivity tool suite. And Google Cloud at this point is --
the entire Google Cloud is, I think, highly diﬀerentiated as the most -- it's got security
at every layer. It is -- and I think the most secure place to have information and do
communications.
Google Cloud Platform is diﬀerentiated in its data analytics and its machine learning.
And it's also diﬀerentiated in our open approach to a modern developer
environment.
G Suite is in-the-cloud productivity suite. I believe maybe the only one that supports
hardware-based two-factor authentication and it has tremendous collaborative
abilities and a lot of AI getting infused into it.
So you might have noticed at the Google earnings call on February 1, we ﬁnally put
out some metrics about where we are in Google Cloud. We said in 2017 we
surpassed $1 billion a quarter run rate for Google Cloud Platform -- no, for the
Google Cloud business. Then we said for Google Cloud Platform, we're the fastest-
growing public cloud by the trailing 4 quarters that we could look at. Then we had
some other metrics like G Suite now has passed 4 million paying companies.
So at this point, we are completely an organization that is laser-focused on our
customers and laser-focused on our partners. And Alphabet Google is excited about
this business. And in 2016 and 2017, we were the largest driver of new headcount
additions in Alphabet. This is a fast-growing business. And we are fueling it with
Google-quality people and also a lot of enterprise expertise. We've hired executives
from all the usual suspects. And it's a very talented group of people working
extraordinarily hard. And we've really built out all the functions for go-to-market,
from training and professional services, to customer engineering, to high-end
architects. And it's starting to really pay oﬀ.
Then we've also forged some big enterprise, very strategic partnerships, go-to-
market with SAP, go-to-market with sales. We'll be running all of SAP's oﬀerings in
our cloud, some of them already; and then Salesforce around integrating with
Google Analytics and the ads data in Google's BigQuery and also around G Suite;
and then Cisco around an open hybrid environment; Pivotal; Dell and a number of
other big enterprise partnerships to help us with go-to-market, along with our work
with the channels, the (S) system integrators.
So what have we done? The ﬁrst thing we had to do was really gear up engineering
to take this phenomenal technology and make it enterprise-ready, remove every
deal blocker that an enterprise might have. And I'm happy to say that by the end of
this last year, we had really done that. We had user-managed encryption keys, peer-
to-peer networking, audit logs with ﬁne-grained access control and identity
management, all the things -- the regulatory, the compliance, all the things an
enterprise needs.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Page 3 of 12So I was pretty happy to see the growth as we completed all these. And I think it puts
us in a great position. And I'll just share an anecdote that a friend of mine that's a
tech CEO said that runs on both clouds. The friend said that looking at what
happened last year product-wise, they felt that Google Cloud out-executed the other
big public clouds in terms of really useful major new functionality. So that was a nice
thing to see.
And the other thing we're doing is sales and engineering are really working in
lockstep. We have a really clear road map. We're executing on it. And it's constantly
evolving. And while doing all this, we're also innovating, which I'm pretty proud of.
So we recently put out Auto ML, a way to automatically generate a machine learning
model with better -- we did it in vision ﬁrst. It can get better results than the ML PhDs.
So you give it any set of images and it will build a model for those images. Huge
reception of that, really pleased with how many companies registered for that.
We were the ones that found the Meltdown -- the Spectre and Meltdown problem.
And we shared the ﬁx for that. We put out our open source Kubernetes and now it's
the leading modern way to orchestrate your workloads. We took -- put out Spanner,
the world's distributed transactional database. And we announced proprietary
security chips that can be used to attest to the validity every time you turn on your
computer that your OS hasn't been tampered with. And we use that in everything,
from Chromebooks to our servers.
We've also been busy building out data centers. We've gone from 2 to 10
international data centers in the last two years. We're rolling them out. We can roll
out a full data center in about 8 weeks once we have a location. So it's basically
demand-driven now. We had to move internationally once we became a really
enterprise-ready public cloud because people like to have their data near to them.
We also have built 4 undersea cables connecting 5 continents, doing
intercontinental -- we have one of the bigger networks in the world, guarantees low
latencies.
Then ﬁnally, I was here a year ago. And we had great customers. We had a lot of
retail customers. We had a lot of Internet customers, gaming customers. But now as
the cloud matures, it's getting -- so everybody's seeing that the value of the cloud is
in having the latest technology just there for you. Then as you get into the data
analytics and the machine learning, it gets pretty vertical. And so we really doubled
down on the verticals over the last year. And we've got really premier customers.
These are all referenceable customers. You see on this slide, ﬁnancial services, HSBC,
PayPal in production, Marketo, Salesforce, health care. Google's got phenomenal
amount of research going on in health care. And Google Cloud is the way we can
bring that to market. If you look at marketing, Google Cloud -- Google's got all the
ads data. You can bring that together in Google Cloud. You can bring that to market.
Media, gaming, communications, Nintendo and PokÃ©mon Go. And there's a lot of
gaming companies. Manufacturing and energy, Schlumberger uses us for HPC, for
machine learning. Colgate is a big G Suite user and now GCP, partnering with us and
SAP. Retail, we really had a spectacular Black Friday through Cyber Monday this year,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Then transportation, Lyft, Airbus, GO-JEK, the little motorcycle delivery service

enjoying bringing the magic of Google to companies all over the world in a way that
really propels them forward. And that's what we see our mission.
So with that, I'll also take questions. Thank you.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
All right. So ﬁrst of all, thank you for disclosing the run rate for Google Cloud. So I
know that it's something that you've wanted to talk about for a while and seems like
you got everyone to agree. So that's good. You've got 4 million paying customers on
G Suite. You -- as you mentioned, GCP is the fastest-growing public cloud provider.
How would you measure your success versus what you thought when you, I guess,
it's been two years or so, when you came on two years ago?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well when I came on, I mean, it was really obvious to me that we had the technology
and the know-how. And I kind of knew that we weren't quite enterprise-ready. And
the cloud business is a phenomenally complex business. And so I wanted to see us
signing these customers. I'm pretty proud of that slide I just had up because we got
them all signed. And the cloud business is interesting because it builds on itself. So
you get a customer and you got to get them moved over and starting to use the
services and then they start growing. And so the revenue is kind of -- builds on itself
in the out-years. And so I'm pretty happy with where we are.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And the deal blockers that you mentioned that were -- I think one of them used to
be, you needed a Gmail account to provision a GCP account, which is hard at a place
like Goldman Sachs to do that. But...
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Although it's very secure, you can't beat...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Exactly. But the point is, did the amount of time it took for you to -- because you said
those deal blockers are gone now. The amount of time it took for you to kind of, I
guess, remove those from the system, did it...

Q - Heather Anne Bellini
A - Diane B. GreeneWell I'm not sure I fully appreciated how -- all of the things we had to do. And had I
fully appreciated it, I wouldn't have thought we could have gotten it done in two
years, like these engineers have really -- they're very good and they worked -- they're
very focused and I just can't thank them enough.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. And can you update us, just level set people in the audience, where do you
think we are in terms of cloud adoption today? What's the best way to measure it?
Do you think about it in terms of the percentage of workloads that are running in
public cloud? And I guess just, where do you think we are today and how much
progress have we made in the last year?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
So one thing, as I said, is I think the -- I was with a big bank yesterday talking to them.
And it was a completely diﬀerent conversation from when I spoke with them a year
ago. And I wasn't saying anything. But then the lead person brought this up. They
said, "We were thinking of this as a place to save money and infrastructure costs.
And we were having a hard time with it because it wasn't clear we couldn't do it
more cost-eﬀective given our size. But now we realize that in order to keep pace with
technology and in order to focus on what we do, we've got to be in the cloud." Then
he speciﬁcally said that there's -- well, his technology person piped up and said,
"There is just no way they could keep up with something like BigQuery for Google."
Like I was just looking at some of the numbers of customers in the ad business,
buying or something went from 20 hours to 10 seconds on a query -- with BigQuery.
That kind of technology, they're not going to be able to get on-prem. And so that's a
long-winded way of saying that we are early because I think people are just starting
to appreciate. Well if you look, I think Gartner says it's about $56 billion last year. And
certainly, the IT industry is over $1 trillion. So it's pretty clearly early days. Now that
doesn't count SaaS. And the reason you don't count SaaS is most of them are still on-
prem. And they're all going to move to the public cloud.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. Yes. And it used to be before you got there or even 1.5 years ago, you would
have CIOs say, "Well I'm not sure if GCP is enterprise-ready, right?" Google's not an
enterprise company. Obviously, you have the background to help change that
narrative, which you've been doing. But how do your -- I mean, aside from that
conversation with the bank that you just mentioned, how are your conversations with
customers? How have they changed even recently?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes. I would say that people come in pretty serious about what we can do with them.
They -- now we have the sophistication to bring in the domain expertise for the
vertical and really get into things we can do to move their business forward. And of
course, that's really fun. And so that -- in the large customers, that is going on. The
other thing that's changed is our engagement with developers, our engagement
with training. We have phenomenal training programs out there, everything from
online to in-person, the hackathons and the whole thing. And we -- people -- we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Q - Heather Anne Belliniclearly an important player at this point and there's no more of, "Well you clearly
have good technology. But can you really serve the enterprise?" We are serving the
enterprise increasingly well.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So you get that question less and less?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. And what is -- what are the key areas of focus from the customers? What are
they -- what are the top couple of things that they have on your development wish
list if they were creating it? What do they want next from GCP?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
I think, overall, what customers want is everything to be easier and easier to use. And
they want to understand how they can move. And we actually have a phenomenal
story now because what we've done is we've taken Kubernetes, (this orchestration)
and its deal for the monitoring. And we've made it work both on-prem and in the
cloud. And so we can go to customers and say, "Look, when you're developing now,
you can develop -- Google is the place -- we do -- we push about 2,000 pushes a
day. And yet for the last two years, we've been, according to CloudHarmony, which is
owned by Gartner, the most highly available cloud. So it's not aﬀecting our
availability. So companies everywhere have to have this agility to keep up now. And
using the container architecture and so on is what they all -- everybody realizes they
have to move to these more modern agile environments. And so now we have a way
they can do it both on-prem and in the cloud. Then we can -- so we do a lot of work
with customers around that. Then, of course, an immense amount of work around
their data, how to make it smart, how to combine it with other interesting data, their
smart data, which is proprietary to them, is becoming a key part of how they do
business.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So from a competitive...
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Then IoT is pretty interesting area.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. So if you were sitting down with a CIO and they asked you, "What are your top
3 competitive advantages versus the other cloud providers?" What would be those 3
things?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

A - Diane B. Greene{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes. Well I'd say it's security, ﬁrst and foremost, simply because I don't think anyone
can aﬀord not to be as secure as possible. And we've -- not only do we discover
these major problems, like the (Speck Hammer) or the Heartbleed and what have
you. But we also -- like with 1.4 billion Gmail accounts, we see everything. We can tell
you, "Hi. someone -- you just gave away your password. Are you sure you wanted to
do it because we're not going to let them log in if you want to change your
password?" And so we're even that sophisticated now. And so -- and then what we're
doing increasingly with GCP. So I say security and just because it's just so important.
Then it's data analytics and machine learning and AI and...
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. And Kubernetes, would that be...
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Then the third is our open approach. And one thing I'll just say about open, the
reason it's so important is the pace of technology is so fast. And it used to be
something that had to run everywhere that you'd have these standards bodies. And
people would elect people to go to these meetings. And it would proceed at a
glacial pace. And now you can just -- if you have something that really needs to run
everywhere like Kubernetes, you can -- or TensorFlow, you can just open source it
and that's a standard. Then you just change the code and it can move fast. And it's
the modern way of letting the world have useful standards. And we have pushed that
more than anybody. I'm really proud of the stance Google's taken.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
You touched on this a little bit in your slides. But one area of focus for the investment
community has been GCP's go-to-market. And I guess, can you go into a little bit
more detail about what you've done regarding an enterprise sales footprint? And
how do you think about the pace of investment that's needed there?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well clearly -- so when I look at our competitors, one of them -- because they've had
a 7-year head start -- has more developer mindshare, although I think we're
addressing that pretty rapidly. Then the other one has been in the enterprise for like
20-some years and has got a big footprint. So we are hiring incredibly aggressively
and we're focused on leveraged ways because organically, we're -- person-to-person
isn't going to happen overnight. And so we're hiring people to work with as many
partners. We're hiring people to do training and to train the service people. Then we
have named account teams, global account teams. We have the mid-market. We
have the SMB. We have the ISRs. We -- the support we have in diﬀerent tiers so that --
one of the more novel things we have is Google -- we have a lot of novel kind of -- I
think how you go-to-market in cloud is not ﬁnalized yet because of the complexity of
the business. And you're basically merging 2 engineering teams and operating it
together when a company moves to the cloud. And it has to work seamlessly, which
is possible because of the cloud, because of how you can share. But -- so we did thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 12Q - Heather Anne Bellini

Q - Heather Anne Bellini
A - Diane B. Greene-- Google embedded site reliability engineers for each of Google's billion-plus active
user apps. There's 8 of them. Then what they do is just monitor the application and
keep it running. And so now we have customer reliability engineers to do the same
for our customers. And that's just one of many things that we are putting out there to
make our customers successful.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And when you talk about leveraging partnerships -- and obviously, at VMware, you
did an exceptional job of building that out as well. How do you kind of grade your
performance here? And has it been moving as fast as you wanted? And where are
we in terms of kind of starting to see that with the investments that you've made
really start to pay oﬀ in terms of pipeline?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
That's a good question. I mean, it takes a lot of work to make a great partnership.
And so we've been doing a lot of engineering work with our partners, with Cisco,
with Salesforce, with Dell -- and Cisco, Dell, too. And I would -- we're seeing
increased traction with joint customers. But I don't feel that it's fully kicked in. In fact, I
was recently giving a talk and someone said to me, they go, "(Hal Reddy) announces
lots of partnerships, does anything ever come of them?" And I thought it was a fair
point. But I do think some really good things are going to come from our key
partnerships. We're pretty focused on them.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I want to pause for a second to get the mic runners so I don't shock them when I call
for them. I'm going to ask another question. But if you guys want to get around the
room and then we'll go to Q&A in a second. A question we get quite often is just --
you showed the slide, I thought -- which was great, that kind of gave the mix and
some marquee customers in some of the diﬀerent verticals. But there are people
who'd say, "Wow, GCP must be having a lot of success. But it must be in kind of the
startup community or the smaller community." How do you think about customer mix
and the evolution of your customer mix, whether it's by vertical or whether it's by
size of the organization?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
So I thought it was really important to work with -- to have a very strong, large
customer segment early on because it would drive the products really clearly and
also in sort of a land grab world, it was kind of important to get it in. So take a
customer like HSBC, the third-largest bank in the world, being able to do so much
with them is just great. No matter how you look at it, pushes us on regulatory and
compliance. It pushes us on broad functionality, a lot of machine learning. And it
pushes us on servicing and making a customer like that feel extremely well taken
care of. And so we have done exceptionally well, I think, on getting these large
customers. And that makes it much, much easier to bring in the mid-market and so
on. We get all the SMBs through our G Suite product and really nice things have
been happening. We're really getting a lot -- well, I think we're growing faster than
we expected to on G Suite with large customers, like we have Verizon, 150,000 seats.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantWe have customers with 300,000-plus seats there. So getting those large customers
deploying G Suite across their entire enterprise forces us to have everything the
customer needs. And know how to take care of them. But we -- it's a volume thing.
You want to have a really healthy mix across every segment.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. Questions from the audience? Why don't we go to this one ﬁrst and then we'll
come over here? I think it's this.
My question, if you were to take enterprises -- are going to innovate with ABCD,
which is AI, big data, cloud and data. And you have got Google TensorFlow and
you've got the GCP cloud platform, how are you inspiring or working with
enterprises to unleash their applications with Apigee, use the AI as well as Google
Cloud Platform? I'm just -- enterprises have a lot of applications. How are you
unleashing the Apigee, the Google Apigee as well as with AI -- in order to do AI, you
need machine learning. And in order to do machine learning, you need apps and
data. So how are you kind of really working with enterprise on that?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well so for everybody, Apigee was an acquisition we did a little over a year ago that
does API management. And they've done -- I'm really happy to report that, that's
been a successful acquisition. And we now -- they go very well with this modern
development environment we're doing. Then we've developed this, it's sort of API
economy almost with all our machine learning. So if you think about machine
learning, you can use TensorFlow and you can build your own models from scratch.
You can use auto. We have a bunch of tools to help you. You can use Auto ML for
some things and automatically generate your models or you could just use some of
the machine learning APIs we have. We have one for jobs that companies like FedEx
use. We have vision API. We have natural language API. We have language
translation API. We have video API. So broad spectrum, more coming on all the time
of these sort of APIs. And so what Apigee -- Apigee's been great because it runs
both on-prem and in the cloud and on any cloud. And it's a place where you can
provide a level, then direction and manage all your calls and secure them. And that
works -- that ﬁts in extremely well with our sort of orchestration and monitoring
environment. And also our mobile development, we have Firebase and Crashlytics
for Android and iOS, making it trivial to write an application, maybe use BigQuery in
the back end or any kind of permanent data store without having to even know what
a permanent data store is. And I tell everybody, this thing is getting to be like LEGOs
that you put together and your 6-year-old is going to be developing valuable apps
in not that long. But anyhow. So Apigee is part of that story and it hooks you to the
machine learning and other useful things.

{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Oh, sorry, (Kevin). The lights, we can't see.
Wanted to just understand the traction you are seeing with the U.S. banks because
clearly, it is easy with good U.K.-based bank. But how's the traction in the home
market because you have clearly larger banks here. And the second question is,
when we speak about small and medium-size companies, one of your competitors,
Amazon, seems to be really all over them and moving very quickly. And the sign-ups
are quite frequent and fast. So what's the game plan there? Do you want to be
aggressive across the spectrum or focus more on the larger companies? How
aggressive does Google want to really get?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Oh, we just want to do a few companies. So no, we're pretty aggressive. We're
working really hard. The banks, we're getting a lot of traction in many areas. So as
near as I can tell, we win all the high-performance computing benchmarks. We're
very good there. We're very good on the machine learning. So when you go to fraud
detection, risk analysis and all these things the banks do -- pretty excited about some
of the things that, I think, are going to be even good for the world that we can help
the banks with. And so work there. Then with -- or even just call centers and natural
language processing and so on. And so -- and we've really -- the biggest hurdle for
us to working with the banks was really getting our contracting process down and
really understanding the regulators and working with them on that. And I had a
compliment recently from someone that said, he thought we actually were now
perhaps best at getting some of that stuﬀ done. I have no idea. But at least we're
respectable there and able to get contracts closed with all the banks, which is the
ﬁrst step to building things out. And internationally, we're working with the banks.
Certainly, AWS has been around a lot longer than us so they have more people that
run on them. But I -- it doesn't seem to be a world where people want to just have
one provider.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
It might be helpful, you and I talked a little bit about this before, just how do you --
when AWS makes overtures into new markets, how does it change the type of
customer conversations you're having?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Yes. That's a great question because I remember shortly after I started at Google, I
got invited to -- I guess, I can say -- I was invited to The Research Board, which is very
high-end CIOs. And they -- you know all the questions -- and it was on my birthday, I
remember, it was very unpleasant -- and all the questions were, Google's going to
compete with us. I mean, they thought we were going to become insurers. They
thought we were going to do everything. And I was like, no, we're not going to do
that. We're pretty focused. But -- and now nobody worries about that with GoogleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantbecause Google's got -- we're really clear about what we're doing and not doing.
And now everybody is looking at Amazon and like that's why we got so many
retailers right away. But now it's kind of going through the whole industry. People
seem to not be worried about it. We're their friend. And they're a little concerned.
And it also tends to be a good thing for us with the SaaS vendors because we're not
doing that.

Oh, sorry, here's the mic, (Richard).
So my question is a bit of an overlap on his as well. But if you're sitting three years
out. And I'm sure your platform is going to evolve over the next 2, three years, is your
platform -- from a -- is it from a large enterprise perspective, is it going to be a no-
brainer to say, we can't ﬁght this battle on our own? We have to migrate to GCP? Is
there other things that you guys are working on to get to that place?
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well we -- is it going to be a no-brainer? Is everybody going to need to be on GCP?
That is certainly our vision. We just see so much -- there's so much that we're doing
around security and modern developer environments and the machine learning.
And this is where the world's going. It's moving -- for better or for worse, it's moving
faster and faster so you got to get more and more agile with your development. For
worse, it is getting more and more dangerous from a cyber-attack standpoint so you
got to be secure. Then the advances in machine learning are just kind of
revolutionary. And you want to take advantage of that. So as long as we can fulﬁll
what we think we can build, I think we'll be in a good position.
And from a cost standpoint, do you think you'd have an advantage where captive
would no longer...
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
Well it's impossible to predict because I don't know what everybody is going to
price things at. But I know that we're pretty good at building eﬃcient data centers.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And yes, we're going to take our last question right here. Just give the -- you might
be -- here we go.
I would love to hear how you think about -- just as you think about GCP, would love
to hear how you think about the diﬀerent buckets of sales and diﬀerent products that
you oﬀer. Like how do you think about it in terms of basic compute versus machineFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

buckets of GCP, which are the biggest, which do you care most about?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
That's like a Sophie's choice.
{BIO 6104652 <GO>}
What do I care about buckets, right? Like I said, this is an extraordinarily complex
business. So we do have infrastructure customers that have a lot of volume. So we
take very good care of them. And we think we provide. And they do, too, excellent
infrastructure. And you can't go up the stack and you can't have a shaky foundation
as you go up the stack. So no matter what, we're going to keep our excellence there
and continue moving that forward. And there's so much innovation possible in the
hardware in that low-level infrastructure. It's pretty exciting for our systems folks. And
we've really got a lot of expertise there. Then we think about the groups that are
working in the data analytics, the cloud space. And then we think about the
developer environment. But more and more, we're thinking about vertical solutions,
not end user-facing vertical solutions. But as you take those 3 kind of things that I
kind of -- and of course, everything completely secure. But if you take those things,
you can kind of make them tailored in a horizontal way for the diﬀerent industry
verticals. And we see some great ways to do that.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
All right. With that, we're going to wrap it up. Thank you, Diane. As always, we
appreciate it.

Thank you.
