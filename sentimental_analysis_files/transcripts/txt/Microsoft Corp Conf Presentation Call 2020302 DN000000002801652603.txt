Amy E. HoodThank you. So I wanted to kick oﬀ talking about overall commercial demand. I think
the -- coming out of calendar year '19 was an extraordinary year for Microsoft in
terms of the growth in your commercial overall commercial business -- commercial
bookings growth. I think exceeded people's expectations each and every quarter
throughout the year. Can you talk a little bit in the rearview mirror about what were
some of the key catalysts for that demand in calendar '19. And heading into 2020,
how are you feeling about the ability to sustain that level of commercial demand in
Microsoft.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Keith. I think what's so interesting is what you talk about a sort of an annual
concept. I think of as like a multi-year focus on where are we investing our dollars,
every single dollar into the right markets, right secular trends, that we believe in over
a durable period of time? And we've been really at that I feel like for six-ish years in
terms of making those decisions every day, that we felt would set us up to be well
positioned to do the things you've seen us do, not just in calendar year 2019, but I
really think over the course of the past few years seeing this demand curve. And if
you look and say where have we really focused and I think you see it in our results
across each of our cloud properties, as well as in Windows for security and you see
those results, I think in the bookings. And for me, bookings is really just a statement
of both, obviously, years of research and development investment followed by sales
and marketing investments to support that based on opportunity. And then solid
execution and then customer commitments made really not just to that year's view,
but really to a multi-year view, because most of those are multi-year commitments
that customers are making. And people don't do that lightly. And we certainly don't
take them lightly once made.
So I think it's less of a one-year view, that I have on these things and more of a multi-
year frame. I'm feeling well positioned for the next decade.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. To press a little bit on that, just in terms of the conversations you have with
your customers. Just about how guys are feeling about their overall budgets, their
overall IT budget outlook into 2020. And then I'd be remiss if I didn't bring in
coronavirus and the potential impact that has on both the supply chain and sort of
demand trends. So ﬁrst on the demand side of the equation, IT budgets, are you
feeling good about them in 2020 from your customer conversations? And two, does
coronavirus have any impact on the demand side of the equation or is it only a
supply side thing you guys right now?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Let me start on the ﬁrst half of the question. In general, I think, for me, it's much more
about where your invested and feeling good about IT budgets. I think in terms of the
markets that we participate in, the segments we participate in, our real focus on
value has always been there. The ability to feel good about every dollar you spend
with us, and the ability to earn a return on that. The ability to help you transform yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-02

Page 3 of 14Keith Weiss
Amy E. Hoodbusiness in a way that makes sense for you. I feel like that positions you well, no
matter what the IT budget is or what the percentage growth is year-over-year, the
people tend to focus on.
It's always been about being in the right market for us, executing well, taking share,
where we can and I think that's been successful right, as a plan, not to get overly
focused on any quarter or any half year changes. Because if you think about it over
the next decade. Do any of us sort of sit and say IT will be a bigger or smaller piece
of GDP, no matter what that number is. I absolutely believe it will be a larger
percentage of GDP in the next decade than it is today. And if that's true, being well
positioned for that growth, no matter it's pacing quarter-to-quarter tends to be just
how I look at the world in terms of demand. And the conversations we're having with
customers really reﬂect that.
On the second half of your question, which is speciﬁcally on COVID-19. I think you
really think about the adjustments, we've made have been pretty narrow to the
supply chain, as we have said for our guidance this quarter. Our focus primarily day
to day is on the health and safety of employees, partners, customers and the
communities in which we operate. And so that for us really is the ﬁrst priority and
then watching the pace of the supply chain recovery will continue to do what others
are doing and continue to keep an eye on it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. I want to drill down into, you talked about helping enterprises with their
transformation into digital transformations. I think, oftentimes, we focus too narrowly
on just the cloud side of the equation. We always want that Azure number from you.
You've been talking to us for a long time, saying Listen, you've got to look at the
bigger picture, really the hybrid cloud, Satya said the same thing to us. Last year I
think we started to see that in spades with hybrid cloud advantage really becoming a
big driver of the business. Can you talk to us about how customers are viewing that?
How does that customer conversation go in terms of a hybrid cloud opportunity
versus just the cloud opportunity? Number one, and does that expand that TAM for
you? Does it create a more expansive market opportunity, when you think about it
from a hybrid perspective?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah, I think maybe to start at the top again. The reality that compute will need to
exist at the edge and in the cloud, I think we call generally hybrids, I think, is a reality
that people are now beginning to see, we've been architected that way from the
beginning and have been talking about the advantages of that also from the
beginning. I do feel that some of the recent announcements, we've made make that
more and more real for people. When you talk about the importance of latency or
sovereignty or privacy or security. And in terms of the portfolio we have and how
customers think about it.
For us that is for the Azure "part of the business". You're right, that number for us is
best seen in the server and cloud products KPI. And we've talked about that for aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Keith Weiss
Amy E. Hood
Keith Weiss
Amy E. Hoodlong time and I know people really focus on one or the other, but if you think about
what customers are asking and how customers are contracting and what they're
trying to achieve. It's far more similar to the all up KPI. And the way, I think you
mentioned on our hybrid beneﬁt. The way we've talked about that and what we're
starting to see and I think we mentioned it on the earnings call was one-third of the
customers who have those beneﬁts are starting to use them in Azure. And so if you
think about it, it's really like a funnel, a funnel of opportunity for us with customers,
who are already committed to our platform. To convert and help them start projects
and be successful with Azure as the most cost eﬀective and cloud platform for them.
And I do believe that going forward that opportunity for us is just beginning. And
that again sort of reinforces why I tend to focus more on the server and cloud
product KPI, but I know everybody picks their favorite one.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And the shift -- as people start to use the hybrid cloud identity on credits that
they've purchased into, should investors be worried about a drag on the serving
tools line because people starts kind of shifting their consumption towards Azure or
is that just me being too myopically focused in the bigger picture of serving tools?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I suspect you know my answer on this one because you answered it yourself. It's that
I tend to believe that any view of trying to get a speciﬁc number, any speciﬁc quarter
to say, did the server on-prem number go up or down and the Azure number go up
or down. And is there some large drag or not is probably getting a little myopic in
terms of the overall trend line, which is the overall cloud opportunity represented by
on-prem hybrid and Azure continuing to show the growth in execution that we feel
good about in terms of the explosive TAM and our market opportunity within that
TAM.
And so, I probably would say that, but it's probably also in my nature to view it over a
longer period of time and not get as hung up on a couple of points here or there.
Especially with 606, I can just add some volatility to on-prem numbers that I tend to
not be as focused on as opposed to overall bookings or consumption growth.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Okay. Got it. Speaking -- when I think of the hybrid story of Microsoft. One of the big
beneﬁts, I see is a real competitive diﬀerentiation versus other mega scale cloud
players like AWS or GCP. How much of that translates into sort of the reality you see
in the ground? How much of a competitive advantage is it having? A really strong
story on both sides of the equation in the cloud and on-premise environments? And
are the other cloud vendors starting to make any inroads in the competitive
environment. Are they becoming fuller story via partnerships or some of the new
products, they have out in on-premise environments?

Amy E. HoodI think, this has been incredibly competitive market for a long time and so I'm not
sure that I would characterize it as any diﬀerent than it's always been an incredibly
competitive market with very large, well-funded competitors. I think in general, the
advantages we have are not and we talked some about hybrid as being an
advantage. There's also unique attributes of the Azure cloud that are diﬀerentiated
Arc and Sentinel. We have a lot of examples of examples of those stack synapse, if
you go down the list. But it's also a real advantage in terms of our focus and our
enterprise sales force which I'm incredibly proud of their execution, our global
presence, our focus on the locations of our data centers. How far we are on that
journey in terms of having a global presence that matters to global companies, and
to local companies. I would add, I think we've done a nice job of making it easier for
companies to make a choice and a commitment to us. And I also think the fullness of
our commercial cloud oﬀerings matter. It's not just Azure, for example, it's the
conversations, we're able to have with customers around their total digital
transformation by workload by solution and it stems across Microsoft 365 dynamics
as well as Azure in terms of this really mattering to customers and relevance and
adding industry layers and I feel quite good about that.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So if we think about the Azure growth and what is driving that growth. I think
on our side of the sense there has been a perspective that is primarily been kind of
workload driven, just more and more people moving to the public cloud, and
starting to use some of those lower level services computing, storage and whatnot.
And what we're trying to assess is, to what degree have the adoption of higher level
services and sort of that ASP side of the equation, start to impact the equation to
start to bolster growth. What kind of help, could you give us some sort of
understanding that equation of where we are in terms of workload growth versus
ARPU growth, if you will, against those units.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes, I think we talked a bit about the past couple of quarters, I believe, in terms of the
growth of what we would call premium services. The best way, and there is a lots of
them, but if you think about premium services tend to have those attributes rates
where it's higher ARPU. They tend to also have higher margin, margin comes from
diﬀerentiation of course and you can see that as one of the core drivers of our
especially IaaS and PaaS growth of course in the past few quarters. And because of
the consumption based if -- that happens when it's being used, right, as opposed to
simply being contracted. So I think we feel quite good about the momentum of the
premium services in particular.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Any of those premium services in particular that you would point to being real hits, if
you will.

Amy E. HoodRight, I think if you looked across our data story is a place that I would, in particular,
highlight great progress over the past year. And I think we're pretty excited about
what the next year has to oﬀer.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. One last question on Azure, and then we'll go on to the rest of the product
portfolio.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I'm excited, because we have so many other thing that we can talk about.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Well, we double-booked you for two keynotes in a row, so you'll hit through all of --
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
The ﬁrst one is apparently for Azure, which is great.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So, I'm going to come back to margin. So in terms of overall cloud gross margins,
you guys have seen remarkable improvement and really nice trend line there. If we
drill down just kind of the Azure side of the equation. You've talk to us a lot about
sort of the scaling equation. That as you scale, you're going to get better and better
margins. How much more room is it there left, particularly if we think about the
consumption side of the business. When I was sort of in Redmond talking to some of
your more technically oriented guys, they are really excited about the ability to drive
more eﬃciencies out of power cooling and CPU eﬃciencies and whatnot. On the
other side of the equation, like you're saying premium services should come with a
higher gross margin. So how should we think about and the ability for those gross
margins continue improving on a go-forward basis.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
My feelings aren't hurt that you called other people more technical. But I will answer
the question anyway, which is, you're right, is that there is a couple of mechanisms to
improve commercial cloud gross margin speciﬁcally will talk about Azure in this
question. You're right, we see a number of factors and improve that. You can talk
through the power in the cooling. We talk about the design of data centers, we
could talk about chips, we could talk about many levels of eﬃciency on the technical
side and putting not just a hardware eﬃciencies but also software improvements
take advantage of hardware improvements.
And I still feel like we have opportunities as the team walked you through to make
improvements on that front. So in addition to that, of course and Azure, as weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Keith Weiss
Amy E. Hoodcontinue to see premium services become a larger portion of the mix, that also
provides some opportunity. And so overall, I do think on what I would call sort of the
core Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption. There is still room for gross margin
improvement and we're still focused on making that happen. Although with time, of
course it gets harder and harder to have those improvements. But as we get closer, I
would say it's a ideal state.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Okay. As an analyst, one of the interesting things that I'm always looking out for is
areas of the story where the company is talking a lot about it, and investors aren't.
And trying to explore those GAAP. Microsoft 365 I think is one of those areas that
every conversation I have with management from Microsoft. Microsoft 365 comes up
a lot. It never comes up in investor conversations. Can you help us understand that
Microsoft 365 motion, how that sort of cements a stronger kind of deep relationship
with the customer, and maybe just for the help of the audience, like what it is.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah, I actually think part of that lack of conversation at the investor community is of
course, community is, of course, that is, in many ways my fault. We talk a lot about
each of the component in our KPIs and there's not really a KPI we point you to that
says Microsoft 365 X. And so it doesn't give you the same mechanisms to have that
discussion. And so, I consider that good feedback to me to really consider how to
make that a more transparent opportunity. Really what Microsoft 365 is the solution
that take and brings together. Oﬃce 365, our EMS story, as well as Windows
commercial. And it's not simply a bundle, it's about innovation done at the core, that
is shared amongst those products that get sold within that bundle.
And the reason, we spend a lot of time talking about it. It is really is the product, that
we lead with our customers and it is in fact their language with us increasingly over
what really a modern and secure workplace and collaborative environment and
experience for users looks like. So we would call that thing that I just said, this
product Microsoft 365. And you see its impact on lots of ways, and I think that's what
you're referring to. We've said recently that 25% of our Oﬃce 365 contracts are
executed this way. And really, what that's meant to do is to tell people, wow, this is
really the hero motion for us in terms of engaging with our customers and the
conversation they want to have with us.
And so you'll see it obviously in our Oﬃce 365 results. You've seen some impact in
terms of ARPU, it helps ARPU. You've seen it in our EMS results in terms of the
number of subscribers. Right. That would be another way, you would see it. And
ﬁnally, you'll see it in Windows commercial that's been a segment KPI that we talk a
lot about. I'm not sure everybody realized how big it was. We've gotten a lot of
feedback frankly from investors in many of our buy-side conversation saying we sort
of lost track of how big each of the Windows components are."And Windows
Commercial is now 30% of our overall Windows business" to give you a sense of the
momentum and a lot of that frankly is also because of the integration into the SKU
and the value in terms of our sales processes. And so this is a place that obviouslyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Keith Weiss
Amy E. Hood
Keith Weiss
Amy E. Hoodwe're quite optimistic about, more based on customer signal then obviously my
ability to sell it as an opportunity to this group.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So last week the RSA Conference was in San Francisco. You guys were hosting
meetings there. And it was a fascinating conversation with Microsoft security
because ﬁve years ago, the secure discussion on Microsoft is all about creating
better security for your own products. It is almost a marketing spend, if you would
like. We want people to be more comfortable using Microsoft. We're now Microsoft
is in the leader quadrant in 5 Gartner Magic Quadrants. And there's over $1 billion
you guys spent in terms of R&D on security. And you could point to some real
validation points on the income statement of where you're starts to see that. And one
of them was in store stats on Microsoft 365. This is the security people talking, but
they're saying now was the primary driver of getting guys to go from an oﬃce 365 to
a Microsoft 365 or to adopt this windows commercial services.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
So, I think security is and I would say, it's not as though there is clear value to
customers by selling a secure products. And so to your point, that is an incredibly
important part of our value proposition across our services. But as you saw at RSA,
we've been realizing that based on customer feedback, the opportunity for us to
solve more than that problem. And so we have seen real signal in terms of some of
our new products. I think we're proud of the progress, we've made and you are
seeing it. It is one of -- I would say, key value propositions across Microsoft 365 is
some of the security value that you've talking about across the Gartner Magic
Quadrants. And really what I think about just security. It's security and compliance.
And underpinning that, of course, is identity. And so, for us, I think it's a pretty broad
view of the opportunity that we have to help customers in that space.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Drilling down a little bit into Oﬃce 365 and in particular the commercial side
of Oﬃce 365. You guys have spoken about having over 200 million monthly active
Oﬃce 365 users now. We think about that in relation to the original base, that you
guys set up of how big the commercial base was. You are pretty far into the
opportunity and deﬁnitely pass the 50% point, which gets investors worry. We always
worry about the back half of the slope. But there is oﬀsets, obviously ARPU is all one
oﬀset but the F1 SKU and the ability to expand out the TAM with sort of the lower
price SKU has helped user growth a lot. How should investors think about the Ps and
Qs if you will, of Oﬃce 365. Is there still a lot of opportunity to expand out that base
and sort of keep that user count growing very well on a going-forward basis or
should we be shifting our focus mostly towards ARPU expansion and sort of the E3
to E5 SKU or the M5 SKU with Microsoft 365?

Page 9 of 14Keith Weiss
Amy E. Hood
Keith WeissLet me try to simplify a bit with all the code names that we use for SKUs a bit. If I
were to say, how are we thinking about internally our opportunity we are still clearly
seeing opportunity in both the number and our opportunity to grow installed base
as well as our opportunity to grow. So and when you think about where we are, we
have moved a long way through that, what I would say, initial view that we had of
moving existing customers towards the future. But I really think what's been in some
ways more impressive to your point is how we've actually grown the installed base at
the same time. And there are lots of ways that happened and you brought up
frontline worker SKUs. These are really people we have never touched with our
products before. And I would say that it's been something we learn with time and
you would say wait, is it just mobile opportunity. It is a lot of mobile opportunity, but
is also beyond that in terms of the work environment and where can we bring some
of the beneﬁts to workers whether they sit every day at a large PC or desktop unit or
whether they work through an environment and have intermittent experiences with
ambient computing. And for us, we will continue to invest in building the installed
base.
And you can see that even in some of the products that we brought to market more
recently, whether you think about teams is really being a mobile ﬁrst experience. Or
whether you think about the Oﬃce app that people see now as an integrated
experience on many phones. And I think you'll see that as continue to be a place
where we see opportunity. On ARPU, you're right, there are a bunch of levers that
can help us grow and I tend to think about that and not just the movements up SKUs,
whether that's from one to three to ﬁve or whether that is moving people from oﬃce
up to a more inclusive opportunity with Microsoft 365, all of those remain, I think,
good opportunities for us.
I would say we've been -- we've had a good execution year. In particular, not just on
Microsoft 365 but on E5 which is the SKU that oﬀers a lot more opportunities with
analytics and security endpoints.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And investors, how should we think about Power Platform? Is Power platform
fundamentally extension of the Oﬃce 365 story or is it like, should we think about it
more so an extension of the Azure story, because there's a lot of diﬀerent
components. There's kind of low-code, there's automation. My perspective is more
on the Oﬃcer 365 side is really meant to expand what oﬃce workers could do.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Interesting. I tend to think of it. This -- is I see where your logic is there. For us it's
almost standalone.

For many of the reasons you just mentioned, it really brings together low-code, no-
code, RPA and self-service BI and analytics. And If you think about those, it's got a
fairly unique position across the portfolio and terms of the assets that it brings
together. It of course has a relationship to Azure in terms of it starting in creating
usage from the applications that are built. It absolutely extends for people who have
not felt that they can build and solve business process, problems themselves, the
opportunity to do that. So that's I'm sure the thread you're pulling on with Oﬃce in
terms of it brings relevance and another opportunity for us to engage with the type
of worker that we have historically associated with Oﬃce 365 or Microsoft 365. But it
is quite diﬀerent in terms of solving those problems.
And then of course it relates to dynamics. Dynamics is really fundamentally about
addressing what I think it's just such the early part of the curve on reinventing
business processes as they work today with the vast amounts of data that are
available in a cost-eﬀective manner. And so you can see why for me in particular and
maybe for our company, we would see it is both a large opportunity, something
that's quite nascent and early it's cycle of development and also really something
that brings together other pieces of our commercial cloud and extends it, as an
opportunity that we see is quite early in the cycle.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. I think that's a great segue to Dynamics 365. I think most investors think about
the Dynamics oﬀering just from the CRM context. I think a lot of people overlook, it is
a really broad portfolio solution you have rigor and the entire suite onto the Azure
platform. It is in excess of $2.5 billion business, growing at a pretty good clip. So it's a
real SaaS business. But I still, get the question from investors like one is Microsoft,
going to get real about at. So what's the progress on dynamics that you've seen thus
far. What's the kind of path to making it a bigger part of the Microsoft story on a
going forward basis.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes, this is one where, over 50% of that business is already cloud-based, which I think
people probably don't always realize in terms of that business. You're right, it is far
more than just a sales cloud workload, it goes far beyond that. And in terms of the
modules and the capabilities, it's -- I think probably one of those if not, the leader in
terms of AI enablement of those applications due to the modern platform upon
which it work. And our ability to take into account, many of the other assets that we
have at the company in order to make it world leading. It's a place where we have
spent the year investing a lot more in sales capacity, which we're excited about and
we're excited to have so many people joined the company in order to make that a
reality on a global basis in terms of meeting demand. And this is a place, where I just
think we're in the very early parts of the cycle in terms of what reinventing business
processes will look like for the next decade. So this is certainly a place where I think
my optimism remains high. We did see Dynamics 365 growth accelerate in Q2 on a
larger base of business and we feel like that's in part, both due to the engineeringFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-02

execution.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. One last sort of product division, I want to make sure that we touched on. Was
a Window side of the equation. I think in Windows OEM in particular before COVID-
19, it was a lot of investor anxiety just about the end of life for Windows 7 support and
how we should be thinking about sort of demand ahead of that curve, that
exploration demand on the back side. Any -- we look to as the analog would be sort
of Windows XP. One is that a good analog to look to in terms of sort of the strength
of Windows coming in, the strength of Windows going out or should we be looking
at a diﬀerent template for how Windows OEM trends from here.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think in general, these cycles tend to look similar, but what I would say is this one is
certainly more complicated by a number of things that I'll talk about in a second.
What is diﬀerent about this. Is there still remains quite a bit of opportunity, more than
we saw at this point in the prior cycle. A lot of that exists, where you would expect it
to exist, which is small and medium business segments. Not unusual, but it means
that we do have some room to continue to grow and likely means that the curve will
look diﬀerent than last time in terms of its shape.
Now, then you add to it two complicating factors, one of which you brought up,
which has been chip supply, which has impacted some of the growth rates over the
past ﬁt and then the second one, which is the supply chain. Currently, in China in
terms of bindings and production. And so those will -- and as we've talked about will
impact the quarterly results. And so I'm not sure it will look like the exact same curve
in terms of the prior cycle, not just because we have a little bit more left to go. Than
we have had in prior cycles, but also because it's been a bit more volatile due to
those two issues as we work through them.

Got it. Bringing into a broader kind of gross margin discussion. Calendar '19, we saw
a really nice expansion in overall gross margins throughout the year. One of the
investor concerns is that a lot of those tailwinds become headwinds spread, product
cycles around Windows XP, Windows XP obviously, really high-risk margins. Product
cycles around Windows Server and SQL Server are all sort of good tailwinds for you
guys. In the prior year, that are high gross margin business, those data away. And
then on the reverse side of the equation, you have new surface product coming out,
which is a lower gross margin. But really Xbox is a big one people worried about in
the back half of the year, there's going to be a new console cycle which could
depress gross margins. How should investors be framing up just like the gross
margin expansion potential for calendar 20 versus calendar '19.

Keith WeissThere are two things and I'll walk you. And I think you've mentioned numbers that
we can walk through from a technically how does it impact margins. But if you step
backwards for a second, in terms of maybe how, I and the management team --
Microsoft, think about this. It tends to be quite diﬀerent than the nature of that
question, which is we're excited about launching the world's most powerful console
at holiday with Xbox Series X. We're excited because launching consoles has a very
good lifetime value associated with it in terms of ROI. And in terms of what it means
to the opportunity that we see a gaming to really bring together content and
community and cloud on a go-forward basis. And so we look and say, well, that's an
exciting time for the company to be a leader in opportunity in a market that we're
excited and committed to.
So the fact that the initial year of any console launch it doesn't help gross margin. Is
not something I take into account, as I think about funding the gaming business to
do what I think it can do, and the importance it has to Microsoft. So yes, technically,
next year, we will launch of console, it will impact gross margins because we will
have higher revenue growth in that segment, because we have a console launch.
And so then separately, when we think about the impact of selling more high margin
in quarter recognition product, which are things like OEM or Windows and SQL
server. And it's somewhat of a similar logic, which is I feel great, that we're executing
well on end of support it builds a great funnel for us, as we think about transition to
the cloud for customers and helping them on their hybrid journey. And so does that
create some headwind for us, it does at the same time, I tend to focus more on gross
margin execution by product which means, are we building and driving the most
eﬀective execution by products for their GM. And that mix is simply a by-product of
execution and timelines. And so I thought especially good about our gross margin
by product execution.
Whether you're talking about the cloud, whether you're talking about our on-prem
products, whether you're talking about gaming and the responsibility each of our
leaders have shown to make that happen. And so for me, I think you're right. You
pick the right to mixes that will create headwinds on the percentage but the
optimism in terms of cash ﬂow generation or actually dollar growth is probably
more, how I would frame how we think about it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. One last one for me, then I'm going to open it up to the audience for a couple
of last questions. On the OpEx side of the equation, for the past four years, we've
executed extremely well to growing OpEx below the radar for us gross proﬁt dollar
growth, which is what I should be focused on.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah. Thank you.

Keith WeissAnd a lot of that comes from shifting investments from lower productivity areas into
the investment areas that should yield more durable over time. Is there still room
within sort of Microsoft for that motion. And can you still sort of keep that pace of
OpEx growth below gross proﬁt dollar growth.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Well, I do think you've obviously seen us accelerate OpEx growth as we've seen an
opportunity to do so and where we feel like there is an opportunity be good revenue
and proﬁt growth. So I don't really think about solving for a number, I think about
solving for opportunity and where we're well positioned to execute that tends to be
how I think about allocating dollars every day. And I think in some way is really the
mark of a healthy discussion and a healthy leadership team is their ability to look and
say, gosh, is there a better way to execute, what we're executing on. Should we
merge teams, should we move resources and having that be part of the every day
conversation that's not led by ﬁnance, but led by having the right conversation. And I
think you're seeing that, whether it's how we thought about building Azure over time
or how we've thought about sharing resources and investment that we've done in AI
across diﬀerent groups. A lot more shared resourcing, so that we can put great
leaders together to innovate faster. So for me, it's much more of a positive culture
statement around innovating with customer solution in mind and the best way to do
that, far more guides, how I think about investment than I think people may realized
it is a landing with the right and best ability to achieve high ROI and solving for a
number is not something I tend to do in that way.
So, I feel good about our execution; the growth opportunity, the market broadly for
us.
