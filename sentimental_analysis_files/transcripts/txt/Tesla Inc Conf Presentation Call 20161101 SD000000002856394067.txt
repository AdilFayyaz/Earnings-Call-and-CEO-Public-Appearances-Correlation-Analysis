Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the webcast to discuss Tesla pending
acquisition of SolarCity.

I would now like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, Mr. Jeﬀ
Evanson. You may now begin.

We're going to start this call directly with Q&A based upon the blog post that we
posted.
(Caller Instructions)
Our forward-looking statement here is, during our call, we will discuss our business
outlook and make forward-looking statements. These are based on our predictions
and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could diﬀer materially due to a
number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent
ﬁlings with the SEC. Now, Donovan, why don't we go to the ﬁrst question please?
Questions And Answers
Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank
{BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Thanks. I was hoping to ask two clariﬁcations. One is on your comments about $500
million cash contributed from SolarCity to Tesla's balance sheet over the next three
years. Are you referring to free cash ﬂow over the next three-year period? What
exactly was assumed there?
And also if you can, just clarify the comment you made about recurring cash ﬂows. If
you can just remind us what, as of September, the present value was of those
recurring cash ﬂows. And what is the current sensitivity to discount rate assumptions?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
This is Lyndon. First of all, the question, the $500 million that we mentioned there,
that is our forecast. And that does not include any of the synergies. It's just our direct
forecast that was in the S-4. That is essentially a tax generation.
Free cash ﬂow, however, when you're looking at GAAP and lease accounting is a
term that doesn't quite apply there. So it would just be straight oﬀ cash generation
from the business --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The bank balance gets $500 million bigger.

Q - Ben Kallo
A - Elon MuskIn terms of the net present value of the systems that we have under management
right now, just so for those listening to understand the business, when we install
solar systems, we collect a recurring cash ﬂow stream from the customers for 20 or
30 years depending on the contract. We incur the cost immediately. And then we
recognize the revenue over (inaudible) 20-year period. So if you look at the MPV of
that number as of Q2, the number was just a little over $4 billion. We will be
releasing the number of (inaudible) on Wednesday, next Wednesday.
{BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Okay. And the sensitivity to discount rate assumptions?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
That is using a 6% discount rate assumption. If you actually go to our website and
look at the earnings line, we do a sensitivity at a 6% and an 8% and at a 4% to give
you the diﬀerent numbers.
{BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you.
{BIO 17156672 <GO>}
Also (inaudible) a bit careful because there's an earning's call next week as Lyndon
mentioned. We don't want to preempt that call. So we can answer things at a broad
brush-stroke level. But we can't preempt the earnings call.
{BIO 1528384 <GO>}

Hi. Elon, Lyndon. Sorry about the background noise. As you look forward with capital
allocation, how do we think about capital Tesla versus SolarCity? And I asked this a
little bit last time but Panasonic in Buﬀalo, how do we think about their capital
contribution. Thank you.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I don't want to speak for Panasonic. But I'm pretty optimistic about that. Obviously,
we have a great relationship with Panasonic. And the discussions with them have
gone very well. The way things work at Tesla is Panasonic makes the battery cell. But
a bunch of suppliers before that make (inaudible) materials that (inaudible) and
whatnot that we're also working to integrate into the gigafactory. But they (inaudible)
everything past the cell level. And we would expect something similar in Buﬀalo.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-01

Page 4 of 20Q - Ben Kallo

Q - Ben Kallo

A - Jason Wheeler
A - Jeﬀ EvansonThat is the point of action. Most of the capital necessary for that to take place is
already there. It has already been funded. So I think it is pretty small capital or
climate going forward to get things going on the cell level.
A little more in the innovation into the (inaudible) ﬁles and (inaudible) structures put
down on the roof. We're not really (technical diﬃculty). I'm pretty optimistic about
how it's going to turn out, though. I think it's really (conservational).
And just a general comment, it's been incredibly well-received on the consumer
level. Customers positive. There's quite a few naysayers on the natural front, some of
the (free cash funds) and whatnot. But I will just say, okay, for those that predict that
outcome, how good have they been at predicting the outcome for Tesla in the past?
And if there has been no formerly -- if Tesla's batting average was zero, you should
really question whether the future predictions are going to be better, at least the
evidence that's (inaudible).
{BIO 16897436 <GO>}
I had one more. My batting average I think is better than zero, versus (inaudible). But
Panasonic, the one big partner with --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Can you speak up because (inaudible) can hear you.
{BIO 16897436 <GO>}
You have Panasonic with two big projects. Do you have another big partner? Or how
has that aﬀected the Panasonic working on both of those things? Thank you.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I'm not sure I understand that question. But Panasonic has been a great partner for
Tesla for many years, for almost a decade. And things are going really well at the
battery gigafactory. We believe quite strongly that the combination of the SolarCity's
technology on the cellular front added to Panasonic's cell technology will make it the
most eﬃcient and ultimately cheapest solar cell in the world, just as it is with the
battery cell. We have the best cell in the world. And also the cheapest cell.
{BIO 19481227 <GO>}
This is Jason, just one thing I would add on. Capital needs for the business, there is
always trade-oﬀ between cash generation and growth. And I think what we
demonstrated in our Q3 results is that we are really focused just on the Tesla side on
strengthening our cash generation and proﬁtability from our current products.
(inaudible) self-fund our future growth to the largest extent possible. So that's how
we're been thinking about.

{BIO 5762430 <GO>}
Good afternoon, guys. I apologize, I'm a simple auto analyst. So I'm going to ask
some basic questions maybe here, or they might seem basic. As we think about the
asset value on the SolarCity side as well as the cash ﬂow, I am just curious how those
things can change. And really from two diﬀerent angles.
One, as you guys innovate on form factor as well as performance on the solar roofs,
which you seem to be doing a great job on, does that impact the existing value of
the asset base that is installed? Then second, as houses change hands, how does the
contract or the payment stream change over to the new owner? I'm just trying to
understand recourse and how those cash ﬂows change with that kind of change.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
This is Lyndon. These are two total separate market segments. The customer who's
looking at buying a new roof should absolutely look at a solar roof.
Customers who have a roof. And there's ﬁve, 10 years left on roof, it would not make
sense to buy a new roof. There is still a lot of value left in your old roof. So we still see
the retroﬁt market being a very active market for us and to continue to grow. Today,
we actually don't address for the most part any customer that has a really old roof
because the buying cycle is they're going to have to get a new roof and solar all at
once. And we have not been able to facilitate that.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Especially, it's like there's this (inaudible) there's a huge database of customers, sorry
for using the word huge. But a very large database of customers who were rejected
for having solar panels on the roof because their roofs are basically too old and in
need of replacement. And it doesn't make sense to put solar panels on a roof that is
nearing end of life.
So there are some groups replace every 20 years. Anything with less than ﬁve years,
even maybe seven years left on the roof, it's really not going to make economic
sense to put (inaudible) in solar panels because they're going to need a new roof.
And older is also more susceptible to leaks. There's actually a huge database of
high-value leads for the putting on a solar glass tile roof.
{BIO 5762430 <GO>}
I apologize, I meant like if you installed a solar roof. And two years later, you sell your
house. And you had a 20-year lease or loan with you guys, who is then responsible
for that. And how does that recourse work?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-01

So let's just separate the whole roof as versus just our standard business. Our
standard business, at the size we are right now, we have about 20, 25 people move
every day. Never have we ever prevented a customer from selling their house.
New customers like it. They see it as a cheaper source of energy. All the installation is
already done. So the transfer rate is extremely high. And that is why we have a good
credit underwriting and able to raise long-term ﬁnancing against (inaudible).
Transferring is really easy. That happens every single day.
With a solar roof, it probably would not fall into a lease or (inaudible) purchase
agreement. There should be a straightforward loan. And in that case, there is no
asset ownership challenge. You just transfer the ownership to the new homeowner.
You don't have to think about the --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's like buying a roof really. You are buying a roof that happens to generate energy
and reduce your utility bill.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 5762430 <GO>}
It's two transactions then essentially, right? The house and the roof, right? Because
you are assuming two loans.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
No. No. We try to design it as one transaction.
{BIO 5762430 <GO>}
Okay. (Multiple Speakers)
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
To the existing mortgage or a second mortgage, something like that. (inaudible)
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Is just like if you did a kitchen remodel or like, let's say you (deleted) all your
appliances to be way more energy eﬃcient, eﬀectively reducing your utility bill. That
is an asset that the house has that is transferred with the new owner.

A - Lyndon RiveGot you. And theoretically, you guys might get paid oﬀ at that point. Just a follow up,
on the asset base the $5.2 billion, as you innovate, what happens -- or what is the
implication for the value of the assets that you are carrying?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
I actually see it as a massive upsell opportunity. We have 300,000 customers in
(inaudible). Powerwall 2 is now out. And it's a actually very, very simple retroﬁt
procedure for us to go back to the 300,000 customers and upsell them a Powerwall
2.
So as I actually see that (multiple speakers) -- I'm sorry? I as see it over time, it's to
continue to innovate with other energy-related products. And as the customer count
increases, we're able to derive additional economic value by providing additional
energy products to our customers with Powerwall 2 being (inaudible) (comparable)
to that.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think there is like maybe too much complexity. This is like way simpler than it may
sound. It's just like you made your house better by having a solar roof or Powerwall.
It adds to the asset value of the house. A few (inaudible) for cash or loan. It can be
provided as a lease. If it is provided as a lease, then somebody could pay that oﬀ at
the time of selling their house if they want or transfer it to the new owner.
{BIO 5762430 <GO>}
Then just lastly, another simple question, as we look at the sales of all three products
together, the roof, a Tesla car. And a Powerwall, how many of those triple plays do
you think you'll be able to sell relative to what you are doing right now. And really,
over time, will that be just be 100% of your sales?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I don't know about 100% bleeding over. But think over time, I think most customers
are going to opt for all three. And even if they don't opt for all three all at once, they,
over time, I think they will.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
I think up front, the solar and storage will be opted in at a very high percentage, very
high percentage.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. And then --

It's like if SolarCity has got 300,000 customers, in (installed and consult) customers,
Tesla has around 170,000, approaching 180,000 customers all in. So there's a pretty
signiﬁcant base to cross sell product there.
{BIO 5762430 <GO>}
Thank you.
Vishal Shah, Deutsche Bank
Thank you. Good afternoon. This is Rachel on for Vishal. We have a question about
the revenue synergies and the cash generation. So on the solar side, the existing
assets, do you guys think about the existing asset maybe generating additional
revenues than the traditional standard sense in terms of the utility services, solar plus
storage. And some additional services and revenue synergies that you guys outlined
today?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
So that in the number that we've put in the S-4, the cash generation, from SolarCity,
just as a reminder, that was a plan that we created as a standalone. It does not
include the synergies. And this asset is standalone. So what's the synergy? That
number is conservative and actually will increase.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I do think that there are additional products that I would like to bring out that I think
people will ﬁnd counterintuitive at ﬁrst and then ﬁnd it obvious because this seems
to be the pattern. It's counterintuitive. It's stupid. It's never going to work. Okay, now
it's obvious.
It's like remarkable how the same people who thought it was -- it would never work
then think it's obvious. The same people. It's crazy.

The State of New York that has, I think that's all (inaudible) if mentioned. They've
allocated about $(770) million towards the building of new equipment. And the
equipment is in progress. So a lot of that --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The majority of it should arrive by the end of next year.
{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
So how much has arrived already at this point?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
I think it's -- so I'd put it at maybe 15%, 20% or so. I don't know exact number oﬀ my
heart. The (inaudible) ﬁnancial value I think is around that number, around 15% or
20%.
{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
How much of it's been ordered at this point? And would you expect the equipment
set to change materially as you start to layer in a new partner into that project.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
I don't think that changes will -- I don't think that there are any material changes. The
approaches that both Silevo and Panasonic have for these cells are the same base
cell design. And then there's a components of each of the technology (inaudible)
that we're going to take and create a hybrid version of each of them. So yes, we
expect all of the equipment to be perfectly applicable to the new cell process.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
But it's pretty exciting. I am more highly comfortable (inaudible) we will have the
best cell at the lowest price, which is -- just as we have the best battery cell at the
lowest price. There is a high (inaudible) cell at the lowest price.
{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
And so what do you think that price really is, Elon, if we're selling into US right now
at $0.40 a watt for those modules, are you guys going to be able to reach $0.30 or
$0.32 a watt as you start to ramp up at scale?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
So you're talking about (inaudible) at Tesla. When we look at it, we look at our cost
compared to the price that we could ultimately get it from. And we're comparing --
your price is commodity, solar panels with low eﬃciency. We think we can get to that
price point of the $0.40 a watt over time (as watts go). But with panel eﬃciencies.
And they're 22%, eventually approaching 24%.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-01

A - Lyndon Rive
Q - Brian Johnson{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
That is a very important distinction because you have to consider the labor cost of
putting the panels down. So low-eﬃciency panels require a lot more labor, a lot
more other material in order to get to the savings power output. So if you have a 15%
panel or a 16% panel compared to, say, a 20% to a 22% panel, it means you need
50% more area. So all the other (bounds) of the system starts to get (against) labor,
transport, logistics. It needs to be weighted to the cost per watt. (Multiple Speakers)
That's a very signiﬁcant factor.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Yes, just like conservatively, the direct cost reductions for high-eﬃciency panels are
estimated around $0.15 a watt, inclusive of labor, mounting hardware. And so on. But
also there's -- you've got to think about the diﬀerentiation in the eyes of the
customer as well. If we have a superior product, they will always pick up. So the
diﬀerentiation I think makes a diﬀerence as well.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Exactly. You don't want compete just on price. That is not a good -- that does not
make for good business.
{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
I'm just trying to put some metrics around it. So maybe we can revisit it on the
SolarCity call given we are short time today. Thanks so much, guys.
Brian Johnson, Barclays
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Yes. Good afternoon. Have a couple of questions on the debt side of the combined
company. And understanding, of course, we will see more when SolarCity
(inaudible). So the ﬁrst, if we think about your statement that the recurring cash ﬂows
exceed nonrecourse debt by $2 billion with a 6% discount rate, how much of that $2
billion is from the renewal assumptions for after year 20, which seems to have a
gross value of $4.8 billion?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
So I'm looking at Q2 numbers. Your contracted number is $3.1 billion. And then your
uncontracted number is $900 million. So total of $4 billion. Then your debt on that is
$1.8 billion, which leaves us $2.2 billion.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Okay so it would be about $1.1 billion excluding the rentals. Second, related to that,
given what you've shown with the solar roof, how do you think that's going to aﬀectFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-01

A - Elon Muskthe renewal rate on the SolarCity panel leases? I know it's 20 years out. But since we
are dealing with MPVs going out 30 years --
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
It's a high probability that many of our customers actually may need to replace their
roof within that 20-year period. If that happens today, we just remove the panels. We
just put it back on. Remember, the panels essentially pay for (inaudible) customers.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
They could be repurposed, too.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Yes. They could be repurposed. We do expect that, depending on the customer's
roof, that a healthy percentage renew.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Okay. And third question --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Just to be clear, it's going to take a long time to really deploy solar to that scale. But
ultimately, there's on an order of 70 million, 80 million residential -- well, take North
America including Canada and Mexico, it's a big number, maybe 150 million --
something like that -- roofs. So just the sheer scale of that is mind-boggling. And yes.
So and that is just North America.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
I'm just getting at, some of these customers, if -- it deﬁnitely takes a while. But if solar
roof is successful, when the renewals come up in 20 years, that may be a better
option for the customer than leaving the panels on an aging, leaking roof.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
It certainly will be for some number of customers. But then we will take the panels
and put them on, say, a commercial installation or put them on some other
customer's roof. So essentially, you have a trade-in value of your roof.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It is sub zero. Like those panels still working ﬁne.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
The really key point, you understand, is it generates electricity. So there is real value
in those panels.

A - Lyndon RiveEven if somebody says that they want to go to solar glass roof, we just take the
panels and the electrical equipment supporting the old-style panels. And we reuse
them on other houses. It will take a long time for everyone, say, wants to do a solar
roof. It's ultimately -- but yes, not be everyone.
Then the panels are still going to make sense for any kind of ﬂat roof installation
where you don't have -- where things aren't visible. So any commercial insulation
where it's on a ﬂat rooftop or a residential situation where it's a ﬂat rooftop, there is
really no point in having it from an as beautiful an aesthetic standpoint. Nobody can
see it.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
And ﬁnal question relating to debt, SolarCity has converts. My reading of those,
which may be wrong, is they are payable in cash given where the stock price is and
where the conversion comes out to.
A, is that right? B, will you downstream cash? C, can you actually convert that to settle
with additional shares. And how should we think about as, from the Tesla level, the
reﬁnancing that SolarCity? And actually, as part of that, can you conﬁrm that it's
going to be a D sub and that Tesla is not going to be guaranteeing the debt of the
new SolarCity sub post acquisition?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
SolarCity, certainly on any of the debt obligation, of course. But I'm not sure what I
mean.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Well I guess, one, technically, will you still be -- is the plan to keep SolarCity as a
bankruptcy remote subsidiary of Tesla as your current ABL seems to indicate?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
No. This would be one company. But I think there's really -- I see zero chance of
SolarCity going bankrupt. Zero.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Right. So then will Tesla downstream money to pay to reﬁnance, or will SolarCity be
out reﬁnancing the converts on its own?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It is going to be one company.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Just to address the actual payment of that convert. So remember, this in two year's
time, the company generates roughly $200 million a quarter of MPV of future value.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-01

Securitization of selling the ﬁnancing, the future cash ﬂows, either through debt or

Solar bonds (inaudible).
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Solar bonds. But when I'm talking about the --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's a core piece of the puzzle.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
When I'm talking about the $4 billion. And then we're talking about the $1.8 billion,
that is not corporate debt. That is asset ﬁnancing, just to be real clear on that.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's nonrecourse as to ﬁnancing.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
So if you're looking at the run rate of the company, when you're looking at the net
present value that we generate every single quarter, it's roughly $200 million. So just
maintaining that run rate, we will be able to monetize enough cash ﬂows to
essentially cover the converts.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-01

{BIO 19481227 <GO>}
This is Jason. Just to add one point on top of that. So SolarCity has 2018 converts.
We also have 2018 converts. And our original issuance on our converts was $660
million. We've actually paid down more than $(415) million of that convert. And we've
done that in the last 90 days. So we have signiﬁcantly derisked 2018 in the capital
structure (inaudible) over the last quarter.
{BIO 7256455 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks.
{BIO 17513488 <GO>}
All right, everyone. We are at the 30-minute mark here. Do you want to take a couple
more questions?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We could do a few more.
{BIO 17513488 <GO>}
Donovan, let's take the next question.
Charlie Anderson, Dougherty & Company
{BIO 16577213 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. One of the comments in the blog post on revenue
synergies was that, quote, customers have overlapping product interest. I wonder if
you have any statistics to back that up, whether it be Model 3 reservation holders
overlap with maybe the SolarCity pipeline. Anything there would be helpful. Thanks.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We've not surveyed our customers on this. So it would be somewhat speculative. But
-- I don't know, Lyndon, if you have any idea on that.

Q - Joseph SpakI think the overlap on Model 3 quite dramatic. And the -- as an asset, I think there's a
fair amount about that. But probably not as much as you will see in the Model 3.
{BIO 16577213 <GO>}
Then as a follow up, I wondered if you can maybe compare and contrast the outlook
for Tesla energy with and without SolarCity, considering there's probably two
diﬀerent outcomes there potentially from your perspective.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
As I've expressed before, I'm pretty optimistic about where the road is going. And
the early work. So far, can (inaudible) favor. But (inaudible) be quite (inaudible) if that
didn't turn out to be the case. But we'll just have a more (inaudible) product oﬀering
where we would be selling batteries and then trying --
So SolarCity would be selling solar systems. They wouldn't be well integrated; they
wouldn't be sold as a package. We really wouldn't have a good basis for favoring
SolarCity because they'd be a separate company. So it would be a -- forced into an
arms-length situation.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
It actually makes it harder.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's very diﬃcult. We went through this earlier this year with, say, the (Hawaii) utility
deal where a combined solar battery system went through us to (inaudible). Had to
go through this long process of approval verifying it's an ongoing transaction.
Slowed down the whole thing.
There is no way we can scale that. We're going to do over time hundreds of utility-
level solar battery installations. We want this to assume it's an integrated system,
both at the utility level, commercial level, at the consumer level. And it is just very
unwieldy to do so as two separate companies.
{BIO 16577213 <GO>}
Thanks so much.

New generation of cash, yes.
{BIO 17457170 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks. Then to follow up on the last point, if for some reason the deal didn't
go through, would you look to set up a partnership or a joint venture to sell the solar
storage combination or potentially even look for multiple partnerships?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I don't think we can really do a joint venture. I hate joint ventures. I think they rarely
work. And I'm not sure we have a good basis for doing so unless we are one
company, I mean (inaudible) jointly. But we -- working with heterogeneous
companies. And it would be the worst product, worst experience for the end user.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS
{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Hi. it's Julien here. Good afternoon. So question, can you comment real quickly
around the remaining obligations to New York in terms of the $5 billion of the 10
years. Just comment, is that something that would be contemplated as being kept at
the SolarCity-Tesla level under any Panasonic deal, or was that something that was
negotiated as part of the Panasonic oﬀ-take? How do you think about that?

excess of that number over the 10-year period. None of these relationships are really
going to aﬀect it what one way or another.
{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Just to make sure I heard you right, you are still conﬁdent you can hit that number. It
still remains with the company. But even pro forma for any deal you guys engage
with with Panasonic, you still feel comfortable.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Absolutely.

Philip Shen, ROTH Capital Partners
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Let's take maybe one last question here.
{BIO 15211204 <GO>}
Thanks for squeezing me in here. Why did key members of the Silevo team leave so
soon after the acquisition and ahead of the commercial ramp up?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So yes, there was one member of the Silevo team. And I think we were, to be honest,
scattered in a diﬀerent direction. We still maintain a good relationship with him. But
yes, for a variety of diﬀerent reasons, we were just wanting to take it in a diﬀerent
direction. But it has nothing to do with our planned ramp necessarily.
{BIO 15211204 <GO>}
I think you addressed this earlier. But you continue to plan to move forward with the
Silevo process, or do you expect to ﬁnd -- I think you mentioned a hybrid cell, if
that's possible, between Silevo and HIP, the hit cell that Panasonic produces? And if
that is the case, do you plan on (inaudible) making them a hybrid? At a high level,
can you explain how that will happen?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
We basically bring the best learnings from both of the teams. I will give you an
example. So Silevo has perfected a heterojunction cell using a six-inch wafer. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-01

on six inch and apply that to the learnings that Panasonic has achieved over the
years scaling heterojunction cells to gigawatts and beyond.
{BIO 15211204 <GO>}
Great. And as it relates to the solar roof, a number of companies have tried to pursue
solar shingles over the past number of years, Dow, Energy Conversion Devices, et
cetera. And they have all come and gone. What are you doing fundamentally that is
diﬀerent. And what are your cost targets for the solar shingles. And what is the timing
of those costs target?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Dude, you just through in three questions after I said that was the last one.
{BIO 15211204 <GO>}
Thanks, Elon. We deﬁnitely appreciate it. And I know there are lots of people
interested in the answers to these questions. So deﬁnitely appreciate it.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
First of all, I have never seen a solar roof that I would actually want, have you? Even
one? I haven't.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Maybe the Dow ones, all those ones that they have -- aesthetically, they look --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
They're worse than a normal roof. Every one of them that I've seen is worse than a
normal roof without exception. So unless you're going to beat no roof on aesthetics,
why bother? So none of them did that.
Then just the -- particularly, attention to detail, the aesthetics, the integration to the
cell with the right type of glass, it's just always been done poorly. I just know a single
case where it has been done well.
And I've been really quite doing that for a while. I have solar panels on my roof. But
they are in an area which is hard to see. So my roof is a French slate roof. So that's
one of the styles I wanted to use, like, could we make a roof that looks like French
slate that I could replace my entire roof with and it would be aesthetically better. And
(technical diﬃculty). And we're going to get that, super hard.
And with the manufacturing process, we're conﬁdent it's going to be very low cost.
It's basically high-volume glass. It is using a lot of techniques from the automotive
glass business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-01

OperatorAnd in case it wasn't obvious with the announcement, Tesla has created a glass
technology group which with some really phenomenal people. The (inaudible) ﬁrst
(inaudible) on Model 3.
So it's just like glass is not expensive. It's actually -- in volume, glass is very cheap and
very resilient. Then applying the hydrographic -- it's almost like painting. But
hydrographic coloring, also fundamentally an inexpensive process. Using up the
(inaudible) to provide earth-tone colors, also there is very low cost in volume.
Like, none of these things are fundamentally expensive. I don't know why nobody
has done this before. It blows my mind.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
The other area where the others have failed, ignore the aesthetics. Let's just say it
was beautiful. Their distribution process is another reason why I don't think it
succeeded.
They went and bought (inaudible) product, going through distributors, who then sell
to the installer, who then has to get it installed. So you have multiple that people in
the value chain who each at a compounding margin. And then the end product was
just too expensive.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, exactly. It's (inaudible) overhead and proﬁt to the, like, ﬁfth power, with a lot of
interest in this distribution chain. You look at the fundamental cost, say what's the
cost? Just like (inaudible) of analysis.
Like what is the cost of glass, the cost per pound and cost per kilogram of glass, a
high-strength glass. It's incredibly low. It's basically -- it's processed sand.
How much would it cost to do hydrographic printing in volume? Also very low.
Custom produced micro (lever) ﬁlm in volume, very low. It's basically plastic or
(inaudible) durable plastic.
Then the tiles, you just snap into a back-end skeleton structure jus like snapping in a
light bulb. It's really simple. It's like -- you can ask me why hasn't somebody done
this? I don't know. I wish they had. And if they had, we wouldn't bother. But for some
bizarre reason, they're not.
