{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Welcome, everyone. Again, for those who don't know me, my name is Mark
Moerdler. And I cover global software for Bernstein. It's with my distinct pleasure to
welcome Takeshi Numoto, Corporate VP of Cloud and Enterprises. Takeshi has been
with Microsoft since 1997 and brings to today's discussion deep knowledge of
Microsoft's commercial products and commercial cloud solutions. And since he
doesn't have a jacket on, I'll take mine oﬀ and roll my sleeves up. So we can hold a --
(Inaudible)
It's okay, I want to be relaxed. And we'll lay into lots of interesting questions.
So what I'm going to start oﬀ with is some, what I would call, speed dating questions,
blast questions, get some quick answers to some questions that investors have
asked us at a high level, can give (inaudible).
I'd like to start at a high level with what makes up Microsoft's cloud platforms, what
are the products.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
When we talk externally about Microsoft Cloud and cloud run rate as a revenue
metric, as an example, we're talking about the commercial cloud service oﬀerings we
have. So that includes things like Azure. And it's inclusive of all the underlying oﬀers
that it has, like EMS or Power BI, as well as Oﬃce 365 and Dynamics 365.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent. At a high level, why do you have so many datacenter regions worldwide?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

Well it's really customer demand driven, in the sense that our customers need, in
terms of their IT environment and what they look for, is very, very complex. So
whether it be from regulatory requirements like data residency or the ability to really
have datacenters close to wherever they want to deploy their applications and
solutions, that's kind of what we look at in terms of giving our customers the option
to be able to deploy their solutions and their applications closer to either their
employees or their markets that they're trying to address.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
So how big is a datacenter region or a datacenter? And are they comparable
between what a Microsoft and Amazon and Google might build?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
One thing I ﬁrst want to clarify is, when we talk about 38 regions for Azure, which is
something you may have heard about, region is not a datacenter. Region is
essentially a logical representation of one or more datacenters.
So we typically set up -- there are some regions that are represented by huge
datacenters, where one large datacenter is a region. But there are other cases where,
more typically, we're aggregating multiple datacenter locations. So that they're
within network latency proximity, such that we can logically represent it as one
logical datacenter. And we call that a region. And we have 38 of them announced in
the world. And that's more than basically what all of our competition oﬀers by a wide
margin.
And again, like I said, the reason we oﬀer this is because we are really geared
towards the enterprise needs. And when you think about one of the key reasons
enterprise customers look to us is the ability for them to deploy their applications
and solutions closer to where they need to have their application solutions
deployed.
We're also unique in the sense that we oﬀer -- essentially, we're the only global
provider that is legally licensed to operate our cloud services and oﬀer them in
China. And we oﬀer that through a partner called 21Vianet. And we also have a
unique -- essentially a data trustee model in Germany, where we have datacenter
oﬀerings in Germany, where the data controlled, in terms of the access to the data, is
controlled by our partner and not by Microsoft directly. And that gives them,
particularly customers in Germany and Europe, additional isolation in terms of data
sovereignties.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. And how big is your datacenter footprint? I mean, could we say it's
built to support 10% of the world's compute -- I mean, what's a fair metric of whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

Mark Moerdleryou've built to date?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
We can share with you a bunch of the collateral we have in terms of the sheer scale
of our datacenters. Because it is quite impressive. Sometimes people talk about the
cloud and, a lot of people immersed in kind of things like a server room. And then
think, well, we have a cloud, too. But the sheer scale of our datacenters. And let
alone the sheer scale of the regions that aggregates multiple datacenters, is quite
staggering. We could sort of show you sort of video reel [ph] that talks about the
amount of concrete used in just one datacenter, the number of cabling that's used in
one datacenter that can exceed -- essentially that can circumvent, encircle the earth
multiple times and things like that. And the scale is quite impressive.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Any sense in terms of -- is it built out to capture some big portion of the world
capacity?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think your question implies that the cloud is largely sort of a mere shift from a trend
[ph]. So for us -- and sort of the customer adoption pattern bear this out -- cloud can,
of course, be a place where you shift your workloads. But so many times, cloud is
also a place where you do new things that you didn't do before. If you want to do
advanced analytics, or if you want to learn a machine -- have a machine learning
(inaudible) that you want to apply against your data, they may not have been
activities that were done on-prem.
So we're surely not thinking about building out our datacenter capacity as a
percentage of the world's computing capacity or even on-prem capacity; we're just
really doing it on the basis of customer demand. And basically scaling to meet the
needs of the customer demands.
And the consumption growth for Azure has been very substantial. In Q1, I think we
talked about our Compute, Azure Compute growth doubling year over year again.
And overall consumption growth was around over 120% year over year. So we're
basically looking at -- we're seeing all this customer interest in consumption growth
across the world. And how do we keep up with the capacity. And we don't think
about it in the ratio that you talked about.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay. That's fair.
Little more detail -- where are we in the Azure adoption cycle? Is this still the early
adopter, the guys kicking tires? Is this enterprises running large production
enterprise workloads? How should we think of it?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

I would say it's not -- it's certainly not just the, quote-unquote, early adopters. I would
say, what the best -- one way to think about it is almost like an early innings, if you
play baseball.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
So everybody's playing the game. Everybody's into the game now, with varying
degrees. Some of the customers are starting with sort of the tiptoe in the water,
maybe with SaaS applications like Oﬃce 365 or just, on Azure, maybe something like
disaster recovery. Then, there are other customers that are far deeper into it in terms
of really deploying mission-critical applications, like SAP and running that in Azure.
And so the question is essentially -- my answer to the question is the participation
into the cloud is really taking oﬀ across our customer base. The degree of which.
And the sophistication with which, they do it is still high variable. But the level of
participation into the cloud, I think, has broadened dramatically over the last year or
so.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay. And you expect that to continue, obviously?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Good, excellent.
What is Microsoft's cloud value proposition to customers versus some sort of an
enterprise software vendor, a Workday or some other vendor? And in the future, do
you see customer using multiple clouds, like Azure or AWS with Compute. And
Oracle Workday for apps? Or how do you think of the world moving over the next
number of years?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
The journey that we see customers going on -- their entry point into the journey to
the cloud could be diﬀerent depending on the customer. Some customers may startFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 29Mark Moerdler
Takeshi Numoto
Mark Moerdlerby introducing SaaS applications into the environment, whether it be Oﬃce 365 or
Dynamics 365. That may be one part of their journey.
Or they might start with infrastructure ﬁrst. And may start with something like storage
or disaster recovery. Or they might actually start using the cloud in terms of
developing net new applications that the -- that's sort of hard to conceive or deploy
on-prem. And particularly around things like new data and AI type applications.
So whether you start with a SaaS ﬁrst or infrastructure ﬁrst, or net new application
into the cloud ﬁrst, what we see customers evolving to is that they end up needing
all three. So you might actually start with one of these three diﬀerent scenarios. But
over time, customers will essentially need all these, whether it's a SaaS thing or IS
[ph] thing or net new application development platforms.
And we see this in the customer number. So in Q1, for example, we talked about how
of the Fortune 500 companies, not only do we have 90%-plus of our Fortune 500
customers running their business on Microsoft Cloud. And over 60% of them are
running three or more of the Microsoft Cloud oﬀerings, which is basically a 20-point
improvement year over year. And it kind of goes to show us, customer may start in
one of the diﬀerent entry points. But actually evolving to use more of it.
And so compared to other application-centric vendors, our really [ph] approach is
we're far more comprehensive. And that's why we see even partners like SAP
basically bring their applications to run on Azure. We've made some announcements
on this a few weeks ago. And no application that you know in the enterprise stands
alone. They're never in a silo, they have to be integrated with diﬀerent applications.
The data needs to be shared across diﬀerent applications, then there's a huge role
that a horizontal application platform and a cloud platform like Azure can play.
And of course, if the customers want to go essentially deploy a SaaS application
purely with SAP or Workday, we will actually have connectors in other integration
points, whether it be things like Active Directory, to go integrate. So we want to make
sure all customers have a way to use Azure, whether it's conjunction with that
existing SaaS app or using Azure as a horizontal line of business model.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay. Brilliant one of the [ph] numbers. You said that 60% of the customers are
running -- of the 90% of the Fortune 500 are running three or more solutions. But
that's still, again, in early innings within their opportunity to build out and use Azure,
correct?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes. First of all, that 60% isn't within the 90%.

Page 6 of 29Takeshi Numoto
Mark Moerdler
Takeshi NumotoOkay.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
So it's actually 60% of (multiple speakers) the base. And when we talk about three, it
is sure that there's even within the three 60 that's already using three of our services.
We have a lot of consumption growth opportunities, because they may be starting to
use one of the three services. But they can use more of that volume of that same
service, in addition to consuming more of our service. So there's a lot of opportunity
there.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent.
Can you provide a sense of the opportunity for Azure from third-party SaaS and
solution vendors building and running on top of Azure? If you had -- gave SAP as an
example, how big of what's going to run, or you think could run on Azure, is going to
the other SaaS members?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I'm not quite sure I get particularly ﬁxated on the notion of a SaaS or not. It is
interesting to really think about the opportunity we have for how essentially the
enterprise ISV application can essentially move to take advantage of something like
Azure. So given historical relationship we have with so many of the enterprises ISVs,
we have an opportunity to work with them and talk about how their enterprise ISV
solution can take advantage of cloud. And they can also move from essentially an
on-prem business model to one in the cloud.
So as an example, Esri delivers their geospatial solutions on top of Azure. They're
historically been an on-prem solution. But now, they bring their cloud solution to the
cloud. Teninose [ph] as a core vacuum [ph] solution has historically been an on-prem
solution. They're working with us (inaudible) via the cloud. And so we have an
opportunity to think about whether it's delivered as a sort of a multitenant SaaS
application or deliver it as essentially a cloud host as solution that isn't necessary
SaaS or multitenant. There's a huge opportunity for us to work with enterprise ISVs to
bring their solution to Azure and help them essentially transform their business.
At the same time, we also have an opportunity to work with net new ISVs that are net
new to the world or are developing net new solutions. And we can oﬀer them sort of
a faster and hopefully a better chance of succeeding in the marketplace, because
they can use Azure to ingrate with enterprise environments. Most enterprise
customers, for example, don't necessarily want to set up another directory or
authentication scheme with a new SaaS vendor, particularly if you are an established
[ph] player. And so we can oﬀer them help by saying -- hey, if you integrate with
Azure and Azure AD [ph], as an example, you can oﬀer sort of a uniﬁed
authentication scheme to your application that enterprise CIOs and CSOs would likeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

Page 7 of 29Mark Moerdler
Takeshi Numoto
Mark Moerdlerto be able to be able to manage your applications. And so we have an opportunity
to onboard net new enterprise ISV stacks [ph] as well.
So both whether it be helping transform existing enterprise ISVs or bring net new
enterprise ISVs into Azure, I think we have a great opportunity. And those, of course,
all catalyze consumption of Azure.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
So following on that, why Azure versus some other cloud platform or building your
own datacenter?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well I think it boils down to there are three, four things that we're focused on at the
Microsoft Cloud level. It's not initially just an Azure segment. But it's sort of a
Microsoft Cloud segment that we're focused on.
First, we talked about sort of our global scale and having this set level of regions so
that you can actually have -- can address your data residency needs, you can
essentially deploy -- have far more options than what the competition oﬀers in terms
of being able to deploy solutions and applications closer to where you need it,
whether it be market or employees or partners. That's one advantage.
Then, we are very, very much focused on really making it easy for both our partners
and customers to be able to trust our cloud implementation model. So trust is a
huge deal and a key enterprise design point for us.
So when you think about the work we do around security or the amount of
compliance work we do, we have far more -- we have more compliance certiﬁcation
than any other global cloud vendor, when you think about SoC [ph] or ISO or even
vertical compliance standards like HIPAA or PCI, or you name it. And we have more
than any of the competition. And that essentially lowers the barrier both our
customers and partners to use Azure. And that's a huge diﬀerentiation point.
Then thirdly, I think, a big one is really a deep notion of hybrid. For us, hybrid isn't
just a mere notion of connecting public clouds on-prem. Or it's not even about just
moving virtual machines to between on-prem and public cloud. It's far more of a
complete consistency in the platform. So all the way from the application layer, from
things like productivity or business application, data technologies like SQL, all the
way down to identity and infrastructure, we provide a really consistent platform. And
that essentially enables both our partners and customers to be able to have a much
more ﬂexible deployment model, where you can focus on your app. And then
deploy -- think about what the best way to deploy it. And those are three big
diﬀerentiations we have versus the others.

Takeshi NumotoExcellent. So does that then deﬁne the approach almost as you're giving clients a
ramp to the cloud versus a rip and replace [ph] to the cloud?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Certainly, that's part of it. Like I said, a lot of the cloud consumption is taking place
not initially just as a lift in shift --
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
-- but also using net new. And also like new scenario that combines what you already
have on-prem. So net new doesn't mean it's in the isolation of on-prem; oftentimes it
shares data, or it shares the technology that you already have on-prem. And then
using the cloud to extend it further.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
So is that why you've been focusing so much energy on AI is because of machine
learning, because it creates new use cases?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well for us, from a cloud perspective, consumption is almost our prime directive.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
And so we want to do everything we can to drive the cloud adoption and
consumption. And that could be by enriching new oﬀerings, like delivering new
oﬀerings and use cases like AI. Wouldn't you like to be able to add speech
recognition to your application, would you like -- what other scenarios where face
detection can be useful, or emotion detection can be useful in your own
applications? And we oﬀer those as APIs that you can use to build apps as Azure.
That certainly adds to the new scenario where the business opportunity isn't just the
monetization opportunity we have for the APIs for oﬀer for that. But also the broader
application consumption that it brings for sure.
And similarly, that's why we're so focused on essentially expanding our TAM. So to
speak, of our cloud oﬀering by embracing OSS solutions. Because when you think
about supporting all variants of Linux, including Red Hat, having not just the
operating system support but broad set of OSS technologies, whether it's on theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 29Mark Moerdler
Takeshi Numoto
Mark Moerdler
Takeshi Numotodata side, like MySQL or Mungo [ph], or if it's the language and frameworks that a lot
of the OSS developers are familiar with. We're spending a lot of time making sure
that our SDKs for PHP or no Goldman Sachs [ph] and whatnot are all ﬁrst-class. So
that we can bring in more OSS developers into Azure. And that's certainly showing in
customer adoption. Because when you think about Azure VMs, over a quarter of the
VMs running in Azure is Linux right now.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right. Okay. So if you're opening up the opportunity for open-source, you're
opening it up for Linux, the SaaS guys are -- many of them are running on Linux or
other open-source capabilities. Does that shrink the opportunity for Windows
Server?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Not necessarily. When you think about -- as you might expect, we're fairly rigorous in
tracking our installed base and sort of share in the enterprise in terms of what
percentage of the servers stops running the [ph] enterprises, Windows versus Linux.
And we're not initially seeing a dramatic shift at all in terms of Windows business in
that regard. Continues to be pretty healthy. Even if you think about our on-prem
business results in Q1, we reported a double-digit growth in premium versions of our
server products. Part of this is, as customers become increasingly more sophisticated
as the use the cloud [ph], they want on-prem technologies that are sort of more
compatible and copasetic with the models themselves. And so that's driving sort of
more of a higher addition adoption on our on-prem servers, too.
And so I don't initially think of cloud transition as essentially a shrinkage of the
Windows Server opportunity. But it's really certainly more of the cloud giving us an
opportunity to participate in markets we haven't participated in before in the Linux
market. And that's why we're embracing.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
So following on on that -- should we feel as investors comfortable that Windows
business is a continuing, growing business, given all the puts and takes of everything
else?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
We certainly think about the lifetime value of the Windows Server. And whether it be
on-prem and we have a very healthy and growing mix of annuity. And we are actually
doing things like Azure hybrid use rights, which we're baking into the annuity
business model, where if you essentially buy Windows Server, then you actually can
take that license and deploy it to essentially run Windows Server more cheaply in
Azure. And so we're basically, again -- that's almost -- you can think of it as a hybrid
business model. And that's one way to make sure that our -- the customer's journey
into cloud is accretive to our business overall.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

So one more on Windows -- how should we think about how much of the Windows
Server use case is tied to hosting traditional Microsoft Windows workloads like
Exchange and SharePoint, et cetera?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
When we look at the use cases, there's just a vast amount of long-tail applications
that are deployed on Windows Server. The ﬁrst-party applications, like SharePoint
and Exchange, are certainly important applications for us. But in terms of the overall
impact to the installed base of all the Windows Server out there, I mean, I wouldn't
say it's that dominant.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay.
Changing gears -- Dynamics -- we haven't really -- investors haven't really focused
yet on Dynamics. But yet, this quarter, we had a really good result on Dynamics CRM
online. The cloud version seemed to be growing very fast. Where is the focus for the
Dynamics product? Is it midmarket, is it enterprise? How should we think about it?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well I do think it's both. Historically, you might be recalling that some of the assets
originally that we started Dynamics business with were based on acquisitions that
were more centered around midmarket.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
And so that might cause you have to -- hey, that's kind of a midmarket-based asset.
But when we think about our business growth, we're seeing really, really strong
business growth in our what we would call VPE space as well. And so increasingly,
the Dynamics business is not just a midmarket business; it's certainly growing rapidly
in the enterprise as well. And we've had some market wins, whether it's VHV that's a
switcher from Salesforce, or -- they get a customer like American Online's [ph]
adopting CRM. So we are seeing adoption in the enterprise for sure.

Takeshi NumotoAnd is that today's predominantly Dynamics CRM? How do we think about it long
term? Is it more of a mixed VRP, is it new products within the Dynamics family?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well actually, one of the things we've most recently done -- and we should spend
[ph] more time increasingly on it -- is we've announced a new approach to our biz
apps where we are now going out to market under the uniﬁed branding around
Dynamics 365.
And what we're doing there is to really break down sort of the vendor-imposed silos
that exist in the market today, where there was a CRM. And there's ERP. And that was
treated completely diﬀerently. But that kind of a segregation of duties and
separation and segmentation was largely vendor based, where what the customer
really wants is the ability to think really about -- hey, how do I actually run the
business in the best way possible from essentially a lead all the way to cash?
And so, we've now gone onto market. And it's available today in the market called
Dynamics 365, that essentially uniﬁes the assets we've had traditionally in what we
used to call Dynamics CRM, as well as our ERP assets. And basically having one
uniﬁed cloud oﬀering that can essentially handle that process end-to-end.
And in addition to doing that, in addition to unifying sort of our [ph] CRM product
and an ERP product, we've also done it in such a way so that it's not just this one
large monolithic thing you have to buy. If you just want to start with customer service,
if you just want to start with sales automation, if you just want to start with ﬁeld
service or project service automation, you can just get going with just essentially the
scenario you like, knowing fully well that the platform is fully integrated. So that you
can add additional applications, business applications. And then actually consume
all of our capabilities. But we're done it in a way where you can actually start in a
bite-sized way.
And we think that the way we both approach the products. And even the pricing
model and the licensing modeling, is quite disruptive to the marketplace. And we'll
quite bullish.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}

where if you get an email in Oﬃce 365 within Outlook, if there's -- let's say, if the

that integrate across each other.

And I think it does speak to the power of really thinking about Microsoft Cloud
holistically.
I think I get a lot of questions from this community that essentially attempts to take
kind of what I think of as a very narrow comparative view on Azure versus AWS, or
Google versus Oﬃce 365, in a pretty category-by-category narrow way. But the real
power that we are seeing in our customer adoption of cloud is that they end up
needing all of the elements of the cloud. And we're uniquely positioned to be able
to address their need holistically and the opportunity to be able to essentially
address their needs across these diﬀerent cloud needs that they have. Then, we're
seeing that in the numbers, I think.

So let me open it up for a couple questions from the audience. Keep the questions

Questions And Answers
(technical diﬃculty).
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
So the question is, can you go through the methodology, internal thinking in terms
of insourcing your datacenters versus outsourcing it?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well when you say insource and outsource, I use -- it sounds like you're asking kind
of a lease-or-build kind of a question. Because whether the facilities are leased or
not, I want to make sure like we actually do run the datacenter operations ourselves.
So it's not like Azure datacenters is somehow outsourced in terms of its operation,
whether the underlying assets are leased or built ourselves. So that's one clariﬁcation
I wanted to.
Then, it's really -- I hate that you might not like this answer. But it's really on a case-
by-case basis. Sometimes we know we have to think about our ability to get to
market quickly. And sometimes a lease might be a faster option. Build might take
slightly longer, as you might imagine. If you think about the long term, cost of buildFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

A - Takeshi Numotomight be slightly cheaper. Like we have to think about all these elements. Then, on a
per-country and per-region basis, we think about what the best way are to do it.
And none of the businesses are ﬁxed in stone, in the sense that -- again, a region
encompasses multiple datacenters. So a given region might encompass datacenters
that have two diﬀerent implementation models, one that's leased and one's built. But
it's one region that we represent to the customers. So really, it's an implementation
detail that we think about in a very case-by-case way.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent. Next question? Good. That's easy.
So if we then look at the Microsoft Cloud vision, when you look at the commercial
side of the business, what is your expectation of how much, how fast that
transformation on [ph] the cloud is? And is it going as fast as you'd like it to go?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well I guess we would always like it to go faster.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Right? If you just ask (inaudible) hey, your Azure growth is pretty substantial, are you
satisﬁed, he would say -- hey, I want more. Of course, he will say, I want more. He tells
me I want more all the time. (Inaudible)
But overall, I think we are quite encouraged by the growth we're seeing. We are
continuing to see triple-digit growth in consumption. Compute consumption, like I
said, doubled year over year. And this is not the ﬁrst time it's been ongoing for quite
a while. And we have a lot of work to do.
But the notion of essentially having a real technology stack that we can bring to bear,
both in our public cloud that also has a consistent platform that customers use on-
prem seem to be resonating. And that's really also helping -- the cloud approach is
also helping us address new TAM that we didn't participate in before. So overall, I
think we're quite bullish.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent. So what would be the limiting factors, or are there any, in continuing to
grow at the rates you're growing. And within both the Azure business and the Oﬃce

{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Or maybe there aren't any.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well of course, we can always execute better and go faster. And that's across both.
On the Azure side, we need to do a great job of consistently balancing two key
growth levers. One is to acquire new customers. And we're basically adding about
200 subscriptions a week now. So that's a high run rate of either customer
acquisitions.
But at the same time, we have to do a great job of the customers we acquired in
growing their consumption.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
And that's all about how do we make their product easier to use, how do we engage
with the customer with some of the sales resource investments we made. So that we
can actually help them accelerate their consumption to the cloud? And so those are
things we just have to go continue to fully execute on.
But it is really upon -- the market momentum is clearly [ph] behind us. And so it's
really upon us to seize the opportunity.

Excellent.
Changing gears over to SQL Server -- who do you see as the biggest direct
competitors to SQL Server? How would you compare yourself against what Oracle
delivers today versus Aurora [ph] delivers today?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
So we think we have a really disruptive value proposition with particularly SQL Server
2016. If you think about all the value and capability we've added to the product. And
whether it be our in-memory capability. So you can do advanced analytics right on
top with the database, all the in-memory OLTP [ph] performance implements we
made, or in-memory of BI [ph], all these capabilities we added would be essentially
an add-on product in the Oracle product realm.

And so we've documented ROI diﬀerences, where the total cost of ownership is --
we are basically 12x cheaper. So we are really bringing on a diﬀerentiated value prop
to the table. And folks like Gartner really recognizes us in the sense that we're like
the tippy-top right top corner in their Magic Quadrant now two years in a row.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}

So we're sort of bringing that increased value proposition to the table and really are
seeing an opportunity to growth the business, both from our existing base but also
by taking share.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent.
What do you see as the key diﬀerentiators in the new version of SQL Server that
could drive further adoption?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well the total -- the TCO [ph] value diﬀerence in the capabilities (inaudible) I just
talked about, I think, in and of itself, is a big lever. Another one that's worth talking
about. And goes to my previous statements around hybrid, is that we really are
thinking deeply about what it means to deliver hybrid capabilities. So in SQL 2016,
you can actually deploy SQL 2016 on-prem and have some basically set policies on
what portions of your table getting drifted [ph] and stored in the cloud, while your
application can remain unchanged, where the database would basically provide a
uniﬁed query back from the data that sits across your on-prem in cloud.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
And that's an example of how we're delivering a true example, a really rich example
of hybrid use cases, where our on premise sales motions can really catalyze also a
dialog around the cloud in a way that makes sense for the customer.
So it's not -- SQL 2016 isn't just a growth opportunity for SQL for the license business
per se. But it's also a great way to engage customers in the cloud.

What do you see as the core things that are driving -- are going to drive people to
E5? And is that where you end? Is there future possibilities of keeping to expand up
the market in terms of capabilities and price?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
There are two answers I have on that, actually probably three. One is, of the Oﬃce
365 E5 motion per se, within that sort of product dialog, we're just seeing a
tremendous amount of customer reaction, particularly around our security value
propositions. Because we approach security not as a bolt-on product but essentially
intrinsic to securing the workload. And customer customers want the secure Oﬃce
365 workload.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
The security elements of Oﬃce 365, particularly on things like advanced threat
protection, is really resonating. And that security portion of the E5 rally [ph]
proposition, I think, is going really well.
Then, we can certainly do a lot more to accelerate the adoption of essentially the
analytics and voice capabilities, where we are really happy with the fact that the way
we're participating in the market -- these are all big market opportunities where we
have an opportunity to grow both in terms of advanced analytics in BI and also voice.
And having E5 as a vehicle to do that gives us a lot of opportunity.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent. Okay. So E5 gives you opportunity, especially on the security side. And
we're heard that earlier today from another speaker on how much that is resonating,
security and compliance, et cetera. Analytics seems to be a part of it. How important
is the voice oﬀ [ph] capabilities within E5? And what more can you do there?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I'm not sure I'm sort of the best person to talk about our opportunity in voice. Again,
it's a huge opportunity that has a horizontal application that essentially is necessary.
It's not something that a small population of your employee needs; it's something
that everybody needs.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}

into the cloud. And so we're just generally bullish on the opportunity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

a great opportunity. But we're also helping the Company rally around, particularly
around this notion of security by creating an oﬀering called Secure Productive

{BIO 16855032 <GO>}

making it easy for customers to buy and transact with us, a way, a solution that
essentially protects their Windows device, protects their mobile device, protects
their Oﬃce 365 environments across their endpoints -- that actually is something
that we're very bullish on.

Excellent.
Let me see if there's another question from the audience. Then I will continue. Yes?
(technical diﬃculty)
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Question is on the Azure Stack and where you are. And what the customer feedback
has been.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
The customer interest and feedback on Azure Stack has been tremendous. We've
just seen -- I forget the exact number. But certainly higher than expected numbers
we had in terms of the downloads in customers that are trying them out. And we've
just dropped essentially a technical preview, too, at a night a few weeks -- a month
ago. And the customer feedback and the interest in our strategy of really delivering
a hybrid cloud solution, where you can both use the public cloud services that we
have as well as create an environment that's highly compatible with what we oﬀer in
public cloud on-premises, is resonating really well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

Excellent.
So let me ask a little more on Azure, since there's obviously a lot of questions in this
space. Azure accelerated this quarter, being obviously quite bullish on the
opportunity, companies building more datacenters on it. What is driving it? Is it
simply the fact that you're moving a little farther in in the innings. And there's more
people driving adoption? Is there some other magic going on in here?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think it's sort of combination of three factors. One is we are seeing quite healthy
growth from our existing customers.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
So once customers get going on Azure, month over month, year over year, the
consumption from the customer we've already acquired for Azure is going well. And
that's the big driver of our consumption growth.
Another one, of course, is that we are really focused, in addition to consumption
growth, acquiring new customers. And I talked about 200,000 new subscriptions.
And that's sort of a metric we can look at in terms of what's the velocity of the
customer acquisition. Because we all need to get customers started.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Initial consumption might be small. But we have to get them going as quickly as
possible. So that that can grow over time.
Then, thirdly, as consumption grows, we are seeing a really healthy growth in our
premium services. As the consumption growth happens in the customer, their use
patterns and use cases become more sophisticated. So perhaps it may have been
originally just sort of the base compute storage and network initially. But we're
seeing good growth in things that we call Azure Premium Services, like database
services or advanced analytics services or machine learning services. And we're
seeing, I think, nine consecutive quarters in terms of [ph] this growth on those
premium services. That essentially is catalyzing consumption growth.

A - Takeshi NumotoExcellent. And that move up the stack to the more premium versions -- what are the
things that are going to continue to drive that coning improvement in premium? And
what can be done to add to that capabilities?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well I think it's three things. One is we certainly continue to have to invest in our
product and make the product richer and better over time. Secondarily, we're seeing
a nice ROI from some of the sales investments we've made, in terms of really having
dedicated resources that can engage deeply with customers in how they can use the
cloud in deeper and more sophisticated ways. And continuing to sort of drive good
returns from that is another one. And thirdly is the work that we're doing here under
our ISV ecosystem, where the more -- we have all this tech. But then what are the
solutions that ISVs and partners and SI partners build in terms of practices that
deliver value to the end customer? And building that ecosystems while they're
growing [ph] can further accelerate that consumption.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Microsoft's always been a very partner-centric organization. Obviously, initially you
were selling the cloud for downloading direct. Now you're selling, I guess, a lot
through the cloud. How do you see that mix? What do you do to keep driving that
ecosystem to get bigger and better?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
You're absolutely right. We have a strong DNA as a company in being very partner-
centric. And it's really important for the cloud. Because particularly when you think
about a product like Azure, it's not like end customers wake up and say I want a
virtual machine, or a database. It's all in furtherance of a solution. And that solution
comes in the form of a solution that the customer develops by themselves. But more
likely, it could be from an IV [ph] or an SI partner implementing before them.
And so the notion of really cultivating a partner ecosystem to be able to better take
advantage of cloud and where we [ph] invest is important to us. And that's part of
the reason we're investing in new business models like CSP Partner Program, which
enables our partners to essentially deliver a ﬁnished service from their end, building
on top of Microsoft Cloud service, not just Azure but also Oﬃce 365 and Dynamics
65.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Most of the SaaS vendors haven't to this point taken a direct-only model. Most of the
-- many of the infrastructure PaaS vendors have taken almost a shopping cart -- pick
a couple of these things and dropping. Why do you have -- can you drill a little more
the advantage of the approach you're taking today and what the long-term payouts
to Microsoft is from that?

Page 21 of 29Q - Mark Moerdler
A - Takeshi Numoto
Q - Mark Moerdler
A - Takeshi NumotoWell there are two ways to think about it. One is we certainly would like to engage
with these SaaS vendors of the customer --
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
-- so that they deliver their SaaS, perhaps even unbeknownst to the customer that it
runs on Azure. But it's Azure (inaudible) their needs. That's a key engagement model
for us. And we announced, since our partnership with Adobe as an example, where
they're bringing their marketing cloud, document cloud, creative cloud -- those are
all SaaS solutions -- to Azure. And that's an important opportunity for us. But at the
same time, like I said before, no apps, particularly in the enterprise, can live in a silo.
That data has to be shared. And the application has to integrate with other systems.
And so there is an opportunity for us to basically provide a platform that both SaaS
application vendors and customers use collectively so that they can share data. And
that, I think, is sort of the best of both worlds.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent.
So you've obviously -- you started out with a purely Microsoft-centric oﬀering in
Azure. You've expanded it by adding third-party and open-source databases and
other technologies. How do you think through what to add, when to add it. And
whether you add it just simply as something that is available on virtual machine
versus something that's more of a platform play?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think we are certainly striving to be incredibly feedback driven. Rather than having
teams sit in Redmond and think about what technology to add next, we actually have
a lot of signals we get from our own consumption. We can see, okay, where are
people stuck in their consumption? Can we improve their documentation? Can we
improve better [ph] samples? Can we -- we have so many points of data to be able
to collect.
Even in our own documentation -- I don't know whether you know this. But all of our
core documentation now is on GitHub. And anybody in the community, anybody on
the internet, can basically sort of give us feedback on, hey, we need things like this,
or we need more capabilities like this, or you need to document how this is done.
And essentially, that can be commented and get us in an open way. And our teams
look at it and then say -- hey, how can we actually take that as a feedback to either
improve our documentation to include the way our products are presented, or
essentially change capabilities of the product?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

critical mass of footprint in each of our communities. GitHub recently gave us an
award for being one of the biggest contributors to their code base, because we also
contribute to their code, too. And so this engagement model that we have with a
broader set of communities in being really feedback driven is, I think, the way we're
going to drive it.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
And so the same feedback type loop is being used as to -- we need to add ZYZ's
brand Linux or some open-source or some NoSQL database -- it's based on
customer interest?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Absolutely. Yes. Totally.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
And so the more the customer interest, you're constantly monitoring that to make a
decision of it. And the way you think about it -- I don't want to put words in your
mouth. But can I ask, does Microsoft think about, purely from a consumption model.
And therefore whether they're consuming someone else's or they're consuming
Microsoft's, that something we want to chase after?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes. I think, like I said, we've gotten really clear, typically around Azure, that
consumption is our prime directive.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
And so, of course we like our own software, too. We love it. If people use our
software in our cloud, that's kind of the best case.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
But at the same time, we are going to basically be clear on the fact that it's -- prime
directive is consumption. So particularly for many of our customers, it's not like
they're really picking between two technologies. They already have a preferred
technology. And they're saying -- hey, how can I use Azure for this?
And so it really makes sense for us to basically be where they are. And sort of

{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
So is that the reason why the push to have SQL on Linux?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
That's certainly one of the elements. We also saw a great opportunity to add value,
frankly. Because some of the capabilities we have in SQL is really, really great. And
how do we actually deliver it to more set of developers so they can write
applications that are exploitive of all this in-memory capability or all this advanced
analytics capability? And this essentially again addresses the TAM for SQL --
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
-- expands the TAM for the SQL business.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
And so, given the market expansion for purely traditional SQL databases to now
NoSQL and Hadoop databases and all the rest of it, do you -- how should you think
about that? Do you think of this as being SQL opportunity in [ph] the traditional
market. And then these other variants into other parts of the market? Do you think of
SQL moving into being able to support what was more nontraditional, because
you've added some capabilities in that respect?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes. Well again, we certainly are working to expand the relevance of the product. So
when you think about a lot of the capabilities like Hadoop, these added capabilities
in SQL 2016, called PolyBase, for example, that allows you to basically write a query
across your relational databases and your non-relational data sources in a uniﬁed
way --
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
-- and then you get sort of a uniﬁed result back -- that's another way to continue to
essentially expand the aperture in which SQL can be useful.
At the same time, we're also directly embracing a lot of NoSQL type technologies as
well. We have things like Dot TV as a service in the cloud. And we've basically made
the API for Dot TV compatible with long wave CI [ph]. So that if you're familiar withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

Q - Mark Moerdler
A - Takeshi Numotolong wave TV, you can actually use Dot TV essentially exactly in the same way you're
already familiar using long wave TV, as an example.
So across the data technology portfolio, we have a broad base of technology from
not just SQL. But other capabilities like Dot TV. We have HD Insights, which is
essentially a managed Hadoop service. And even more advanced technologies like
Azure Data Lake, which is highly diﬀerentiated in the sense that now you have a fully
managed service where you can literally put in petabyte objects. And the system will
handle sort of a charting of (inaudible) and queries automatically for you.
And so we have this broad portfolio, again all in furtherances of recruiting more
applications and data to be leveraging Azure.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
So given the breadth and depth of what you're oﬀering, can you give a sense of how
much of that was traditionally, ﬁve or 10 years ago, addressable by what Microsoft
sold?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I guess, many of the new things, particularly the things that exist only on Azure,
probably would not have been addressable previously. These are all net new TAM
expansions. And also, when you think about -- this is why I go back to -- don't think
just about Azure versus AWS in the sense that the way that really -- I spent a lot of my
time thinking about Microsoft cloud holistically.
So for example, Azure Data Lake technology originally sort of started oﬀ with some
of the capabilities that were originally built for Bing, in terms of having a huge data
store that's capable of indexing the internet. And that technology was originally used
ﬁrst-party only for Bing.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
But now, the market expanded to have more people and require that level of
capability. And we ﬁgured out a way to essentially oﬀer it as a commercial service on
Azure.
And so this isn't just a work of the Azure team showing up in Azure that all of the
cross-Microsoft team's capabilities showing up through Azure. Things like face
detection or emotion detection is all very similar in the sense that it's essentially a
way for Microsoft as a company to surface investments we've made in places like
Microsoft research that can now shine through the lens of Azure.
And there's a lot of capabilities that we oﬀer in Oﬃce 365 that is essentially
engineered by the Azure engineering team that shows up. And so we're trying to beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

But of course, when you make it a commercial oﬀering, you have to go through all
the compliance, interpretation (inaudible) that's the value that the Azure team often
has in commercializing technology.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
But I just wanted to give this example of the way to think about how Microsoft Cloud
is really a manifestation of Microsoft engineering capacity showing up in a way that
makes sense for customers regardless of where the engineering org is.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay. And that's signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from what we saw many years before within
Microsoft.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I do think this whole notion of being more customer-centric and having engineering
output through customers in the packaging that makes sense is something that
we're increasingly getting better at.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay. And your speed to market, in terms of going from an idea to something in
there, is that also improving through the changes in the development strategies and
processes?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

Yes. I mean, I've been at the Company 19-plus years.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
And at no time have I experienced the speed with which we are delivering new
capabilities. In fact, one of the things we're constantly working on is how do we keep
our partner ecosystem and our own sellers in ﬁeld and partners all trained up and up
to date on the level of new things coming down at a ferocious rate.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
And you could argue that's a good problem to have. But it is something we have to
work on. Because we want to make sure that the products and the customer
representation of the products is reﬂecting the latest and greatest.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right. Okay. So I guess that's also part of the value prop, is where you can get the
clients going from on premise to running either hybrid cloud or pure cloud, for lack
of a better word, that the clients are going to be able to get much faster, more
capabilities, new improvements, et cetera, et cetera on it. Is that having that
feedback into the traditional on-prem customers and driving the acceleration of
them upgrading to the latest versions of Windows Server, SQL Server, et cetera?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well that's certainly our intent. And that's what we're trying to execute against.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent.
Are there any other questions from the audience? Yes?

So the question is, for a Fortune 500 company running on AWS decides to move
over to Azure, what's the cost to do it, what's the time to do it?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

The answer for that is, in many aspects, our conversation with the customers aren't
initially about switching what they've already done. It's about -- like your next
workload, you may have already done this. But for your next project -- cloud
penetration, cloud consumption is happening at such a rate that oftentimes, it's far
less about switching. But it's far more about the next opportunity, what's the net new.
And increasingly, customers, particularly those that may have invested heavily in
AWS is deﬁnitely looking at a multi-cloud strategy. They're saying -- hey, I just want to
make sure that I'm not single-vendored in the cloud. And I want to be able to
manage a portfolio that sits across diﬀerent clouds.
And that, of course, gives us an opportunity to say -- hey, now you're next project is
going to be Azure. Perhaps you should relook the one you've done before. But our
ﬁrst -- the likelihood of success isn't to focus on the switch. But to actually focus on
the next workload.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
So that would imply that the amount of greenﬁeld opportunity is massive at this
point, compared to the ability or interest in taking from one cloud vendor to
another?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Right now, I certainly believe the market expansion and momentum is such that the
growth does not initially have to come at the expense of the other.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay. So that does that mean that we're just not going to see --
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
That doesn't mean there aren't competitive situations, that doesn't mean there aren't
competitive bids.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
There's always procurement experts in every company. And so we get to earn our
business for sure. But also, at the same time, it's not initially about always a switch is
required for us to win.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Right. Okay. Much of it is not switch.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-08

A - Takeshi NumotoOne last question, I think, from the audience.
(technical diﬃculty)
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes. Let me explain what we've done in terms of essentially simplifying our pricing in
October, which is what we really have done. It may have come across as a price
reduction. But it's really a simpliﬁcation, in the sense that we have historically had
Azure pricing that was somewhat diﬀerent based on your contractual (inaudible)
used to buy Azure.
And when we basically are seeing a lot of growth, particularly from customers that
we may have not traditionally engaged with us before, they may have not -- we've
learned that a lot of them actually don't know to sort of check all of our channels of
distribution and ﬁnd out the greatest price. Because they're maybe a startup, they
may be a relatively unengaged customer with a Microsoft distribution mechanism.
And so in order to make sure that we simplify our pricing model, particularly for
Azure. So that we reach new audiences in the most price-competitive way. Because
we were already price-competitive in the way we priced it overall. But it wasn't the
most visible on the website. So we just simpliﬁed it. So that the website prices
basically reﬂect the oﬀers we have in other channels.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent.
So I do apologize, we're going to have to cut in here at this point.
Takeshi, thank you so much, I really appreciate all your time and eﬀort.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
