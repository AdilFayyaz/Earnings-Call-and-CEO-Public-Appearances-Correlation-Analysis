Hi. Good morning and good afternoon depending on where you are. It's Kirk
Materne with the Evercore Software Research team. We're really excited to have
Chris Capossela with us from Microsoft. Chris is the Head of Marketing at Microsoft
and we're delighted to host him for a ﬁreside chat.
There is an opportunity to ask questions. I'll run through some Q&A with Chris and
then I'll open it up to your questions, so please use the Q&A function within the
Zoom Webinar to ask questions and I'll relay them to Chris if we have time at the
end.
So, Chris, thanks for doing this. I was hoping maybe just to level set, because I'm
sure not everybody has the chance to meet you before. You can just give us some
idea of your background and your roles and responsibilities at Microsoft.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
(technical diﬃculty) I'm pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the chart. As
you mentioned, I am the Chief Marketing Oﬃcer at Microsoft. I have a fancy title,
Executive Vice President. I get to work directly with Satya Nadella, he is my boss;
Amy Hood, obviously our CFO is a key peer of mine and partner of mine in our daily
work here at the company.
I look after marketing for all of our products. So that means all the things you would
associate with marketing, I think, products positioning, messaging, naming. We also
do all the pricing and licensing and sort of the business models for all of our
products inside of marketing with very close partnership with ﬁnance. Obviously,
things like advertising and communications, PR, analyst relations, all of those types of
things, events, our websites. I also get to look after three diﬀerent sales forces; theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Christopher C. Caposselasales force that calls on advertisers, like myself, to compete with Google, with our
Bing ad products. That's a very large business that doesn't get a lot of attention, but
that's an exciting business for us.
The sales -- and other sales force that we run is our retail sales force that calls on
retail partners like a Best Buy or a Walmart or Amazon all around the world to sell our
consumer products through their stores.
And then, ﬁnally, the Microsoft Stores team is in my sort of arena [ph], which is the
team that runs microsoft.com and we do billions of dollars of Xbox transactions and
Surface of Windows and Oﬃce.
So I work, kind of, under two hats; marketing for the whole company, and then some
more consumer-related or advertising-related sales teams are what I do. I've been at
Microsoft for almost 30 years, which is kind of crazy. I joined right out of college and
I've done jobs in engineering, believe it or not. I was computer science and
economics major, operations sales and marketing.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
That's great. That's great. 30 years at one company. I think it's going to be -- not too
many of us will be able to accomplish that. So that's super. Chris, given you stay in a
lots of -- lot of parts of the business, I was hoping maybe we'd start on commercial
and then toggle back to consumer and not to ﬂip ﬂop back and forth too often.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
So maybe I'll start with commercial, because I think from an investor perspective that
obviously gets a lot of attention. And one of the things you all obviously play into or
a lot of the themes around digital transformation, whether it's cloud, AI and you have
products within all of those areas really that can help address those opportunities
and frankly challenges ﬁrst for a lot your customers, but how do you think about
putting together marketing messages that help your clients think about the
challenges, but actually have products that really address them today, meaning there
is almost like where you want to talk about sort of the -- how do you not boil the --
clients want to boil the ocean, but the reality is you have to address these things on
sort of step-by-step basis. So how do you think about that broadly? Maybe just to
start and then we'll dive in a little bit.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah. So, I mean, I am hearing a decent amount of noise from some construction
outside of my house. Sorry, again, I just sort of pulled this mic closer. Can you hear
me okay?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Kirk Materne{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
Yeah. We're good. Thanks. Yeah. That's good. We hear a little vibration, but all good.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
If it's probably a little louder, my apologies.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
No problem.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
I would say that ﬁguring out your marketing message is always -- it's always sort of a
big challenge. Satya has made my job relatively straightforward in that he's made it
really clear that he wants us to be the empowerment company, the empowerment
brand. So he said many times, if you want to be a cool kid, don't come to work for
Microsoft. If you want to make our customers cool, come work for Microsoft. So we
really try to put the customer at the center of our marketing. And that means ﬁguring
out what customers want to talk about.
If you look at the way we go-to-market, what we have what we call 10 solution areas
or customer solution areas, which is where all our marketing and all our sales
activities are organized around. Our solution area might include something like data
and AI and it include something like Modern Work, the tools we use to collaborate
every day. It could something like security.
So we have ﬁve or six of these that are very commercially-oriented and three or four
of these that are very consumer-oriented and there is some overlap between them.
But having that clarity on what are the addressable markets you participated and that
customers want to talk to you about, do you have diﬀerentiation in each one of
these, and is there growth associated with each one, we ask those questions in
designing these sort of 10 solution areas. Now we have 10. In a couple of years,
maybe we'll have 12 or 13. The 10 that we have can drive huge amounts of growth,
but we're always looking for that next year, whereas the next $20 billion of growth
going to come from, not the next $5 billion of growth.
So I would say, the short answer I can give you is that we do a lot of work to ﬁgure
out the solution areas where we have diﬀerentiated technology that applies to a
customer problems that has a large total addressable market where we're actually a
relatively small share player, so we can grow pretty dramatically.
Does that context make sense, Kirk?

Kirk Materne
Christopher C. Capossela
Kirk Materne
Christopher C. CaposselaYes. No, that helps. I think, I'm just trying to think about how you approach that,
because there's obviously diﬀerent opportunities and then diﬀerent sort of ways you
might want to go-to-market for each of the diﬀerent products that I think it helps
clearly.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
You will see our messaging change --
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
That can happen quickly, but the core solution areas that we compete in have some
dev -- app developer, sort of app developer go-to-market, infrastructure go-to-
market. Those types of things will be pretty consistent year-over-year-over-year. And
when I think about FY22, there is no doubt that for us a big, big priority is going to
be security, a big, big priority is going to be helping companies return to more of a
hybrid work model in the way they approach work, what we call modern work and so
hybrid is going to be a big focus. And then, of course, the Windows PC is going to
be a huge focus and that cuts across a few diﬀerent solution areas.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
That's helpful. And so within that context, I guess, on the commercial side, over the
last few years, obviously with the shift to the cloud, it's interesting you all obviously
have more per user pricing and serve the on sort of the Oﬃce 365, Microsoft 365
area, but then you have consumption-based pricing when it comes to Azure. When
you think about -- because you are involved on the pricing side, how do you think
about that? I mean, we wrote a report earlier this week about some of the
opportunities you guys have in things like voice and security and people were like,
well, how big they could be? Well, how big they could be and how you are all
pricing. It could be diﬀerent, meaning it's part of a broader solution, so how do you
all think about pricing on, maybe, the Microsoft 365 side and then how maybe do
you think about diﬀerently when it comes to consumption-based pricing with
something like Azure?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah. It's such a big question about any of that. We have a lot of team that literally
focuses on this as their full time job and it's been amazing to see us transition from
the original Microsoft, where our pricing and licensing in our entire business model
was very optimized for software to physical distribution of goods, literally like boxed
software and seller-led transactions, much more of a push model, sort of a supply-
led model and with the move to the cloud 10, 12 years ago, we've realized, obviously,
a lot of customers talk to us about this all the time. With the move to the cloud, you
sort of start to realize though that's sort of device-based model is really going toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 14Kirk Materneshift. It's going to become far more digital and it's going to really evolve to a user
subscription model and a consumption-based model, both of which have more of a
pay-as-you-go, use ﬁrst and pay later, so freemium becomes really, really important.
And most of our services, you can get started with for free and then eventually we
ask you to pay a subscription or pay-as-you-go. And that's required a huge amount
of engineering and, of course, it's less supply-led and it's much more demand-led.
Customers just expect to come to microsoft.com and be able to stand up on Azure
virtual machine using whatever operating system they want just by swiping a credit
card and getting started, not even actually paying for the ﬁrst 30 or 60 days, or they
want to be able to take their existing Windows server license and just be able to
move that server to our cloud without having to re-buy that license and those are all
really sophisticated business model things that we've developed over the past
bunch of years.
Spot pricing has become a reality for us. If we don't have somebody using all of our
capacity at a particular time of day, we now algorithmically will change the price of
what a VM or a cost if you're willing to be evacuated from that VM for somebody
who is paying the higher price to have access to about 24/7. So the consumption
models are very, very sophisticated and the user subscription models, I think, are a
little more straightforward for people to understand.
But, Kirk, one of the cool things, I know -- I got a hunt you want to nerd out on this
today, because this is an area I absolutely love. One of the very cool things is, we're
starting to see blends between these two things. So, for example, when you buy
Microsoft 365 user-based subscription, you get a certain amount of our Power
Platform technology, Power Apps, Power BI, et cetera, but it is game. It is governed
and limited, and if you need more compute, let's say, you need more powerful
servers or more powerful cores to power your Power BI, then you would then buy
consumption on top of what you already own from your user-based subscription, so
you sort of surge your capability for that part of the 365 subscription.
And so, I actually think that in future you're going to see far more blending. It won't
be as simple as, well, that's a user-based model, oh that's a consumption-based
model. I think you will get a lot for user-based, but if you want more like more
compute then you'll search for a period of time, pay us the consumption, then you'll
be done with that surge, maybe you're closing the books for a quarter and you need
more Power BI juice, so to speak, and that means that customers really, I think, will
have much more of a blend to work with. So the business model of the company, it's
just -- I think, it's totally fascinating and it has moved to user-based and
consumption-based, but I think you should expect more of a blend over time as
opposed to just the simple binary choice.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
Yeah. That's really helpful. I think it's interesting to see that we are having some
activities on both ends of it, it might become more important for most software
companies over time. I think we sale with a lot of the bigger names talking aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14Christopher C. Caposselathat. Maybe just one quick follow-up on sort of the Microsoft 365 side, because you
mentioned security being one of the areas that you guys are focusing on, also from a
marketing perspective. So when it has a -- when you have a new product that
perhaps people aren't as aware of -- with -- for Microsoft like security and some of
the oﬀerings in that area, I think probably for a voice and some other areas in there,
how do you think about price? I mean, do you try to lead with low prices to kind of
get people on it and try it out? I guess, I'm sure the marketing strategy and the
pricing strategy has to go hand-in-hand. So, yeah, how do you -- is that a fair
assumption? And when we think about these things, I know you all are obviously
trying to drive -- dive deeper into -- yeah, do you use pricing or do you use
aggressive pricing that -- not to fool people or anything, but just to give to try it out,
so that they can understand also the power of the platform at a broader -- from a
broader perspective.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
The cool thing about the cloud is that, there is sort of an expectation that there is a
freemium approach for just about everything. And so even -- almost no matter how
cool you look at it and that we compete with, there is an element of, hey, you're
going to be able to get some things for free and then over time the companies like
us try to earn the right to have you sort of pay for something.
In the case of some of our big products, as it relates to security to your exact
question, we know from talking to customers, if customers buy email from us
through Microsoft 365 or their buying obviously Word, Excel, PowerPoint, they
expect that to come with some level of security. They don't expect us to say, hey, you
bought an email from us, but we've -- it's totally insecure email and now you have to
buy our security product too.
So in the case of security, what we tried to do is to say for a lot of our core
workloads, if you buy email from us, if you buy Windows from us and you're willing
to buy that on an enterprise level, that's going to come with security built into it. It's
kind of crazy for us to sell you email that's insecure. It doesn't mean that it has every
security capability that we could possibly think of, but it's certainly going to include,
let's say, secure email and then there may be more sophisticated things.
For us, we think of security, we also think about compliance and we think about
management and identity as all sort of one solution area. A lot of companies think of
security as one thing, we actually think it's a little bit broader than that. So if you buy
email from us, you're going to get a good level of security, but you might not get all
the compliance capabilities that you want for legal discovery or for the sophisticated
compliance needs that a larger company might need and then that would be an
additional products with a higher price.
So I think about it. We think about security speciﬁcally that way. We shouldn't sell you
an insecure operating system and say here is Windows, it's not very secure enough,
pay us more to secure it. We're going to have a base level of security in there. ThenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Page 7 of 14Kirk Materne
Christopher C. Caposselathere is always going to be another tier that you may want to buy into depending on
your threat posture around security and compliance.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
Okay. That's helpful. Another thing I want to touch upon it from the commercial side
is obviously sort of the verticalization of the business, you all have been building out,
really not only marketing but products that go after addressing sort of the last mile, if
you will, of business transformation in certain verticals and obviously some of that
last mile might be the most important stuﬀ when it gets down to it for the business
person. So from a marketing perspective, do you -- how are you thinking about that?
Where are you in terms of verticalizing products, obviously most your products are
horizontal by nature, but obviously adding in vertical functionality and then
speaking, I'd imagine, directly to the business owner, not just the IT person, it was
something that, I think, would unlock new pools of spend for you all as we go
forward. So can you just talk about that generally? Thanks.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah, it's such a good one. Thank you for asking. The -- I would say, as soon as Satya
pushed to the company to focus much more on empowerment, Judson or Jean-
Philippe, our sort of sales leaders, they were the ones who really said, hey, if we're
serious about that, we need to get far deeper and understand how Azure can be
applied to the ﬁnancial services industry, how Azure can be applied to the healthcare
industry, to the retail industry, et cetera.
So, for us, it was sort of a natural transformation from taking very horizontal products
like Microsoft 365, like Azure, like Dynamics 365, the Power Platform, et cetera, and
starting to dig more deeply partnered with the biggest companies in the world in
each one of these industries and understand how we can make our horizontal
platform the platform that they build on. And one of the ﬁrst things you hear is, of
course, that we need the best ISVs in the world who have very specialized needs or
very specialized solutions to be building on the Microsoft Cloud.
So I would say that, as you think about what we're doing in industries we've --
generally available right now is the Microsoft Cloud for healthcare. We are in public
preview with the Microsoft Cloud for retail and the Microsoft Cloud for ﬁnancial
services. We've announced the Microsoft Cloud for manufacturing and the Microsoft
Cloud for non-proﬁt. Those are not yet in public preview. But you see us taking our
horizontal cloud assets partnering with very important ISVs by vertical and then
going to market in a way where our sales and marketing is far more tuned to the
problems customers have. I don't think you'll ever see us be a deeply vertical
software company, it's always going to be, hey, these are the horizontal platforms we
have and we have incredible partners that we can go-to-market with. And as those
partners win, so does the Microsoft Cloud. And that I think is the key thing for
investors to understand. It's still very much a horizontal play for us, but we are doing
more to make sure our solutions and our partners' solutions meet the needs of the
biggest industry verticals that have the biggest compute needs, shall I say.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Page 8 of 14Kirk Materne
Christopher C. CaposselaI'm not sure if that gets to your core question, but do feel free to ask a follow-up.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
No, I think it helps and actually it kind of dovetails with another one, which would be,
as you mentioned, having ISVs adopter platform build on top of your platform, yeah,
developers go hand-in-hand with that obviously and obviously GitHub was an
important acquisition, I think, in terms of getting to the crux of talking to developers,
perhaps, a little bit more directly. Where do you think you are in that journey with -- I
mean, look, Microsoft has always had tons of developers, but I'd say the ﬁrst maybe
tranche of big Internet companies was built on maybe another platform. I think,
going forward, you obviously want the next big tranche to be on yours. Kind of, how
do you -- where do you think you are in that journey with developers? What's been
going right? What are some of the things are going to diﬀerentiate you, I guess, from
a marketing pricing perspective over the next couple of years?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, as you said, our very ﬁrst product as a company was a product for
developers is a basic programming products and Windows, of course, succeeded in
large part, because developers chose to build their applications for Windows. And,
now, I'd sort of say that a lot of our cloud success with Azure has actually been
enterprises taking their existing infrastructure and migrating that infrastructure to the
cloud.
The next opportunity for us or very big opportunity for us is to actually make the
Microsoft Cloud the platform of choice for ISVs and developers, not just ISVs but also
developers at every enterprise company in the planet and you know there is no
doubt that the developer, the software developer is sort of the creator of this part of
the greater economy. And so we were really excited with the GitHub acquisition,
because it's essentially lead business application if you want, it's almost of the SaaS
tool that every developer wants to use and it's the collaboration tool that every
developer uses.
And so if you think about the tech sector not being the sector that has the most
developers, it's really going to be every large company, every more -- more
companies are hiring developers than high tech. If you look at all the industries,
right, if you go to talk to the automotive industry, their hiring huge numbers
developers; talk to the energy industry, huge numbers of developers. So, for us, the
developer as an audience is a super, super interesting business opportunity for us.
GitHub is the business application. It is the CRM tool of the sales person and so it's
just absolutely core to what we're doing. I'm really happy. I would say the company is
really happy with the growth of GitHub over the past couple of years. The
technology integration between GitHub and Microsoft products did really good, but
GitHub has also maintained its own identity, which I think is really, really important
and that's done a wonderful job as a sort of the CEO inside of Microsoft are working
for Scott Guthrie, who runs a huge, huge part of our engineering stack.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Kirk MaterneSo, I'd say, look, we are really pumped about GitHub. This is the year, I think, where
we're going to tell more of the developer tool chain story, because it's not just
GitHub, Visual Studio is incredible set of tools for developers and we're really happy
with the way that business is growing. It's growing really, really healthily. We have a
whole low-code series of technology called the Power Platform. We think the no-
code low-code developer is a sort of ignored developer and we want to serve them
super well with Power Apps and the Power Platform integrated into the rest of the
Microsoft Cloud. So I think FY22 is going to be a big, big year for Microsoft catering
to the needs of ISV developers, but also enterprise developers using this entire tool
chain from Visual Studio to Power Platform to GitHub to all the Azure services geared
towards developers.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
That's helpful. I was going to ask a question on the low-code no-code opportunity,
so I'm glad you touched on, because I want to make sure I get to consumer too,
because I feel like us in the ﬁnancial industry might sure change your consumer
products by two months. So --

{BIO 6054036 <GO>}

{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
So ﬁrst on gaming and consumer. Let's just talk about Xbox and Game Pass is really
set up to change, I think, the way people consume content and you have obviously
acquired a number of studios to build out your own content, there is third-party
content. Just I guess -- like, because you run marketing and pricing and the
consumer market, they both go hand-in-hand. What is kind of the strategy withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 14Christopher C. CaposselaGame Pass and how is it going thus far? It seems to be going pretty well, so just
more if you could touch upon that?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks. Thanks. I'm a huge gamer fan, I am a huge gamer myself and I just
absolutely love how committed we are to this business. For those of you who aren't
really familiar with, the gaming is a massive business and it used to be the gaming
world was sort of split between sort of the PC gamers, who were die hard PC-only,
and console gamers, who loved their particular console, whether it is Xbox or
PlayStation or Switch or the Wii, or what have you.
But what we've seen, as the technology has gotten better and better, gamers actually
game across many platforms. They don't just play on their console or just play on
their PCs. So we've really tried to change the business model of the way we
approach gaming to put the gamer more epicenter, so that our promise is that, hey,
you can play the games that you love with the people that you love, because social is
a big, big part of gaming communities, it's a big part of it, across the devices that
you love. So with Game Pass, you basically pay a monthly fee for access to hundreds
of games. You don't have to buy the game if you don't want to, you can just play that
game and you can play it on the console that was built for or the PC that was built
for.
But we're also -- with our highest tier subscription, we are now hosting consoles in
our own data centers and streaming those games to a variety of endpoints, even in
an Android phone and soon we're going to be testing on the iPhone and the iPad
and to the browser as well as of course Windows PC, so you can think of it as games
streaming to many, many endpoints, really billions of diﬀerent endpoints. And so it's
less console-centric or PC-centric, it's far more gaming-centric and the latest number
we've announced is 18 million Game Pass subscribers worldwide. We've only been at
it a relatively short period of time, so we're thrilled with that growth.
As you saw, Kirk, our Q3, our gaming revenue grew 50%, which is kind of crazy.
Some of that's driven by the new console Xbox Series X and Series S, but a lot of it
frankly is driven by subscriptions and content and services on top of those
subscriptions.
And I'll just to share a couple of crazy stats. One of things we've been blown away
with is that, I can look at someone before they are a Game Pass subscriber and after
they are a Game Pass subscriber and we're ﬁnding that once somebody subscribes
they're spending 20% more time playing games. So they go even deeper into
gaming. They're playing 30% more genres, so they're are exploring just like a Netﬂix
person might explore documentaries or comedy even if they were an action ﬂick
person. 30% more genres and they're playing 40% more games overall, including
games that are outside of the subscription. And so for game developers, Game Pass
is an awesome way for them to take their content and get it in front of gamers. It's
not just, hey, the consumer wins and the publishers lose. This is a real win-win model
and we're pretty excited about that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Of course.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
I could circle back on if I want to be mindful of people that made of the opportune
or taking the advantage of emailing in. So can you just talk about -- I mean, the
question is on sort of GitHub driving conversion to Azure, can you talk about how
that's going? And what you see? Because I think when you bought GitHub, it wasn't
just about the GitHub revenue by itself, it's really about what you said earlier, the
community driving better awareness of Azure, your technical capabilities within IaaS
and PaaS, so can you just talk about that a little bit in terms of how GitHub and Azure,
the interplay between the two?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah. So the engineering teams have worked together to do some really beautiful
things where you -- right from the GitHub, you can take advantage of a whole bunch
of Azure services. You can also take advantage of a whole bunch of our security
services. So from any GitHub, you can actually run a bunch of Microsoft Security
Services on your code to ﬁgure out if the code you're about to use in your product
or in your -- inside your company is secure and that's kind of a beautiful secondary
example that it's not just sort of these Azure core developer services, it's also our
security services that we can bring to GitHub.
And then, the opposite is also true, where you can start in a Microsoft, a traditional
Microsoft product like Visual Studio and of course that's deeply integrated into
GitHub. So there is sort of rows working in both directions, if you will. For GitHub
users, they have very easy, intuitive, seamless access to Microsoft technology; and if
you're using Microsoft technology, GitHub is the natural destination for your code toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Christopher C. Caposselabe able to share it. We've done a whole bunch of cool things where you can stand
up your own developer rig from our cloud working with GitHub, you'd be surprised
how time-intensive it is for a developer to set up a cost of dev box, believe it or not
to have just the tools that they want. We're actually doing that as a cloud dev box, so
you could then pick that up at any time and as a developer you're not spending two
days getting that dev box just right, and that's all obviously being instantiated in our
cloud and deeply integrated into GitHub.
So I think we've only scratched the surface of what's possible here. If you want to use
GitHub and not use any of Microsoft services, of course, you can continue to do that,
that will be very important to continue to respect that, about the GitHub community,
but we want to make it just drop dead easy, if you do.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
That's super helpful. No, I think it's a great combination. I appreciate the comment
about the independence of GitHub too. It's obviously super important to you guys. I
think you've been very forthright about that since you bought it, which I think is
important. (multiple speakers) you don't play games with developers, they have long
memories. So
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Exactly right.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
Very smart on your part. Well, next one was just around sort of voice and UCaaS as
an opportunity for you all and how you think about marketing, but also pricing for
some of the services you have from a phone and voice perspective. Can you just
touch upon that a little, about maybe the strategy behind that versus partnering in
competing, because there is a lot of other vendors and there is some of what you
obviously partnered with. So how are you thinking about that?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, just from a competitor lens, there is no doubt that Cisco is still the
competitor or the company we see the most of on the voice side. Zoom is obviously
very popular for video conferencing, but not so much on mature voice side. So most
of the customers we're talking with all the time these days are really talking about
their Cisco technology. There -- the phones that they have, obviously the routers, the
switches, the telephony that they've built there. And so we're doing a lot of work to
make it very easy for you with Microsoft teams, because this is really where teams
shines, it's not just for video conferencing, it's not just for persistent chat, it actually
lets you do all of these workloads for video conferencing to persistent chat to
telephony to being able to make IP-based phone calls to not have to have the
telephony infrastructure that many companies use or have had traditionally.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Christopher C. CaposselaOften companies want to explore this when they are building a new facility, moving
to a new location, it's on a rapid replace, it's said, hey, I want to take this set of
employees that work in this ﬁeld oﬃce and we want to just make sure they don't
have to have any of the traditional infrastructure. Can we please just do it in teams.
So this coming year you'll hear us making a lot more noise and having more
oﬀerings, frankly, around people who still want a physical phone, but it might not be
connected to the traditional telephony network, they want to connect it to a 100% IP-
based network and they just wanted to meet extension of Teams.
And so I think that will be more to come on that. I don't have anything to enhanced
in terms of pricing or licensing, but I would say that this is a really rich area of
investment for companies. We think we're going to deliver a lot of value here and we
think we should monetize that value. It shouldn't be something that's just a sort of
freebie, so to speak.
But consider Teams at the center of this strategy. As I think you know, we've got
about 145 million daily active users of Teams now, which is double -- almost double a
year ago and the rate of innovation that the Microsoft Teams team has come -- has
released it to the world has just been absolutely fantastic. So expect more from us in
the area of voice, phones, meeting rooms, along with our partners to build a lot of
those devices with us.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
That's super. So I'm getting the notiﬁcation, we got a few minutes left. I'm going to
sneak one last one in there, just because I think it's a little bit of a higher level
question and I was just kind of curious about it, based on some of your commentary.
Low-code no-code, Power Platform, you have Dynamics, you have more
verticalization going on. I mean, it seems to me that the nature of the business
application market might change over time and there's a lot of ways that I think you
all can help that come about citizen developers, business users or from a vertical
perspective, I guess, just do you think that's fair? I mean, I think I understand where
you all are going with that. It is that how you're thinking about marketing, maybe
longer-term around sort of what you historically maybe call business applications,
meaning that there is going to be some business applications that frankly the
company has developed themselves, that don't necessarily come out of more
codiﬁed horizontal solutions. Sorry, I only give you 60 seconds or so to answer that,
but just kind of curious on that.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
I think you're on to it, Kirk, and that's exactly right. I think the days of like the
Salesforce CRM ThinkTool are sort of passe, it's much more modular in these days.
We have something like 26 diﬀerent Dynamics 365 modules that are very speciﬁc to
a ﬁeld service. There is a ﬁeld service module that you can adopt, integrate it into
your data estate, integrate it into the tools that people use on their mobile phone, in
many case it will be a Microsoft Teams solution. So I think you're right that this is
much more about sort of a data plan that you're then attaching modules onto to
solve a particular business process or business application as opposed to theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Kirk Maternetraditional monolithic solution and that's one of the reasons Dynamics 365 is -- grew
45% for us last quarter year-over-year. This is a business that's on the rise, it's much
bigger than it was just a couple of years ago and we're really starting to see our
industry-speciﬁc approach go hand in hand with Dynamics 365, our data platform
and our citizen developer tools, those all come together and I think are really
virtuous cycle that if I could be bold I don't think our competitors have quite
understood yet and customers are really embracing.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
That's helpful. No, it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out, but you can
see the sort of the concentric circles overlapping and having a really interesting I
think next few years around how apps sort of progress from here. So I appreciate
that answer and I'm glad I'm not barking up the wrong tree frankly. So going good
here.
We are literally at time. So, Chris, thanks very much for joining us. I have just
mentioned that Brett Iversen and James Ambrose from IR were on with us. So if you
have any follow-up questions for Chris, please follow up directly with the Microsoft IR
team. Otherwise, thank you all for joining us for the events. And if you have any
follow-up questions for me at Evercore, feel free to reach out directly. Otherwise,
enjoy the rest your day.
