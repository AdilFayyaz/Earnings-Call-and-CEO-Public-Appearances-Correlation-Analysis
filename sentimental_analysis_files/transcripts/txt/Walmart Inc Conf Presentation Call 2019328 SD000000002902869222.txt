So hi, everyone. It's great to be back in the room for our next ﬁreside chat. And it's a
great pleasure to have Brett Biggs, EVP and CFO of Walmart. Walmart has clearly
been a leader in going into multichannel retail and as a shameless plug of our
launch piece last week called the Golden Age of Multichannel. I can't think of
anyone better to have than Walmart and Brett representing Walmart here with us
today. So everyone, thanks for listening. I think the webinar is live. I get the thumbs
up, if that's the case.
And with that, I'm going to hand it oﬀ to Brett for some introductory comments. And
then we'll start the Q&A.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
All right. Great. Thanks, Greg. We've known each other a long time.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Yes. You can probably think it's too long at this point. But...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
So we've got -- I know we've got a forward-looking statement, I think, we're going to
show here, may not. There it is. I get in trouble with attorneys if I don't put this up. So

Yes. I know. It's possible I may make forward-looking statements during this
conversation. So as you think about investing in Walmart, make sure you've looked at
everything that we've said and go to our website and take a look at our materials
there. So I think I've covered that.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
All right. So we'll get onto this -- so let's get into the fun stuﬀ.

Onto the fun stuﬀ.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
So last night, we heard from Hubert Joly at Best Buy. And we had Bill Lennie this
morning with Home Depot. And we're -- I think that there's one theme. It's just how
the consumer is changing so fast and how it's not just about your online sales
anymore and it's not just about your in-store sales. The consumer really expects
multichannel. And they're not going to ask for it. They are only going to go where
that's there. So I guess, I'd love to hear in your words if -- what has Walmart really
done over the last 5 or 10 years to position themselves to win in this environment,
because you guys were ahead of the curve and are getting there, clearly.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It's -- I've been with the company 19 years and maybe as long as I've known you,
I'm not sure. It's -- the amount of change over that period of time certainly is
enormous. When I came into the company, we were, I think, $160 billion in revenue.
And everybody thought Walmart couldn't grow anymore. And now we're more than
3x that size. But for the ﬁrst 10 years of my career, it was really about rolling out
supercenters. Probably even ﬁrst 15 years of my time with the company, it was rolling
out supercenters. And that was a part of the best retail format in the history of the
world, because with supercenter that made sense to do that. I think at times that
made us probably a little -- in hindsight a little slower than we would have liked to
have been, getting to this omni-channel customer and -- but now it's here. You can
see it. I think in the last 3 to four years, we've caught up in a lot of ways. And the
great thing for us is, what's now become I think increasingly apparent is a store base
that's going to be a big, big part of this omni-channel experience and a big part for
the customer, where I think there was doubt from folks 5 or six years ago, what about
the supercenters? Are they really going to be important? I think, today, it's pretty
obvious those supercenters are going to be very important in that strategy. We've
got them. We've got over 5,000 stores in the U.S. that are already there. They are
running eﬃciently. And so in some ways, I think, we've done the hard part, which is
put stores in the ground. And where we've evolved over the last several yearsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

Q - Gregory Scott Melichcertainly is on the eCommerce side. But as you said, it's not -- you can't be a brick-
and-mortar company and an eCommerce company. You've got to be an omni
company. And what we've done around Online Grocery, what we've done about
store pickup are things in some ways that only we can do at scale, given the assets
that we have. That's why I'm so excited. And I think, in the company, we're so excited
about what the future looks like, because you can look at today and say, we're $514
billion company. But the growth that I see next 5, 10 years, it looks diﬀerent certainly
in the last 5 or 10 years. But there is a lot of excitement about what we can do. And
we've got the assets, we've got the ﬁnancial ﬁrepower to do it. And we've got the
will inside the company to do it, got the will with the board to do it. And today, we
just move with great pace to go get things done.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Maybe it was a sell-side analyst -- I'm not going to name myself. But at some point,
maybe we said the supercenter was dead or that it didn't work anymore. It wasn't --
people weren't shopping the whole store. It was too big. It sounds like you've
reached the stage now where it's not necessarily a disadvantage anymore to have
3,600 stores in the ground that are that large. Maybe talk to that a little bit is what's
changed in those last few years that you can really leverage it?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
There's always been an element of convenience. Convenience is a big word that
everybody uses. Today, it's incredibly important with customers. Price will always be
important. But convenience is very important. There is an element of convenience at
supercenter. You have 120,000 at least items in a supercenter that I can go pick up
today and pick up right now. There is 90% of the U.S. that lives within 10 miles of one
of our stores. So the ability to go into our stores or pick up something online on your
way home is really easy. It's part of what people do anyway. We're already part of the
community. So I think that's a big piece of it. There's an element of convenience.
And, I think, it will be there for a long, long time with the supercenter. The ability to
get something today in that 120,000 SKUs fulﬁlls an enormous amount of what
people need. That's why they developed. When you look over time, there will
continue to be products that move more online. I think stores will have a long, long
life with certain types of products. That also gives us space, which I don't -- which I
think is a positive in that there's ways for us to continue to be the center of those
communities that we're in, in those neighborhoods that we're in. There'll be room for
services, which gives you potential for other income streams. But really just another
way to keep in people's lives. We have the ability to do that whether it's ﬁnancial
services, health care and other things that can utilize the space inside those stores.
So over the last 10 years, as we're building supercenters, generally, they've become
a little smaller than they were what we were building 10 years ago. But I think that
space is going to be incredibly valuable for a long, long time.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
So maybe juxtaposition a bit, if you think about the main competitor, at least the way
we look at it, Amazon's GMV is up to about 7% of U.S. retail. You guys are 10% or 11%,
depend how you want to deﬁne the market. Advantage you got the space. When
you were leveraging supercenters before, you've got the traﬃc. But then there was aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 18A - Brett M. Biggs
Q - Gregory Scott Melich

A - Brett M. Biggspoint where you couldn't monetize that traﬃc. That's -- I want to say it was maybe 10,
12 years ago. Now it seems like -- or I guess, the question is you got the traﬃc back.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, yes, traﬃc...
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
So if you put on your CFO hat, when can we monetize that traﬃc? Amazon certainly
looks like they've decided to monetize traﬃc in the last 18 months given the way
their margins have exploded through, not the traditional 1P sales. But 3P subscription
services advertising. How do you think about, as a CFO, making sure we monetize
some of this traﬃc resurgence?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, some of it you've seen. We've made investments over the last, certainly, 3 or
four years both on the eCommerce side as well as the store side, to ensure that
longer term we can get more productive. In those -- in the supercenters, our
associates have better tools than they had 2 or three years ago to better serve our
customers. And it allows us to be more eﬃcient within those stores. You've seen us
take opportunities to -- we've trialed some things in health care. We have a big
ﬁnancial services business. You've seen us -- you heard us talk more recently about
things like ad revenue. That's utilizing the space more on the website actually than
utilizing the space inside the stores. But I think we are starting to utilize that. I think
there is still ways in which we haven't fully demonstrated what we can do. We're
testing a lot of things. We're trialing a lot of things. And you've seen with, potentially
-- in particular with Online Grocery, where we -- I was looking at a transcript that I did
three years ago at a conference. And we weren't even talking about Online Grocery
really three years ago. Today, it's becoming a really big part of what we do. So when
we ﬁnd something that's working, we will lean into it really quickly and put the
investment behind it. And we have the ﬁnancial resources to put the investment
behind it.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
So maybe let's go right to there. We got there eventually. So where are we now
today with click-and-collect in terms of number of stores? Does your online customer
who I think spends at least double probably the average basket, I'm guessing here --
how does click-and-collect look in that? And how do you really continue to scale and
leverage that the way it's really enabled? It seems like it's been a real enabler to
reaccelerate eCommerce.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
And it's been an enabler -- it's been a real halo with our customer. When we started
rolling this out -- we're up to a couple thousand stores now, we'll be around 3,000
by the end of the year. When we started to rolling this out, I noticed more comments,
whether it was on Twitter or Facebook or in social media around, from customers
going this is the greatest thing I've ever seen. And we would get these testimonials
then from customers, like, wait, we really have something here with Online GroceryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

Page 5 of 18Q - Gregory Scott Melich

Q - Gregory Scott Melich
A - Brett M. Biggsthat's hit a chord with that customer. And so, it's grown very rapidly. And we've
leaned into that. Now when you lean into things like that, these are the things you
say, hey, let's put that on hold. We've got to make -- get this right. And so we've put a
lot of emphasis into that. And it's caused the customer to look at us in diﬀerent way.
We've talked about before, maybe even with you, where -- part of what you got to
do is make sure is that search goes through someone's head of where am I going to
shop? That Walmart gets to the top of that search. And we were always there in the
stores certainly. But now with stores, with eCommerce and all the new brands we've
put on eCommerce, the partnerships we've done in eCommerce, with Online
Grocery, with delivery, we are deﬁnitely getting higher and higher on that list with
the customers of I get what I need at Walmart. And Online Grocery, I think, has been
a real kick for that.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
So online has been growing 40%, let's say. I can't remember if you guys -- I mean,
Online Grocery has been half the growth, give or take.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's a signiﬁcant part of the growth.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Signiﬁcant part. So what's next after that? In other words, now that you've get people
sort of hooked on coming back to Walmart, just to get the grocery shop. But then,
like, wow, what's the key enabler? Is it when they have downloaded the app and now
it's just that much easier to add 5 more things to the basket? Or is it frequency, which
is where you're seeing that customer engaged?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's been a number of things. Once you get on the app, it's very easy to use. There
were -- I want to say it was about a year ago, we put in Easy Reorder, which is once
you've set up an order, it's very easy, just go click, click, click. That's the same items I
want. And I do that. I watch even how my wife shops. In 5 minutes, she got an Online
Grocery order ready and goes and picks it up. She goes in our stores still. But not as
often as she used to because of Online Grocery. But -- and what you'll see with
Online Grocery over time too is we're going to expand that basket. So one of the
next legs with that is in every -- probably every time you look at our app, you'll see
more items on the site than you would have seen before. And over time, our ability
to better mix out that basket from a margin perspective is a real beneﬁt. There's a lot
of our competitors that are doing Online Grocery. But we'll be able to mix that
basket out much diﬀerently than our competitors. And that will be a big advantage.
Over time, you'll see us continue, I think, to get more and more involved with that
customer in their home. You've seen things that we've tested with Google. You've
seen a partnership we did with August Lock on having people go into the homes.
We're testing some of that, again, today. We're going to get more and more involved
in that customer's life to where they don't even have to think about shopping with
Walmart. They're just shopping. And we're keeping them in stock.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

That's maybe another segue to sort of looking at strategy more broadly. You've done
a lot of eﬀorts to shift the global portfolio. Could you update us there in terms of
where you are in that process? And are we thinking about which markets to focus on
or not and sort of an update on Asda. And what's going on, on that side?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Sure. So we've been pretty clear that our -- all the pieces of our international
portfolio are important. We're very focused on North America. So they includes
Canada and Walmex. And sometimes, Walmex doesn't get the credit it deserves. It's
been an amazing success story for the company in the last 20 years, deﬁnitely in the
last ﬁve years and probably one of the best retailers in the world. So I'll put a plug in
for Walmex because they are just a great business. China and India will be a very
important part of what we do going forward. There's very few places in the world
you ﬁnd 1.3 billion people. And you ﬁnd that in both of those markets. And we made
a big move in India last year and are excited about the opportunities there and what
we can do in that market. To Asda speciﬁcally, there's not a lot I can say. As you can
appreciate, we don't agree with the provisional conclusions that came out from the
CMA. Still going through that process. We owned Asda. We own Asda today. And
the business is actually performing well. Management team has done well. And we'll
just -- we'll keep running it. Keep helping the U.K. customer.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
You're doing a good job.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Best you can.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Maybe on that front, with India and then follow-up on China and maybe tariﬀs, we'll
go down that path a little bit. You bought Flipkart. We're now sort of a year into that.
Given some of the legal changes in India, what do you wish you've done diﬀerent, if
anything? And where we go from here? I know you talked originally about
potentially IPO'ing that business at some point in the future. Does some of the
changes there change your thought process on that front?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
So we've been in India for more than 10 years. And so we've seen regulation
changes in India before. Like any other country, you're going to see regulation
changes from time to time. What we want is predictability in a market and a level-
playing ﬁeld. That's what we look for in any market that we go into. So that's
important. Nothing has changed in our minds about India. The opportunity is there.
When you see the increase in online penetration, mobile usage, middle income, all
of that was true a year ago. It's still true today. So we feel really good about the
opportunity in India. We really were excited and are very excited about theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

A - Brett M. Biggsecosystem that Flipkart had developed. And when you look at companies, ourselves,
Alibaba, Amazon, others around the world, they've really developed that ecosystem
with their customers. And Flipkart was a great example, one that's really already
been put together when you look at logistics and what they're doing in apparel and
online and payments, which is a very interesting piece of the business. That was
already put together. And we felt like that we can build upon that. So we're excited
about what we can do in India. China is a very diﬀerent market than India. We're
continuing to have really good success on the store side, particularly Sam's Club.
Sam's Club has done really well in China. It's a great format for us there. The income
levels ﬁt very nicely in what we want to do with Sam's Club. Smaller formats over
time, maybe something that would be, be interesting there. And of course, the
eCommerce business and the partnership that we have with JD. And there's a
number of things that we're working on with them. We've taken an interest in JD
Daojia, which is the delivery business, which is a big part of what happens in China,
as you know. There's a lot of things that we're doing that we're partnering, we're
owning some things and just a lot of opportunity in those 2 markets.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
So that's -- in the markets, there are -- maybe that's a transition to the tariﬀs. So I'll
use the Evercore ISI estimate that about $50 billion of your COGS come directly or
indirectly from China. Don't conﬁrm or deny it, you can if you want.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I won't.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
I know you won't. So feel free to just jump right there. But within that grand context, I
would say you guys -- so last year, we went from this -- we had the ﬁrst $50 billion,
then next $200 billion. And then had 10%. And we had this discussion last night with
Hubert a little bit. It seems like a couple of those leading companies, like yourselves
and Best Buy, were quite successful and explained so what this could do to the U.S.
consumer, how it could put some real pressure on the consumer from an inﬂationary
standpoint. Could you just sort of update us from that front as to what you've been
able to do to help mitigate that impact on the customer? And going forward, where
you think the path out of this is? And where do you think -- from your planning
purposes, where do you think you're going to end up?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I mean we'll conﬁrm. Over 2/3 of our purchases are made in the U.S. So I will conﬁrm
it for you. And then we -- the rest of it will be purchased from markets, including
China. And particularly when you look around the world, most of our sourcing is
done locally because of the big food businesses that we have in those markets. We
have been pretty vocal about how we feel about making sure our customers get the
best prices. And we want fair trade and we want free trade. We want both of those
things. And so, we've had opportunities to say we think we should on those topics.
We've been pretty clear that there's -- and you've asked this question a number of
times. There's diﬀerent ways you can manage through that. And our merchants areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

A - Brett M. Biggson top of it. If you look at where you're sourcing, you look at the cost structure of
your suppliers and other things you can help them with, to help with those
challenges, how do you mix the box diﬀerently. And it's very category speciﬁc, as
you know, as you think about tariﬀs. So it's tough to have about just kind of a broad
conversation about that. Having said that, if we -- if all of the tariﬀs that have been
discussed over the last six months, if they went into place, prices will go up. They're
going to go up for everybody. And I think the administration knows that. Where we
go from here, I don't know. It seems to change from time to time. You hear the same
things I do about what's going on from a tariﬀ perspective. But we want the lowest
cost and price we can get for our customers. That's important to us. And we'll -- I
think, we'll always be in a better position than some to make sure that's the case. But
there's a level of tariﬀs by which you can't oﬀset.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
And we're maybe not there yet. But we could be given some of the things that we're
throwing out. Is that a fair summary?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It seems to change from time to time. So -- and how we get our way out of this is -- to
other people, I would say.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Okay. Sounds good. Fingers crossed on that. So maybe something that we have
another view that's important is the U.S. consumer. So we've spent a lot of time
parsing through how the tax cuts, we think, helps retail sales, maybe 50 bps last year.
And this year it will be less. So we think retail sales will decelerate modestly to
around 4% growth. How have you seen it between the government shutdown earlier,
the movement in the SNAP payments coming earlier and now tax refunds, they
should be positive. But so far they haven't been. So I just wanted to hear. Real-time,
are you seeing a larger paycheck cycle than you did a year or 2 ago? Or is the
consumer -- your consumer feeling good right now? Or is there pressures there that
we're not fully aware of?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We talked about in -- when we released Fourth Quarter, we had a pull forward in
sales into January from the early release of beneﬁts. But overall, the consumer still
feels pretty good to us, looks pretty good to us. When you look at -- fuel prices are
still in pretty good shape. Interest rates are low. Unemployment is good. Wage
growth has been pretty good, particularly, I think, lower income in the last year or so.
All of that pretty favorable for -- particularly for the U.S. economy. We still see some
paycheck cycle. It's not quite as distinct as it used to be. For one reason, states have
changed in many cases how they allocate that. It isn't always in the ﬁrst of month or
the end of the month. It's a little more rapidly spread out through the month. So we
don't see that quite as much as we used to. But you still see a little bit of that. Tax
refunds, I've been with the company 19 years. I've seen every ﬂow, I think, of tax
refunds you can see during that. For us, it's always in the First Quarter and no matter
how it happens. So we -- it doesn't tend to impact how we see the quarter. ButFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

A - Brett M. Biggsmonth-to-month it varies quite a bit. I've seen every diﬀerent pattern, I think, you can
see on that.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Have you seen this pattern yet?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
What's that?
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Have you seen this pattern where it should be positive but it's not for some reason?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think it does reﬂect each one of them is -- it's its own unique pattern. But overall, I
think, you've seen the same numbers I do. I don't think tax refund dollars are
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than they've been. And customers tend to still spend that
money when they get it.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Yes. So maybe transitioning to a little bit more of the operations of business. Again,
put on the CFO hat. You had this nice resurgence of traﬃc and the customers giving
you credit for, I think, really engaging the omni-channel. It has come at a cost where
margins, I think, what used to be almost 8%, now they're 5.5%. So help us
understand that margin trajectory. I think in your guidance for this year, it eﬀectively
assumes ﬂattish. If you think sort of longer term, is that -- have we done enough
investments of that? And how will we actually see the turn? And what actually -- will it
ever turn if we think about margins over time?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We -- when you think about the productivity loop that we always talk about, rate
matters, the dollars matter more. So if I could lower or needed to lower rate in a way
that would grow comp sales to a point to where I can grow those dollars more and
more, there's typically a trade-oﬀ you're willing to make the way that we look at the
world. As you said, margin rates have come down. Most of that has been gross
margin. But expenses have gone up as well. We're around 21% SG&A. We were
around 20% a few years ago. And that's been investments in wages, have been
investments in eCommerce, have been investments in technology, all of which I
would say we're glad we made. And it's helping with comp. It's helping with traﬃc.
And so, we are getting -- starting to see the payback from those investments. You've
seen us talk more about expenses recently. And the reason that is, is we'll continue
to make investments as a company. If we can get our expense percentage in line
with where we want it to be, it gives us more ﬂexibility versus our competitors to
make decisions from a margin perspective. I believe gross margin, over time, to
some degree, gets determined by competitors -- and the market and the customer
to some degree will determine what your gross margins can be. We have some --
certainly some ﬂexibility on how we invest in price, how we mix up product, all ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

A - Brett M. Biggsthat. So we can manage that. If you get your expenses in line, it's a diﬀerent level of
ammunition, potentially than some of your customers have to make decisions. And
so, that's why we've gotten more focused on expenses over the last two years. But
we're attacking expenses in a really diﬀerent way. In the past, it would have been
pretty typical. Let's cut here, here and here, this peanut butter type approach to
expenses. We're taking a much more automated approach. So how do we
automate? How do we change a process in a way that's sustainable? Because if you
go, make those cuts in a peanut butter approach, they don't work. They're not
sustainable. And they come back. Sometimes, they come back more than they were -
- you get more back than you cut. And that happens. The way we're trying to attack
expenses now is very diﬀerent. I brought in somebody under my team a little under
two years ago to lead this cost transformation. And while it's really -- I mean it's really
embedded in each one of the businesses. But centrally looking at making sure we
really can get our data in a way that gives us a better way to make decisions. How do
you get coordination among the company? How do you get more visibility to the
executive committee to say, okay, we're saving $20 million here, let's get that $20
million up the executive committee. So they know where to spend this. So if I save
$20 million in a certain part of the company, we don't necessarily need to spend that
$20 million back in that same part of the company. We may want to spend that
somewhere else. And today, because of what we've done, we have better visibility to
be able to make some of those decisions. So I feel better about the sustainability of
it.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
And as you roll that up, is it fair to say that in the world we're living now and as omni-
channel continues to grow, that more investment would come in the P&L as opposed
to traditional CapEx or working capital? Maybe that's the transition we think about
the pieces. Or am I little too far?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Well CapEx is lower than it was 3 or four years ago. 3 or four years ago, it would have
been $13 billion, even $14 billion, $15 billion of CapEx. Now at around $11 billion. So it
has come down CapEx -- type of CapEx has changed dramatically with much -- many
fewer new stores. So some of it -- it's probably a little more P&L focus. And even on
the CapEx side, I think you tend to usually -- I get question about depreciation, is you
have shorter-lived assets and so that does impact depreciation more quickly than it
does in the past. So there's some of that as well.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
So I think, maybe going forward, we tend to focus on -- the market tends to focus on
the next quarter or this year. And I'll say, your EBIT margin's coming down. But it
feels that your CapEx has come down at the same time. So maybe asked another
way is that how do you feel about the ability to keep generating $15 billion, $20
billion of free cash ﬂow?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
That's where you go with cash ﬂow, right?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

Q - Gregory Scott Melich{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. The last 3 or four years, we've taken out over $10 billion of working capital,
which has helped certainly with that number on the operating cash ﬂow side. I don't
know if the opportunity to drive that much in the next few years is there. But we're
continuing to drive pretty good progress on working capital. Our CapEx has been
pretty steady over the last few years. And so, I think, a steady number on that free
cash ﬂow line feels good. I don't know exactly -- I wouldn't come out and say what
that number is. So it depends some on working capital.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
So the $11 billion feels good. What is the mix now versus 5 or 10 years ago as you
were just...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, dramatically diﬀerent, even three years ago. I want to go back to FY '15. We were
spending over 70%, I think, on new stores. Roughly 2/3 on new stores and clubs.
Today, it will be less than 20%, new stores and clubs. So much more on technology,
much more on supply chain, eCommerce. But also on the remodels. We're spending
more and more on remodels. And I wouldn't -- and not in the classical way you think
about remodels. It's certainly going to make sure the stores are in good shape. But
the focus on customer-facing initiatives, how do we use the stores diﬀerently, how do
you allocate more space to pick up things like that as we go and remodel the store.
It's much more customer facing, I think, than just how you would typically think about
a remodel.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Well I guess the -- it all becomes intertwined, right, because if you're investing in
eCommerce and eCommerce is multichannel, then a remodel that click-and-collect,
like where do you put it?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You've got to increase Wi-Fi in stores. You've got to make sure you're doing it,
because when you walk around a store, you see people -- how many people are on
their phones doing diﬀerent things. You need the Wi-Fi bandwidth to make sure they
can come in and enjoy themselves while you are in the stores -- while they are in
your stores.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Do you think that balance now is sub-20% on sort of classic new stores, is the right
sort of selling level or where do you -- if we're going to see it fade to 10% or is it...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

Most of new store growth we have today would be in Mexico and China to some
degree. When I say Mexico, Central America included. So it's smaller stores for one.
And most of those markets other than Sam's Club is in China. I do think it could end
up being a little bit lower than that. We're basically not opening new stores in the
U.S. for the most part. And that's where most of the capital was going.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Got it. So if we think about the priority of using the free cash ﬂow. So that's the fun
part. Could you sort of rank the hierarchy of needs? And so how you and the board
and management are thinking about allocating that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I'll start back on operating cash ﬂow, if I can, as that -- the last is on CapEx. Wherever
we think we can get a return on investment over a period of time that makes sense,
we're going to do that ﬁrst. We're going to invest in the business. So whatever that
number -- we think that number needs to be that we can get a return on, that's
where we're going to start. We're very committed to our dividend, 46 straight years
of increases. Now as we retire a few shares, actually that number in the dollar basis
doesn't go up. It actually stays about ﬂat. I still feel good about our share repurchase
program. And that's kind of how you go from operating cash ﬂow down to free cash
ﬂow. I still feel good about our company. I feel good about the value of the
company.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
On the acquisition front, you've obviously got a lot.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Couple of big ones.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
A lot to digest just recently, the largest in history last year. So do we -- if something
made sense, would you do that again or are you willing to let leverage go up? I
mean, you guys have always run a very conservative balance sheet. I mean, do you
have a debt-to-EBITDAR target or any sort of other metric that we should think about
that you're trying to run the business around?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We look at all of those things. We've been very committed to our AA credit. It served
us -- have served us well over the years for sure in the way that we borrowed even to
fund the Flipkart deal, which showed the great strength of our balance sheet. We're
going to do what's right for the business long term. And I think in those decisions,
you balance the beneﬁt of what you would be buying versus any detriment you
would take from a downgrade in your credit rating. But it's -- we feel good about that
AA rating. But we're going to do what's right for the business long term.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

Maybe I'll tie it together with one last strategic question. I want to make sure the
audience has a few. If we think about how that capital has been allocated and there's
been that shift that we've had. And we've done the M&A. If you think about some of
the actions others have taken in the last few years, I'm thinking Amazon in particular,
would you consider acquisitions even in the home market of a traditional retailer? Is
that something that maybe the -- legally we thought would never be allowed. But
Amazon was allowed to buy Whole Foods. So maybe that is allowed or is it just -- it's
just not even a priority given all the other things you could do with your capital?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I don't think you ever say never. But we feel good about the store base that we
have in the U.S. What you've seen us spend more time on and more resources on
recently, put Flipkart aside because that was another country. But in the U.S.
speciﬁcally been more capabilities, Even Jet to some degree was -- as a website,
there's a lot of capabilities, technology involved in that. You've seen us partner.
When you start -- Greg, when you start following the company, we bought 100% of
everything. That's what we did. We like to own everything. And today, we're much
more open, a few minority ownerships, partnerships. And as you think about where
we go in the future, there's always -- we have to sit back and say, what I want to own,
what's really important that we own? Where can I partner? Where can I take a
minority interest? And to some degree, it's how can I speed up what I'm doing?
What's the best way to speed up what we're doing?
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
So it's really capability. It doesn't need a huge -- a big balance sheet. It's basically
we're doing something, we see we need it. But we can get there faster if we add this
on...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think it looks more like that. I said never say never on what we wouldn't or would
do. But capability is probably a better way to look at it going forward.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Yes. That's great. So we'll make sure we leave some time for questions for the
audience. I'm sure we'll have found that there is a microphone to walk around. That
will be great. And if -- so, Mike, you're there. Anybody raise their -- so this -- when we
webinar, sometimes people are real shy. So we have one question.

A - Brett M. BiggsThe investment in the grocery pickup. In the ﬁrst go around, are you giving yourself
enough capacity to sell general merchandise?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
From a storage capacity standpoint?
From a storage capacity, what you're doing to the storage now? Do you have to
make another round of CapEx in order to get the mix to more general merchandise?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It is interesting when you -- typically when you start out something -- and the good
thing for this is that it's exceeded our expectations. So there are some places,
particularly in the initial stores, where we've had to go back and retroﬁt some things
to be able to do -- not only do what you're talking about. But handle the capacity of
what we're doing. But it's not incredibly capital-intensive to go do that. The good
thing is we have a lot of space. And in some -- and a lot of stores, it's not that diﬃcult
to move space around, move a wall here or there. So I wouldn't anticipate a great
deal of capital because of that.
Is it an operational hurdle then in general merchandising the basket?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, I wouldn't call it a hurdle. But it is more about how you pick the product. And for
instance, one would be apparel. To make sure you're -- what you're showing online
and what's actually in the store, size and color, apparel is a little more tricky than
some. But most of what we do is lightbulbs, screwdriver, golf balls. It's not that
diﬃcult to pick. You just have to go to diﬀerent parts of the stores. But we're putting
in -- we've been putting in a lot of technology and we'll continue to do that to make
that picking...
(technical diﬃculty)
That's one of the things you want to do from a proﬁtability standpoint on picking. It's
just making it more and more eﬃcient for the personal shopper to do that.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Does that end up adding more labor to the stores or basically there's so much
productivity going on now that it's just a reallocation of -- I mean I'm just...

Q - Gregory Scott MelichIt's more of a reallocation. We've taken -- because of technology we've put in the
back end, you've seen some of that. And in the front-end, we have fewer people in
the back-end and fewer people in the front-end. If you go into a Walmart store today
versus 3 or four years ago, you will see more people on the ﬂoor. You will notice this.
And so, to some degree, it has been reallocation.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Interesting. But they are in the middle picking stuﬀ or...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Well some picking but some helping customers as well.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Right, helping customers. And the self-checkout trend -- have we gone as far as we
can go with that or is that...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's hard to say. I don't think so. When I look at what's going on at -- particularly at
Scan & Go at Sam's Club, that continues to ramp up. So customers like it. They like --
the balance is trying to ﬁgure out what the right mix is. For each store, it's really
diﬀerent in how customers use this. So making sure you have enough lanes. If they
don't want to use self-checkout then they can get to the lanes. And those lane lines
then don't become too long because it forces all the complicated baskets or the
bigger baskets into the lanes. You just got to make sure you got the staﬀ right. Each
store is really unique.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Maybe I'll just keep following up on that. The Scan & Go reminded me of Amazon
Go. So there maybe sort of a push in that direction. What have you guys done on the
front of that type of store and tested and piloted it? Like, where do you think where it
works and where it doesn't, given your experience there?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We have a test store that we have right now with Sam's Club, actually in Dallas. I was
in Dallas yesterday. So we've been doing some of this as well. Think limited is really
limited assortment, low traﬃc stores, certainly easier to do something like that, to
drive the amount of traﬃc that we drive in the store. I think you continue to see more
and more move towards that, towards customers can come in and get what they
want. The higher the SKU count goes, the more -- and the more you have variable
weight products and things like that, the more challenging that...

It's more challenging. Scan & Go is a perfect ﬁt with what you do at Sam's Club,
limited SKU environment. I love it. I go and SNAP 2, 3 items out of the club.
Supercenter, we had -- at Scan & Go, we're still doing some things like that. And
people ask, have we quit doing Scan & Go? No, you try things, you learn, you adjust.
At some point, you'll see something like that at Walmart as well.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
Great. Anything -- Mike, why don't you -- you look like you wanted to ask one?
So just from a margin rate perspective, Brett, maybe you could talk about some of
the key kind of driving variables there and just the way that we ought to think about
those things that could either cause EBIT margin to go up or down, especially in the
core U.S. business?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, sure. Gross margin rates -- it's a really diﬃcult discussion at a macro level
because it's so category speciﬁc and there's so many pieces of that. You have
transportation expenses, which have been challenging over the last year. It feels like
that's starting to settle down a little bit. I'll go back to how I answer the question on
expenses a little bit, probably which is, if we can get our expenses to where I think
we should get them, it gives you more room on the gross margin line to do what you
need to do. We're very thoughtful about price investment. We feel good -- in
general, we feel good about our price gaps. We didn't feel as good about them
three years ago. We've invested a lot. And we feel pretty good about price gaps. So
we're going to make sure we're very strategic and thoughtful about that. You can
invest in price and just keep investing in price. We want to make sure we have the
right price for our customers. But we're going to be really thoughtful about that. That
is smart for our investors as well. But getting expenses in line to be able to do what
we feel like we should and need to do from a competitive perspective on the gross
margin line is really important. The mix of business between traditional eCommerce-
type categories and what you do in the store makes a diﬀerence, although I think
those margin mixes will evolve over time. In eCommerce, you've seen us doing more
in the store, in home and apparel. Home and apparel have really good margins
generally. And so try to mix it out diﬀerently that way. And you've seen companies
we've acquired as well as the brands we've tried to get on our sites have been more
in the home and apparel lines. So there's just a lot of diﬀerent things that we can do.
And the great thing about our box is having 120,000 SKUs, we have a lot of diﬀerent
ways to mix out that box and the site. When I say the box, the site as well. But some
competitors, I think, don't have the ability to do that because they just don't have the
assortment we have. Does that make sense?
Yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-28

Okay, Brett, thanks very much. As you think about the longer-term model and the
balance between, kind of, SG&A leverage and gross margin, just holistically when
you think about the business, what are you kind of -- what line are you managing to?
It seems almost like there's a lot of opportunity for yourselves to manage to the top
line by reinvesting any sort of SG&A leverage over a longer multi-year period to kind
of continue the momentum that you've seen and the share gains that you've seen?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's a balance. We -- the executive committee. So Doug and his direct reports, most
of what we spend our time on are making strategic choices, where do we invest, the
P&L as well as CapEx? When we have those discussions, the P&L and the balance
sheet are sitting right there along with ROI and other things as we try to discuss that.
And you've got to look short term as well as long term. Top line growth is really
important. And it just drives eﬃciencies in your business and it drives stickiness with
the customer that we need long term. That is a true sense of the health of the
business. But we have to do it in a way that's smart. Where we ﬁnd things that are
working, like Online Grocery, we really, really need to lean in. And you'll see us lean
in more quickly than we have in the past. You'll see us scale things more quickly. I
think you'll also see us stopping things more quickly than we used to. When
something is not working, we'll stop it quicker than we used to because we need
those dollars to fund what we really want to invest. The challenge with the company
a size of Walmart is you can be investing $30 million here, $40 million here, $50
million here, $60 million here and you can really add up over time. And I think we've
gotten better about -- because of all we have done with cost transformation, look at
those pockets and say, we're not doing that anymore. It's not important. But we are
going to do this. This is going to grow top line. We can do some other things that will
help us on the bottom line. And we know, particularly -- I know in my role, we've got
to balance this in a way that when we come out and give you guidance for a year,
that it makes sense to you. You understand what we're doing and that the balance is
right.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
I think that's the right note to end on. So Brett, I really appreciate you ﬁnally joining
us here. We'll see the store later. And we'll see all those magic in action. Thanks a lot,
thanks for coming.
