Thanks everyone for coming. I am Chris Danely, the senior semiconductor analyst
here at JPMorgan. It is hard to believe it is our 11th Annual Tech Forum here. It just
keeps getting bigger and bigger along with my waistline, which I guess sometimes is
a good thing.
Anyway, remember the format is 30 minutes per presentation. It is pure ﬁreside chat
so all Q&A. So whenever anybody has a question feel free to raise your hand or
throw some rotten fruit or something like that to get our attention. That is the goal.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
No, don't do that.
{BIO 3509857 <GO>}
To start things oﬀ we had NVIDIA who is going to be introduced by my trusty cohort
here, Harlan Sur. But again, everybody have fun and hopefully we all ﬁnd out
something today. Thanks a lot for coming.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Chris. So to get things started here we have NVIDIA. We are very
pleased to have Rob Csongor, who is Vice President of Investor Relations for NVIDIA,
here with us this morning. Thanks, Rob, for joining us.

NVIDIA held their press event on Sunday and I think that one of the overall sort of
overarching themes was the untethering of video gaming. Essentially gaming
anywhere, on any screen. And on any device. And to support that the team
introduced a plethora of products.
So Rob, maybe to get things kicked oﬀ here, why don't you provide an overview of
what the team rolled out on Sunday? Then we can open it up for Q&A.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Okay, sure. I guess to summarize I would start with I guess what our biggest surprise
was. We unveiled an NVIDIA handheld gaming device called Project SHIELD. I think
that was the only actual secret that we actually managed to keep at CES. I think
everything else -- as you know, we also announced Tegra 4 which was probably the
worst kept secret at CES.
But I think Project SHIELD was a surprise for most people. But the more we have
talked with press I think one of the common questions that we have gotten is what
took you guys so long. I think most people associate NVIDIA with gaming expertise.
It is at the core of NVIDIA.
It is certainly a huge market. It is the largest consumer entertainment segment. I
think, just to give you guys a frame of reference. And we always talk about gaming. A
lot of times when we talk to the Street -- people always smile when you say gaming.
But just to give you an idea, the number one movie this year, blockbuster movie in
2012, was The Avengers. In the ﬁrst 72 hours. So the opening weekend box oﬃce
revenue for The Avengers was about $160 million in revenue.
This year the number one blockbuster video game was Call of Duty Black Ops 2. The
ﬁrst 24 hours of Black Ops 2 was $500 million. So it is signiﬁcantly -- it is very big
business, on the order of about $12 billion to $13 billion when you add up all of the
diﬀerent components. It is 65% of what people do on a tablet and on a smartphone.
So there is a lot of obvious market opportunity there.
So one of the things that we did is we announced this gaming device. One of the
things that I wanted to make clear was -- because we got questions afterwards -- was,
hey, this is a game console. Isn't the game console business model to subsidize it
and make money oﬀ of the content?
Obviously the ﬁrst thing we are pointing out is this gaming devices is Android. It is
pure Android. It is an Android gaming device and that is an open platform. So the
ﬁrst thing we demonstrated is you are on Google Play, you could launch any app that
is on Android.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Harlan SurHowever, it does have other things. You can then go to TegraZone and play some
amazing games. We showcased Hawken, which is a brand-new game just ported to
Tegra 4. So at the heart -- by the way, I just want to make it clear -- at the heart of this
handheld gaming device which we call Project SHIELD is Tegra 4.
So Tegra 4 we also launched at Sunday. It is the world's fastest mobile processor. It
has 72 graphics cores. Just to give you a frame of reference, Tegra 3 is 12. And Tegra
3 I think is widely regarded as pretty good.
So 72 graphics core. It is the ﬁrst quad A15 processor. So it is a 4-plus-1 architecture,
kind of the big/little architecture that we started with Tegra 3. Yet for all of that it runs
at roughly half the power of Tegra 3 in most use cases. So we are pretty excited
about it.
The other thing that we announced was the GRID server, which was something we
disclosed earlier in the year. But this is basically the expansion of our GPU business
into the server. So what it is is GPUs on a rackmount product. It's designed by
NVIDIA. It goes into a server rack and it delivers an enormous amount of processing
capability for gaming.
And it is virtualized. So what you can do is think of it as Netﬂix for gaming. Imagine
next year with any luck you check into the hotel here and one of the things you will
be able to do is turn on your TV and there is a controller there and you could play
Black Ops 2. There is no game console. There is no PC. There is just an Ethernet
cable plugged into the back of the television.
So one of the things we demonstrated. And I don't know that -- I wouldn't call Project
SHIELD the intersection point. But it ties all these things that NVIDIA has been
working on together. You have -- just to make it clear, what you were doing is you are
seeing somebody playing with a handheld device that is pure Android and then you
say I want to stream it to my TV. I want to play it on my TV.
So we had a 4K LG TV. You can just play any Android game. You could play special
games designed for Tegra. We then have a partnership with Steam where we then
press a button and now you can play, you can access your PC, which is somewhere
else in the house, wirelessly. You now start playing Assassin's Creed, which is a very
high-end PC game, on your TV.
Then you say I want to connect to my GRID server, whatever your service provider is
for games. Now you can play a game oﬀ the Internet and play it on your TV through
the Project SHIELD device. So it has been very exciting.
I think I was just showing you -- we turned on Bing this morning and we were listed
as one of the top ﬁve coolest things at CES. So we are pretty happy about it and
looking forward to hopefully making some money oﬀ of it.

Harlan SurYes, Project SHIELD has certainly generated a lot of interest, as you mentioned. I
guess the question that the market is asking is when is SHIELD going to be available
and at what price points is SHIELD going to be available to consumers and through
what distribution channels are you going to try to launch this product?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Those are all ﬁne questions that I can't answer right now. We have said that it is
available in Q2. But we haven't announced a distribution strategy. We will obviously
have a distribution strategy and we will roll that out when we can.
I think the most often asked question is how much. There has been a number of
articles, some analyst reports that have pointed out things like what it should be
priced at. If you guys have opinions, we will be happy to take them.
But I mean essentially you are looking at the functionality of, say, an iPod Touch plus
a JAMBOX plus a game controller. I mean that is about $450 worth of stuﬀ. I am not
saying that is the price. But we will roll all the details out a little later on.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Okay. Then on Tegra 4, at the event on Sunday I think the team showed some
performance comparisons relative to the iPad 4, relative to the Nexus 10 tablet and a
bunch of other tablets. Performance was, by far, better with the Tegra 4-based
platforms.
The team is sampling the product now and the design cycles, whether it is
smartphones or tablets or compute platforms, is fairly lengthy. So I guess the
question is given the solid traction that you had with Tegra 3 last year in tablets, the
Surface, the Nexus 7, the Nabi 2. And others, do you anticipate your share in the
tablet market with Tegra 4 will be higher in 2013 than it was in 2012?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
It is hard to say. It is really hard to say. I think that we obviously got a good start and
we have -- I think the last report we were a higher market share in Android than
anybody and certainly in Windows.
But obviously everyone is forecasting the tablet market to grow pretty fast, to be the
size of the notebook business within two years. As part of that there is a very large
ecosystem starting to form. Everything from Shanzhai tablets in China, millions and
millions of low cost units, children's tablets.
I don't know if you guys saw the -- did you see the Nabi Jr.?

Harlan SurYes.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Nabi Jr. was launched. It is a kid's tablet using Tegra 2 and it is at Walmart at the end
of this month for $99.
So anyways, we are not going to win all of them. I know we are not going to win all of
them. I think we will do ﬁne. We are not going to win all of them. But I think the
combination of all of that plus I think what you are going to see is Tegra showing up
in more types of devices.
We have talked about our automotive business. We have embedded business. We
have -- obviously, you saw Project SHIELD so you know that you can make a gaming
device out of it. In fact, mobile devices I think have become your preferred gaming
device for many people. So there is just a lot of diﬀerent markets that are possible, I
think, with this type of technology.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
2012 was the year where we did see some of your competitors exit the applications
processor market. Texas Instruments, Freescale -- they had some, I would say, fairly
substantial customer engagement. So with the exit of these two competitors have
you seen a new set of customers that are coming to NVIDIA to engage with you on
your Tegra platform?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Nothing that we can announce or talk about. I mean, sure, we would love to do a
tablet for Amazon and we would love to do a tablet for a lot of people. So we will
see. I don't know what we can talk about there.
But I think just qualitatively, I think one thing that has become clear I think is that it is
easy to do something, to make something. You can make an apps processor. I think
that is pretty easy for anybody to do.
To make one that is world class is very hard. It is really, really hard. Anybody who is in
the graphics business knows how hard it is to extract the performance out of a
graphics core. It just takes an enormous amount of expertise to do it and I think that
is the reason why not everybody can make a world class --
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Absolutely. The Tegra 4, as you mentioned, was well telegraphed to the market -- the
performance, the specs, the fact that it was probably going to be rolled out at CES. I
think the other product that I think the market was maybe anticipating would beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantintroduced by NVIDIA was your Grey chip, which was an integrated applications
processor with 4G cellular modem all integrated into a single chip solution.
So I think there was some expectation that you would roll that out here at CES. I
guess the question is, is the team still on track to introduce the product in the ﬁrst
half of this year? When would you expect to start to sample Grey. And what would
be the earliest that we would see some of your potential smartphone customers
ramping this solution?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
We are exactly on track on Grey. We had not anticipated launching it here. When we
had disclosed our roadmap we said Wayne, our internal codename for Tegra 4,
would be launched right on the intersection line between Q4 and Q1 and then Grey
was going to be later in the year. What we have disclosed is that we are sampling
Grey in the ﬁrst half of this year. The product is essentially done.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Okay. Done meaning out of the fab or --?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Taped out.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Taped out, okay.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Then we expect -- for these types of devices it just takes a while to get them
designed in and certiﬁed and validated and so on. So when we have talked about
Grey we have talked about it as it's -- by the time you get devices out -- I think it
samples in the ﬁrst half of the year. Device is, I think, the second half of the year. You
might see some revenue this year.
But revenue-wise, it is really a 2014 contributor. This year is mostly Tegra 4 plus i500.

{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Why don't you repeat the question?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Yes, I will repeat the question. The question is the new game device from NVIDIA, is
that something that we are demonstrating?
We are certainly demonstrating it to customers and the -- well, we are demonstrating
it to the press. The customers are gamers. So we are not -- we don't have it openly
available and we are not handing them out.
It's still -- that version that we are showing is not the production version. So the press,
we are giving it to the press and the press are playing with it and writing their
reviews and doing their blogs. It is already all over YouTube and everything. So if you
want to see how it works and everything there is a billion videos already.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Any other questions in the audience? Maybe -- oh, back there.
It is Rod Hall. I just wanted to ask you about this gaming device. It seems like most
gaming is moving on to these mobile platforms -- smartphones, tablets. Why would
you even bother to make one? Where is the market for that?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Where is the market for the -- I just want to make sure I got the question right. Where
is the market for gaming?
Yes. It seems like gaming devices, stand-alone gaming devices are on their way
down as people play more on connected to smartphones or tablets. I am just
wondering, I am just curious to know where the market for those kind of devices is in
the future; why you guys would put eﬀort into making one.
Is it just to showcase Tegra 4's capabilities or is there still a big market out there that
we are unaware of in the future?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
No. It is deﬁnitely not a reference platform for Tegra 4. It would be a really expensive
reference design.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

Page 8 of 13Q - Harlan Sur
A - Rob CsongorI think the diﬀerence, the fundamental diﬀerence between this and other, I would call
them game consoles, is that the game consoles are fundamentally closed platforms.
So what we believe we are doing is enhancing the gaming market that you just
referred to.
The growing gaming market in Android, I think, is taking oﬀ because it is open. It is
an open platform. You are not paying $60. You have free to play, you have user-
generated content. And in addition you have your blockbuster games.
So the successful elements of the market today are free to play, some people call it
freemium which is starting to ramp like crazy, especially in China which is our biggest
market for our GPUs. Then you have got all the Android content. So all of these
things we would like to feel like we are just accessorizing it.
When we talk to gamers one of the frustrations if you play an Android game is that
you kind of have a joystick by moving your thumb around on the glass. Wouldn't you
like a real joystick? You should sit with me when we talk to some of the gamers, they
love it.
You already see a huge accessory market out there already. Have you guys seen all
these components that will strap onto a tablet? They have all these doohickeys that
they can Scotch tape it on to a tablet and then try to make it a better gaming
experience. All we are doing it is just tapping into that.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Any other questions in the audience?
Maybe moving over to your GPU business and computing fundamentals, PC
shipment demand continues to be relatively muted here this quarter and it looks like
ﬁrst half of this year, even with the rollout of Windows 8. However, the gaming side
of the market has been outgrowing the overall market. As you mentioned, there
were several huge blockbuster games that were launched in the second half of last
year that contributed to NVIDIA's growth, especially in the Third Quarter.
In hindsight, your guidance for Q4 for revenues to decline about 8% sequentially
seems spot on with the soft demand environment. So I guess the question is as the
quarter progressed, as you look at the near-term fundamental environment, are you
seeing anything diﬀerent, positive or negative, relative to your expectations?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
No. I think our expectations are pretty much what I think you guys are. There is a soft
market out there for sure. Our Q4 guidance was based on a couple things. One of it
was some softness that we see in the market.
One of the things we have been pointing out recently is that what I think many
people don't know about NVIDIA is that we do not address the whole PC market. IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

Q - Harlan Surthink we have talked about that in the last several conferences. We focus on specialty
PCs like gaming, like workstations, like high-performance computers. Those are
specialty PCs that are really only 5% of the overall market. But they drive 75% of
NVIDIA's gross margins. They drive NVIDIA. So 5% of the PC market and that is it.
Now those markets are not immune to macro conditions, they are just more robust.
Gamers are not going to not buy Black Ops 2 because there is a ﬂood in Thailand
and hard drive prices are -- they are wrapped up around the block. So it is a little
more robust.
But I think our Q4 guidance was based on the macro and then also just based on the
fact that we saw that for tablets Q3 was a build quarter. For Nexus 7 and for Surface
and for tablets in general people were clearly building ahead of the holiday. Then
Q4 is post the holiday build. So we just saw a seasonal decline.
We don't know what seasonal means yet. It is still a relatively new business for us. But
we clearly saw that that was a seasonal build.
So going into next year I think we will have to see. We will have to huddle up and
ﬁgure it out. I think we continue to see PC gaming growing and DFC intelligence is
basically projecting 10% CAGR for the next three to ﬁve years. So we see it remaining
very strong, particularly in Asia and particularly being driven by the free to play
model.
I think the Quadro business we see softness in the business. But the Quadro
business has not gone through its capital refresh yet and that is the one thing that I
think will help us.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Yes. That was the one question I was going to ask you because you have been
talking about the (Romney) ramp being slower in the workstation market and the
Kepler ramp tied to that is still in front of you. Have you gotten any more visibility
about when that ramp will potentially start to kind of unfold?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
A little bit. It is slow, it is just slow. Quadro always ramps slower. Typically our
consumer GPU business you will see product launch and then it is, boom, it is out.
In Quadro you have to -- we provide, for example, the Quadro to HP. HP has to certify
the workstation. It goes through apps testing and certiﬁcation for 3D Studio Max and
all of the various professional applications. So it always just takes a little longer. Then
it is just kind of staggered.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
So the Quadro business was weak in Q3. It was weak in Q4. It doesn't sound like
fundamentals have changed all that much there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

Q - Harlan Sur
A - Rob Csongor{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
I don't think so. I hope we are at the low point just because, again, we were hoping
to already have been in the Kepler refresh. So hopefully that was the low water mark.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
I think one of the important things which you touched upon was there is this idea in
the market that NVIDIA is tied to the overall PC markets. I think it is important -- I
think you mentioned 70% of your gross margins come from the specialty PC
segment of the market. I think that translates into, what, roughly about two-thirds of
your GPU revenues are tied to the specialty PC gaming segment of the market,
which -- specialty PC segment of the market which tends to carry higher gross
margins. Is that kind of the way to think about it?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Yes. If you look -- that is exactly right. If you look at our business and all of our GPU
shipments, 20% of the units are in that specialty PC segment. So 80% of the balance
is what we call premium PCs, which is somebody buying our lowest-end GPU and
putting it into a notebook and then up-selling it. So margins for those are
signiﬁcantly lower than up above.
In the premium PC segment, as you can imagine, I mean if you looked at our
announcement on Sunday you just can't imagine all of the software work that goes
into creating virtual GPUs that you can put in a server or the software that went into
that gaming device or the amount of complexity of what it takes to build the
workstation software that generates the special eﬀects that you see in movies. I mean
all of that is such high barrier to entry that obviously that is where we focus our
attention and that is where the high gross margins are.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
So JPMorgan's tech team is anticipating a ﬂattish PC market in 2013. I think, as you
mentioned, the third-party research guys that follow the gaming industry are
anticipating that gaming-related compute platforms should grow, within that GPU
market should grow. Is NVIDIA anticipating that similar to 2012 that you will outgrow
both the specialty PC gaming market as well as the GPU market?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Well we haven't given guidance but we would certainly hope so. The one thing that
we are proud of is over the last four years, if you have looked at our GPU business
minus the chipset business which we exited, we have grown steadily despite just
about every headwind you can think of. Whether it is ﬂoods or everybody was saying
attach rate was going to decline and everybody was saying -- anyway, I think we have
executed pretty well.
We have come out with -- not only have we kept -- we keep innovating on the
gaming side, which is what drives gamers. We keep innovating for the workstation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08

A - Rob CsongorThe HPC business is our fastest growing business right now.
You saw Intel announce the Xeon Phi and they are entering this market. And you
know Intel doesn't do anything unless they think it is a big market. So we now have
GPUs also going into the servers.
I think one of the fundamental questions I always get and people always ask is how
can GPUs be a growth business when the PC market is declining? I think the answer
is we are in robust segments of the PC market and then there is these new growth
segments which are kind of outside the PC market.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
We have a question right here.
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible)
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
The question was, are we concerned about supply with TSMC given Apple might
move in there. We are not now. We were concerned about supply last year for sure.
But we are not concerned right now. I think we have good visibility on our supply
and I think TSMC has got a good supply and a good program for us so I think we are
good for the foreseeable future.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
A question right there.
Can you say a couple of words about the Xeon Phi and why you think customers are
going to keep choosing your product? The reception has been good on Phi -- lower
prices, similar lots, easier coding.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
I think that if you were to speak to people I think there is a couple of things that
would be clear about our position versus Xeon Phi. We have a signiﬁcant head start.
We have been developing, for example, libraries, pieces of code called directives,
which are the code that you need that calls a multitasking algorithm in to take care of
your code.
So those applications, those libraries, those directives have been developed for all of
the key markets, like ﬁnance and molecular dynamics and everything. And it took us
seven years. It has taken us seven years. Intel still has to write all of those.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-08
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 12 of 13Q - Harlan Sur
A - Rob Csongor
Q - Harlan SurAnd the issue of easier code is just not what you think it is. When Intel says it's easier
to do code primarily what that refers to is that if you had x86 code it is x86 code. You
still have to write all of the parallel programming algorithms. So the x86 part, yes,
that will port but you still have to write all of that new stuﬀ.
Intel's strategy so far has been to drop price and that has been successful. I think that
is a good strategy if you are entering the market. I think they have been funding
some places and that is ﬁne.
But I think even that is partially -- I think that is a partially successful strategy because
you still have to write all of the code and that has a cost. So it is not so
straightforward.
Overall, we are thrilled, we are thrilled. I mean you know Xeon Phi is Larrabee 4. I
mean this is -- we take Intel seriously every time, every time they announce a GPU.
But anyways I think it is a validation for us. One of the issues we had always run into
is that sometimes you need two suppliers. A lot of places you go they require two
suppliers and I think having Intel in there I think validates the market for us.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. Then my closing question, as you think about 2013 and the growth prospects
it is clear that Tegra, your Tegra business, will continue to be one of the fastest-
growing segments for you. This year kind of help us rank order the other major
drivers of growth for NVIDIA in 2013.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Wow. Rank order them? I don't know if I can do that, Harlan. But let me identify what
I think our growth areas are. I don't know if they are particularly in rank order but --.
I think this year will be a good year for us in China phones. I think it will be a good
year for us certainly for Windows tablets. I think you will see automotive; it will be a
good year for our automotive business. I think it will be a good year for high-
performance computing. And I certainly hope it will be a good year for Project
SHIELD and for new types of Tegra devices coming out.
Hopefully we still have a few surprises left. Oh. And I think it will hopefully be a big
year for our GRID, the cloud computing products, because we announced the
gaming one. We have disclosed that there is a professional version, what we'd call
GRID Pro. So there is the pro version and then there is the gaming. And we still have
that coming.
