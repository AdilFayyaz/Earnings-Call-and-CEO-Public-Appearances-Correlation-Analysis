All right. Thanks to the more than a few in the crowd that are making it to the very
end of the day. And we appreciate Chris from NVIDIA coming in from the IR side to
talk us through their story. No presentation today. We're just going to go straight into
Q&A. And to the extent you do have questions, as I've said 17 times today, please
wait for the mike coming so that those on the webcast can hear you.
So one way I've been starting oﬀ. And it's a little more speciﬁc for you guys than
some of the broad-based analog guys, et cetera. But we've been starting oﬀ asking
questions about current business conditions. And generally, what you're seeing. And
the compare and contrast that might help frame it, because I know you can't really
change any guidances, in the last couple of years, the back half of the year has been
generally disappointing for most companies, as business has gotten a bit choppy, or
you could talk about it from a seasonal perspective. But either way, how are you
seeing current business conditions versus what we've seen in years past in the
second half?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So we're in a number of businesses. So I'll try and take that by segment. So if you
look at our GeForce business, our consumer graphics business, there are two very
diﬀerent dynamics that operate here in that market. On the desktop side of the
business, that's chieﬂy a gaming business. And that seems to be -- I was going to use
the word immune. But that's probably a strong word. But right now, it seems to be,
it's still growing very strongly. It's immune from the PC malaise, is what I was going to
say. And because it continues to grow strongly, ASPs are growing. And that market is
continuing to do very well. PC gamers still want to play games.
The other side of that business is the OEM business, which is largely notebook
graphics. And that's weak, like the rest of the PC notebook market is weak. And of
course, it's all consumer. So we're very exposed to the consumer side. And if youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 15Ross Seymore
Chris Evendenlook at the numbers on the PC market, no surprises there. The consumer is doing
worse than commercial. And obviously, we're feeling that, just like anybody else is.
And so that is netting out. Year on year, revenue-wise, it's approximately ﬂat. But of
course, the proﬁts are going up because the gaming business is much more
proﬁtable than the netbook OEM business.
Moving on to Quadro, which is our workstation business, that is currently looking
pretty strong. We've had two consecutive quarters of strong growth. 80% of the
revenues in that business are driven by manufacturing. CAD is the biggest
application area for Quadro. And the manufacturing data looks pretty good. The PMI
data looks good. It just took an uptick last month. And everyone knows that the car
manufacturing data has been fantastically good recently. So there are reasons for
continued optimism on that. The reason I focus on the market there is because we
have over 90% of the dollar share of that market. So while we have a bunch of
promising initiatives to try and grow the market, the dominant term in that equation,
if you like, is the market itself. So it's doing pretty well.
Then our other businesses, they're small growth businesses in bigger markets. So I
can't give you any extra market insight from our results there, because it's really a
share gain story, like Tesla. Tesla's doing extremely well. And we can talk about that
more later. But it's a small part of a massive high-performance computing market. So
it's not necessarily relevant from that perspective. And ditto Tegra as well. Tegra is a
relatively small part of the mobile computing market.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Well why don't we start diving into the main segments, then? And the GPU side is
obviously the bread and butter of the Company. And we'll stick with the consumer
side ﬁrst and leave what you used to call the professional services business, or the
PSB, before.
So in the GPU side of things, talk a little bit about the strategy there. You guys have
done an incredibly good job in an otherwise challenging PC environment of not only
making the margins rise. But the revenue side of the equation has been relatively
strong as well. Talk a little bit about how you've been able to deliver that.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So part of it is share gain. So we've had very competitive products. I mean, Kepler,
the architecture, the current generation of GPU architecture, is genuinely a very
good architecture. So it's a better chip. And I think we ﬁxed some of the problems
we had before. And so now we're back on track. And we're at this 65% market share,
which feels like a good level to be at.
Part of it is the innate strength of the gaming market I referred to earlier. It's
genuinely strong and genuinely independent of -- apparently independent of the
aﬄictions that are aﬀecting the rest of the PC market. The notebook market, like I
said, is where it is.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11

Ross SeymoreSo the PC market, the PC gaming market, is a diﬃcult one to measure. It's diﬃcult to
ﬁnd good data from that. But we believe it's growing about 10% annually, based on
software sales. Software sales themselves are actually diﬃcult to measure, because
something like 80% of PC gaming revenue now goes online, is through online. Only
20% is packaged software sales. So you can't take yourself down to Best Buy and
gauge the health of the PC gaming market, because that will give you a very
misleading picture of the health of the gaming market.
Some of that 80% online revenue is downloads of games, an online version of just
buying the software. But an increasingly large part of it is subscriptions in game
purchases, micro-transactions, that sort of thing. It's a new model of generating life
from software. Frankly, the Chinese software situation forced game developers to
ﬁnd new ways of generating revenue, because people weren't buying software in
China. And that innovation has caught on.
And you see it. I mean, frankly, you see it on the phone platforms as well. People are
now used to paying $0.99 for a game, or getting a game for free. I mean, I can get
Grand Theft Auto on my Shield Android gaming device for $4.99, the full version of
Grand Theft Auto. So it's a very diﬀerent model. And that's driving a lot of success in
PC gaming. But it's very diﬃcult to count. But at the end of the day, 10% a year
seems to be about the right number.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
When you talk about the notebook side, the ultimate consumer side going down
because of the market and not because of anything speciﬁc to NVIDIA, then you
have the core PC gaming side, how close are we to the level where you've started
stabilizing on the notebook side. And the core gaming is all that's left in the revenue
that you guys have?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
That's a good question. It's hard to say. I think a lot of the weakness on the notebook
side is driven by the fact that tablet is a better solution for most consumers than a
PC. And if you're just using your PC for general computing tasks, like surﬁng the
Web, updating Facebook, reading and writing emails, then the tablet's a much better
solution for the vast majority of people. It's much more convenient, it's instant on, it's
always connected, it's more portable. PC, my last laptop took over 10 minutes to
boot. So that's why those general-purpose PC users are just migrating to tablets.
However, like I said before, the gamers, they have a PC for a speciﬁc purpose. It's a
specialized purpose. Just like designers have a workstation for a speciﬁc purpose,
researchers have a Tesla workstation for a speciﬁc purpose. It's like a destination they
have in mind, rather than something they need to do. Because frankly, people have
to do email and surf the Web and be on Facebook is just a function of adults in the
21st Century. I think it's just one of those background things that has to be done.

Chris EvendenKind of scary, isn't it?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Well apparently only adults. I've learned from my children that only old people are
on Facebook. And Instagram is actually the way to go.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
So tablets are already not cool anymore.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
So if we get the gaming side of the equation. And we'll stick with even the desktop
side of things, what impact do you think the new console refresh has on that whole
process? Then we can get into some of the console questions and why you're not
playing in there as much, this generation.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
It's funny. There's very little data. I went back to look at data, because we have
people in the Company who adhere strongly to completely opposite points of view
on how the console refresh will aﬀect the Company. So I went back and looked at the
data. And there isn't really any data on how it aﬀects (inaudible). It's very diﬃcult to
tell, to pass from the data how it will aﬀect it. The downside, obviously, is the PC
gamers typically own 1.X consoles. They're gamers. And that money to buy a new
console presumably comes out of the same wallet that is used to buy PC games and
PC gaming hardware.
However, PC gamers spend $1,000 to $5,000 on a PC. They're fairly well oﬀ
compared to your typical gamer. So that might mitigate that. Then there's the
argument that actually, since these new consoles are very close to being PCs,
actually; they're like entry-level gaming systems. So they're now within the band of
gaming PCs, whereas before, they were so far below, it was very diﬃcult to port
software across because you had to do so much work. You had to generate assets
speciﬁcally for the PC gamers. It's a much higher quality gaming experience.
Now you've got a sort of entry-level PC gaming experience on a console. So the
argument goes that developers who before would have just developed console
games will now ﬁnd it so much easier to port the games across to PCs that they're
more likely to see a greater amount of high-quality content on the PCs. And that
would drive PC gaming sales.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11

Page 5 of 15Ross Seymore

Chris Evenden
Ross SeymoreSo you can argue, then, both ways. Honestly, I don't know how it's going to turn out.
And this console generation is going to be an interesting one, because the market
has changed. I alluded to this earlier. People have spent the last seven years learning
to buy software for free or in $0.99 increments. And the idea now of spending $560
on an Xbox One and then another $60 on a copy of Halo before you even start
playing is anathema to a large proportion of modern gamers.
So we'll see. I mean, the pre-orders, from what I've read, the pre-orders look
satisfactory. I'd be interested to see if that's just early adopters and whether it will
stop or whether it will continue to evolve beyond that.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Yes. It's hard to ﬁgure out how much is complementary and how much can be
substitution eﬀect, because even the bulls and the bears in your Company and your
prospects could argue that $0.99 games shouldn't be a good thing for a company
that sells very high-end graphics -- in general. If you just talked about the
predominant portfolio.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes and no, because $0.99 is typically not the only source of income for those
games. Like one of my colleagues recently bought a game, a car-racing game. I think
he paid $2.99 for it on the Android Marketplace. And he subsequently spent over
$40 on buying cars.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
I bought the sucker that does that.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes, I bought the same game. And I'm still racing a Prius and he's got a Porsche. So I
won't take him on. But the point being that they have ways and means of extracting
value from the customers. Some people will pay $2.99 for the game and decide it's
rubbish and just never come back. Other people will pay $2.99 for the game, decide
they actually quite like it. But they would really like that next car up. So then they'll
spend $5 on that. Then they'll say, oh, now, I really want that car. Oh. But that car's
part of this bundle. So if I spend $15, instead of getting just the car I want, I can get
all these other cars that I sort of would like as well. And before you know it, you're
$40 lighter. That's the trouble with high-bandwidth connections is that you can spent
a lot of money very quickly without even feeling it.
But the point being is there is funding for high-end games, even at a $0.99 entry
level.

Chris Evenden
Ross SeymoreRight. Yes. And I'm not arguing about the funding side. I was more taking the
opposite side, that many people would have said -- leave Tegra out for now -- but
that devices like this, where you can play games, like you said, on your Shield device,
for $0.99, you can play Grand Theft Auto --
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Oh, I see what you're saying. It would compete with our PC games.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
This should have killed the PC games. And clearly, your PC game market has actually
done quite well. So a similar analogy, I think (inaudible).
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
There are two diﬀerent types of gamer, right? So most of those $0.99 games are
casual games. Now, we are starting to get some decent high-end games now for that
sort of entry-level price. But it's a diﬀerent sort of experience. It's a lean-back as
opposed to a lean-forward experience. People used to talk about that. And PC
gamers are ﬁercely loyal to PC gaming, the mouse-keyboard interface. You'll hear
they'll rather die before conceding that that's not the best interface ever developed
for playing games. And they're very loyal to that.
But as I mentioned earlier, they'll buy other gaming platforms as well, because PC
gamers are gamers. And PC can be their favorite platform, probably the one that
they invest the most in. But they will, they'll have iPads. They'll have the latest
Android phone as well. So I'm not sure how much cannibalization you get from that.
You'll see people doing both.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
So moving back to the original part of the topic, get back to the game console side,
you guys played some roles at the IP side of things, more so than actual silicon, in
prior generations. This time it's gone to the AMD side of the equation. Why did that
happen? Why did you not focus on it as much?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
I think that's really a good question to ask the console manufacturers. There's
reasons to be in the console game industry. The danger of participating in the
console industry is it causes you to lose focus on your core markets. So there are a
lot of reasons about why you would want to participate; there are a lot of reasons
why those companies would choose us or AMD. And I wouldn't want to speculate on
that.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11

Page 7 of 15Chris Evenden
Ross Seymore
Chris EvendenWas the architectural change to looking more like a PC and integrating how AMD
calls it as an APU, putting the CPU together with the GPU into a single die,
something that you guys have the GPU side. But you don't have an X86.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
That is true. We don't have X86. We have our own. So we have Tegra. And so again,
it's really a question for Microsoft and Sony. Did they want speciﬁcally X86? Is that
part of their story?
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
What if we switch over to -- you talked about gaining share was part of the drivers
that you had, going back to about the 65% level with Kepler involved. How do you
view that dynamic, going forward? Is this a steady state and now you're kind of more
limited to what the market itself grows, or do you think that maybe with your
competition focusing more on the game console side, there's some more share you
could ﬁnd?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
I think, if you take a step back and look at where the market is, it feels pretty stable at
about this level. If you zoom in close, obviously, we're ﬁghting tooth and nail for
every single design win. We're ﬁghting aggressively at every OEM. We're ﬁghting
aggressively in the channel. And we're working very hard. And so you'll see, they'll
win some wins, we'll win some wins. And there's an awful lot of backwards and
forwards.
It's an equilibrium. But it's a very dynamic equilibrium when you zoom in. And I think
sometimes people try to zoom in too much. And they try to have conversations with
me about one OEM or this OEM or that or the other. And I think, when I have those
conversations, I try very hard to make sure that we're not mistaking the wood for the
trees and try to stay focused on the big picture. So step back, I think 65/35 seems
like a good level.
You know, AMD has worked very hard on their, aggressively with their software
bundling promotions. It's hard to imagine that didn't have any eﬀect on share. But
we certainly didn't ever feel we're in a position to ever have to adjust prices, despite
the fact they were giving away $240 of software with some of their graphics cards,
which is an extremely expensive promotion for them to run, even though they're not
paying $60. They're probably paying a signiﬁcant amount, given the cost of the GPU
in their systems.
And they've got some new products coming out in a couple of months. We feel that
we've got a pretty good bead on where they are and how we would counter that.
And of course, at some point, we'll have new products. And again, it's backs and
forths, backs and forths, ﬁght, ﬁght, ﬁght. But at the end of the day, probably stable.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11

Chris EvendenThere will be some ups and downs. But at a 20,000-foot view, I think it's probably a
fairly stable share.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
From that same 20,000-foot view, without asking you to preannounce anything, of
course. But when do you think their response to Kepler comes out. And when does
your subsequent architecture after Kepler come out, just roughly speaking? Middle
of next year, early next year?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Well I think their response comes out in the next few weeks, is my understanding. So
we'll see where that puts them and just whether that's a signiﬁcant advance in their
current architecture and what that does to the proprietary lineup. And I won't talk
about our product.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
I had to try.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
We're not going to announce them until we announce them, yes.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Right, right. What about the -- just a bit ancillary to this discussion. But it was
pertinent not too long ago. The shrinking side of the equation. These are not small
die. And the challenge in getting access at a reasonable price. And some of the
arguments about partnership versus customer relationships with some of the
foundries, et cetera. How important is chasing Moore's Law for you. And how do you
ﬁght against what appears to be an ever-increasing cost of chasing Moore's Law?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So I think it's important to realize that architecture trumps process every time. So
obviously, a smaller process node is generally better than a larger process node. But
the architecture has a much more signiﬁcant impact on the performance. In fact, the
software you put on that architecture has a much more signiﬁcant impact on the
performance. And I can point to numerous examples in the past where Art or ATI
were ahead in process node but behind on performance. And you can see that
throughout the history of the companies' competition with each other.
Having said that, moving to new process nodes is valuable because we can add
transistors and we can ﬁnd new ways to diﬀerentiate and add value to consumers. As
long as we can ﬁnd ways to make the consumer experience noticeably better, that
moving to a smaller node is a good thing. So we'll keep doing that. But meanwhile,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 15Ross Seymore
Chris Evenden
Ross Seymore
Chris Evendenwe innovate on the same process node as well. And so you can improve your
architecture, you can come up with completely new architecture, or you can carry on
tuning your existing architecture to make it more and more eﬃcient -- either more
compact, more power-eﬃcient, more performance -- and work on all those
dimensions at once.
So the good thing about not moving so fast from one process node to the next is it
means we don't have to re-spin our chips so often. We would want to move nodes at
some point, because at some point you want to move to a new node to introduce a
new step function in graphics functionality and features. So slowing down the
movement from node to node could actually be a good thing for us, because it
enables us to reduce those node transition costs.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
And I would imagine not being the guinea pig for the node any longer is another
beneﬁt as well. Let some of the other Ashcrofts and guys do that.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
I would think we'd almost certainly have some products at the most advanced node
available. It's just a question of how quickly you transition. There's not quite the same
pressure. When the advantage in terms of cost and performance is not as stark as it
has been in the past, then there's not the same pressure to move rapidly. And so you
make a choice about which products you move and when.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
The last question on the traditional graphics side of things is the integration. You
guys used to play on the chipset side. Then that got pulled into the CPU or APU, as
AMD calls it. That integration of graphics capability out of the chipset into the actual
CPU was always a big concern. And yet again, over the last couple of years, you guys
have grown rather nicely, whether through market share gains or pricing or what-not.
How do you see that dynamic, that threat of integration at the low end, impacting
your business?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
The interesting thing is. So going back to the way I described our GeForce market
before we had this gaming PC market, which equates approximately to desktops.
And this OEM market, which equates approximately to notebooks, it's not quite a
perfect correlation, because there are OEM desktops and there are gaming
notebooks. But as a ﬁrst order of approximation, it's pretty good.
Now, these gamers, they buy gaming PCs because they're playing games. It's
something they do; it's part of who they are. It's part of their self-actualization. The
OEMs buy graphics, not on graphics performance. But because they want discreteFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 15graphics to diﬀerentiate their laptops. Exactly. No OEM can survive just selling an
entry-level laptop. They want to sell a $500 laptop, a $600 laptop. And so on.
And so how do they justify that increase in cost? Part of it is the Intel brand, the i3, i5,
i7. And part of it is integrated discrete. And so those consumers buying those
laptops, the general-purpose consumers that I talked about before, looking for a
utilitarian notebook. And they're buying -- they're using price as a proxy for quality.
And so they're getting graphics, not by accident. That's too strong a term. But almost
incidentally, as part of buying a better-quality PC. And they get some real beneﬁts
from that, of course. But they're not buying it on graphics performance. Those guys
are not looking at the 3DMark Vantage scores of their $600 notebook.
It's just like if you or I were to walk into a liquor store to buy a bottle of wine. There
are people out there, of course, that have a benchmarking guide, Parkers. This is a
benchmarking guide for wine. But how many people do you know that walk down
the shelf, going, "Well that's a $40 bottle of wine and it scores 80 in Parker's. That
one's a $45 bottle of wine and it scores 92 in Parker's. So in terms of points per
dollar, that's a much better bottle of wine. I think I'll buy that one." There are people
like that. And those are analogous to PC gamers. PC gamers buy on benchmarks,
absolutely.
But most of us buy wine based on price as a proxy to quality. So if I'm drinking alone,
I might buy a $15 bottle of wine. If I'm trying to impress my girlfriend's parents,
meeting them for the ﬁrst time, I might buy a $40 bottle of wine.
I once gave this metaphor to Jensen, by the way. And he laughed, because I don't
think he'd cook with a $40 bottle of wine. But that's an important point as well,
because the reason you spend a certain amount on a PC is how important is
technology to you and how much money do you have? And so some of us might
buy a $700 laptop because we love technology. Others of us might realize that
actually $400 is going to meet our needs just as well. And it's ﬁne, just like people
buy expensive cars and cheap cars. A Toyota Camry -- at the basic function of car, a
Toyota Camry is just as good as a BMW car. But there are still those of us who like the
idea of owning a BMW, even at twice the price.
So this is a very long, rambling story at the end of the day, just to say that these
people buying these laptops are not buying them on performance. So Intel getting
better graphics performance does not displace discrete graphics. There are things
that could displace discrete graphics, like the bomb cost pressure from touch
screens is perhaps one thing that might displace discrete graphics. But graphics
performance is not one of those things.
And we've been having this debate for over 10 years. I can remember when I ﬁrst
started in the graphics industry, which was well over 10 years ago, having this debate
with a journalist way back when about Intel was just launching, I think, 945G chipset.
And that had much better graphics. And this was diﬀerent this time. And that was itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11

Page 11 of 15Ross Seymore
Chris Evendenfor entry-level discrete graphics. And it's a recurring debate. And the reason it never
happens is because they're not buying on graphics performance.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Right. Well let's switch gears over to the Tegra side, smaller as part of your business.
But probably larger in the frequency of questions you get on that. In the recent
quarter, it's a July quarter end for you guys, that was a tough quarter. We know some
of the reasons why. You've guided up signiﬁcantly in this next quarter. Some things
are ramping nicely. But you're still down between the two quarters, 50% to 70%,
roughly, year over year. Talk a little bit about this transition away from Tegra 3 into
Tegra 4. And I guess the biggest-picture question that really comes out of this to me
is how do you win in this game when even the pseudo-incumbents, from a merchant
perspective, don't seem to be getting the best of margins coming out the other
side?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So there's a bunch of questions there. So let's do the post-mortem and then how do
we win?
So the post-mortem on this year is Tegra 4 was too late. And that, obviously, meant
that we were disadvantaged in competing for the big tablets, the important tablets,
because we were competing with Tegra 3. Now, the reasons for the lateness, some of
it was just sometimes products are late. And some of it was deliberate in the sense
that we decided that we wanted to double down on Tegra 4 and Tegra 5. So we
made sure that if we were going to miss the deadline for Amazon and Google with
Tegra 4, at least Tegra 5 would be on schedule. And at least Tegra 4i, we can bring in
and accelerate that to market, Tegra 4i being the integrated product, the mainstream
smartphone product.
And so what you've seen now is we've been sampling Tegra 4i since February. We've
started sampling the Project Logan, which will presumably become Tegra 5 in the
fullness of time. And we actually demo'd that as early as July. And we've been
sampling it since August. So we're on a very good schedule now. So we're in the
right place now to compete for the Amazon and Google tablets. And the Company's
very, very focused now on bringing Tegra 4i to market and bringing Tegra 5 to
revenue as quickly as possible. You know, the software team's very focused on that,
the hardware team's very focused on it, the sales team's very focused on that.
So yes, it means certainly the ﬁrst half of this year is very diﬃcult from a revenue
standpoint. But it was a diﬃcult choice. But it was the right thing to do, because it
puts us in the right place for future years. I mean, we could have doubled down on
Tegra 4 and probably still been too late to win those things. Then perhaps Tegra 5
would have pushed out and been too late to win the next year. Then you're really in
trouble. Then you're behind and playing catch-up forever. This way, we actually have
really good products available at the right time to compete for those wins.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11

So I guess the second part of that question is, let's assume Tegra 5 hits the market in
time for the Google and the Amazon refresh, et cetera. Is the market for standalone
apps processors big enough to warrant all this investment?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Oh, yes, yes. So if you look at Android, Android is all about being ubiquitous.
Android is everywhere. We're going to see it everywhere, in all manner of devices,
not just phones and tablets. We're going to see it in cars, we're going to see it in TVs,
we're going to see it in set-top boxes, probably a whole bunch of categories that I
haven't thought of yet.
In many of those applications, visual computing will be important. And we are, at
heart, a visual computing company. And that is the value we bring to our customers'
products. And the diﬀerentiation that our consumers can see. So wherever Android
intersects with visual computing, that's where Tegra can succeed. And so that's
phones, that's tablets, that's all the devices I mentioned. That's a very large market --
so large, in fact, that if we were not to succeed in phones, Tegra can still be a
success. I should emphasize that we're wholly committed to succeeding in phones.
And we've got a great chip with Tegra 4i.
How can we succeed? Well if you look at -- you talked about the state of the
merchants and if there's a market for application processes. You said it's not a very
attractive market. The PC market doesn't look like a very attractive market, either, yet
our PC business, our PC gaming business, is extremely attractive -- 10% a year
growth, mid-50s gross margins, highly proﬁtable, highly defensible as well. Because
we put a lot of software around that, actually, in terms of drivers and also a lot of
work we've done with the ecosystem. We have hundreds of engineers that just
function to work with developers to get the latest features -- our features -- into their
games. So we have this very defensible market there.
Now, let's see if we can replicate that in the mobile computing market as well,
because then we can win in a very speciﬁc segment, a segment that we have unique
skills and experience in. And one that would likely be defensible and grow for the
long term as well.
Going head-to-head with some of the competitors across the whole phone and
tablet market would seem to be suicide, right? So we have to ﬁnd a defensible
segment where we have unique advantages. And this intersection of visual
computing and Android is speciﬁcally where we can make gaming matter. I think
that's a good place for us to be. And to your point, it's certainly big enough to
proﬁtably fund the development of Tegra.

You've been going a long way. But let's open it up for questions from the audience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11

Chris EvendenHi. Just one thing I'm curious about is the diﬃculties the market has had in general in
integrating communications, LTE in particular, into the processor in the mobile
space. It's something that you've managed to do now. And certainly Qualcomm have
done. But it seems to be something that has been a lot harder than I think a lot of
people had a feeling would be. So I want to understand, really, why that was so hard
and whether that gives you a sustainable advantage, given there's really only one
other competitor now that has that.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So I think we are in a pretty good position right now. We have a 3G voice and data
modem that's been shipping for a couple of years. We have a 4G data modem that's
been shipping for over a year. We have a 4G voice and data modem that's currently
well on its way through qualiﬁcation. We have a 4G data modem that's likely to be
out of qualiﬁcation in the next month or so. So I think we're probably in pretty good
position. There's a lot of claims and counterclaims from other companies. So it's
diﬃcult to know exactly where everyone is. But it feels like we're right at the front of
the pack, at least.
I think, ﬁve years from now, none of this will matter. And 4G will be about as
important a part of your buying decision as the WiFi manufacturer is today, its
connectivity. It's so important today because there's one company that does it. And
so it's focusing everyone's minds. So I think it will be an advantage for us.
In fact, even more importantly than it being an advantage for us, it will cease to be
such a headwind. If you think about it, we operate just in the high end of the market,
solely in the high end of the mobile computing market. And to operate in that
market without access to an LTE modem is a tough proposition, because LTE
becomes essential to high-end phones. And so the fact that we've had any success
at all, I think, has been good progress for us.
(Inaudible-audience question).
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So the question was, can we talk about the integration into the chip? I don't know if I
want to go into any great detail about the technical challenges. I think the issue is
not so much the integration. But the LTE, it's more complex than a lot of people
would happen to believe. And we saw that recently. Broadcom bought Beceem.
Beceem's a WiMAX company. WiMAX has a lot of features in common with LTE. But
it's not LTE. And it's a bigger step from WiMAX to LTE than I think they were
anticipating, hence last week's acquisition of Renesas.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11

Chris EvendenBut the integration itself, I don't think there are any particular hurdles there. I think
it's actually just building an LTE modem. And it's computationally a very intensive
task. And it's very complex in terms of, particularly, handling the voice calls in the
handheld. So there's a lot of work there that needs to be done.
If you look at the integration, it took us, between us acquiring Icera and actually
sampling a chip with an integrated LTE modem was 20 months. So we feel pretty
good about that. So I think that's testament to the skill of the engineers that were
involved. But like I said, I think the big -- there's obviously technical challenges in
integrating products like that. But I think the big technical challenge is the LTE
modem itself.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Any other questions from the audience? We only have about 2 minutes left. So a little
bit diﬀerent question. But strategic question in nature. With Shield getting into the
hardware side a bit and some chatter earlier this week about potentially having your
own tablets, NVIDIA-branded tablets, talk a little bit about the thought process
behind getting into hardware on one side, conﬁrmed. And maybe even one way or
the other.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So rumors, I can never comment on rumors. I'll try and be quick since I've been so
rambling so far. On the Shield side, there's a couple of things about Shield. We want
to sell a lot of them. We want to make money by selling them. But also, the other way
Shield succeeds for us is by helping us build this fortress of gaming inside the
mobile computing space, because it's a bridge, if you like, between our strength in
PC gaming to our soon-to-be strength, I hope, in mobile gaming. So it's a great
device.
Now, why do we build it ourselves? Generally, I'm pretty conservative about the
Company's capabilities. But I genuinely think there's no other company out there
that knows as much about gaming hardware and software as we do. We've got
experience in mobile, in PC, in console markets. We have hundreds of people who
spend their entire lives working directly with game developers. We've got 20 years --
20 years experience in this market.
And we have a huge brand with gamers. Over 70 million GeForce users today know
who we are. Brand awareness, brand preference, particularly in countries like China,
are huge. We have over 90% market share in i-cafes in China, for example. So there's
a big, big brand equity that we can leverage as we launch our own product.
So if it can succeed, I don't think anyone's more likely to make this product succeed
than we are. And it's a niche product. We're not going to sell tens of millions of units
this year. So I don't think it's going to oﬀend our existing customer base. They see it
as a very speciﬁc niche. And they understand, or we've communicated to themFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-11

Operatorcarefully before the launch to explain how it works. So yes, I think we're the right
people to build this product.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Great. We are -- you can ask a question afterwards, because we are on time at the
end of the day. So thank you all for making it to the end of the day. And Chris, thank
you for bringing us home in a strong fashion.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Thank you.
