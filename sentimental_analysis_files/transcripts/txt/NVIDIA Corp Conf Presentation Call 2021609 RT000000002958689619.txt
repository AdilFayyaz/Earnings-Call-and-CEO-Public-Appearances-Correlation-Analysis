{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us in this afternoon session. I'm Vivek Arya. I
had the U.S. semiconductor research team at BofA here in New York. And I'm really
delighted to have Colette Kress, the CFO of NVIDIA, join us to share her insights
about the industry and NVIDIA, and all the exciting things that company is involved
in. Before we go into the ﬁreside, I just want to turn it over to Colette. She has an
opening statement and then we'll go through with the Q&A.
With that, welcome Colette, and to you.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Vivek, and thanks so much for having us. I have to make an open
statement. As a reminder, that the presentation and discussion today, contents will
have forward-looking statements that investors are advised to read our reports ﬁled
with the SEC for information related to risks and uncertainties facing our business.
But ﬁrst, let me kind of make an opening statement. NVIDIA is just turned the corner
in terms of announcing our earnings just several weeks ago, a quarter in terms of
record revenue, and strength across all of our market platforms. We reached a
record in total, in Gaming, in Data Center, as well as Pro Vis. A strong demand across
our platforms is there, even as we work through some of the challenges that we are
seeing in terms of the semiconductor industry's overall supply.
We even provided the opportunity for us to reach another record quarter with our
guidance for Q2 as well. We see strength in Gaming and in Data Center, as we work
into Q2 and expect all of our market platforms to do well. This is a time when our
overall Ampere architecture for Gaming, our Ampere architecture for Data Center is
hitting strides and ramping quite well. So I'm going to turn it back to Vivek and see if
we can start today's conference with some of the questions that you may have.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

(Question And Answer)
Excellent. Thank you, Colette. So maybe let's start from the supply side and then we
will go through the diﬀerent demand drivers, like you mentioned supply as one of
the headwinds, very broad-based for the industry. Is there a way to quantify how
much that is restricting your growth this year? Part B is, what steps are you taking to
get supply aligned with the demand? And then kind of part C is, when do you think
supply and demand will start to align for you? Can that happen this year? Is it a 2022
event? Just give us some more color on the supply situation for you.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. We've been working through supply for actually a very long time. Keep in
mind, demand is strong across all of our market platforms, so an issue that we have
to realize and work through some of the supply constraints that we have. The supply
constraints are largely apparent in our Gaming business, although some of our
products in maybe Data Center or a few in terms of Pro Vis may also be constrained.
We have employed, what we refer to as, a dual-foundry strategy that allows us to use
the full capabilities of our supply chain for longer planning cycles, and that has
helped us with our current environment that we are seeing. We expect our supply to
increase throughout the year. We expect growth, as we continue to add supply
throughout the year, but we do expect that we will be supply-constraint in Gaming as
it relates to the overall channel levels for probably most of this year, just based on
the strong demand that we are seeing.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Colette, just to dig into that. Are you supply-constraint just in Gaming, or also
in the Data Center? And how has this kind of dual-foundry strategy help you align
with the market demand in these two diﬀerent markets?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, so our -- most of our supply-constraint is focused on Gaming and where a bit of
our eﬀorts are. But keep in mind, we were pleasantly surprised, of course, in terms of
the strong demand that we saw in terms of Gaming, which, therefore, put pressure
on supply. We have supply for growth in all of our other markets as well, Data Center
and Pro Vis, but keep in mind, we don't have an exorbitant amount of overall supply
if things change in terms of super strong demand going forward. So some of our
products may be limited in terms of the supply that we have.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. So if you look in the second half of the year, right, as you were expecting the
second half to be stronger, should we assume that more of the growth comes fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

A - Colette KressGaming because you're getting more of the supply? Or is it more tied to the
seasonality that Gaming is more of a consumer business or perhaps there is more
growth in Gaming because of that? So what are the kind of the drivers of that second
half demand strength that you mentioned.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, so this takes us that opportunity to really look at our full strategy with our dual-
foundries. Our expectation is, in the second half of the year, the economy will likely
continue to expand and improve post the overall COVID. Our overall dual-foundry
strategy that we have has enabled us to provide Ampere at both of our overall
foundries. And many of our work with the foundries is long-term based. So we've
been working on building out our platforms -- our advanced platforms at both of
these foundries, and we do believe that will enable our growth as we go into the
second half of the year.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. So let's step through the diﬀerent demand drivers, and I'll only ask one or two
questions about crypto, because that's not the focus of the business. But there is a
great deal of interest in that. So the real question is that, you have announced a step
to have a very speciﬁc crypto mining board, right, the processor -- the CMP product.
How much of the crypto mining exposure of NVIDIA is contained within that CMP
product? And how much of it do you still think is being reﬂected in your Gaming
segment?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
(Technical Diﬃculty)
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Okay, that is much better as I should have mentioned it before. I thought maybe it
was something from my side. Would you mind just repeating just the last 10, 15
seconds. So the question was, how much of the crypto exposure is on the CMP
product? And how much of it is being reﬂected on the Gaming side? I think we
missed that answer.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. Let me try here in terms of what we're seeing within Gaming that maybe
overall crypto. I want to ﬁrst start to help folks understand that we can't always see
what our end use of our cards are. And so it is very diﬃcult for us to determine within
Gaming how much is possibly being used for crypto. There could be cases where
people are duly gaming and also using crypto. So at this point in time, that's just not
something that we're ever going to have a full understanding. But we can take
actions to try and steer more of our GeForce supply to our overall gamers.
What we've done is we've created the CMP boards for our overall professional
miners. Our CMP boards stand for crypto mining processors to where they are
engineered and manufactured for the algorithms of overall crypto. Additionally, weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Q - Vivek Arya

Q - Vivek Arya
A - Colette Kresshave de-hashed our newly manufactured GeForce GPUs. What this allows us to do is
make sure that there is more supply, speciﬁcally for those that want to game, and the
de-hashing will essentially to tier [ph] overall miners from buying those GeForce
cards. We hope this strategy, this dual strategy, will again provide more of a supply
for the GeForce gamers that are out there.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. So Colette, when we go -- and I've tried to do that, my team has tried to do
that many times to just go to any of the e-tailer websites or eBay to just buy an RTX
card, right? And they are selling for two, three times above MSRP. Is that gamers who
are creating that level of ASP inﬂation? Like from the outside, how will we know when
there is enough supply available? When we see those externally available prices kind
of getting back to recommended price? Like, if you were in our shoes, how would
you monitor when the supply situation becomes more normal? And also, very
importantly that the demand is really being driven by a gamer -- a majority gamer
rather than a majority miner?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Let's ﬁrst talk about the overall Ampere architecture -- the Ampere architecture
for Gaming. This is an important architecture. It provides a tremendous performance
leap from the last generation, 2x better performance from what we had seen in
Turing. It is providing overall ray tracing as well, and there has been a long list of new
games that have now been enabled for ray tracing, more than 130 enabled games
and overall applications. So we do know that the demand for Ampere is quite strong.
We have adoption right now of ray tracing within our installed base still at the early
levels, or essentially, we believe probably 80% of our installed base could still
beneﬁt from upgrading to take advantage of our overall ray tracing.
But what we have right now is strong demand, which is, therefore, putting a strain on
supply. And when there is a strain on supply, we have seen an increase in the overall
ASPs that you see at the endpoint. Now, keep in mind, a lot of that is driven by the
channel driven by the overall distributor. The best that we can do to help work
through that is to provide more supply, and make sure that supply is geared toward
the GeForce gamers, so we can start to see those prices come back down to normal
manufacturer's suggested retail prices. That's our goal that we are looking at for Q2
and beyond to actually build that. We believe that -- given that there is such small
amount of supply in the channel today, we believe that there is strong demand out
there that we just haven't been able to reach all of the gamers, even though Ampere
has been with us for several quarters now. We have a ways to go in terms of that
upgrade cycle and get them in bond [ph] overall Ampere.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
So if a friend or relative came to you and say, Colette, when is the best time to buy a
3070 or 3080? When would you say that, okay, this is the best time and this is when
you can actually buy some -- one of those cards at an attractive price?

Page 5 of 11Q - Vivek Arya
A - Colette Kress
Q - Vivek AryaWell, several relatives that have asked me that question, and probably even more
they've asked me the question, do I have any spare ones to give? So even my dear
family members have not been able to ﬁnd some of that supply. If -- once the supply
is available and -- in the market, I strongly encourage that the enjoyment from that
overall gaming card will last quite long. We can't (inaudible) control that
manufactured retail price, as that is by the channel. And we do hope that those
prices will come down as we work in this next quarter to improve the overall supply
for those gamers.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Understood. And when -- Colette, you mentioned that only -- less than 20% of the
base has upgraded to something that is RTX capable. Give us some historical ﬂavor
for what that 20% means? Like, is 40% the peak, is 50% the peak before you
introduce a new architecture? So where does the upgrade cycle usually get to? And
an important aspect -- other aspect of this is that, for the 80% who do not have an
RTX card, what kind of an ASP uplift does it promise to you when they do upgrade to
something that is RTX capable?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So let me see if I can unpack a little bit of those questions regarding what
we're seeing in terms of the overall purchasing. This is an opportunity for people to
upgrade. With 80% still not on RTX, we have a great opportunity. But keep in mind,
with each of our generations in the past, whether that be Pascal, whether that be
Turing or here until Ampere, you're correct, we've never reached where -- before we
move to a new architecture, we get our installed base up to a high percentage of
that installed base. It is often that our top gamers will upgrade each architecture
because they get excited about the new opportunities within each architecture. And
there's often where we see people buy multiple times within that architecture.
So it's very common for us to have such a low percentage right now as we're moving
to get people towards overall Ampere. We don't have any overall speciﬁc goals, and
it's going to depend as that volume increases over this time on how fast that
increased installed base will go, because we're also seeing new overall gamers
joined the market. More and more we're seeing overall gaming move to
entertainment medium or using us not over for -- only for social purposes, we see a
lot of creators coming into the market and ﬁnding, again, the opportunity to gain as
well as so many other diﬀerent use cases around it. So we'll continue to watch this
market and try and get as much supply there. But we're excited about the upgrade
opportunity that we have both going into the back-to-school season, as well as the
holiday coming around the corner, too.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Is it possible, Colette, that -- I imagine at this point, you already have a good
idea of the kind of supply you will have available for Gaming in the back half, and
obviously, right, you have diﬀerent demand models built for gaming, is it possible
that this gaming growth cycle continues into next year, right? I don't want to pin you
to a speciﬁc number, per se. I imagine it is not as high as 100% year-on-year growthFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 11A - Colette Kress
Q - Vivek Arya
A - Colette Kressthat we are seeing. But is it possible that, conceptually, next year is also a somewhat
above-trend kind of year in terms of your Gaming business?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Where we stand right now and looking forward, we do have an idea of the supply
that we're getting. But keep in mind, we still have some work to do in terms of
thinking through what speciﬁcally we'll manufacture and put into the market. So that
is still not absolutely deﬁned as we go forward. We're trying to determine the exact
month and timing of both supply and demand will be interesting as we go into back
of the year.
When we step back, though, and think about Gaming and -- as a growth opportunity
for the company. Absolutely, we think of it as a growth opportunity in terms of long-
term. We're continuing to excite them with overall ray tracing, what ray tracing has
done in transforming overall gaming. We continue to put out the best performance
types of cards. And what we're seeing is not only upgrades, but those new gamers
coming into the market. We're at a point where when we think about the holiday
season and beyond, I think we will likely see a great holiday season and beyond as a
gamer is always a gamer, and looking at new opportunities for them to purchase
overall Ampere.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. And ﬁnal question on the Gaming side is, how much of this extension of this
growth cycle also has to do with the fact that there are shortages on the console side
also, because I assume one of the drivers of more ray tracing adoption would be that
it's being adopted in-game console, so there is probably some kind of mutual
synergy that you now have all the gaming platform, right? And that probably then
stimulates more software publishers to publish games with this feature. Does that
have also something to do with perhaps extending this growth cycle into next year
that maybe, as you get more supply on the console side, that also stimulates more of
this Gaming growth for you?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That is correct. When we entered into the Ampere launch, and entered into that last
holiday season, we understood this to be a season where new consoles will return to
market. It really drives the overall ecosystems of game development. Game
developers are generally writing games for a wide range of diﬀerent platforms,
whether that be consoles, or whether it be the number one platform, meaning the
PC platform. So we have been able to attract overall game developers. Game
developers building RTX games or building games for the new transformation to
real-time ray tracing. That has beneﬁted us. It's beneﬁted the industry as a whole, as
people are playing together. So what we're seeing in terms of our overall consoles
that we have with Nintendo, what we are seeing also with mobile form factors, such
as our notebooks, have also strongly increased in here. So just the mere production
of new games is the number one reason to attract overall gamers to purchasing
overall hardware.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

Got it. Let's go to the Data Center side. So if you look on the Data Center side, talk to
us about what is the level of demand that you're seeing right now, maybe we will ﬁrst
start for the cloud side and then go to the enterprise side. Is this cloud demand in
line with what you think? Because we had a mixed picture. We have Intel saying
cloud digestion. We have AMD saying, where is the digestion? I don't see it. Right?
So there's been a very -- there's a lot of mixed picture. So if you separate out the
beneﬁts of Ampere from just the spending environment. How would you
characterize the spending environment among your cloud service customers?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So let's start with our overall Data Center business and what we saw in terms
of Q1. Our Data Center business grew 8% sequentially last quarter, even as much of
the industry as a whole declined over that period between Q4 and Q1. When we
think about our overall hyperscale business, remember, our hyperscale business
incorporates what they may use for internal use, but also what they do to set up the
overall cloud instances that researchers and enterprises do. Our hyperscale business
was up double-digits sequentially from Q4 to Q1. So we really didn't see much
digestion. Now, why, what we see in terms of the cloud instances, the hyperscales, is
they're focused on solving some of the key solutions that they need for acceleration,
and particularly for AI solutions.
So we're well aligned with some of the top priorities that we see at the cloud, but
also what we see in terms of the overall enterprises. We see that strengthening of
hyperscale demand, as we look forward as well, and probably the growing set of
interest in terms of the vertical industries, particularly as we see them coming back to
the oﬃce and the economy likely to improve over the second half of the year. We
expect growth both in computing and in our networking. We hope to see that solid
demand across both training and inferencing as we go through the year. Also, we
have launched some additional amount of products with our NVIDIA-Certiﬁed
Systems that -- and our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software that we are well positioned for
a new vector of growth with mainstream enterprise and tiers [ph] as we go forward.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Do you expect your cloud demand to be stronger in the second half versus
the ﬁrst half?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's very diﬃcult for us to determine whether that cloud increase will stem from
enterprises using the cloud or enterprises choosing to actually bring that in house or
going through some type of hybrid model. What we do know is that our hyperscales
look to build out the cloud based on the demand that they see. They try to stay
ahead of that and see the use cases for continued overall growth. What we do
believe is the enterprises will come back into the market with the overall economy,
but there are many diﬀerent types of solutions for them to support that, anything
from the cloud or purchasing on-premise.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

Q - Vivek Arya
A - Colette Kress{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Because -- I believe one thing that either yourself or Jensen had said is that
you expect some kind of acceleration in your Data Center business. So how much of
that is a predicated on the growth among your -- ﬁrst, how much is enterprise as part
of your overall Data Center business? And then how much of the second half growth
is predicated on enterprise recovery.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So we've kind of talked about our breakdown of our Data Center business
between our hyperscales and our enterprise. So our hyperscales -- now keep in
mind, the hyperscales, remember, have that cloud instances and the use cases of
those cloud instances often our enterprises. But the best that we can see is we're
able to divide between our hyperscales and what we're seeing in terms of our
vertical industries. That number is about 50-50. 50% coming from the hyperscales.
And yes, we have built up in our Data Center business supporting the 50% of our
revenue with those overall vertical industries.
So the focus in terms of AI is not just focused on hyperscales. The enterprises are
very interested in building out their businesses to support AI as well. When we think
about the second half of the year, we will likely see the growth both in the
hyperscales and the enterprises, as we see that acceleration going forward, from
both aspects of hyperscales building out the overall cloud, but also enterprises
coming back to the oﬃce and focusing on building out their workloads on
accelerated and AI.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. And Colette, what are the top few applications that you're seeing that
enterprises are kind of gravitating most towards using NVIDIA products?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Wow, there's a lot of diﬀerent things that we have both enabled with what we do in
helping them stitched together from our product solutions and our platforms to
what they may want to do in terms of in the enterprise and in the industries. We have
focused on many diﬀerent workloads and industries where we think the beneﬁts of
acceleration and/or AI would really help their business models. As you know, retail
and e-tail have highly focused in terms of recommendator or recommendator
engines, very similar to the work that you've seen in terms of the hyperscales. You
see cloud, Internet companies and you see much of e-tail and retail focused on
drawing people to their websites, and that form of marketing can just be
recommendator engines. So that's one area of focus.
Additionally, we've seen both ﬁnancial services, we've seen manufacturing, we've
seen a good representation of folks on supply management, forecasting and using
overall data science to speed up the work that they do to make sure that their
processes are well aligned. We'll continue adding more and more high-levelFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

Q - Vivek Arya
A - Colette Kressworkloads, but those are some of the key areas that we do see people concentrating
on.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Colette, I'm curious when an enterprise or even a cloud customer when they
buy an accelerator, do they always buy it next to a new server buy? Or can they also
or do they also retroﬁt existing server deployments, right, to perhaps improve their
application, right, with the addition of accelerators? Because we are always trying to
ﬁgure out where we are in terms of attach rate of accelerators and we are kind of
limited by the, whatever, 12 to 15 million servers that are sold every year. So our
accelerators always sold with new servers? Or can they also be retroﬁtted with
existing deployments?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So what we are seeing across the industry is maybe a two-fold. Yes, a signiﬁcant
amount of clusters are being purchased newly, newly designed, because I think
there are great things within a lot of the server conﬁgurations to enhance their
workloads overall, the acceleration -- and remember, all of the diﬀerent parts with
that. We have focused not only on acceleration of the GPU, but acceleration in terms
of the networking. We've seen us all focused in terms of acceleration on using a DPU
to enhance that overall experience. So purchasing new clusters for the new modern
data centers is a very important piece in terms of that expansion.
Additionally, we see folks purchasing or adding on to their existing clusters that may
be accelerated. They have already trained models. They have already deployed a
conﬁguration of acceleration, and it may be needed to add in terms of more about
that that's something that they would like to do deploy. There is an opportunity, as
you know, within their existing servers for them to attach and put in an infringed
product into a PCIe slot and that is a possibility. But the ﬁrst two are probably the key
focus areas that we see enterprises and hyperscales doing.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. So is it -- because we always ﬁnd that tough to forecast growth for the Data
Center business, right, over long periods of time, and I'm talking just on the
compute side. Is this way of looking at how many accelerators are being added
every year, right, versus the number of CPUs? Is this a good way of projecting that
growth? And if yes, what is the attach rate? Is it 10%, 15%? Just -- again, if you were in
our shoes, how would you project NVIDIA's computing growth opportunity?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, let's go back and remember that an accelerator added to any server system is
taking on more work than any single overall CPU server. So it wouldn't be a one-to-
one comparison that says one accelerator versus the CPUs to determine the overall
attach rate. The best that we can do is really look at the overall TCU -- TCO value that
we are providing to our customers, and helping them understand that we have now
enabled them to have a very streamline approach to their data center if using
acceleration and AI.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

Q - Vivek Arya
A - Colette KressI think the best way that I could articulate how to count, how to measure in terms of
where we are. I think the easy answer is to say, we're in the early days. We're in the
early innings of what we're seeing in terms of the long-term a move to accelerated
computing and the use of AI almost in every single workload. Now, why do we only
consider that to be in the early days? There is still a signiﬁcant amount of
applications and software that needs to be stitched together to inﬂuence all
workloads to move to use accelerated or overall AI. We have put together a large list
of that when you think about our work that we've done with the CUDA development
platform, and many of the both compilers, frameworks as well as system software
that we have done to add to that. But we still have a ways to go.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. And then, Colette, in the last two or so minutes that we have, I was hoping if
you could give us an update on the Arm acquisition. Where are you in that
regulatory process? What's your level of conﬁdence in closing that announced
acquisition? Just give us some update on where you are in that process.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So we are working with the regulators all across the world. This is part of the
process that we know well after completing the overall Mellanox acquisition. We are
working with each of the jurisdictions, whether that be the U.S., the U.K., in Europe,
as well as moving to China.
Now, keep in mind, the details of those discussions with regulators are generally a
conﬁdential discussion. It is about helping them understand the technologies,
learning about the two companies. But the discussions right now are going well with
overall regular -- regulators. It has been productive and we are proceeding as
anticipated. Our milestone in terms of completion, we are still expecting in the early
part of 2022 to complete the acquisition of Arm.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
From what you have disclosed and described before, Colette, have you heard of any
big -- I know there have been some push backs on the U.K. side, have you heard of
any other push backs or any other feedback perhaps from potential customers, right,
if the two companies are able to get together?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, we have been with discussions with customers, as, keep in mind, many of the
customers that Arm has are some of the same customers that we do.

Got it. Okay. One last question, will the DPU, the data processing unit, do you think
that can be a measurable part of the business here next year?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Let me see if I could answer that about the DPU. The DPU is an essential part of what
we consider to be the modern data centers going forward. You're probably going to
see three parts. You're going to see a need for, of course, the CPU form of an
accelerator, such as the GPU and the DPU, which is that data processing the unit, an
important piece, which will enable the encryption, the overall security, that is
necessary for the data that is passing through to your whole data center. This will be
beginning to ramp in the second half of the year and we do believe that will be
meaningful as we turn the corner into the new year of calendar 2022.
