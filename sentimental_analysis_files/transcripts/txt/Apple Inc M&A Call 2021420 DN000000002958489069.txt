Hello and welcome back to Apple Park for our ﬁrst event of 2021. After the
challenges of this past year, we're optimistic that brighter days are just in front of us.
As we move forward, we feel it's important that Apple continues to make a diﬀerence
in people's lives through our products and our values. So we're glad you could join
us today for some exciting updates and announcements.
This week marks the Annual Earth Day Celebration, and I couldn't be more proud of
the environmental initiatives and commitments we are making at Apple. Today,
Apple is carbon-neutral for our global corporate operations with all of our oﬃces,
stores and data centers running on a 100% renewable energy. And by 2030, Apple
will be a 100% carbon-neutral across our entire end-to-end footprint including our
supply chain and the use of our products. This month, we launched the Restore Fund
in partnership with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs. This pioneering
new investment fund will provide returns that are measured not only ﬁnancially, but
by the tons of atmospheric carbon removed by each investment. Our goal is to
remove more than 1 million tonnes of carbon every year. At Apple, our values and
principles make us who we are. They drive us to create products and services that
are better, easier and more enjoyable.
Now I'd like to turn to some updates on our services, beginning with Apple Card.
With Apple Card, we set out to completely reinvent the credit card and enable
people to live a healthier ﬁnancial life. Our customers are loving all the beneﬁts of
Apple Card, and we believe it's the most successful credit card launch ever. One of
the things that became apparent to us in the beginning was a lack of fairness in the
way the industry calculated credit scores. When there were two holders of a credit
card; one got the beneﬁt of building a good credit history and the other did not. We
want to reinvent the way this works too. So today, we're happy to announce that
Apple Card will allow spouses and partners to share and merge their credit lines,
have equal rights on their account and build credit equally. This solution helps
deliver ﬁnancial equity and it's a game changer, and Apple Card can now be used by
anyone in your family over the age of 13 with optional spending limits and controls
for kids. We call this set of features Apple Card family. These beneﬁts reﬂect our
ongoing mission to reinvent the credit card and help you and those closest to you
experience a healthier ﬁnancial life.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

Page 2 of 15Unidentiﬁed SpeakerNow let's talk about Apple Podcast. As you know, Apple help launch the podcast
industry 15 years ago, and this is what it look like. The day we launched Podcast and
iTunes, we had 3,000 shows in the directory. Today, there are millions to choose from
and Apple Podcast is the best place to listen to all your favorites and we're making
the biggest change to Apple Podcast since its debut. This starts with a newly
designed Apple Podcast app. Every show and episode has a beautiful new page
making it easy to follow, listen and share. We're also introducing channels to help
you ﬁnd new shows from your favorite creators. And you'll get recommendations for
new channels to explore. We're also introducing Apple Podcast subscriptions, which
enables you to unlock new content as well as additional beneﬁts like ad free
listening, early access and much more. So now you can help your favorite podcasters
build their business and fuel their creativity. Apple Podcast subscriptions launches in
a 170 regions and countries next month. These major updates will make listening to
podcast easier and more enjoyable than ever before.
Now let's turn to iPhone. iPhone 12 is the most popular smartphone in the world and
people love its amazing features. Super Retina XDR displays with ceramic shield,
incredible camera systems and 5G, and of course they love the stunning design and
selection of beautiful colors. And we have another beautiful color perfect for spring.
(Video Presentation)
We're so excited to introduce a new gorgeous purple. It looks stunning with the
precision milled back glass and new design. It has elements of sophistication and
brightness with the color matched aluminum edges. It's absolutely beautiful. Purple
joins the iPhone 12 line-up for pre-order this Friday, and it will be available on April
30th. What are the things that customers love about the iPhone experience is Find
My, and we have some exciting news to share. Here's Carolyn to tell you more.
(Video Presentation)
One of the most helpful features we pioneered is ﬁnding your iPhone through Find
My. Over time, we made Find My even more powerful. Find My includes a vast end-
to-end encrypted and anonymous network approaching a billion Apple devices that
can help locate a missing iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac even when it's oﬄine.
We also opened the Find My network, so you can use Find My to ﬁnd third-party
products, and this is just the beginning. Today, we're adding to this growing
ecosystem of the new iPhone accessory that makes ﬁnding things even easier.
(Video Presentation)
This is AirTag. The next time the couch eats your keys, AirTag will help ﬁnd them.
AirTag uses the Find My network so iPhone can help you keep track of and ﬁnd your
things. You can personalize your AirTag to make it your own even with emoji. AirTag
is easy to use by itself for beautiful accessories we've designed so you can attach it
to just about anything, like you're backpack, luggage or whatever else you have.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

this precision ﬁnding.
As you move, precision ﬁnding uses our U1 chip to get the precise distance to your
AirTag. iPhone fuses that data with input from the camera, accelerometer and
gyroscope to give you visual, haptic and audible feedback guiding you right to your
AirTag.
At Apple, we believe privacy is a human right and that's why we designed it into
AirTag and the Find My network. With the Find My network everyone can participate
without sharing their location to anyone, including Apple. AirTag is designed to track
items, not people so we included safety features to discourage unwanted tracking
like unwanted tag detection, rotating identiﬁers and audible alerts from unknown
tags. These capabilities are an industry ﬁrst and are driven by our commitment to
privacy, so that's AirTag. AirTag is just $29 and because you likely have more than
one important item in your life, a four-pack is just $99. Orders start this Friday and
AirTag will be available April 30th.
We also worked with Airmix on a special hand crafted leather collection, a bag term,
luggage tag and key ring, each including an AirTag as to Airmix signature. With
AirTag in the Find My network, iPhone can now help you ﬁnd even more things.
And now back to Tim.

Now let's talk about Apple TV and how we're making the time we spend at home
more entertaining and more enjoyable. Apple TV brings you the very best cinematic
experience, giving you access to the world's leading video services. This starts with
Apple TV+ and it's line up of critically acclaimed and award winning Apple originals,
including global hit drama The Morning Show, Academy Award nominated
Wolfwalkers, the Billie Eilish documentary, the Oprah Conversation and of course the
incredibly popular comedy Ted Lasso. Ted Lasso was one of my favorites, and I'm so
excited for the second season.
So here's a sneak peek at what's coming next.
(Video Presentation)
Ted Lasso returns this July, and I can't wait. And of course the best way to enjoy it
and everything on Apple TV+ is with Apple TV 4K. To tell you more about what's new
with Apple TV 4K. Here's Cindy.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

What makes Apple TV truly unique is its deep integration of Apple hardware,
software and services. Apple TV is built on the same world-class Apple silicon we put
into iPhone, and it runs TV OS, the most powerful TV operating system, giving Apple
TV all of this power. Power that smart TVs just don't have, plus you magically
transform your living room. So you can get in your morning workout with Apple
Fitness Plus, show of your school project using AirPlay, battle it out on Apple Arcade
and even sneak in a late night movie with AirPods. The ability to do all of these
things and so much more is why we've put so much power into Apple TV. And it's
why I'm so excited to share with you the next generation of Apple TV 4K.
Apple TV 4K is now built with the A12 Bionic, bringing a new level of performance
that will be a massive upgrade to your TV. Delivering the highest visual quality
possible has always been core to Apple TV. It already supports high dynamic range
format such as Dolby Vision, revealing more realistic colors in greater detail. And
with the A12 Bionic, the new Apple TV 4K can now play HDR in high frame rate. This
allows video to play more smoothly and appear more lifelike than ever before, which
will be great for fast moving action like sports. We're working with leading providers
across the globe as they begin to stream in high frame rate HDR.
And it's not just professionally produced programs that will look amazing. For those
of you with an iPhone 12 Pro you can already record in Dolby Vision at 60 frames per
second. And to enjoy all these moments in the best quality on the new Apple TV 4K,
we've enhanced AirPlay to support high frame rate HDR. We want everything you
watch on Apple TV to look amazing, but because every TV settings are diﬀerent, it's
challenging to know if you're getting the best picture until now. With our new color
balance feature, Apple TV will work with your iPhone and its advanced sensors to
improve your TV's picture quality. Your iPhone users its camera and proximity sensor
to guide you to an on-screen target, color measurement start automatically. Apple TV
uses the light sensor in your iPhone to compare your TV's color balance to the
industry standard speciﬁcations used by cinematographers worldwide.
Using this data, Apple TV will then automatically tailor its video output to
compensate for any inaccuracies in your TV's picture settings. So you'll now see
much more accurate color without you ever having to adjust your TV. The results can
be dramatic, with more natural colors and improved contrast making your TV look
better than ever. Of course the way you interact with Apple TV is with the SIRI
remote. So this year, we completely redesigned it with new functionality and
controls.
It starts with a new one piece aluminum design that ﬁts perfectly in your hand. And
with contrasting controls, you can easily ﬁnd and hit just the button you want. We
also have a brand new ClickPad with ﬁve way navigation for better accuracy and the
entire ClickPad is touch enabled preserving the fast directional swipes users love,
and we did something pretty cool with the outer ring, we've given it a new circular
adjuster that turns it into a jaw control, perfect for ﬁnding just the scene you're
looking for. We've also made it the only remote you need for your TV, it now has aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

the SIRI button to the side, just like on your iPhone. The enclosure is made from
100% recycled aluminum joining Apple TV 4K and all of our products and furthering
our commitment to reducing our environmental impact. So that's the new Apple TV
4K. It'll be available for $179 with 32 gigabytes or $199 with double the storage
capacity, perfect for enjoying even more apps and games. You can order them on
April 30th and they will be available in the second half of May. With the power of A12
Bionic, the realism of high frame rate HDR and a totally redesigned SIRI remote, the
new Apple TV 4K brings the absolute best entertainment experience to your home.

Now let's talk about the Mac. There has never been a more exciting time for the Mac.
We've recently announced that we were embarking on a two-year transition to Apple
silicon and we're oﬀ to an incredible start. The reception to the new MacBook Air,
MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with M1 has been oﬀ the charts. WIRED called M1, a Mac
revolution. M1 delivers incredible performance, custom technologies and
revolutionary power eﬃciency. With a giant leap in performance per watt, every Mac
with M1 is transformed into a completely diﬀerent class of product. This isn't just an
upgrade, it's a breakthrough. Our customers agree as Mac continues to lead the
industry in customer satisfaction. And our Mac business has never been stronger, our
M1 products have continued to fuel the Mac's incredible growth and now represent
the majority of our Mac sales.
Today, M1's profound impact on the Mac continues as we are about to take another
exciting step forward. To tell you more, here's John.
(Video Presentation)
M1 has been a gigantic leap forward for the Mac. It has redeﬁned the MacBook Air,
MacBook Pro and Mac Mini shattering expectations of what each of them can do.
They've shown how M1 plus macOS Big Sur can bring breakthrough performance
and power eﬃciency to the Mac. Users have been absolutely blown away by the
responsiveness and amazing battery life. And developers have been busy delivering
universal versions of their apps, in fact, there are now thousands of universal apps
available that take full advantage of M1 and Big Sur, including Photoshop, Twitter,
Microsoft Oﬃce, Quicken, Slack, Aﬃnity Publisher, Zappos, 1Password and DaVinci
Resolve, and there are more arriving every week.
These Macs demonstrate how M1 can dramatically move the Mac forward, but there's
even more that they can do. With its system on the chip architecture, M1 allows us to
push the Mac far beyond what was previously possible and that's why we're here,
because today we're thrilled to introduce the Mac that has been built from the
ground up around M1, and here it is.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

The all-new completely redesigned iMac Is more personal, more powerful and more
capable than ever and it's incredible from every angle. It's bursting with color from
both the front and the back and it practically disappears when you view it from the
side.
Let's take a look at its revolutionary design. iMac's new form is stunning with the
spectrum of vibrant colors, so you can choose the one that ﬁts your own personal
style. We wanted it to feel light and optimistic while instantly brightening up any
space. From the front, iMac is clean and simple, with a single sheet of glass covering
the entire surface. The softer colors and light grey borders ground the iMac in your
environment and allow you to focus on your content. In contrast to the more neutral
front, the back is designed to really celebrate color with bold richly saturated shades.
In many places, the back of iMac is the ﬁrst thing you'll see, so we created colors,
that would bring a sense of joy to any space.
Next let's check out the striking side proﬁle, where you really see the profound
impact of M1. With every generation, iMac has moved closer to our vision, to make
the computer disappear. And while we've had the same great design for several
years, we haven't had the technology to take the next big step until now, because M1
has enabled us to get closer to that vision than ever before. For comparison, let's
take a look at the previous iMac, the logic thermals were huge because of the power
hungry processor and the CPU/GPU and other components were all separate chips
in the system. Now with the System on a Chip architecture of M1, these are all
consolidated into this much smaller logic board, and because M1 is far more power-
eﬃcient, the bulky thermal system is replaced by just two small fans. This keeps the
system cool, while running exceptionally quiet. In fact for typical use, iMac stays
under 10 decibels, which is barely audible to the human ear. Together, these two
components help reduce iMac's overall volume by over 50%, the result is a design
that's much more compact and just a 11.5 millimeter spin. And with an even smaller
footprint, it ﬁts easily into many more spaces.
Next iMac has always been about its best-in-class display. So on the new iMac, we
made the display and expansive 24 inches. By narrowing the borders, we did a
signiﬁcantly bigger display and a design that's only slightly larger than the 21.5 inch
iMac, and it has nearly 11.3 million pixels in its 4.5K Retina display, so you can see
your content in all its glorious detail and with a feature-wide gamut and over a 1
billion colors, plus 500 nits of brightness, every image is brilliant and vivid. It also
has True Tone, which automatically adjusts the color temperature as you're
environment changes for more natural viewing experience. And it has a coating with
industry-leading low reﬂectivity for greater comfort and readability. iMac's new
design with this immersive display is awesome and we're just getting started. We
also pushed every other aspect of the experience forward.
First, we've taken iMac's camera, mics and speakers to a whole new level. And to tell
you more, here's (inaudible).FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

We've all been spending more and more time on video calls. So with the new iMac,
it was important to us to enhance the core technologies that keep us connected.
Let's start with the camera. iMac, now has the 1080p Facetime HD camera, which
doubles the resolution for much higher quality video and with a larger sensor, the
camera performs great in low light. The camera's paired with M1 which has Apple's
latest image signal processor or ISP, this works to further enhance the image quality
with computational video.
Let's take a look at the processing pipeline. As you use the camera, the ISP goes
through a series of steps to analyze and enhance each pixel at over a trillion
operations per second. For example, it works with M1's Neural Engine to make more
intelligent exposure and bypass adjustments. So you're lighting is always just right. It
utilizes advanced noise reduction algorithms to bring a new level of clarity to video
and it uses tone mapping to deliver enhanced dynamic range, bringing more detail
to bright highlights and dark shadows. This camera will make you look like a rock
star. In fact, it's the best camera we've ever put in a Mac.
And to complement the camera, we gave iMac, a studio-quality three-mic array. The
mics are engineered to reduce feedback from the rest of the system, so
conversations ﬂow more naturally and you'll interrupt each other less. And
beamforming allows these mics to better ignore background noise and focus on
your voice, which means you will come through loud and clear on video calls or
when recording an audio track. This is also the best mic system ever in a Mac.
Now with this amazing camera and mic array, you know we leveled up the speakers
too. To create big room ﬁlling sound, speakers need to displace a lot of air. In order
to do this, we increased the power driving the iMac sound system. Now while iMac
needed to have big sound, it also had to deliver accurate sound, so we gave it two
pairs of force-cancelling woofers that produce an incredible base response while
reducing unintended vibrations from that increased power and we balanced each
set with a high performance tweeter. The result is a six speaker system that produces
a massive sound stage with strong articulate base and crystal clear myths and highs.
All of these speaker innovations coupled with advanced algorithms enable iMac to
support spatial audio when playing video with Dolby Atmos. On the beautiful 4.5K
retina display, it's an outstanding movie watching experience. With its dramatic
improvements in balance, vocal clarity and instrument separation, iMac delivers a
remarkably robust and high quality audio experience. Simply put, it's the best sound
system ever in a Mac and we can't wait for you to hear it.
Back to you, Colin [ph].
With these camera and audio features and it's stunning display, iMac delivers an
entirely new level of capability. Now adding the power and performance of M1 and
macOS Big Sur, this experience is simply unrivaled. You can feel the diﬀerence
immediately, as iMac wakes almost instantly and your apps launch with blazingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

Page 8 of 15speed, everything you do on macOS Big Sur is extremely responsive and the apps
you use every day are fast and ﬂuid, like in Safari you can browse even faster and run
hundreds of tabs at once. And photos you can apply through to your iPhone images.
And in Apple Arcade. Gaming on iMac is better than ever, with awesome and
exclusive games like Warp Drive, M1 delivers so much great performance, you can
even keep playing while simultaneously taking your next zoom call. And with
powerful creative apps optimized for M1, it's easier than ever to explore your passion
or ﬁnd a new one. When it comes to CPU performance and apps like Xcode,
Lightroom, and iMovie, iMac is up to 85% faster than the previous 21.5 inch iMac
models, so you can compile new apps in Xcode in a fraction of the time, easily work
with massive 100 mega pixel photos in Lightroom and export your favorite video
projects in iMovie faster than ever.
And when it comes to GPU performance, for certain apps, like Aﬃnity Photo and
Photoshop, iMac is up to 2 times faster than the previous models and it's even up to
50% faster than the most powerful discrete graphics in the fastest 21.5 inch iMac, so
you can render edits to your next brilliant composition in real-time with Aﬃnity Photo
or quickly transform a picture into an oil painting with Photoshop and then Final Cut
Pro you can edit up to ﬁve streams of 4K footage or one stream of 8K footage
without dropping a frame. And machine learning is now to 3 times faster and apps
that leverage M1 16 core Neural Engine. So apps like Vectornator, which can swiftly
turn a photo into vector layers get even faster on iMac and because iMac has the
same chip architecture as iPhone and iPad, you can run iPhone and iPad apps like
Headspace and Zillow right on your iMac without breaking your workﬂow.
Or, you can enjoy games like Sky: Children of the Light while you spread out on iMac
and use your keyboard as a game controller. And with outside and continuity it's
easier than ever to use iMac and iPhone together. Your calls and text come right to
iMac. So no need to switch devices when you're in the zone. And that email you
started on iPhone, you can use handoﬀ to ﬁnish it on iMac. And you can even copy
text and images on iPhone and then paste them right into a document on iMac with
the magic of universal support. And all your content is always available and up to-
date across all your Apple devices. You're going to love the combination of M1 and
macOS on the new iMac. It's the ultimate Big Sur experience, and we're not done
yet. iMac has state-of-the-art connectivity for all your data and devices. It has up to
four USB C ports, including two thunderbolt ports for super-fast data transfer and
support for up to a 6K display like the proto/SDR and we created a new power
conductor that attaches magnetically, so it's quick and easy to connect. It has a two-
meter color match woven cable that leads to a small power adapter which can be
placed on the ﬂoor behind your desk.
And for Ethernet checkout this cool innovation, it connects to the adapter and runs
through the power cable to keep your desktop less cluttered.
Now let's take a closer look at iMac's new keyboard, mouse and Trackpad options.
You can choose from three types of keyboards with gorgeous aluminum enclosures
color matched to iMac. First, there is a Magic keyboard with new emoji, spotlight,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

a Magic keyboard with an exciting new feature, Touch ID which comes to the Mac
desktop for the ﬁrst time. Wireless ﬁngerprint data transmission is made possible by
a secure processor in the keyboard. It communicates directly with the Secure Enclave
and in M1 creating an encrypted channel to protect your ﬁngerprint data from end-
to-end. So whether you're making a purchase with Apple Pay or unlocking your iMac,
it's fast, easy and secure. And Touch ID also works with fast user switching so you can
change to a diﬀerent user proﬁle with just a touch of the ﬁnger, and there is a Magic
keyboard with Touch ID and a numeric keypad too.
Magic Mouse loved by iMac users now features color matched aluminum. And
Magic Trackpad still by far the industry's best has a reﬁned shape to match the new
keyboard. These new accessories complete the system and bring even more
capability to iMac. With a colorful cutting edge design, best-in-class features, the
power of M1 and macOS Big Sur, the new iMac can do it all dynamically transforming
any space into whatever you need it to be.
Let's take a look at the many ways iMac can ﬁt into your life.

Page 10 of 15That's right the M1 chip is not just in the Mac, it's now in iPad Pro and it's going to
blow you away. iPad Pro has always use turbocharge versions of our A-series chips to
deliver a powerful and responsive experience that's years ahead of anything else. M1
continues that momentum to an entirely new level, with a big jump in performance
to run powerful apps and drive a high performance ecosystem. For M1 to ﬁt into its
incredibly thin and light design requires power eﬃciency that's way beyond just
being better, it has to be amazing and M1 delivers. And because M1 shares the same
fundamental architecture of A series chips, iPad OS is already built to take full
advantage of its powerful technology.
The next level performance that M1 unlocks on iPad Pro starts with its powerful CPU,
built around the world's fastest CPU core and low power silicon, gate core design of
M1 delivers a whopping 50% jump over the industry leading performance of the
previous iPad Pro. What's amazing is that compared to the ﬁrst generation iPad, this
iPad Pro now delivers up to 75 times faster CPU performance. It's no wonder apps
are pushing the limits of what's possible on iPad from blazing performance for
Vector and raster tools and aﬃnity designer to rendering the most detailed designs
with Shapr 3D, to adding complex eﬀects to 4K videos in LumaFusion. iPad's
expansive display comes bursting to life with M1's amazing graphics performance.
The 8 core GPU is in a class of its own delivering up to 40% faster graphics
performance.
Again compared to the ﬁrst generation iPad get ready for this, the graphics of this
new iPad Pro is now over 1,500 times faster, that's just ridiculous, so painting with
water colors and oils and Adobe Fresco look and feel like the real thing and you can
bring the most Intrepid AR models into the real world with GigSpace, you can also
play the latest games with console quality graphics at super high frame rates. This
raw performance along with the pro motion display, four speakers and now support
for the latest Play Station or Xbox game controllers with haptics makes playing
games on iPad Pro insanely fun. With this combination of CPU and graphics
performance, the new iPad Pro is yet again the fastest of eyes of its kind, it's not even
close, but it's bigger than that because powerful custom technologies like our latest
16 core Apple neural engine, advanced image signal processor and uniﬁed high
bandwidth memory architecture make iPad Pro more capable than ever. And the
industry leading power eﬃciency of M1 enables all of that amazing performance
along with all day battery life in the incredibly thin and light design of iPad Pro.
The new iPad Pro also allows users to access their content faster than ever, with up to
2 times faster storage and for our most demanding users a new 2 terabyte
conﬁguration gives you enormous storage capacity, so you can keep up to 60,000
pro raw photos at your ﬁngertips or up to 220 hours of 4K HDR video content with
you wherever you go.
M1 brings much faster connectivity to iPad Pro as well. The USB C port already
support superfast data transfers and now we're adding Thunderbolt with USB 4
support as well, making it the fastest most versatile port ever on an iPad or any other
device of its kind. Not only is there 4 times more bandwidth for wired connections
up to 40 gigabits per second, Thunderbolt also opens up a massive ecosystem ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

Display XDR now at its full 6K resolution and all connected using high performance
cables and docs. iPad Pro now ﬁts perfectly into so many more workﬂows.
Now on a mobile device like iPad Pro, ultrafast wireless connections are absolutely
critical and that's why we've added 5G to iPad Pro, accessing ﬁles, collaborating with
colleagues and backing up data are fundamental when you're on the go.
This is huge superfast 5G cellular connections lets users be creative and productive
wherever they are, download speeds can be as high as 3.5 gigabits per second in
ideal conditions. Of course 5G speeds will vary by carrier and region. In the U.S.,
iPad Pro also supports millimeter wave, the high frequency version of 5G, and with
this model, iPad Pro can reach up to 4 gigabits per second peak download speeds in
ideal conditions. So no matter where you work takes you, you can live stream from
wherever you are.
(Video Presentation)
The blazing speeds of 5G allow you to do just about anything just about anywhere,
and there is more. iPad's versatility is further enhanced by its pro cameras. And to tell
you more, here's Fiona.
Customers love taking stunning photos and videos on their iPad and with powerful
apps, these advanced scanners enable so much more like video capture for mobile
journalists and content creators, especially with the built-in stereo quality mics on
iPad Pro and with the lighter scanner they pave the way to completely new
workﬂows, like motion tracking, recontract AR, super accurate depth data makes

Check out this new version of clips, which is the lighter scanner to transform your
living room into a magical space for your next video. How fun is that? And with the
more powerful ISP and M1, we got smart HDR 3 where the ISP and the Neural Engine
work together to just color, contrast and noise in distinct parts of the photo. And in
low light conditions, the ISP and lighter scanner quickly and accurately focus images
and videos to capture incredible details from almost no light at all. On the front, the
TrueDepth camera instantly and securely unlocks iPad with Face ID and takes
portraits oﬃce which look amazing on that large display.
And now more than ever, it plays an important role when collaborating with co-
workers and connecting with family and friends. So in the new iPad Pro, we're going
to take a huge step forward by updating the TrueDepth camera system to include an
all new ultra-wide camera designed speciﬁcally for iPad. It features a new 12FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20

Page 12 of 15megapixel sensor with a 122 degree ﬁeld of view, which enables something really
cool, and we call it, Center Stage.
Center Stage uses the new ultra-wide camera and machine learning to recognize
and keep you in the central of the view. What's amazing is as you move around, it
automatically pans to keep you in the sharp, and that's not all, when others join in, it
recognizes them too and zoom's out to ﬁt everyone into the view. So whether it's a
wide porting session with co-workers or a family get together, the experience of
connecting is now more engaging than ever. So that's the new ultra-wide camera
with Center Stage, video calls never looked so good.
Now back to Roger.
IPad is a magical sheet of glass that can become anything you want it to be, and the
center piece of that experience on iPad Pro is its stunning liquid retina display, which
features a long list of advanced display technologies, many that we've pioneered on
iPad. We introduced it as the world's most advanced mobile display. The liquid retina
display delivers nearly 4 million pixels on the 11 inch iPad Pro. Users love being able
to take the most powerful iPad experience with them everywhere in a portable one
pound design. On the immersive 12.9 inch iPad Pro, it delivers an enormous 5.6
million pixels, this is for those who want the biggest window for their creative
workﬂows, and we have some exciting news here.
We know our users are increasingly creating content with the high brightness and
high contrast ratio of HDR. So we ﬁrst equipped creative users with the Pro Display
XDR to view and edit their content. This amazing display delivers extremely high
brightness and an extremely high contrast ratio. And now, we're going to take the
next big step. We're bringing the stunning fronter screen performance of our Pro
Display XDR to a 12.9 inch iPad Pro. So our users can take their XDR workﬂow
wherever they go. This is the new liquid retina XDR display and it delivers a 1000 nits
of full screen brightness, a breath-taking 1,600 nits of peak brightness and a
phenomenal 1 million to 1 contrast ratio just like Pro Display XDR.
Now due to the ultrathin design of iPad Pro compared to the Pro Display XDR, we
had to take an entirely new approach to make this happen. So to tell you all about it,
here's (inaudible).
Extreme dynamic range is all about delivering a visual experience that reﬂects what
we see in the real world. This means seeing the brightest highlights, along with
several details in the darkest parts of an image, bringing the XDR experience to iPad
Pro was an enormous challenge. We had to rethink how the display creates light. So
we went back to the drawing board, to achieve way higher brightness we used an
array of LEDs across the entire back of the display similar to the Pro Display XDR.
And to ﬁt within the ultrathin iPad Pro design, these LEDs need to be incredibly
small. So we developed a mini LED, which is over a 120 times smaller in volume than
the previous design. And because these mini LEDs are so small, achieving extremely
high brightness requires lots of them and I mean thousands of them. In fact, thereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 13 of 15are over 10,000 LEDs that deliver XDR level brightness on that stunning 12.9 inch
display. That's a massive increase over the 72 LEDs that were in the previous iPad Pro.
We then grouped these mini LEDs into over 2,500 local dimming zones, so
depending on the content we can precisely adjust the brightness in each zone. The
result is an extremely high 1 million to 1 contrast ratio. The light is then shaped by a
series of incredibly thin custom design optical ﬁlms and diﬀusers, and that's why this
display can ﬁt into a design that's just 6.4 millimeters thin, weighs just 1.5 pounds
and still delivers all day battery life. So XDR content with the ﬁnest specular
highlights like Galaxy's and Star ﬁelds is more true to life than ever. We're thrilled to
deliver the XDR experience on the new iPad Pro.
Back to Roger [ph].
There's never been a display that delivers this kind of visual experience on any other
mobile device. So users can now do things they can never do before. Videographers
have a large XDR display, they can take with them everywhere and edit true to life
HDR content using LumaFusion. Photographers can see even more detail when
editing their images right on iPad using Lightroom. And ﬁlmmakers can more
conﬁdently review and approve HDR content with frame IO, previewing it as its
meant to be seen from anywhere on the set.
And everyone can enjoy a mobile cinematic viewing and listening experience with
support for HDR video formats like HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision. And the advanced
sound system supports Dolby Atmos as well. So this is our new 12.9 inch Liquid
Retina XDR display. With this amazing set of features, it goes beyond any display in
the world, and we couldn't wait to put the new iPad Pro with all of its advanced new
technologies in the hands of our developers.
Checkout what happened when we did.

We're always amazed by the new capabilities our developers put in the hands of our
users. Of course you can talk about iPad Pro and not talk about the phenomenal
accessories that make it even more versatile and capable. Apple Pencil transforms
iPad Pro into an immersive drawing canvas and the world's best note taking device
by far, and scribble now with support for ﬁve additional languages allows you to
write in any text ﬁeld so you never have to put Apple Pencil away. And iPad Pro
supports the thin and light smart keyboard portfolio and the Magic keyboard with its
backlit keys, integrated Trackpad and ﬂoating design not only is it a great typing
experience, it's now also available in a gorgeous new white color.
Finally iPad Pro has been carefully designed to minimize its impact on the
environment and support our overall net zero carbon goal. It uses 100% recycled
aluminum for the entire enclosure and 100% recycled rare earth elements in the
magnets of the speakers and enclosure. iPad Pro is also free of a long list of harmfulFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-20
