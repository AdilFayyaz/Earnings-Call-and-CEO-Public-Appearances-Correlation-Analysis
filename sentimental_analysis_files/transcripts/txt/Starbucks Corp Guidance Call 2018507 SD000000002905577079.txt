Shaw, you may begin your conference.
{BIO 17370352 <GO>}
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And we appreciate you joining us this early to
start your week. Last night, we announced that Starbucks and NestlÃ© will form a
global coﬀee alliance to elevate and expand Consumer Packaged Goods and
Foodservice categories. On today's call, Kevin Johnson, President and CEO of
Starbucks, will provide further details and the strategic rationale behind the alliance.
Then joining us for Q&A will be John Culver, Group President, International and
Channels; and Scott Maw, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call will contain
forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risk and uncertainties that
could cause our actual results to diﬀer materially from these statements. Any such
statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements and
risk factor discussions in our ﬁlings with the SEC, including our last annual report on
Form 10-K and the press release we issued last night regarding our plans with
NestlÃ©. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking
statements or information.
Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com for the related press release as
well as to ﬁnd a reconciliation of non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures that may be
referenced in today's call with our most directly comparable GAAP measures.
This conference call is being webcast. And an archive of the webcast will be
available on our website until Wednesday, June 6, 2018.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Our today's announcement of our new
global coﬀee alliance with NestlÃ© is a signiﬁcant strategic milestone for Starbucks.
Underpinning the alliance is our continued focus on driving long-term value creation
for our shareholders. And the alliance will also deliver many meaningful additional
beneﬁts for both companies. I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share my
perspective on the alliance. And then John, Scott and I will take your questions.
First, this global coﬀee alliance brings together the world's leading coﬀee brand and
retailer, the world's largest food and beverage company and the world's largest and
fastest-growing installed base of at-home, single-serve coﬀee machines. Starbucks
and NestlÃ© share similar values. And both companies have long coﬀee heritages
with an emphasis on premium experience related to all things coﬀee.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 14As part of the alliance, Starbucks will supply and license to NestlÃ© exclusive rights
to market, sell and distribute Starbucks-, Seattle's Best Coﬀee; and Teavana-branded
products through the Consumer Packaged Goods and Foodservice channels
globally. NestlÃ© will bring our Starbucks brand into regional markets around the
world where we currently have no CPG assets or presence. The alliance will also
bring Starbucks Coﬀee to both the Nespresso and Dolce Gusto machine platforms.
Together, the world's largest installed base of at-home coﬀee systems, a global
installed base estimated to be greater than that of Keurig. This aspect of the alliance
materially expands Starbucks' assets to the addressable, single-serve coﬀee market
beyond our already sizable share of the Keurig K-cup category in North America. In
consideration of this relationship, Starbucks will receive an upfront cash payment of
$7.15 billion and ongoing revenue from product sales and royalties.
The NestlÃ© alliance will not be our ﬁrst. It will be similar to the successful,
collaborative relationships we currently enjoy with Pepsi, Anheuser-Busch, Tingyi,
Arla and others around our global ready-to-drink beverage businesses, which are
notably excluded from this alliance.
The alliance leverages the core strengths and combined scale and sophistication of
2 of the strongest and most recognized and respected consumer brands and
consumer product companies in the world. It will, over time, transform, expand and
elevate both the at-home and away-from-home coﬀee and related categories all
around the world. And it will do so long into the future.
For all Starbucks shareholders, I want to walk you through both the strategic
rationale as well as the economic rationale supporting this agreement. Let me begin
by framing the opportunity for you.
Starbucks today operates over 28,000 retail stores in 76 markets around the world.
And we are adding over 2,000 net new stores every year, including more than 500
in China alone. Our global leadership and authority around all things coﬀee and our
reputation for sourcing and roasting the highest quality coﬀees in the world has
been built, One Cup at a Time, over the last 42 years.
Today, Starbucks is recognized as the world's leading coﬀee brand and coﬀee
retailer, serving nearly 100 million retail customer occasions around the world every
week. Complementing Starbucks' North America retail store portfolio is a powerful
CPG business, our Channel Development segment. This has been ﬁring on all
cylinders and has been a brand ampliﬁer in North America, which has generated
signiﬁcant shareholder value over the past several years.
Let me explain what I mean by a brand ampliﬁer. In the U.S., the Starbucks retail
store footprint and the elevated Starbucks Experience we deliver to our customers
has established broad awareness of the Starbucks brand. That brand awareness was
ampliﬁed by Channel Development when Starbucks branded, packaged, roasted
ground and single-serve coﬀee became available at tens of thousands of grocery,
mass merchant and Foodservice locations across the U.S. The increased reach ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Starbucks at-home coﬀee enabled customers to sample new Starbucks coﬀees and
become even more engaged with our brand, both at retail and CPG. In short, our
retail stores established the brand. And our coﬀee at-home ampliﬁes the brand. The
fact is that we have established a global retail store footprint and global awareness
of the Starbucks brand. But the brand ampliﬁer, our Channel Development business,
is nascent in all countries outside of North America. Therefore, the core strategic
rationale for this agreement can be summarized as follows: leverage NestlÃ©'s reach
and scale to rapidly accelerate growth in Channel Development globally as a brand
ampliﬁer for our retail store business; introduce Starbucks brands to the Nespresso
and Dolce Gusto system platforms, together, the world's leading at-home coﬀee
systems with particular strength outside of North America; and establish the
deﬁnitive global coﬀee alliance in a rapidly changing, competitive landscape.
Every Starbucks market around the world will ultimately beneﬁt strategically from this
partnership. In addition to the strategic rationale, we also shape the alliance with an
eye on long-term economic value, the value it would create for Starbucks
shareholders, which includes an immediate upfront payment with signiﬁcant
ongoing economics; rapid expansion of addressable growth markets, both new
countries and new platforms, including Nespresso and Dolce Gusto; further
streamlining our business to enable increased focus on growing our core retail
businesses, particularly in our critical markets of the U.S. and China; and scale
economics for both Starbucks and NestlÃ© in North America and beyond.
As a result of the transaction, we now expect our 3-year commitment for cash
returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases to approach $20
billion with most of the incremental $5 billion of net after-tax proceeds of this
transaction impacting ﬁscal '19 share repurchases. And we expect the transaction to
be EPS accretive within three years or sooner.
Now I've had the pleasure to work closely with NestlÃ©'s CEO, Mark Schneider. And
the NestlÃ© senior leadership team over the past several months deﬁning this
alliance and has come to realize just how operationally and culturally well suited
Starbucks and NestlÃ© are together. We are both like-minded and purpose-driven
companies with values-based leadership teams and long-standing commitments to
social, environmental and community responsibility. We share similar views on the
need to expand C.A.F. E. Practices, coﬀee farmer education and support and
agronomy initiatives around the world. And we share the belief that a public
company can have a positive impact on society and the environment, while still
delivering increased proﬁts and creating long-term shareholder value.
Mark has become a friend and a valued business partner. And we are both
personally committed to making this a win-win partnership for both companies and
both companies' shareholders while, at the same time, serving our customers in all
parts of the world. It is also important to note that upon closing, which we expect to
occur this summer or early fall, NestlÃ© will oﬀer employment to virtually all
Starbucks' partners impacted by this transaction, assuring a seamless transition.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07

Q - John Stephenson Glass
A - Scott Harlan MawIn closing, we are all exceptionally proud of the channels business we've built and
the entrepreneurial partners that have consistently driven this business to perform at
well-above industry averages. We're looking forward to working with our colleagues
at NestlÃ© to bring Starbucks-branded coﬀee and Teavana-branded teas to even
more consumers and more global markets in the years ahead.
We'll now take questions. Operator?
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Your ﬁrst question comes from John Glass from Morgan
Stanley.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Scott or others, could you please just maybe provide a little bit more detail on 2
things? One is you said, earnings accretive within the next three years. So does it
mean that it is dilutive or maybe this just earnings neutral in the intermediate time?
Then maybe how can we look at what the remaining shell development revenues
and proﬁt streams are? You're going to be selling coﬀee to NestlÃ©, I assume. And
getting a royalty. Is there any way to dimensionalize how big that piece of the
business is on a new go-forward basis?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Thanks, John. First I want to reiterate what Kevin said that we're excited to start this
new alliance, creating new opportunities to unlock new avenues of growth on a
global basis, while driving a deeper focus on our own retail operations. And some of
the speciﬁc ﬁnancial impacts are yet to be ﬁnalized from an accounting standpoint,
especially the revenue recognition of the upfront payment, which is a material part of
the ﬁnancials going forward. But let me give you some preliminary ranges that I think
will help with John's question. So in 2019, using our non-GAAP ﬁnancials as a base
and assuming the deal closes on October 1 and including an initial estimate of the
accounting for the upfront payment, we expect total company revenue growth will
be impacted by about 2 to 3 points from lower revenues under the license model.
Fiscal '19 revenue growth normalized for this. And all other streamline-related
activities is still expected to grow in the high single digits. When you exclude the
transaction-related costs, we expect ﬁscal '18 EPS growth will also be impacted by
about 2 to 3 points. And as Kevin stated, we expect this will become accretive to EPS
within three years or sooner. So signiﬁcant ongoing retained economics plus the
upside that we get from participation on NestlÃ©'s systems plus the impact of the
buybacks gets us to EPS breakeven pretty quickly. And we'll give more speciﬁcs as
we move through the year. We need to better understand the accounting treatment.
We're working with our accountants and auditors to further dimensionalize that. And
we'll get back to you before our planning cycle and our guidance as we move
through earnings.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07

Q - Jeﬀrey Andrew Bernstein
A - Scott Harlan Maw
A - Kevin R. JohnsonYour next question comes from Jeﬀrey Bernstein from Barclays.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Great. Just wondering, broadly speaking, how you arrive at the valuation and
whether you're able to share any of the royalty terms, perhaps related to that? I'm
just wondering for perspective, if you can maybe compare the past partnerships? I
know that in the past, you had a relationship with Kraft related to the CPG business
and, ultimately, brought it back in-house, believing it was better run by yourself. So
just wondering how this partnership might diﬀer from that, both positive and
negative.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Thanks, Jeﬀ. I'll talk a bit about valuation. And then I'll hand it to Kevin for the second
part of your question. I think it's important to understand that we love our CPG
business. We are most deﬁnitely not selling it outright. And while we receive a very
large upfront payment from NestlÃ©, we will retain a signiﬁcant interest in the
ongoing economics and signiﬁcant rights in the brands. Under NestlÃ©'s
stewardship and on their global platforms, we expect the distribution channel to
meaningfully grow, providing us the chance to participate in a much greater pool,
while simultaneously reducing the complexity of running both retail and CPG
channels. You also have to value the initial cash ﬂows we will receive from
participating on their platforms globally. We believe that ﬁlls quickly over the ﬁrst
few years, add in the value Starbucks for eﬃciencies across the supply chain and
beyond. And the related multiple that we're getting on this deal is actually in the
high teens, which is very, very compelling. I'd remind you that Channel Development
will continue to report the proﬁts of our ready-to-drink business, which is a
meaningful portion of the segment's earnings and future expected growth. And we
looked at the entire package that we'll receive. And again, just to summarize where
the value sits for Starbucks: the upfront payment, the continued economics from the
existing activities, new products and channels we'll build together with NestlÃ© all
over the world. And the eﬃciencies that I mentioned. We then factored in the tax
impact of the upfront payment. And the value of the entire package was signiﬁcantly
higher than our status quo valuation assumption. So that's important to understand.
But in addition to that, because this was not a traditional asset sale due to all the
continuing and growing economics received -- we'll receive, we hired Morgan
Stanley near the end of our process to provide an independent view of our valuation
work. And their independent analysis supports our conclusions regarding the
ﬁnancial merits of the deal to Starbucks. Kevin, you want to handle the second part?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes, Jeﬀrey. In terms of your question regarding this relationship with NestlÃ©
compared to the relationship in the past, this is a completely diﬀerent scope of
relationship. First of all, NestlÃ© has a long, long heritage in coﬀee, premium coﬀee.
They're the #1 at-home coﬀee system with Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, globally. And
they have declared coﬀee to be one of their top growth priorities as a company. SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07

Operator
Q - Sharon Zackﬁa
A - Scott Harlan Maw
A - John Culverthis is just core to what NestlÃ© does. That's number one. Number two, this is a
global relationship. In the past, we've had regional relationships. And the fact this is a
global relationship allows us to do much more with NestlÃ© as our partner, allows us
to put our energy into NestlÃ© and that relationship as our global CPG and
Foodservice's partners for roasted ground coﬀee for single-serve, whether it's
Nespresso, Dolce Gusto, K-Cup, the work we're doing now to bring Teavana sachets
and the dry teas down the aisle. This does not conﬂict with the ready-to-drink
partnerships. But it opens up a whole new aperture of things that we can do globally.
And by doing that, it creates that brand ampliﬁer. And third, the cultural ﬁt, I think,
between our 2 companies, is evident. We've had dialogue with them over the past
and, I think, clearly shared values and a shared focus on how we not only are driving
for shareholder value. But trying to do good along the way, speciﬁcally as it relates to
origin of coﬀee. The work that I think we have an opportunity to do together to make
coﬀee the ﬁrst sustainable agricultural product in the world, whether that be
agronomy research, whether that's the farmer support that we provide, I think we
have an opportunity to have a very positive impact together. And I think for those
reasons, we look at this in a very diﬀerent light than anything we've done in the past
as it relates to roasted ground and our single-serve coﬀees.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
The other thing I would just add to that, Jeﬀrey, is that this also goes beyond CPG
and includes Foodservice. And as Kevin highlighted in his script, obviously, outside
of the U.S., both our CPG business packaged coﬀee as well as our Foodservice
business is really nascent. And NestlÃ© clearly gives us the scale and the
opportunity and capability to grow much faster. So we're excited about it.
Your next question comes from Sharon Zackﬁa from William Blair.
{BIO 4804954 <GO>}
I think recalling back to the buyout of Kraft, one of the rationales is the ability to do
integrated marketing and kind of coordinated product launches between retail and
CPGs. So can you talk about the availability to do that with a NestlÃ© relationship
going forward? Then I might have missed this. But what is your % ownership of the
alliance?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think John will start. And I'll answer the second part.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
So Sharon, I think for us, obviously, we want to continue to work very closely with
NestlÃ© in terms of how our brand shows up in the marketplace, how we think
about innovation and how we continue to drive growth for packaged coﬀee and tea
down the aisle as well as in the Foodservice business. I think what you'll see is that
within this alliance, we have a detailed framework of how we will work together to
maximize that opportunity to leverage the best of both companies and ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07

Q - David E. Tarantino
A - Scott Harlan Mawcapabilities, to drive meaningful growth and, in particular, drive meaningful share
growth, both in packaged coﬀee as well as on their single-serve systems.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
And on the second part, Sharon, because it's an alliance, there's not an equity
ownership. But I think your question is probably more what's our ownership of the
economics going forward. Without getting into the speciﬁcs, what I will tell you is the
product supply revenue plus the royalties received, we receive both on our existing
businesses and in the future leaves signiﬁcant economics with Starbucks. And you
can see that, I think, in the relatively moderate impact on our EPS growth next year
and the speed at which this gets to accretion as we build this partnership with
NestlÃ©.
Your next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird.
{BIO 15144105 <GO>}
Scott, just a clariﬁcation maybe to help with some of the modeling on this. Could you
maybe just talk about if the deal was in place today, how much operating proﬁt
dilution you would have from the arrangement versus your current structure? Then
my second question is, why does it take until ﬁscal '20 or '21 for this to be accretive?
Is this something that you're assuming in terms of the pace of buyback activity? Or
are you assuming some level of growth once NestlÃ© controls the distribution that
makes it accretive in the out-years?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes, David. So on the ﬁnancial impact on operating income, the guidance I gave was
on EPS. And there's a reason why. And let me just talk a little bit about the
accounting. I'll try to stay out of the details here. But ﬁrst of all, this accounting is
under the new revenue recognition rule. So there's no real precedent. So we're
working through with our auditors to ﬁgure it out. But there are basically 2 methods
we'll be using and they have very diﬀerent outcomes within the P&L. And they have a
diﬀerent outcome on the bottom line initially. They end up being the same over time.
And one actually has an impact on interest expense because it's a ﬁnancing method.
And one is basically straight-line amortization of the revenue over time. So you can
understand on the operating income line item, one is a straight-line amortization of
the revenue and an equal amount in operating income and one actually reports
more revenue with the signiﬁcant amount of interest expense. So with that detail,
that's why it's hard for me to guide on operating income because the geography on
the P&L is actually quite diﬀerent. But if you look at the revenue impact, that's the
range of the revenue impact that I gave you picked up both of those methods and
the range of the EPS impact that I gave you picked up both of those methods, one
impacting operating income signiﬁcantly diﬀerently because of the interest
treatment. So that's the best way to think about it, modeling it all up. And we'll get
back to you as we know, obviously, what's the impact on channels margin, what's the
impact on the company's margin and as we get into guidance, we'll clarify all that
with you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07

Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Kevin R. JohnsonYour next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.
{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
Scott, just to follow up on your comment about the multiple being in the high teens,
is that EBITDA multiple on the proﬁt stream you're selling before tax on proceeds?
Then could you let us know what you think the tax might be on that $7.15 billion?
Then lastly, I assume that you think that this is going to bolster your EPS growth over
time. In other words, it's not only going to be better in the joint hands of you and
NestlÃ©. But perhaps this was going to be a drag on your growth before you sold it
if you ran it yourself versus your long-term algorithm as a company.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for the question, David. So the multiple I mentioned includes all of the
pieces. So the after-tax impact of buying back shares of the upfront payment. And
just to answer your second question, we'll take our buyback and dividend targets
over the next three years up from $15 billion to $20 billion. So that gives you an idea
that the after-tax proceeds is about $5 billion, in that range. Then all of the other
economic streams that we talked about, not only our ongoing interest in the North
American, particularly, piece of the partnership. But the international opportunities
that this opens up with NestlÃ©. And it absolutely is EPS accretive once you get
through that ﬁrst few years. And we think this is a signiﬁcant upside to the status quo
valuation in earnings of the business, just given what NestlÃ© unlocks for us
internationally, both in our existing businesses and in their platforms.
Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
First, I think, a basic question and then maybe a bigger one. What percentage of
CPG revenue and operating income is actually being sold, is the ﬁrst question? Then
secondly, I mean, you did mention Keurig and K-Cups. How does this in any way
aﬀect that relationship in the U.S.? I mean, obviously, there's been ownership
changes for that business. But contractually, what are you allowed to do, what may
you be forced to do in terms of any change on single cup on the K-Cup platform?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes, John, this is Kevin. I'll take your second question, then I'll hand over to Scott to
address your ﬁrst question. Look, regarding K-Cup, certainly, we've got a great
relationship with Keurig. And we've got a great business on K-Cup. We're the #1
share player of coﬀee on the Keurig system. And we intend to keep that. And we
have an agreement in place, allows us to continue to do that. Clearly, we're reaching
out and having a discussion with Keurig. But the -- strategically, we're going to stay in
the K-Cup business, full stop. Scott?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07

Operator{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. And on the ﬁrst part of your question, John, while we won't disclose the actual
retained economic interest, what I would tell you is that 2% to 3% that I quote at the
company level, obviously, the vast majority of that is going to be in the CPG
business. And so for your modeling on the top line, you can put it in there. And just
on the operating income line, I would just again reemphasize the diﬀerent methods
have quite a diﬀerent impact on channel operating income. So we've given total
company EPS impact. And we'll come back to you when we get the accounting
landed.
Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim.
{BIO 3948570 <GO>}
Just a clariﬁcation than a question. So that was 2% to 3% of the revenue today? Or
2% to 3% of future growth coming down?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Sorry, 2% to 3% of growth.
Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Actually just another quick clariﬁcation question. If I'm looking at as -- at CPG as
reported Channel Development segment, that's about $2 billion in revenue, which is
what the NestlÃ© press release indicated they were buying. So are they buying both
the CPG business and the Foodservice business that's included in that segment? Or
are there revenues sort of elsewhere on the P&L that are also getting pulled into the
agreement?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
It's a little bit of both, Karen. First of all, Foodservice globally is absolutely included in
that and we're pretty excited about the partnership and the upside that exists in our
Foodservice business with NestlÃ©. There is a little bit of revenue in some of the
other segments that are impacted by this agreement. Then I would just remind you
that the signiﬁcant economics we have in our ready-to-drink business, those are not
impacted by this NestlÃ©'s 100% with Starbucks.

Can you talk about today's announcement in the context of your strategic priorities
to streamline operations a bit more? Any broader cost savings that exist outside of
the Channel Development segment as you streamline the business further? Then just
if you could touch a little bit more on what this can do as it relates to a greater focus
on the retail business, both in the U.S. and China. And how signiﬁcant that could be
as you don't have to be as focused on the Channel Development business?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes, Dennis, thanks for the question. This is Kevin. I'll comment. And then let Scott
add to that. But clearly, we've called out the fact that we've been very focused on
streamlining the company in a way that allows us to put our focus and energy behind
the highest-priority value-creation drivers for the company. And certainly, our retail
business in the U.S. and China are the 2 big growth engines. We're in 76 countries
around the world. We care about every single country and what we're doing. But the
real emphasis has been on U.S. and China. So certainly, as part of that, you've seen
some of the actions that we've taken to address things like the underperformance of
the Teavana mall stores and closing those stores to allow us to save the G&A and put
more of our energy into the core business. We sold Tazo Tea, as an example. We
have gone through a SKU rationalization process to help trim some SKUs. That gives
us more eﬃciency, a number of things on that front. Secondly, then as you look at
the markets around the world, we've consistently been transitioning a number of
those markets to licensed markets whether that was Singapore, Germany, Brazil, the
market in Taiwan as well as then the acquisition of the East China. So getting the
markets lined up in the right operating models. Then certainly, this particular step is
a signiﬁcant one because this is a piece of the business that is very important. And as
I described in my comments, the way we look at this is when we open stores in a
market, we establish the brand and we begin engaging with customers in that
market. As soon as we then extend and have that CPG and Foodservice relationship
and tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of more points of presence where a
customer can engage with Starbucks and buy our coﬀee and our ready-to-drink and
the tea products, that becomes a brand ampliﬁer. And we've proven that. We've
proved that in North America. And so this opportunity is really about growth. It's a
brand ampliﬁer and it's growth in new markets. And it's growth on our new systems
platform -- platforms with Nespresso and Dolce Gusto. You see what happened
when we got on the Keurig platform and how we helped to grow that platform. The
Nespresso and Dolce Gusto platforms are estimated globally to have an installed
base that far exceeds that of Keurig. And so this is a big unlock for growth. It's a big
unlock for the brand ampliﬁer. And it's very consistent with what we've been doing
to streamline the company. So we put more and more of our energy into the core
value drivers of growing our retail business and speciﬁcally in the markets of U.S.
and China. Scott?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think the only thing I would add from a ﬁnancial perspective is in addition to what
Kevin talked about strategically with streamline, there's a capital deployment aspect
of this. So if you take the sum of what Kevin talks about and you think about what
we've done to date, it's about really getting capital deeper into the business that weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07

Q - William Everett Slabaughwant to grow. So if you look at the buyback program that we announced and the
dividend program of $15 billion now up to $20 billion, you look at the deal we did in
China to emphasize our retail operations there, we're taking capital in these growth
businesses and deploying where we think we can grow faster and taking capital out
where we think we have a better opportunity to deploy it elsewhere.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yes. And I would just add that this is also clearly utilizing NestlÃ©'s size, scale,
infrastructure to accelerate the growth that Kevin spoke about, whether that's on the
Packaged Goods product or Foodservice or on the single-serve systems. And clearly,
that is a huge opportunity that, to Scott's point, from a capital standpoint, would
have taken us a lot of capital in many years to build outside the U.S.
Your next question comes from Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.
{BIO 17063863 <GO>}
I guess on that last point, are there facilities that are being transferred as part of the
partnership? And how does this change what you currently produce and distribute?
And does this impact your CapEx related to the plans in the future?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
So there are a small amount of assets that are transferred. But really nothing in our
supply chain. So we'll continue to source roast and distribute our coﬀee through
NestlÃ©, similar to the way we do it today. The important part of the alliance, right, is
NestlÃ©'s strategic ability to help us with the branding, help us with the product set,
help us get into markets that were sort of nascent for us today. So that's really the
way I think about it from an overall capital deployment standpoint. No real change in
CapEx because, again, we're retaining all of our supply chain facilities.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yes. And I would just add that from a people's perspective, as Kevin shared, NestlÃ©
will take the majority of our people that sit -- our partners that sit in the Channel
Development and Foodservice organization. Then also we will continue to keep
those people located here in Seattle. And it'll be a business that will report directly
into NestlÃ© to support the growth.
Your next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens.
I want to ask on the single-serve market more broadly. That's been a pretty important
piece of the growth to attain Channel Development over the years. And it sounds
like that's expanding pretty meaningfully here. So I was wondering if you could putFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07

Q - Christopher Thomas O'Cullnumbers around what that may mean from a standpoint of households served with
Nespresso and Dolce Gusto versus where you stand currently?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yes. Will, this is John. With regards to the single-serve opportunity, clearly, the
market and the customers have shifted their at-home coﬀee consumption to single-
serve. We have been on the Keurig system now for six years. And we've built a
leading share. We're going to continue to be on that system. And clearly, the
opportunity with NestlÃ© as the leading single-serve system provider through the
Nespresso system as well as through Dolce Gusto creates a tremendous opportunity
for us to continue to meet the customers' needs in their homes. So we're very bullish
on the opportunity to continue to grow, both in-home as well as within the
Foodservice channels on the single-serve systems. And we're going to continue to
invest in this area. If -- in the most recent quarter, our single-serve business, K-Cups,
actually outgrew the total category by 2x. And we've seen consistent, strong growth
and share growth in single-serve. Starbucks is the leading share. And we're going to
continue to expand that globally now on the Nespresso and Dolce Gusto systems.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Let me just add one more comment for perspective. So about ﬁve years ago at our
Investor Day, we started talking about the signiﬁcant international opportunity that
Starbucks had in CPG. And at that time, CPG was about 10% of our business. And
ﬁve years later, the team has done a nice job growing that business. CPG has grown
a lot. But it's still about 10% of our business. Just with all the markets and all the
execution, we work really hard. Basically, the whole share the same. And so when
you think about what NestlÃ© brings internationally and the power of the Starbucks
brand, there's a huge unlock in these international markets that we've been working
at that this accelerates that meaningfully.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
And just to put that into context, we operate and have our CPG products available.
And it's been pretty dominant in the ready-to-drink category. But in about 28
countries around the world. And when you look at NestlÃ©, they operate in nearly
190 countries around the world. So clearly, they have a scale that we don't have. And
this is going to be a great partnership. And we're going to realize that opportunity
for growth.
And the last question comes from Chris O'Cull from Stifel.
Just had a modeling question and then a strategic question. The 2% to 3% impact on
revenue growth implies signiﬁcantly less revenue reduction than the $2 billion in the
CPG Foodservice segment revenue. So Scott, is it fair to assume the primary
diﬀerence is the ongoing supply revenue? Then my last question is, did the process
include discussions with any other potential partners?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-07

Yes. I'll start then. I'll take both of those. And Kevin can add on. The reason it's not a
bigger portion of that $2 billion is we still give what we call product sales revenue. So
the coﬀee that we'll be selling to NestlÃ© will still go through the revenue line item
and then the range is, obviously, impacted by the accounting. And yes, we talked to
a number of parties in this deal. And we're quite far with a number as well. And we
feel that NestlÃ© is not only the right strategic partner, as evidenced by all the things
we talked about strategically. But also the right ﬁnancial partner. And this is the right
ﬁnancial agreement for Starbucks.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Shaw for his closing remarks.
{BIO 17370352 <GO>}
Great. And that will conclude our call today. So I want to thank you again for joining
us. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at our Investor Day in China.
Have a great day.
