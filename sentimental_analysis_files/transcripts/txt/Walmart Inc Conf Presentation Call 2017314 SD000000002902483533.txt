Presentation
(audio in progress), the CEO of Walmart stores with us here today, especially on a
day like this and we appreciate all of you making it in on a day like this with the
weather.
Most of you are very familiar with Doug. He has been with Walmart since 1984,
working in many, many diﬀerent roles. He was a summer associate in a Walmart DC.
He's been an assistant store manager. He started as a buyer trainee when he entered
the merchandising organization.
Before taking over the CEO role of Walmart in 2014, Doug was President and CEO of
the Walmart International Division. He's had multiple leadership positions at Walmart
during his career.
He is also on Walmart's Board, I think as most of you know. He's also on several other
boards. He's on the Consumer Goods Forum. He's on the US China-based Business
Council. He's on the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art Board. He is also on
economic and business school advisory boards.
I don't know how he does all this stuﬀ and he comes to conferences in the middle of
snowstorms; so extremely busy guy. We really appreciate him making the time to be
here.
Also want to thank Brett Biggs, the CFO of Walmart, for coming and also Steve
Schmitt from Investor Relations. Both of them made the crazy trip as well. So let me
turn it over to Doug for some comments before we go into Q&A.

Page 2 of 17Good morning, everyone. It's really a relief to see other people here. Brett and Steve
and I thought we were going to be talking to each other this morning, which
wouldn't have been all bad. We have some things to talk about. But it's really nice
that you made it. Appreciate that.
We will make some forward-looking statements today. So please refer to our website
for our safe harbor statement.
Let's start with the customer, Robby, because I think that's ultimately where all this
change is coming from enabled by technology in particular. It's helpful in an
environment where the world is changing so much to break things into pieces.
And if we were to quickly characterize some of the pieces we think about, as it
relates to price, value is only going to increase. The product itself, quality is going to
improve. Prices are going to be under pressure over time. The Internet brings
eﬃciency.
It's also going to be increasingly transparent. You can see a lot of that today. That
trend is just going to continue and intensify.
Assortment has changed. There is a lot more choice out there. The world now has
access to just about everything, which is exciting as a retailer. Then on the
experience side, maybe there's more change happening there than anywhere else.
Technology, in particular, is being used to get rid of friction, make things simpler and
easier and customers just expect that, as a company, you are innovating all the time
and making things more enjoyable for them.
We've got to get faster. We've got to make our customers' worlds simpler and we
are excited about doing that and feel like we've just started to make some changes
that will help us win in the future.
So thinking about the customer back into the Company; what that means is, inside
the Company, we've got to change a lot and we have a history of changing. But I
think, in today's world, it's larger and faster than maybe it was in some past periods.
Inside the Company, this is a one-pager we use to talk to our own associates. At the
top, you'll see the purpose of the Company. We save people money so they can live
better. When Sam Walton said those words, he was on a stage receiving the
Presidential Medal of Freedom from George H. W. Bush and what he said after he
uttered those words was our customers will have a better lifestyle. And so, today, we
don't just think about saving them money, we do also think about saving them time
and creating a more sustainable company so that they beneﬁt when they shop with
us.
That next row refers to our four core values. When you are in a people business like
we are with 2.3 million people around the world working for the Company, it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 17important to constantly be talking about culture and values and behavior equals
culture and we want behaviors that are consistent with the four core values that you
see on this page and they have been timeless for us and we believe will be our four
core values for a long, long time.
Those four middle points I'm going to come back to in a second and break them
down piece by piece. These are the four things that this year in particular we are
most focused on and what I'm going to share with you is very consistent with what
we would tell all of our associates.
Last week, we had the Walmart US store manager team, about 7,000 people
together in Orlando. We also had the Sam's Club US meeting in Orlando at the same
time. So we had all of our management team from around the country assembled
and these are the things that we talked about with them while we were together.
As we do those things, we believe in shared value. We believe that multiple
stakeholders can beneﬁt from this Company. At its size and scale, we can make
decisions that will help local communities that will help shape systems to be more
sustainable, deliver for shareholders, win with customers and create opportunity for
our own associates. And as we design our system, if you want to think of it that way,
we are working to solve for all of the stakeholders that beneﬁt from Walmart.
So as it relates to these four objectives that we are focused on this year, I will start
with making everyday easier for busy families. This relates, as I mentioned just a
moment ago, to time and not just money. We really do believe that the omnichannel
model is the winner and we believe we see quantitative evidence to support that.
We are not just saying it because we happen to own and operate a bunch of stores.
Our data indicates that the customer is going to want to have a personal experience
and want to have some interaction with stores. But they also want an e-commerce
capability from the Company. They want to be able to have access.
They want to be able to do it easily and as we work together to ﬁgure out how to
take all the seams away, we see a path to winning. And in the future, customers won't
think as much about the seams that we see today -- stores, e-commerce. Today, you
are starting to see voice emerge. There will be a great virtual reality, an augmented
reality experience. They will order on their mobile device. All those things are going
to happen and we believe if we work hard enough, we can erase all the seams and
customers won't even think about it.
I personally experience this at times today when I'm shopping. My wife and I shop at
Walmart and Sam's Club, as you would expect and now Jet and a few other places
like Hayneedle and Shoebuy and Moose Jaw that we've acquired recently. But I
don't really think about the channel as much. Sometimes we pick merchandise up at
the Sam's Club in the local town that we've ordered on the mobile app the night
before. Sometimes we go in the club. Sometimes we place an order on e-commerce
and those lines are starting to blur away.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 17We are working hard now to erase those for all the customers and you can see it with
this acceleration in our e-commerce business. You can see it with our grocery pickup
business that we are building.
Recently, you may have heard about announcements related to payment with
Walmart Pay, or our scan-and-go capability at Sam's Club where, as you are going
through the Club, you put it on the ﬂatbed or the cart, when you get up to the front,
you completely skip the checkouts. You just go to the exit; an associate there has a
tablet; they look at what's in your cart, say thank you and have a good day and you
are gone.
We are also ﬁguring out how to do that within the Walmart Stores, not just the Sam's
Clubs. And in the last week or two, we made an announcement that this year we will
be rolling out some digital experiences with ﬁnancial services in the store and also at
pharmacy.
Today, it's too cumbersome to do a money transfer in our stores. You have to ﬁll out
a paper form that looks like it came from the IRS. Tomorrow, you will walk up, go to a
line and if you've been with us before, it will be incredibly fast. All those kinds of
changes have got to be delivered for our customers and members and we are on it.
As it relates to changing how we work, we were born with a low-cost mindset. But as
time goes on and a company gets bigger and older, you inherit bureaucracy layers
and expense that, in some cases, we don't need. We've been trying to chip away at
that. But we've got more of a transmission to go through.
We will keep working on the more conventional ways to reduce costs. But we are
really excited about changing how we work inside the Company to be digital inside,
not just with the things that customers see. But how we actually do work.
So if you just simply took the concept of designing for change for a customer and
instead thought about it as designing change for an associate, we can do a better
job of building new tools inside the Company, enabling them to have better access
to data, to be more digital.
Sometimes when I'm talking to our folks, I will say the phrase please go run that
report for me. It's going to go away. It's just there. The data is just there and the way
we have designed the work inside the Company is more like work would be
designed for an app for a customer.
And we do some of that now and I can tell some success stories about diﬀerent parts
of the business where it's being deployed. The great news is that makes you faster. It
also reduces costs because you just don't need as much overhead. And in addition
to taking costs out at store level and being more productive with technology and
other things, we also must do that in the home oﬃce, which will increase our speed.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 17So there's a bigger change that is really in its very early stages. We've been this past
year as a leadership team reading about design thinking and talking with each other
about what it means to be a digital enterprise and having guest speakers come in
from digitally native companies to talk to us about it and I'm really excited about it.
I've been around Walmart for a long time. I got to see Sam Walton work a little bit
and all the leaders from Sam to today and we like change and there are so many
things you can do right now to improve this business that one of my biggest
challenges is not ﬂooding the engine with ideas. We've got to also be able to
execute. But it's really been an exciting time to be part of our business and I think
our team is starting to feel the same way.
As it relates to the next one of delivering results and operating with discipline, Brett
talked about this ﬁnancial framework when some of you were in Northwest Arkansas
in October. Strong eﬃcient growth. We don't want to waste anything, whether it's
expenses or capital. We want to deliver growth that delivers a return.
Our time horizon and yours don't always match up. But we have the same objective.
Strategic capital allocation. I think in Walmart you run this risk that because you have
so many resources and cash ﬂow, you feel like sometimes you can do everything. But
you can't and I think we've been more deliberate and more choiceful recently as it
relates to where we are putting capital. You can see it in the reduction in the number
of US supercenters that we are opening for example.
Then on the operating discipline side, managing all the costs as I was speaking
about earlier. Comp sales are increasing in importance within the Company. We want
to get our growth from comp store sales growth and e-commerce growth and as you
well know, comp store sales growth has a really attractive return.
So investing in price for comp stores, investing in remodels, those things are
deliberate to over time lift the comp store sales number. We are experimenting with
diﬀerent types of stores, diﬀerent formats of Supercenters. And by the way, we like
the Supercenter format, particularly in this country. It's a very eﬀective vehicle and we
believe will drive traﬃc over time if run well.
A couple of stores we've open recently in the Orlando area, Lake Nona, Florida and
in the Houston market, Tomball, Texas or the Woodlands area represents some of
our latest thinking in terms of Supercenters and if you are in those markets, go check
them out. That will give you some idea of where we might allocate some of our
remodel dollars going forward.
We are focused on working capital. I think the inventory and payables performance
you've seen recently is vital to us being able to generate the money that we need to
invest and really pleased with the job that Greg Foran and the Walmart US team have
done in particular as it relates to that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 17Robby OhmesSo going forward, this is the framework that we will be using as we talk to you and
we think about how we run the business.
Being the most trusted retailer is the next one. We do believe we are in an era of
increased transparency and trust is really important and with all the things that we
do, we want to earn trust.
A few years ago now -- I guess it's been about 10 years ago -- we started on a
sustainability journey; we started working on energy and eliminating waste in
diﬀerent ways and we've made progress. We recently announced that we had
achieved a goal of eliminating 35 million metric tons of greenhouse gases as
reported through our supply chain.
In 2011, we set a goal of sourcing $20 billion from women-owned businesses and just
recently announced that we have a US manufacturing program that we started in
2013 where we said we want to go out and ﬁnd an additional $250 billion in US
manufactured goods. We put a team together. We are bringing states together with
manufacturers and investors and parts suppliers to help deliver against that goal and
we are on track as it relates to that.
We are hiring US veterans. We've hired 169,000 since 2013 and we've promoted
20,000 of them. In October, we announced a new set of targets around greenhouse
gases and science-based targets and continuing to try and lead in that area and it's
good business. It helps us reduce costs. It helps us be more eﬃcient. It helps as it
relates to people understanding the Company better, demonstrates a heart and
again, we've become convinced you can do multiple things at a time, serving
multiple shareholders and actually create a higher quality and stronger business.
And it's one of the reasons why I like working at the Company and why I think we've
been able to attract and retain great talent.
So in summary, our plan to win is getting clearer. Our team is becoming more
conﬁdent in it. This last year, we generated over $31 billion in operating cash ﬂow. So
we have resources to invest. But we have to be choiceful to get positioned for the
future. We are moving faster. We are trying to do a good job of balancing the short
term with the long term. And what I would like to have this leadership team
accomplish is that when we are a few years ahead here, we've been through these
changes, we've positioned the Company to win for a long, long time, culturally and
in terms of positioning and what we've done with technology.
It's fun. It's challenging. The world is changing quite a bit. But it creates great
opportunities.
Thanks, Doug. I'm going to kick it oﬀ with the questions. You are going to get I think
a lot of questions on the e-commerce side. But 2016 was actually a really good year
for the US Supercenters. You guys had positive comps. You had a great FourthFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 17Doug McMillon
Robby Ohmes
Doug McMillonQuarter, particularly relative to the rest of retail and your traﬃc comp was really
standout.
The question I get a lot. So as we are moving into 2017, you begin to anniversary a
successful year. What would you say to someone that says, hey, you are up against
tough comparisons there, you increased wages, gas prices were in your favor? How
do you guys keep that core US momentum going?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
What goes through my mind ﬁrst is that we are controlling the things we can control
better. The job that Greg Foran and the US leadership team are doing to create a
better experience for customers is real and I get into a lot of stores and almost all the
time unannounced. The store standards are higher. The in-stock is better. Inventory is
way down. The comp store inventory being down 6% or 7% is a big deal. If you work
in a store and you can ﬁnd merchandise in the back room and you are not moving
things twice, it just creates this positive morale and feeling in the store that you can
do what you need to do.
Then they layered on training and technology. We went from these old handhelds
we've been using forever to tablets and store managers today can run their store to
some extent on apps and it feels more like a contemporary experience.
We can't control fuel prices. We can't control some other things that are in our
environment. But from what we can see, if we just continue to make improvements
like the ones I just described, layer on an intelligent price investment to help move
the productivity loop, customers are going to ﬁnd faster checkouts, technology to
help them check out, improved in-stock. Steve and the team are working hard on
new items and being exciting.
What I'm conﬁdent about is that, as a team, we can keep making these Supercenters
better as the weeks and the months go on and then the external environment will be
what it will be. But we should outperform as it relates to competition. And as long as
we don't get too shortsighted and try to manage the short term too much, we are
going to keep seeing that improvement.
Then the way that Greg and Mark are working together as we build the e-commerce
business to ﬁnd ways to save customers time and have experiences that you can only
create by having an e-commerce business and a stores business, all the better.
Another question I get all the time or more recently, Lidl is coming. How would you
tell us to think about the deep discounter threat?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 17Robby Ohmes
Doug McMillon
Robby Ohmes
Doug McMillonYes. We've had Aldi here for a long time, as you know. So we are familiar and then in
the UK, we've been through the Lidl and Aldi growth over the past few years and
that certainly focuses you.
As it relates to what we oﬀer, I think it starts with assortment. We've got to make sure
that the quality of our merchandise, not just the price, is right. So that takes a little bit
of time and we've been working on that for some time.
Sizing of a product so that it's easy for a customer to compare one item against
another, which is harder with private brand than brand or oﬀbrand than brand, ﬁrst-
tier brands like we sell. So product engineering comes to mind ﬁrst. Price comes to
mind second and we have been, as you know, making some price investments.
Then in the Supercenter, what we can't do is have too much friction. Part of a small
stores beneﬁt is getting in and out. We certainly see that with neighborhood
markets. So ﬁnding ways to innovate for speed so you can ﬁnd an item and get out
of a store quickly is also a really important part of the oﬀer. So we are going to try to
take away advantages the discounters have and then play to our strengths.
I know a lot of people are going to ask if I don't ask it. Can you just talk a little bit
about the outlook for food inﬂation and deﬂation and how you are thinking about
your grocery business for 2017?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Sure. Deﬂation has been an issue. We think it will moderate some this year. But we
still expect when the year is over, all in, there will be some deﬂation. We don't worry
about that too much. We are tracking units and tonnage. We want to see the trips
continue to increase in the Supercenters and in the neighborhood markets. So
managing all the things I've already spoken about, including price, come to mind.
Again, we try not to get too distracted by things we can't control -- currency, inﬂation,
fuel prices. Be aware of them. Understand their impact on the business. But nail what
you can.
So on e-commerce, you mentioned a few of the acquisitions you've made. Can you
give us a little more color on how you are thinking about the potential for future
acquisitions in the e-commerce business?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes, sure. It's not very complicated. Customers want a great assortment, great prices
and service and we haven't been delivering for a number of years on those things asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 17Robby Ohmes
Doug McMillonwell as we have to. So assortment is driving a lot of these acquisitions.
We can pick up some of these companies that are great in terms of the assortment
and the service they provide. But they don't have enough money to lose to go
market their brand and scale it and in e-commerce, scale is obviously very
signiﬁcant. So by joining Walmart, they get some beneﬁt as it relates to the halo of
marketing. They can sell through the brand that they've established. They can take
their assortment and make it available to customers through Walmart or Jet and we
can scale faster and we get some synergies as a result of that. So the acquisitions are
largely being driven by assortment.
And in grocery, how important is -- how do you think about pickup versus delivery
over time?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
It's cool. Customers love pickup. Our customer satisfaction scores related to online
grocery and the pickup experience are amongst the highest that I've ever seen and
they've been that way really for quite a while now.
I was in this Orlando location I was mentioning earlier last week and given the time
that we've had to plan now, the physical store is improving as it relates to pickup. We
are learning how to manage the outside experience so it's faster. We are learning
how to build a backroom so inventory can be moved from in-store pickup to exterior
pickup quickly and easily.
The systems are getting better. On-hand accuracy is getting better. We are starting to
learn how to put refrigeration close to the pickup area that our associates can use so
that it's fast. And ultimately, we want to make that a great experience and when
people come into the store through the portfolio, Walmart will make money. But if
the customers don't want to pick it up, we still want to be able to deliver.
What we've learned from the UK where we've been doing grocery delivery for a long
time, well over 15 years now, with our own trucks, our own drivers, a really good
experience, is that we are still doing well, over 90% of our volume in store.
So there's a role for delivery. There's a role for pickup. And by the way, the on-hand
inventory management for pickup is the same as it would be for delivery. You just
have to sort out last mile, whether you want to do it or have somebody else do it. So
the capabilities are being built within the Company.
Then she will decide. The customer will decide on that moment what she wants.
There will be times when she wants to come into the store. There will be times when
she wants to pick up and increasingly you can order it on a mobile device orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14

Robby Ohmeswhatever technology you want to use and it will be faster and then if you want to
have it delivered, you can have it delivered.
And humans won't have to decide a week ahead or two days ahead on something;
you can decide faster how you want to shop. The delivery times are becoming
shorter. So we want customers experiencing our brand, Walmart. And as long as you
are in the Walmart ecosystem, whether it's delivery, pickup or in-store, we will be
there to serve you.
And the economics of those choices, do they become very similar over time or --?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. As you scale pickup, the economics become favorable. But you've got to get the
orders up to a certain number and what we've learned is that not every store needs
to pick. It actually does make sense in some cases to have a hub picking and
delivering to other stores and to the home. So it's just math. It's capability and math
and we are ﬁguring out where to do it and where not to do it.
How should we ultimately think of walmart.com versus jet.com and do these come
together over time or how should we be thinking about (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
They are coming together behind the scenes now. But on the front end, we want to
keep them separate. Jet attracts a slightly more aﬄuent, more urban and younger
customer than the Walmart brand. The Walmart brand, when you think of the
Walmart brand, just think of the US demographic. There's so many transactions there
and it's largely true for walmart.com, as well as stores.
When you think of Jet, just shift that demographic a little more towards urban, more
aﬄuent, younger clique. But there are some suppliers that don't want to sell on
Walmart that will sell on Jet. Mark's got some ideas, which I'm excited about, on what
Jet might be in the future and it will be diﬀerent than Walmart.
Recently, we decided to do shipping without charging for it for two days, which is
diﬀerent than a membership model. So having multiple brands gives us the
opportunity to make diﬀerent choices with those brands based on our best ideas
and what customers want.
Let me just stop there and give a chance for some in the audience to ask a question.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantQuestions And Answers
Could you talk a little bit about the marketplace side of the Jet and walmart.com
business to the extent that there's 3P. What is the strategy; how are you thinking
about referral pricing; how are you thinking about ultimately fulﬁllment for the 3P
part of the business just overall? Thank you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes, building a 3P capability is obviously really important because of the breadth of
assortment and we don't want to own all the inventory and many of you that have
been following us know that, for a while, we were telling you we have foundational
things to take care of. We need a new operating system and we've got to get these
fulﬁllment centers built.
I got tired of saying that and I think I went around saying that for about a year or two.
And those things ﬁnally got taken care of and then along comes Jet and we see this
opportunity to drive up units per basket and really step on the gas here.
And so as it relates to 3P, once we got that operating system and fulﬁllment center
foundation in place, we could really scale it. So it came later than we wanted. But if
you look back almost 12 months ago now, we started really seeing the item count
and the sellers go up and we started gaining traction and it drove growth each
quarter as we went through last year.
We will continue to build a 3P business and we don't currently have plans to do fulﬁll
by Walmart. But we wouldn't rule it out. Ultimately, we believe that managing ﬁrst-
party inventory is a core competence that we should take advantage of. And so tying
up fulﬁllment space for others may not be in our best interest because we may want
to own the inventory.
When you own the inventory, you control the customer experience more eﬀectively.
It feels to me like that this rapid expansion of enormous assortment is going to play
out. There are only so many items in the world and then we will move into a period
of time in coming years that's more about optimization; and that mathematical
optimization may cause us to want to -- I'm just thinking of the US here in particular --
may cause us to want to have more ﬁrst-party items than we might have imagined a
year or two ago.
So it's a ﬂuid situation. We are seeing the math every day every week and we will
make decisions as we go along. But it's important. We need to have third-party. But
ﬁrst-party is hard and that creates opportunity for those that can do it well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 12 of 17A - Doug McMillonJust a follow-on to that. While you don't disclose your total GMV, you do disclose
GMV growth. It seems to us that the size of your GMV positions you right now,
including your 1P, as the third-largest GMV overall retailer in the developed markets,
or at least in the United States. Can you just comment on that a little bit?
Then also on the 3P side, can you just comment on referral pricing? It looks like you
are 15% across the board where some other marketplaces may be on certain items --
except in electronics, which you are (11.7%) -- other marketplaces may be little bit
more competitive. Just how you think about competitive pricing in 3P. Thank you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes, yes, I don't want to get into too much detail on third-party pricing. But we will do
over time what we need to do to be competitive because we've got to grow that
assortment.
As it relates to our position in this market and in others, we just have a great
opportunity. This e-commerce business is not magical. You can build it and I think,
today, we understand a lot more than we did in the past about how to do it and
really excited about the talent that we have in the Company helping us ﬁgure that
out. So I think we've got a great opportunity.
The question that I think is on all of our minds is how fast can you scale it and what
does that mean to proﬁtability over time. And if we look back at the past, I think
most, if not all of us would say we put too much pressure on short-term proﬁtability
and didn't really drive the J-curve like we should have.
And as I look back, Brett, just at the last few years, we made some choices and I
regard them as being truly strategic. They were intentional, we thought about it and
as a team, management and the Board, we decided that the Supercenters are
running really well. We have cash ﬂow and time.
So phase one was go make the Supercenters strong, particularly in the US. So how
do you do that? Well number one, this is a people business and your people have
got to be with you. They've got to know their jobs. They've got to be excited about
their opportunities. They've got to have the resources they need, including
technology to be successful. Go do that. That took a little bit of time and took some
money and so all of you, or a lot of you came back and said too much money, not
enough return, it's tough. And we said, yes, it is. But we are not running this business
for one quarter. So we are going to go do that and I am really pleased with how all
that is coming together. We've got to manage it every day. There's a lot to do. But
I'm pleased with that.
Then we came back to you, particularly in October. And we said now that we are
operating from more of a position of strength there, we see the opportunity to step
on the gas as it relates to e-commerce. We have the people, we have the plan, we
now have the fulﬁllment centers, we now have the operating system, we are going to
bend that curve a bit more.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14

A - Doug McMillonThis is a ﬂuid environment. Competition is not sitting still. Customers are changing.
It's faster cycle time than I can ever remember in my history and I think it's only
going to get faster. So we are going to be really thoughtful about what we commit to
you and say to you and try to leave ourselves enough room to make the decisions
that we need to make to ensure that Walmart wins.
And part of winning is generating a return. But that return doesn't have to be
delivered in one quarter. It's got to be delivered over time and I'm not trying to say
just hang with us and in a decade, we will make money. I'm not saying that. I'm
saying that as you hold us accountable, you'll see progress. But we are not going to
be shortsighted. We are going to do what we need to do to build the capabilities to
when.
So those things were on purpose and again, I think in summary to your question, we
have a great e-commerce opportunity. We have a great e-commerce opportunity as
it relates to food and nonfood. We have a great opportunity in this country and in the
other countries where we operate. We have learned a lot.
I just wanted to follow up. So ﬁrst, get the house in order was the communication
and now you are saying we can go a little bit faster with online. I also want to
understand the other half of that of what was going to happen in the stores was
price investments will be made. If we get the prices right, we are going to win versus
-- I think the theory behind it was we can get right and win versus Aldi and Lidl over
time.
At this stage, we've made some cost reductions in the store to try to drive some fuel
to make those price investments. But the price investments continue. So how are we
funding lower prices for Pop Tarts, Tide, Chunky Soup, very speciﬁc, lots of items are
clearly lower price? Are we asking vendors to lower prices as we see in the media a
little bit? Are we able to get money out of them by charging them for late deliveries
or not full delivery or being in the -- what's happening, or are we looking at just
gross margins under pressure?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. We had some pretty big opportunities with private brand and with sourcing. So
we've resourced private brand. We have more talent there than we've ever had
before. On the ﬂoor of our store managers meeting last week in Orlando, for the ﬁrst
time I can remember, they wore lab coats. Some scientists and suppliers and some
of our own merchants that were showing how we had built some of these private
brand products and we wanted our store managers to see quality.
We had examples from food. We had examples from footwear and apparel so that
our own team would know we are really investing and ensuring that our
speciﬁcations here are strong. So that opportunity is still in front of us. We've started
to see some momentum in private brand and we will still sell brands for less. But for
the space we allocate to private brands, they've got to be great. And we have someFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantreally big private brands and some that have a great reputation. But we have a lot of
upside there too.
We had some opportunities as it relates to sourcing. We've reengineered our
sourcing team. David Cheesewright has been leading that. We are making some
progress there.
As it relates to supplier funding, we had drifted away from a more pure EDLP model
and you guys probably look at it and say, well, no, you really didn't drift away. But
through our lens we did some. We were running too many print ads. We went
through a year of comp store pain. My ﬁrst year in this role where we told you we
were cutting our tabs back and we cut them back from I think it was over 100 to 12 or
13 or something like that. The suppliers were funding some of that.
So there were dollars in that ﬁrst year that had been going towards advertising that
we told the suppliers we no longer want for advertising. We'd like to talk to you
about an oﬀ-invoice price, working through that math together to ﬁgure out how to
get the price into the invoice lowers the cost and we get back to a more pure EDLP
model, which helps us get the store inventory down because when you advertise
something, you've got to ship in a feature because you promised customers you are
going to be in stock. When you stop advertising it, you stop sending the extra
inventory in, it helps reduce labor, it helps reduce markdowns. So some of the
funding that we will experience and are experiencing just comes through
operational eﬃciency by getting back to the model that we had always built and it
works for the stores.
Dynamic pricing and e-commerce are a diﬀerent thing to ﬁgure out and how we put
it altogether is other work to make sure that all of this ultimately builds trust with the
customer and through inventory ﬂow, builds a lower cost operating model. So we
are creating oxygen from a number of diﬀerent places and we are not hitting 100%
max on our ability to do that.
Just to follow on to the private label comment you made, Walmart has always been a
house of brands. So I know Walmart is cheap because Tide at Kroger is X and at
Walmart it's X minus 10% or whatever.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Right.
Why then is private brands a focus? So maybe you can wrap that into -- I think the
Lidl model has a lot more private brands in it, they are showing a price that's 20%,
30% less in some cases than a branded product. So should we think that private
brand has become a much bigger part of the assortment at Walmart over time?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14

Yes. It should and things have changed. Let me try to explain this in a way that's brief.
Let's take Tide. If Tide is available on the Internet and you can see pure e-commerce
sellers, store retailers, all of the above and we are all selling the same size Tide, that
margin over time is going to be compressed.
So having a private brand from a margin mix has always been important -- margin
mix point of view -- has always been important. But it's even more important now
and the sourcing capability is even more important now.
Then layer on that loyalty. If you can get Tide anywhere. But you can't get Sam's
Clubs' Members Mark or Equate or Great Value anywhere and we have engineered
the specs such that you just really love our granola, then there's a loyalty there that
passes not just through the store. But through into the e-commerce business as well.
So product-driven royalty becomes even more important going forward than it was
in the past. That doesn't mean we want you to walk into a Walmart store and if we've
got an 8-foot section of something, we don't want you to see 4 foot of private brand.
But for the space that we do allocate to private brand and we don't have a target set
by category to say each category has got to be X % of a private brand, we are letting
the product itself and the customer pull that through.
As we do it for whatever space we do allocate, it needs to be great. And we had to
get out of this binary are you private brand all in or not into let's be more speciﬁc.
Can we be great at selling brands for less and resource private brand so that when
we do sell a private brand, it's great? Yes. We can do both at the same time and
that's what we are doing.
Amazon has shown the ability to create ancillary proﬁt streams through recent 10-K
advertising, obviously, the cloud, credit. It's allowed them to subsidize in eﬀect retail
pricing. How do you think about ancillary revenue streams or proﬁt streams to
continue to support your pricing?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. Within the Company, the language that we use is where to play and how to win
and the management team and the Board regularly are thinking about the where to
play side of that equation. Where are we in; where are we out? Which geographies
are we in on? Which categories are we in on? Which formats are we in on and are
there other things we need to do that will help generate proﬁtability if we are in a
situation where retail margins are suppressed because someone has a diﬀerent
model? All of those things are being actively discussed.
We need to be really thoughtful about that and not try to do things that are not in
our DNA and are too far from the core of what we do. But there are things that are
closer to the core of what we do. Financial services would be one. Health andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-14

be more aggressive and resource in a diﬀerent way to capture those opportunities.
So it could be in the future that you see us be more deliberate about creating
additional proﬁt pools. That's certainly on the agenda and we are thinking about lots
of things, many of which you can probably guess. But we will be really thoughtful
and deliberate about those kinds of choices, including managing our existing
portfolio.
Just had one unrelated question. But a follow-up to the other person's question. So
if you look at the margin structure of your Company or other large mass retailers and
your suppliers in the last 10 to 15 years, there's been a huge divergence in terms of
margins. One is going up; the other is going down. How do you think about that
longer term and is that right? Does that need to be corrected or is that just the state
of the world?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
That's hard to predict. I think we have to -- ﬁrst of all, as we've looked at the years
that are closest to us here, we've already said some things about how we feel about
our operating margins from where it's going to come from. Longer term it's really
harder to call. I do believe that technology and the Internet will make the world more
eﬃcient period and that some of these ecosystem or where-to-play questions that
you raised earlier will factor into the longer-term future of business, not just retail.
But business in general.
What's going on in the supplier community -- let's just say it this way. I hope that
folks continue to invest in R&D and innovation and our supplier community doesn't
become too short-term focused either. We need them to think longer term and to
create exciting new products to drive demand. So as we are talking to suppliers and
I talked to leaders from suppliers, I'm encouraging them to make sure they've got
the right short and long-term balance.
And with that, we unfortunately have run out of time. I want to thank Doug and
Walmart for coming to the conference.
