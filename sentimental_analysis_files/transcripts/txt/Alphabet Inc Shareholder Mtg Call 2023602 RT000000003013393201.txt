Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining Alphabet's 2023 Annual Stockholders'
Meeting. I'm John Hennessy, and I have the privilege of serving as Chair of the
Board of Directors of Alphabet, and I'll be presiding over today's meeting.
Joining us today are members of Alphabet's Board of Directors. We also have
members of the management team participating. I'll open with a few words, and
then I'll turn it over to Sundar, who will talk about how our work to make AI more
helpful for everyone is the most signiﬁcant way we can make progress on our
mission. We'll then hear from Eli Collins, Vice President of Product at Google
DeepMind. He'll share more on our approach to AI responsibility and principles.
Then Kathryn Hall, our Vice President of Corporate, Legal, and Assistant Corporate
Secretary, will go through the formal business of the meeting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 2 of 37Finally, we'll have a Q&A session where we will answer a number of stockholder
questions that have been submitted online. We will focus on addressing the topics of
most interest to stockholders. You can see all the rules and procedures for this
meeting posted on the Virtual Annual Meeting platform.
In recent years, there has been no shortage of challenges to occupy the world's
attention, from the global pandemic, supply chain disruptions and the war in Europe,
which have shown us the power of human resilience and the importance of
innovation. Against this backdrop, Alphabet continues to deliver helpful services, like
Google Search and Google Cloud for people and for our partners around the world,
while also investing in technologies that are foundational to the future. This remains
our focus and responsibility today and in the coming years. For seven years now,
Alphabet has led the way in advancing the ﬁeld of AI.
Our AI-ﬁrst strategy aims to ﬁnd technology breakthroughs that will deliver
signiﬁcant beneﬁts for society. That vision has motivated years of research and
product work as well as investments in the best technical talent. This was reﬂected a
few weeks ago at the annual developer event, Google I/O, where the company
showcased the many ways that Google is making AI even more helpful for people,
for businesses, and for communities. It was an impressive display, and I'm proud to
see how the company is reimagining its core products like Search, Workspace, and
Android. Sundar will talk more about this in just a moment.
Importantly, Alphabet is focused on developing AI responsibly. Alphabet was among
the ﬁrst to develop and adopt AI principles and to implement an AI governance
structure, which is important for the long-term development of this technology. As
this work continues, the company is also committed to investing responsibly for
long-term growth and to ﬁnding areas where it can operate more cost-eﬀectively.
Beyond AI over the past year, our Board has redoubled its eﬀorts to engage on the
issues most important to our company. Environmental, social, and governance topics
have been front and center in many of those conversations. In my role as Chair of the
Alphabet Board, I've worked closely with our Legal and Investor Relations teams to
understand and respond to investor perspectives on these matters.
Our Board is pleased to see Alphabet increase transparency in some key areas.
These include our recently completed Civil Rights audit and our disclosure of water
metrics for Google-owned data centers. Our senior management team oversees this
work and provides regular updates to our Board, and we actively prioritize our
oversight duties and frequently engage with leaders at the company on important
matters like these. A company building products for billions of people around the
world beneﬁts from a workforce with a diversity of skills, backgrounds, and cultural
experiences.
Our Board is no diﬀerent. I'm proud of the diversity of backgrounds represented on
our Board, including those our most recently appointed directors. Nearly 2/3 of our
directors identify as female or from an underrepresented community. Our robust
director selection process most recently led to the appointment of Marty Chavez in
July. Marty brings years of deep experience from the worlds of ﬁnance andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Robin Washington as Board members appointed in just the past ﬁve years.
Looking ahead, it's an exciting time for technology, full of opportunity for our
company and the broader industry. Alphabet remains among the top R&D investors
in the world, and these investments have yielded glimpses of the future from our
work in quantum computing to our many AI-supported breakthroughs. The
importance of technology companies to society has never been more profound, and
our Board is proud of the meaningful contributions by our company, especially
during challenging times.
Since Alphabet's founding, we have been committed to being helpful to people
around the world through products that support a better future and by earning our
users' trust every day. For our Board, overseeing that mission is why we exist, and
we're deeply grateful that our stockholders helped make that possible.
With that, I'll turn it over to Sundar.
{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
Thanks, John. Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It's been an eventful 12
months since our last annual meeting. The macroeconomic climate became more
challenging, while AI progress and acceptance has accelerated. In particular,
generative AI has captured the imagination of people around the world. It's an
exciting inﬂection point.
Looking back at the deﬁning AI breakthroughs over the last decade, our world-class
research teams have contributed to a signiﬁcant number of them, including
AlphaGo, Transformers, sequence-to-sequence models, and more. It's a particularly
exciting moment for us because of how it relates to our mission. We are fortunate to
have a timeless mission to organize the world's information and make it universally
accessible and useful, and it grows more relevant with each passing year.
Making AI more helpful for everyone is the most signiﬁcant way we can make
progress on our mission. As we outlined at Google I/O last month, we are doing this
in four ways: Improving knowledge and learning, boosting creativity and
productivity, enabling others to innovate with AI, and building and deploying AI
responsibly. First, we are using AI to improve knowledge and learning and deepen
people's understanding of the world. The biggest way we do this is through our
founding product, Search.
The opportunity to make search better was the reason we started investing so
deeply in AI to begin with. With each breakthrough, we have made it more helpful
and intuitive, from improvements in language understanding to computer vision and
multi-modality. Today, even if you don't have the words to describe what you're
looking for, you can search anything you see with Google Lens. In fact, Lens is used
for over 12 billion visual searches every single month. Advances in large languageFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 37models allow us to better connect people to the richness of the web and help them
more easily ﬁnd and understand what they are looking for.
In Search, this means unlocking entirely new types of questions that people never
thought Search could answer. As we take the early steps to incorporate our latest
large language model capabilities in Search, we are also keeping information quality
and user trust as a North Star. That's why last week, we launched our new search-
generative experience in Search Labs ﬁrst. We'll get feedback and continue to
improve the experience. Videos are also an increasingly important source of
knowledge and learning, making YouTube even more central to delivering on our
mission.
Google's AI will unlock a new era of creativity for creators and help them expand
their audience and build their businesses. At the same time, viewers are increasingly
watching YouTube on the largest screen in their house, the television. According to
Nielsen, YouTube is the leader in streaming watch time on TVs in the U.S.. And we
are seeing momentum across the twin engines of our ads and subscriptions
businesses. Revenues across all YouTube products were nearly $40 billion over the
past 12 months. The same capabilities that are transforming how people access
knowledge can also help them express themselves more creatively across our
products.
Bard, our Experiment and Conversational AI, continues to improve rapidly with more
visual responses, coding upgrades, and new languages. It also has the ability to
interact with other Google products with third-party partners coming soon. Bard is
now available in 180 countries and territories with more coming soon.
AI can also help people work more productively. Our latest tools for Google
Workspace will help people create and reﬁne emails and documents and easily
generate images from text descriptions in slides and meet. Our computing platforms
are central to how we support both creativity and productivity. They are with users
throughout their day and helpful in the moment.
On Android, we are bringing new advances to make devices more personal,
including Magic Compose for messages and Generative AI wallpapers. We are also
driving progress across the ecosystem, helping devices work better together. For
example, we've invested to improve app experiences on large screen devices like
tablets and foldables. And speaking of foldables, we were proud to introduce new
Pixel devices, including the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet, as well as the much
anticipated Pixel 7a.
Alongside our own products, we are enabling developers, businesses, and
communities to build their own transformative products and services using AI. AI is a
platform shift that creates opportunity for every organization, so we are focused on
making it easy and scalable for others to innovate. Google Cloud is providing access
to our computing infrastructure and foundation models, and the tooling for
companies to train and run their own models. One example is Generative AI supportFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 37in Vertex AI. Developers can now easily use, customize, and deploy foundation
models to production, opening up a new era of useful applications. Finally, we are
building and deploying AI responsibly so everyone can beneﬁt. Our AI principles,
launched in 2018, continue to guide our overall approach. As the technology
evolves, so does our work.
Last month, we announced we will provide ways to identify when we have used AI to
generate content in our services. And we are engaging deeply in responsible AI
regulation between governments, industry experts, publishers, academia, and civil
society. In the last few weeks, I was both in Washington DC and Europe to talk to
leaders and policymakers about how we can build AI responsibly together with
frameworks that are robust and pro-innovation.
To make the most of the AI opportunities ahead, we are sharpening our focus as a
business. Including the formation of a new unit called Google DeepMind that brings
together two of our world-class research teams. Backed by the computational
resources of Google, this unit will help us accelerate our progress in AI, ensuring we
can build more capable systems safely and responsibly. The teams at Google
DeepMind are working on Gemini, a new foundation model built to be multimodal
from the ground up. While still in training, it's already showing multimodal
capabilities not seen in prior models. We are excited to see the capabilities this
model will bring to Google products and experiences and what developers will do
with it once it becomes more widely available.
More broadly, we are committed to investing responsibly with great discipline into
ﬁnding areas where we can operate more cost-eﬀectively. Looking across Alphabet,
we are investing where we see potential for long-term growth as emerging
technologies begin to transform what's possible in many diﬀerent sectors. This year,
Waymo began testing in fully autonomous mode in its third major city, Los Angeles.
And last week, we announced that Waymo vehicles would be available on the Uber
app, starting in Phoenix, beginning later this year. At over 180 square miles, Waymo's
Phoenix operations are currently the largest fully autonomous service area in the
world. Wing, our drone delivery service, recently celebrated more than 300,000
commercial deliveries. In the last year, Wing expanded to serve the Dallas/Fort
Worth metro area, began operating in new parts of Australia with DoorDash, and
launched a new trial in Ireland.
In closing, the shift to AI is as profound as any technology shift we have experienced
before. As an AI-ﬁrst company, we are approaching this with a sense of excitement
and a deep commitment to get it right. As we have said, that's the race that matters
most and where we are focused. We are in the early days and the best is still ahead.
Thanks for being with us on this journey and for joining us today.
I'm going to turn it over now to Eli Collins, our VP of Product at Google DeepMind,
who's going to go a bit deeper on AI responsibility.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 37Eli Collins
Thanks, Sundar. Hi, I'm Eli Collins, VP of Product for Google DeepMind. As Sundar
shared, our vision is to develop AI in a bold and responsible way. So let me give you
a sense of what this looks like at Google.
First, we're harnessing AI to solve the biggest challenges facing communities around
the world. This is everything from developing technology that can one day cure
diseases to predicting natural disasters. For example, during a natural disaster, we
know that timely information can play a critical role in saving lives that's why Google
Research has built a ﬂood forecasting system based on machine learning, and we
recently expanded this to over 80 countries worldwide. We also now provide ﬂood
forecasting up to seven days in advance, giving communities vital time to prepare.
Another example from the cutting edge of science is Google DeepMind's work on
AlphaFold. AlphaFold is our AI system that has solved a decades-long scientiﬁc
challenge to understand the structure of proteins, the building blocks of life. Last
year, AlphaFold was able to uncover the structure of more than 200 million proteins,
essentially all the proteins known to science. We open-sourced AlphaFold's code
and published two in-depth papers in Nature. More than a 1 million researchers have
now used AlphaFold's data, and over the coming years, we could see AlphaFold
help with creating new drugs that can cure diseases.
We're also using AI to make technology accessible to more people. For example,
with Live Caption, you can get real-time text captions for audio on Android, Chrome
or Google Meet, allowing everyone to follow along. These are just some of the ways
we're using AI to help address societal challenges.
Now, developing AI responsibly also means building with safety and responsibility in
mind from the start. That's because our AI principles aren't just words on a page. We
really think deeply about how to live up to these commitments at every step of
product development. Sometimes, that means knowing where to draw the line. So
we were the ﬁrst major company to decide not to make a general purpose face
recognition API commercially available. Then sometimes, there's a balance we need
to navigate between what's helpful and what could be misused.
So let's take our new universal translator. This is an experimental AI video dubbing
service that helps experts translate a speaker's voice, while also matching the video
to the speaker's lip movements. You can imagine how this helps break down
language barriers. But bad actors could also misuse this type of technology to
produce deceptive videos. So we've built our service with guardrails to help prevent
misuse, and we're giving access only to authorized partners.
Finally, there are challenges we can tackle head on. We're one of the ﬁrst companies
to launch automated adversarial testing for large language models. We're doing this
for Bard at a scale that's never been done before at Google. It signiﬁcantly improves
the speed, quality, and coverage of testing. We're sharing this through our
Perspective API, which was originally created to help publishers mitigate toxicity, butFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 37Kathryn Hallit's been used to create an industry evaluation standard. And today, all signiﬁcant
large language models, including from OpenAI and Anthropic, use this standard to
evaluate toxicity in their models. And of course, we bring all of the beneﬁts of these
innovations to our billions of users directly through our products.
For example, we know how important it is to see yourself represented in the world
around you. That's why we worked closely with Dr.Ellis Monk to introduce a more
inclusive skin tone scale. We use it today to inform more relevant Google search
results based on skin tone. We also use it to provide more representative
photography through our Pixel camera and Google Photos. We also know how
important it is for people to have safe experiences when interfacing with new AI
experiences, like with Bard.
We leverage the adversarial testing approach, as I talked about, to understand how
well Bard meets goals set by our content policies in areas like hate or harassment.
And we've also built in guardrails, like capping the number of exchanges in a
dialogue and training the model to provide more nuanced answers to try to keep
interactions helpful and on topic. And we're seeing how AI can help fulﬁll our vision
for Google Health to help billions of people be healthier. For example, Med-PaLM 2
is a language model trained by our health research teams to answer questions and
summarize insights from medical texts. This was the ﬁrst to perform at expert level on
U.S. medical licensing exam-style questions.
We're adding multimodal capabilities too to synthesize information like x-rays and
mammograms. We're sharing Med-PaLM 2 with a small group of Google Cloud
customers for feedback soon. So this is just a glimpse of how we're taking a bold
and responsible approach with AI. We're excited to continue developing the
breakthrough AI products that can solve the biggest challenges of our time. There
are so many exciting innovations that we're working on and we can't wait to share
more with you.
I'll now turn it over to Kathryn Hall.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you, Eli. Hello, everyone. I'm Kathryn Hall, Alphabet's Assistant Secretary, and
I'll be conducting the formal business of the meeting.
At this time, I call the meeting to order. Joining us today are Leah Grant, a
representative of Broadridge Financial Services, who will act as our Inspector of
Election; and Matthew Sapp and Priya Chandy, representatives of Ernst & Young LLP,
our Independent Accountants.
The polls are open and will close after the presentation of our formal business
matters. As John noted earlier, after we have ﬁnished the formal business of the
meeting, there will be a question-and-answer session. We received a number of
questions from stockholders before today's meeting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 8 of 37Stockholders may continue to submit questions during the meeting. To do so, please
enter your question in the Ask a Question box on the virtual meeting website.
Stockholder questions or remarks must be relevant to the meeting. Thanks in
advance for your cooperation with all of the rules of procedure posted on the virtual
meeting website.
I've received an aﬃdavit of mailing from Broadridge that states that the notice of this
meeting was duly given. All stockholders of Class A and/or Class B common stock as
of the close of business on April 4, 2023 are entitled to vote at this meeting. In
addition, I've been advised by the Inspector of Election that holders of our
outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, representing at least a majority of
the voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock entitled to
vote are represented at today's meeting. Therefore, a quorum is present, the
meeting is duly constituted, and the business of the meeting may proceed.
The ﬁrst item of business is the election of directors. 11 directors will be elected at
today's meeting. The directors elected today will hold oﬃce until the 2024 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders. Our Board of Directors has nominated the following
individuals: Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai, John L. Hennessy, Frances H.
Arnold, R. Martin Marty Chavez, L. John Doerr, Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., Ann Mather, K.
Ram Shriram, and Robin L. Washington.
Our bylaws require that stockholders provide advanced notice of their intent to
nominate persons as directors. No such notice was received. Accordingly, I declare
the nominations for directors closed.
The next matter being submitted to our stockholders is the ratiﬁcation of the
appointment of Ernst & Young, LLP, as our independent registered public accounting
ﬁrm for the 2023 ﬁscal year. Our Board of Directors has recommended that our
stockholders ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young, LLP, as Alphabet's
independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for the 2023 ﬁscal year.
The next matter being submitted to our stockholders is the approval of an
amendment and restatement of Alphabet's 2021 stock plan to increase the share
reserve by 170 million shares of Class 3 -- Class C capital stock. Our Board of
Directors has recommended that our stockholders approve an amendment and
restatement of Alphabet's 2021 stock plan to increase the share reserve by 170

The next 13 items being submitted are stockholder proposals that were included in
our proxy statement. In addition, we have a stockholder proposal that was not
included in our proxy statement, but we expect will be presented today.
The ﬁrst stockholder proposal is brought by United Church Funds. The proponent
has submitted a prerecorded presentation in support of this proposal. I recognize
Matthew Illian for a period of three minutes to present this proposal.
Good morning. My name is Matthew Illian, Director of Responsible Investing at
United Church Funds, the ﬁler of proposal number six on the Alphabet proxy.
The Board appears to misunderstand the focus of this shareholder resolution. The
proxy statement suggests that Alphabet's lobbying transparency eﬀorts have been
recognized as best-in-class and references the 2022 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate
Political Disclosure and Accountability. We must be clear that the CPA-Zicklin Index is
focused on corporate political spending, which is diﬀerent than lobbying.
Corporate political spending relates to funds that go directly to support state and
federal legislators. While we can all congratulate Alphabet for providing industry-
leading transparency in these payments, the same cannot be said of Alphabet's
lobbying payments, which go to trade associations, social welfare groups, and non-
proﬁt membership groups. When it comes to lobbying, Alphabet is not a leader, but
rather a laggard.
Microsoft, Cisco, Salesforce, PayPal, Comcast, and AT&T, all publish lobbying
payments with speciﬁcity or within bands. Alphabet does neither. Alphabet lists
support of 369 trade associations, social welfare groups, and non-proﬁts for 2022,
yet fails to disclose its payments or the amounts used for lobbying. Alphabet's lack
of disclosure prevents or presents reputational risks when its lobbying contradicts
company public positions or hides payments to social welfare groups.
Alphabet has drawn attention for funding so-called dark money groups to oppose
antitrust regulation. Last year, this proposal received majority support from outside
shareholders. We urge your support of Proposal Number 6. Thank you.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. We and our Board of Directors are
committed to transparency in our public policy and lobbying activities. Our U.S.
public policy transparency website provides robust and detailed disclosures of our
public policy activities and lobbying eﬀorts that already contain much of the
information requested by this proposal, including oversight by our Board ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

activities, details on lobbying expenditures, trade association participation, and other
key elements of our approach to engaging with policymakers.
Given the depth and breadth of our existing disclosures and frequency of our
updates about our public policy and lobbying activities, our Board of Directors
believes that the report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful
additional information to our stockholders and recommends a vote against this
proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by the National Center for Public
Policy Research. The proponent has submitted a prerecorded presentation in
support of the proposal. I recognize Ethan Peck for a period of three minutes to
present this proposal.
Google has a paid partnership with the World Economic Forum, and company
Founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both completed the WEF's Young Global
Leaders program in 2005. By contributing to WEF and sending company Executives
and Directors to its annual conferences, the company is funding and contributing to
its overtly orwellian [ph] agenda. This very public agenda that can be viewed on their
website and heard in their conferences, includes such things as the abolition of
private property, replacing meat-eating with eating bugs, living in pods, banning
reliable energy, the adoption of Chinese-style social credit systems, one global
government that works in tandem with corporations, implanting people with
computer chips, and modifying the human genome. Amongst a host of other
comparably dystopian objectives.
In other words, fellow shareholders, through the company's partnership with and
contribution to the WEF, our assets are being used by corporate and political elites
to fund the eﬀorts for our own enslavement. How is that in our best interest? All this
proposal requests is a report to evaluate the congruency between the Board's legal
obligation to do what's in the best interest of shareholders, and the company's paid
partnership and working relationship with WEF and other similar anti-shareholder
globalist organizations such as the council on Foreign Relations and Business
Roundtable.
In its opposition statement to the proposal, the Board doubled down on these
partnerships, while also admitting that quote, our sponsorship or collaboration with
an organization does not mean that we endorse its entire agenda, its events or
advocacy positions or the views of its leaders or its members, unquote. Well, that's
likely an outright lie, but even if it isn't, though the Board probably doesn't realize it,
that's still a shocking admission, because using our money to fund evil with willful
ignorance, just so that company executives can schmooze and dabble with other
corporate executives on the shareholder dime is not much better than using our
money to fund that same evil with an explicit intent to do so.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 37Kathryn HallThe Board has a legal obligation to serve our interests as shareholders, not their own
personal interests at the expense of shareholders, and that includes vetting how the
money that the company gives away is spent. So the issue is not whether or not
every Board member agrees with every position of every organization that the
company that the company gives to, as the Board leaned on as a defense in its
opposition statement.
Rather, it is whether or not, the WEF's agenda is so beyond the realm of acceptable
that it is clearly not in the best interests of shareholders for the company to
contribute to it in any way ever. Contributing to and partnering with WEF and other
explicitly anti-shareholder organizations, clearly does not serve shareholder interests,
who I can safely assume don't for the most part, regardless of political view, support
the debasement of their own inﬂuence as shareholders within the company and the
abolition of their own private property.
Fellow shareholders, if you don't want your money paying for the Great Reset and
the movement seeking to turn the world further into 1984, then we recommend that
you vote in favor of this proposal.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. We believe it is important to be an active
participant in organizations in order to support issues that are important to our
business and ultimately to our stockholders. And we and our Board of Directors
remain committed to being transparent regarding our participation. Our executives'
participation in discussions facilitated by organizations like the World Economic
Forum enable us to engage on key issues aﬀecting the company.
We regularly update our U.S. Public Policy Transparency website to provide a listing
of politically engaged trade associations, independent organizations, and other tax-
exempt groups that receive the most substantial contributions from us. We respect
the independence and agency of trade associations and third-parties. We prohibit
trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations from using dues or payments
made by us for political expenditures. To ensure that organizations are abiding by
our policy, Google reserves the right to terminate all payments immediately if we
ﬁnd that any portion of our contributions have been used for political expenditures.
Our Board of Directors believes that given our existing transparent policies and
disclosures, the report requested by this proposal would not provide useful
information to our stockholders and recommends a vote against this proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by Boston Trust Walden Company
and Zevin Asset Management as lead ﬁlers, and the Benedictine Sisters of Virginia
and the Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica as co-ﬁlers, along with a number
of other co-ﬁlers.

proposal. I recognize Kristen Lang for a period of three minutes to present thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 12 of 37Kristen Langproposal.
Good morning, members of the Alphabet Board, the management team, and fellow
shareholders. My name is Kristen Lang, and I am the Deputy Director of ESG
Investing at Boston Trust Walden.
At Boston Trust Walden, we seek to invest client assets and enterprises with strong
ﬁnancial underpinnings, sustainable business models, prudent management
practices, and a governance structure that supports these objectives. Our proposal
ﬁled in coordination with Zevin Asset Management, asks Alphabet to issue a report
describing its framework for identifying and addressing misalignments between the
company's direct and indirect lobbying and Alphabet's commitments to mitigate
climate impact and its support of the Paris Climate Agreement.
I am pleased to move this resolution for a vote. Regularly examining the alignment of
direct and indirect lobbying activities with corporate public commitments and
policies is an increasingly important requirement of strong corporate governance.
Instances of lobbying misalignment, in particular, lobbying undertaken by trade
associations, social welfare organizations, and other non-proﬁts to which Alphabet
aﬃliates, may serve to obstruct and/or undermine Alphabet's stated global climate
policies, commitments, public policy advocacy, and investments to mitigate its own
climate risks.
Alphabet's position as a corporate climate leader only underscores the need for
processes and disclosures to identify, address, and remedy instances of
misalignment across its direct and indirect lobbying activity.
Alphabet publicly supports the goals of the Paris Agreement, advocates for speciﬁc
climate-based policies and leads investments in carbon-free energy. These
commitments and investments represent the seriousness with which Alphabet is
approaching climate risk mitigation and the signiﬁcance of the resources the
company is expending.
These actions, however, stand in contrast to the Company's disclosure of continued
ﬁnancial support and aﬃliation with organizations that publicly question accepted
climate science and claim measures to address climate risk will be too costly. For
example, the American Enterprise Institute, which Alphabet lists as an aﬃliate
organization. In its description of its strategy to become carbon-free by 2030,
Alphabet prioritizes work with partners to advocate for smart policy. The company
also describes within the proxy statement its support for public policies that
strengthen global climate action eﬀorts through the Paris Agreement.
These commitments to smart climate policy are undermined by Alphabet's public
support of organizations that actively lobbied against the Paris Agreement, including
Americans for Tax Reform, Taxpayers Protection Alliance, and the Competitive
Enterprise Institute. By strengthening its oversight processes and disclosure withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. Our U.S. Public Policy Transparency website
already includes transparent disclosure on instances where we have engaged in
lobbying activities speciﬁc to climate-related issues. For instance, our most recent
federal lobbying report includes our lobbying eﬀorts with regard to U.S. Federal
Climate and Clean Energy policies.
Google has also long supported international action on climate change and
advocates for strong climate policy outcomes as members of numerous trade
associations and third-party groups. We participate in trade associations to advance
the interests of our company and our stockholders.
As I noted earlier, we respect the independence and agency of trade associations
and third-parties to shape their own policy agendas, events, and advocacy positions.
We assess alignment of our trade association participation with the goals of the Paris
Agreement, and engage within organizations to support advocacy for climate policy
needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees celsius and to create a prosperous and
competitive zero-carbon economy. We are in dialogue with our trade associations to
encourage alignment between our core public policy objectives and their policy
advocacy activities, including on climate change.
Our Board of Directors believes that our existing disclosures on lobbying and
transparent reporting on our climate-related activities, combined with our climate
change strategy that includes participation in climate policy trade associations,
makes the additional reporting requested by this proposal unnecessary and
duplicative, and therefore recommends a vote against this proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by Arjuna Capital on behalf of
Elizabeth Bartle. The proponent has submitted a prerecorded presentation in

{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Natasha Lamb, Managing Partner at Arjuna Capital, and I
move Proposal 9, asking Alphabet to examine the risks associated with how it
handles user data when facing abortion-related law enforcement requests.
Reproductive freedom is under siege in the United States, increasing the risk that
consumer data will be used for the enforcement of state laws that ban or restrict
abortion access. In such cases, law enforcement relies on consumer data toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 14 of 37Kathryn Hallinvestigate and prosecute individuals who provide, aid, or receive an abortion, even
if the procedure was conducted in a state where abortion remains legal.
Notably, Meta-platforms faced signiﬁcant negative backlash when it turned over to
law enforcement Facebook messages of a mother and daughter discussing an
abortion. This action resulted in the two women facing criminal charges. A similar
incident happened at Alphabet several years ago when state law enforcement
prosecuted a woman for a miscarriage after obtaining her Google search
information and found she had Googled abortion medication online. Because
Alphabet amasses large troves of user data, it is vulnerable to increasing law
enforcement requests.
First and foremost, our company should be working to protect users data and
privacy. Following the Dobbs decision last summer, we were encouraged to see
Alphabet announce it would automatically delete sensitive location history, such as
when a user visits an abortion clinic with their phone on their person. Yet, if a user
searches for an abortion clinic through Google Maps, Alphabet does not
automatically delete that location search history. Alphabet has also not committed to
deleting sensitive Google Search history, or other sensitive user information
collected by other Alphabet products that could in turn be accessed by law
enforcement. Protecting users' data from abortion-related law enforcement requests
is essential to uphold user trust, Alphabet's reputation, and consumer loyalty.
To that end, our company should consider additional policies and practices to
enhance encryption and protection of users' data. Increased scrutiny of law
enforcement information requests is also essential before obliging. We urge you to
support Proposal 9 to improve data handling practices so that Alphabet does not
expose users to serious risks stemming from abortion-related criminal prosecutions.
Thank you.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. Protecting users' privacy and securing their
data is core to Google's work. We have policies and procedures for evaluating and
responding to requests for user information, and implement appropriate changes
that address the evolving needs of our users. We also have a long track record of
challenging overly broad or otherwise inappropriate demands. We design products
to help people keep their personal information private, safe, and secure. Late last
year, we announced a number of changes to protect user privacy around health
issues, and we remain committed to these changes.
As the proponent mentioned, location history is oﬀ by default and can only be
turned on if users opt in. We save the mobile device locations of users who opt into
location history, but if our systems identify that they have visited a potentially
sensitive location, including counseling centers, domestic violence shelters, abortion
clinics, fertility centers, addiction treatment facilities, weight loss clinics, and cosmetic
surgery clinics, we delete these entries from location history soon after they visit.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

controls with proactive tools in their Google accounts, including in Google Maps.
Beyond the policies and procedures we have implemented for our own products,
Google has long advocated for limits on government access to user data to support
a consistent and transparent approach across our industry and actively engage with
key stakeholders, including civil liberties, civil rights, and reproductive healthcare
groups.
Given our existing strong privacy protections and open and proactive commitment
to improving these protections when appropriate for our users, especially around
topics such as their health, our Board of Directors does not believe that
implementing this proposal would provide additional beneﬁts to our stockholders
and recommends a vote against this proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by some of us on behalf of Mary
Manel Bell as lead Filer and the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate United
States Province as co-ﬁler, along with a number of other co-ﬁlers. The proponents
have submitted a prerecorded presentation in support of their proposal. I recognize
Ali Abbas Al-Ahmad for a period of three minutes to present this proposal.
Greetings. My name is Ali Al-Ahmad and I am a Saudi Arabian national living in exile
in the United States. I was 14 years old when the Saudi government began its
campaign to silence me from speaking out against its abuses. Put me in prison and
then similarly jailing my brothers years later. My youngest brother, Kamil, has been in
Saudi prison since 2012. He has spent over 20 years in Saudi prisons for his peaceful
activism. I consider myself lucky to have escaped, but thousands of others have not
been so lucky.
The Saudi government has only intensiﬁed its crackdown against dissent, even
inﬁltrating big tech companies in order to obtain user data of people who dare to
speak out against it. I was one of those people who have been inﬁltrated. When the
Saudi government inserted spies at Twitter, many activists were jailed and some of
them, including my friends, Dr.Abdullah Al-Hamid and Abdullah Sareh were either
died in prison or were executed, like in the case of Abdullah Sareh. Given this grim
reality, it is truly shocking that Google plans to build a data center in Saudi Arabia
and in partnership with the Saudi government, Saudi Aramco. Google claims to have
done a human rights assessment for this decision, but refuses to provide
transparency into its ﬁnding and mitigation eﬀorts.
Absence of that, hundreds, if not thousands of activists in the region are now at risk
of Saudi's brutal abuses. And if they were Google Cloud users before, they will soon
be ﬂocking to other services that will not jeopardize their security. I will be one of
those people. We expect Alphabet shareholders to prevent it from violating its
stated commitment to human rights and vote to pass Resolution 10. Thank you so
much for your support.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Thank you presenting this proposal. Google Cloud's goal has always been to bring
our cutting-edge technology to businesses across the globe. We are proud to
currently have 37 cloud regions around the world and have announced plans for 12
more. It is important to note this cloud region in Saudi Arabia will provide storage
and services for Google Cloud customers, which includes businesses, organizations,
and the public sector. It is not a traditional Google data center, which processes
requests for all Google services such as YouTube, Search, et cetera.
As we expand our infrastructure footprint, we are committed to upholding human
rights, which informs our business decisions. We respect the rights enshrined in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its implementing treaties, and have
pledged to uphold the standards established in the United Nations Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights and in the GNI Principles.
In September 2021, we became a signatory to the Trusted Cloud Principles, which
recognized the role of global cloud service providers in upholding international
human rights law. The Trusted Cloud Principles reﬂect our approach to addressing
human rights considerations and establishing cloud regions and data centers in
countries where a government may restrict the rights of users on the Google Cloud.
When deciding where to locate cloud regions and data centers, we consider a
number of important factors, including human rights and security, and how to
optimize our overall data infrastructure so as to provide a high level of performance,
reliability, and sustainability. And we undertake human rights due diligence when
expanding infrastructure operations into new locations. We publish our human rights
approach generally and speciﬁcally with regard with regard to how we consider
human rights in siting these facilities.
In Saudi Arabia, we conducted an independent human rights assessment for the
Google Cloud region. As a result of the human rights assessment process in Saudi
Arabia, we put in place mitigations and guardrails to protect the privacy and security
of our customers and individuals. We also recently issued a blog post that describes
how we are strengthening our programmatic approach to human rights, including
how due diligence informs our planning for expansion of cloud infrastructure.
Under the umbrella of our human rights program, our senior management oversees
the implementation of our human rights work, and responsibility for oversight of
human rights issues is speciﬁcally codiﬁed in the Audit and Compliance Committee's
Charter. Our existing extensive disclosures provide transparency on our approach to
evaluating and managing human rights related risks, including in the context of
siting data centers. Therefore, our Board of Directors believes the additional report
requested by this proposal would not provide additional useful information to our
stockholders and recommends a vote against this proposal.

proposal. I'll advise you when your time is about to expire. Operator, please open
Ms.Couturier-Tanoh's line.
Ms.Couturier-Tanoh, your line is now open.
Good morning. Good afternoon, shareholders of Alphabet. Google Advertising
accounts for approximately 80% of Alphabet's revenue. Despite the importance of
targeted advertising to Google's business model and the well-documented human
rights risk associated with targeted advertising, Alphabet has not conducted a
human rights impact assessment or demonstrated a suﬃciently robust and
transparent equivalent due diligence system to identify, address, and prevent the
adverse human rights impacts of its technologies.
There is increasing concern that algorithms used by modern AI systems produce
discriminatory outputs, presumably because they are trained on data in which
societal biases are embedded. Pernicious errors in targeting can lead to algorithmic
bias in which automated systems create consistently unfair outcomes, such as
privileging one group over another, often aggravating existing inequities.
Although we acknowledge Alphabet's eﬀorts to provide some disclosure on this
issue, it is insuﬃcient to address the concerns shared by the civil society and
Alphabet shareholders, an independent third-party human rights impact assessment
would help inform Alphabet's management, the Board of Directors, and
shareholders about the human rights risks that the company faces in its ads business
and the merits of its human rights approach, including policies and practices.
In addition, such an assessment would help the management and Board manage the
risk associated with failure to respect its human rights, guide management's
approach to protect the human rights of its users, including the steps to remedy any
negative human rights impacts stemming from its technologies.
Mr.Pichai, I ﬁnd it very encouraging that you recognize the importance of developing
AI responsibly. Because of the nature of its business and billions of people using
Google products, your company has an outsized inﬂuence on human rights globally.
I hope that the management and the Board will take shareholders' feedback and
vote on these issues seriously and act on it. I am now moving to Proposal number 11.
Thank you.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. Our existing policies are designed to
safeguard user privacy and safety and work in tandem with our human rights
governance and management structure. For example, our Google Publisher policiesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 18 of 37Jonas Kronrestrict publishers from publishing content that incites hatred or promotes
discrimination of, harasses, or intimidates individuals based on their identities or
beliefs.
These protections shield against harm based on race or ethnic origin, religion,
disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity,
and other characteristics that are associated with systemic discrimination or
marginalization. Google aggressively enforces its policies by taking down bad ads
that promote discrimination against marginalized groups. In March 2023, we
published our 2022 Ad Safety Report, our latest annual report on Google's eﬀorts to
prevent malicious use of our ads platforms.
We collaborate across the digital ads ecosystem to enhance privacy. For example,
Google is working to create solutions that enable advertisers to rely less on third-
party cookies or tracking consumers across the Internet, in order to provide ads that
are relevant to them. Through our participation in the Privacy Sandbox Project, we
have taken a collaborative rather than a unilateral approach to help ideate, design,
develop, and test Privacy Sandbox proposals since the project's inception.
This has driven several improvements in our approach that already address the
primary concerns raised by the proponent by signiﬁcantly reducing risk related to
identifying individual users and/or revealing sensitive demographic characteristics.
For these reasons, our Board of Directors does not believe that implementing the
requests of this proposal would provide additional useful information to
stockholders and therefore recommends against this proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by Trillium Asset Management on

name is Jonas Krohn. I'm Chief Advocacy Oﬃcer at Trillium Asset Management. On
behalf of Trillium and John Hancock ESG Large Cap Core Fund, I hereby move
Proposal Number 12, which focuses on algorithm disclosure.
Speciﬁcally, we are asking Alphabet to go above and beyond its existing disclosures
and provide more quantitative and qualitative information on its algorithmic systems.
This proposal, which received 56% of non-insider votes at the 2022 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders, has not been implemented by the company, and we believe it still
deserves investor support for the following reasons.
According to current and former Alphabet employees and internal documents, The
New York Times reported that the rise of ChatGPT has led Google to take greater
risks with ethical guidelines. It also reports that researchers are alleging that GoogleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 19 of 37Kathryn Hallis, quote, taking risks by releasing technology that even its developers don't entirely
understand. Similarly, a January 2023 report stated that Google now intends to
unveil more than 20 new products and demonstrate a version of its search engine
with chatbot features this year, while at the same time, scaling back its workforce.
In May, the company unveiled some of those features following the layoﬀs of 6% of
its global workforce in January. We also believe that existing disclosures failed to
meet stakeholders' needs. As one prominent commentator pointed out in April, right
now the testing done to make sure large models are safe is voluntary, opaque, and
inconsistent, no best practices have been accepted across the industry, and not
nearly enough work has been done to build testing regimes in which the public can
have conﬁdence. In addition, Alphabet's internal controls were developed at a time
when Section 230 immunity for online platforms was the dominant framework.
However, non 230 protected activities, which artiﬁcial intelligence and other systems
may fall under, may present a new challenge for the company.
Finally, we have seen for years now important voices on these topics within Alphabet
being pushed out, such as Meredith Whittaker, Timnit Gebru, and Meg Mitchell or
leaving to issue warnings about AI, such as Geoﬀrey Hinton. This steady stream of
voices warning about what is happening should raise concerns for investors as
Alphabet's decisions have implications for society, in particular, marginalized
communities, and the economy, and as policymakers are severely challenged to
meet this moment, we believe investors need more and better information. For all of
these reasons, we are urging Alphabet shareholders to vote for this proposal. Thank
you for your time.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. Supporting a trustworthy and transparent
digital ecosystem for our users, advertisers, and publishers is critical to our business.
Our approach to algorithm disclosure requires us to focus on providing an
appropriate level of transparency to mitigate related risks and bolster trust, while
balancing the critical business need to protect our users and their privacy and the
proprietary information that is foundational to our business.
Any consideration of rules around algorithmic transparency must consider the
serious risk that information could be exploited by bad actors, that users' privacy
could be impacted, and that commercially sensitive information could be exposed.
The algorithms that platforms use to manage content are conﬁdential and core to
how they serve and protect users. We believe that algorithmic transparency can be
eﬀective and safe where it is focused on explaining what the algorithm is intended to
do and how it works in general terms. That is why we publish a number of policies
reports that provide meaningful visibility into how those services operate, as well as
provide easy-to-use tools that put users in control, including an overview of how
Search works and how YouTube works, a YouTube Community Guidelines
transparency report, ad safety report, and a number of other reports.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 20 of 37Lauren CompereWe invest signiﬁcant resources in developing and maintaining the industry-leading
quality of the algorithms used by our various services. Multiple academic and
journalistic studies of our services, including Search, Ads, YouTube, and more, have
found that those services deliver high-quality results and do not reﬂect political or
other improper biases. For these reasons, our Board of Directors does not believe
that the disclosure sought by the stockholder proposal on this issue would provide
meaningful information to stockholders and in fact could be harmful. As such, our
Board of Directors recommends a vote against this proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by Boston Common Asset
Management. The proponent has submitted a prerecorded presentation in support

{BIO 16966372 <GO>}
I'm Lauren Compare, Managing Director and Head of Stewardship & Engagement at
Boston Common Asset Management. We seek your support for Proposal 13 on the
company's 2023 proxy statement. The proposal asks Alphabet to issue a report on
how the company intends to minimize legislative risks by aligning YouTube policies
and procedures with worldwide online safety regulations.
Our rationale for this is threefold. Despite apparent eﬀort and leadership at YouTube,
the platform remains a meaningful part of the child sexual abuse exploitation
ecosystem by being a place of contact for grooming and coercion, live streaming,
and housing child sexual abuse material. YouTube has also been implicated in
human traﬃcking. Traﬃckers in industries such as agriculture and animal husbandry,
bars, strip clubs, cantinas, pornography, and traveling sales crews used YouTube to
recruit and interact with those eventually traﬃcked. Numerous online safety
regulations and legislation have been implemented within the U.S. and many other
countries in which YouTube functions.
We disagree with Alphabet's assertion that it's currently providing suﬃcient
information about YouTube's policies and procedure to further Alphabet's
commitment to online safety. These major reported risks and potential failure to
align with regulatory requirements pose continued reputational and legal risk to the
company. We have reviewed the civil rights audit conducted by WilmerHale released
in March 2023. While the recommendations regarding content moderation align
with many of the requests of this proposal, we urge Alphabet to conduct a child
rights impact assessment as an additional measure to protect its most vulnerable
users.
We ask that Alphabet provide suﬃcient transparency for investors to evaluate the
eﬃcacy of such policies. This requested disclosure goes beyond mandatory
disclosure under various regulatory frameworks and focuses on investors' ability to
assess how Alphabet's policy to align YouTube policies and procedures with the
most rigorous online safety regulations and thereby minimize legal and reputational
risk. Further transparency from the company is necessary for investors to understandFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Thank you for presenting this proposal. We are committed to balancing creative

We have longstanding policies and procedures to foster a responsible platform that
the users, creators, and artists who make up our vibrant online community can rely
on, which we disclose publicly and periodically update in consultation with industry
experts and creators.
We support this commitment all while continuously keeping pace with the changing
landscape of online content and ever-evolving online safety regulations worldwide.
We have intensiﬁed our company-wide regulatory readiness initiatives, including
within YouTube, all under appropriate senior management and Board oversight.
Further, Google and YouTube are committed to sharing data that sheds light on how
the policies and actions of governments aﬀect privacy, security, and access to
information online, and we have voluntarily issued detailed, timely disclosures
regarding compliance and product changes in relation to new regulations.
As we shared with the proponent, we have published and regularly update a
number of substantive disclosures to meet stringent reporting requirements,
including the EU Platform to Business Annual Report, information about monthly
active recipients under the Digital Services Act, and much more. Given the nature of
these reports, the additional required risk assessments and data access provisions,
we believe that the information we need to prepare under these frameworks will be
more substantive and informative in nature than the type of report the proponent
has requested in this proposal. For all these reasons, our Board of Directors believes
that implementing this proposal would not provide additional beneﬁt to our
stockholders and recommends a vote against this proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by the National Legal and Policy
Center. The proponent has submitted a prerecorded presentation in support of the
proposal. I recognize Paul Chesser for a period of three minutes to present this
proposal.
Here we are a year later, and the incidents of bias and censorship I brought up at last
year's Alphabet meeting in support of that version of our transparency proposal
have only been further conﬁrmed with more evidence that has come to light. Now
there is an even greater number of bias and censorship examples at Alphabet since
a year ago. I have a 15-page document on my laptop of just links to examples ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 22 of 37Kathryn HallAlphabet's rampant and vicious practices of suppression, demonetization, and
deplatforming.
Alphabet opposes our proposal by saying it has, quote, safeguards in place to
prevent, quote, improper bias. So how do Google and YouTube deﬁne proper bias?
There's a lot more that can be read between the lines of Alphabet's opposition
statement in the proxy. I will give several examples.
One, the Company says, quote, we enforce our policies consistently, end quote. I
would agree with that. Alphabet consistently censors conservatives, [ph] Christians,
and skeptics of government propaganda.
Two, the company says, quote, we have a rigorous quality assurance process for all
cases, end quote. Yes, we all can see how rigorously YouTube enforced its bias
against the likes of Matt Walsh, Steven Crowder, Jordan Peterson, medical experts
who spoke truth about COVID, and many others whom YouTube silenced. Three, the
company says, quote, we carefully evaluate decisions to remove or demonetize
websites and content on our services and seek to harmonize the application of our
policies across those services, end quote.
I am certain that Google and YouTube eagerly make such evaluations and
considering the company's billions of dollars in contracts with State and Federal
government have happily censored those who don't adhere to the government
narrative. Four, the company says, quote, our business model depends on our
services providing a useful and trustworthy source of information for all our users,
end quote. Google and YouTube's determination of what is useful and trustworthy
depends on the desired goals and outcomes of Alphabet, which don't align with
advocates for free speech.
Alphabet has proven itself as a company to be entirely untrustworthy. The company
gaslights shareholders by telling them how transparent it is about its censorship
practices when it is nothing of the sort. Alphabet's biased censorship decisions are
perhaps illustrated most by YouTube's shuttering of a channel that satirized Chinese
Communist dictator Xi Jinping and by restricting a documentary critical of Disney. I
can't think of two more perfect bedfellows for Alphabet, Oppressive China and
Delusional Disney. Please vote for Proposal Number 14.

Our enforcement approach is to apply our policies consistently regardless of who or

The next stockholder proposal is being brought by Harrington Investments, Inc as
lead ﬁler along with a number of other co-ﬁlers. The proponents have submitted a
prerecorded presentation in support of the proposal. I recognize Annie McGrath for
a period of three minutes to present this proposal.
My name is Annie McGrath. Five years ago, I had a beautiful family with two amazing,
sweet children. Then one night, my only son, Griﬃn, went up to his room to try a
challenge he had seen called the Blackout Challenge, and he tragically died. Since
then, my family has been grieving this immeasurable loss every single minute of
every single day. Griﬃn was an extraordinary, brilliant and talented child. He was
popular, hilarious, and quick-witted, but most importantly, he was a sweet soul and
touched everyone he knew with his genuine kindness.
He loved science experiments and engineering. He invented his own homemade
Spider-Man web shooter that could hold a chair from a ceiling. It was his interest in
learning about science experiments that led him to frequent YouTube regularly.
Sadly, Griﬃn's death is not an anomaly. Challenges posted on YouTube have proven
lethal to many. A recent Bloomberg article has stated that in the past 18 months, at
least 17 children have died from the Blackout Challenge alone. In addition, a non-
proﬁt called Eriskaz by my friend Judy Raab, whose son also died of the choking
game, has documented 1,385 children that have also died of the Blackout Challenge
alone. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
Thousands of parents across the globe have discovered just how dangerous
Alphabet's products, speciﬁcally YouTube, can be to younger users. It's not just
dangerous challenges that are a concern. Too often, YouTube serves younger usersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

more. And young users are more vulnerable to the untruthful, biased, and even toxic
material delivered through AI in a human-like way. Alphabet is in action and actively
serving these harmful videos to young users should give investors pause. It
demonstrates the company's failure to appropriately mitigate risk, legal risk,
regulatory risk, and human risk. Without change, more kids will suﬀer, more kids will
die.
While Alphabet's Audit and Compliance Committee is charged with evaluating risk,
I've learned that investors have no idea how the committee operates. That's why the
independent audit of and report to the Audit and Compliance Committee's
performance proposed by Regulation No. 15 is long overdue. Alphabet opposes this
resolution, claiming its outside review would not result in better direction and
performance, but given the Board's lack of disclosure, there is no way for concerned
shareholders to assess the Board's actions. My son's life should not be the cost of
doing business, something has to change. Strong support for Resolution 15 will send
the message to Alphabet that shareholders demand greater transparency and
accountability.

Thank you, Ms.McGrath, for presenting this proposal and sharing with us about your
son, Griﬃn. I speak for all of us at Alphabet, including our senior leadership team
and our Board of Directors, when I say that we are truly sorry for your loss.
Responsibility is our top priority at YouTube. Our business decisions, growth, and
innovation are all focused on building a platform, technologies, and monetization
tools that serve our community of creators, advertisers, and viewers. Keeping kids
safe online is incredibly important to us. YouTube does not allow content that
encourages dangerous or illegal activities that risk physical harm or death. This
includes extremely dangerous pranks or challenges, especially those that prevent
breathing, involve ingesting harmful substances or other things that pose an
imminent risk of physical injury.
This is simply not content that we want on our platform. We have invested heavily in
the people and systems needed to keep our community safe. And when content
crosses the line and violates our community guidelines, we remove it as quickly as
possible using a combination of machine learning and human reviewers. These rules
apply to all videos on YouTube and are enforced consistently across language,
perspectives, and speakers. Our investments in this area show in our ability to
quickly and eﬀectively remove content that violates our policies.
In Q4 of 2022, we removed 5.6 million videos for violating our policies. 94% of the
videos removed were ﬁrst ﬂagged by machine learning technology, and the vast
majority were removed before they even received 10 views. Speciﬁcally when it
comes to protecting young people, YouTube has built age-appropriate experiences
for children that provide safer options for exploring online, including YouTube Kids,

that may impact public well-being, we believe that our Audit and Compliance
Committee has the requisite experience, skill set, and protocols to conduct the
robust risk oversight sought by the proponent and the committee's performance is
already reviewed as part of the Board's annual evaluation process.
Our Board of Directors as a whole and through its committees has responsibility for
oversight of risk management and is supported by management reporting
processes, including an annual company-wide risk assessment that are designed to
identify, assess, and manage critical risks and mitigation strategies. The Audit and
Compliance Committee is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk
management and major risk exposures and has a key the key role and oversight of
matters raised in this proposal, including data privacy, alleged antitrust violations,
and risks related to AI. It has rigorous frameworks and processes for fulﬁlling these
responsibilities, and regularly evaluates and adjusts its strategies to best meet the
needs of our Board of Directors and Alphabet.
In addition to its quarterly meetings, the Audit and Compliance Committee has
separate dedicated meetings to discuss risk and compliance matters, including data
privacy and security, competition, legal, regulatory, compliance, civil and human
rights, sustainability, and reputational risks. Successfully managing these and other
areas of risk are all critical to maintaining our customers' and stakeholders' trust, and
to ensuring our long-term business success, and are important priorities of the Audit
and Compliance Committee and our Board of Directors.
As such, our Board of Directors believes that the assessment requested by this
proposal would not be an eﬀective use of company resources or result in better
direction or performance and recommends a vote against this proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by James McRitchie and Myra K.
Young. The proponents have submitted a prerecorded presentation in support of
the proposal. I recognize James McRitchie for a period of three minutes to present
this proposal.
In 2002, I petitioned the SEC for proxy access. It took three rulemakings and a court
battle. More than 20 years later, 81% of S&P 500 companies, including Alphabet,
have something called proxy access. Unfortunately, it requires that nominating
groups hold 3% for three years and groups are limited to 20 members. That sets up
a situation where proxy access can't really be done without one of the big four fund
families. They administer retirement savings plans for companies and have never
even ﬁled a shareholder proposal, let alone challenged Directors. Therefore, proxy
access has gone unused.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 26 of 37Kathryn HallNow, after decades, the SEC adopted Rule 14a-19, allowing shareholders under
speciﬁed conditions to split votes between Board nominees and challengers without
attending annual meetings, but will the universal proxy rule go the way of so-called
proxy access? After reading bylaws adopted by Mossimo, Bloomberg's Matt Levine
speculated that company bylaws might demand challengers submit disclosures on
paper woven from unicorn manes with requirements waived, of course, for the
Board's nominees.
While they don't require a speciﬁc type of paper, Alphabet's advance notice bylaws
allow the Board to request any additional information as may be reasonably
required. Who determines what is reasonable? The Board, of course, unless you're
willing to go to court. Most agree, there should be some limits on what Boards can
require without seeking shareholder approval in advance or at least within a year or
so of adoption. I ﬁled 30 proposals like the one before you. We reached agreements
with one-third of all companies based on guardrails that preserve the rules intent.
All shareholder proposals are advisories. Boards are free to ignore them or adopt
whatever they please. Your vote for this this proposal can help us reach an
agreement with Alphabet that will protect your rights either before the next annual
meeting or after an even higher vote next year based on a revised proposal that
reﬂects our agreements reached with other companies to protect the rights of
shareholders such as our recent proposal at Procter & Gamble. Please vote for Fair
Elections, Proposal Number 6. Thank you.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. The requests put forth in this proposal are
already largely reﬂected in our current bylaws. We amended our bylaws in October
2022 following SEC rule changes and careful deliberations by our Board of Directors
in an eﬀort to ensure both that our stockholders would beneﬁt from having a
meaningful opportunity to nominate candidates with minimal unnecessary
challenges and steps, and any director nominees nominated via our Universal Proxy
advance notice provisions would meet minimum qualiﬁcation, competency, and
disclosure requirements in compliance with applicable laws. The proponent requests
that our bylaws include language requiring stockholder approval for any advance
notice bylaw amendments that touch on two areas, submission deadlines and
disclosure.
First, the proponent requests that we amend our bylaws mandating stockholder
approval for any advance notice bylaw amendments that require the nomination of
candidates more than 90 days before the annual meeting. Our bylaws have included
advance notice provisions since our IPO as Google, Inc in August 2004, and these
provisions have always included a market standard timeframe of requiring advance
notice by stockholders not later than the close of business on the 90th day, not
earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the anniversary date of
the immediately preceding annual meeting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

AnalystSecond, the proponent requests that we amend our bylaws to mandate stockholder
approval for any advance notice bylaw amendments that impose new disclosure
requirements for director nominees. Our current bylaws do require certain
disclosures from stockholder nominees, but only to the extent required for us to
satisfy the relevant securities disclosure rules with respect to those nominees in our
proxy materials as well as to meet NASDAQ requirements, such as the requirements
for biographical information of director nominees, information about related person
transactions under Regulation S-K, and information about actual or potential conﬂicts
of interest. This is the same information we request from our company-nominated
director nominees.
In approving our October 2022 amendments to our bylaws, our Board of Directors
carefully and intentionally avoided an approach that would be overly burdensome
for nominating stockholders. We are conﬁdent that our October 2022 amendments
struck the proper balance and ensure that the company complies with its SEC and
NASDAQ requirements. Our Board of Directors therefore recommends a vote
against this proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by John Chevedden. I recognize
John Chevedden for a period of three minutes to present this proposal. I'll advise
you when your time is about to expire. Operator, please open Mr.Chevedden's line.
Mr.Chevedden, your line is now open.
Hello, this is John Chevedden. Proposal 17, executives to retain signiﬁcant stock.
Shareholders ask our executive pay committee to adopt a policy requiring senior
executives to retain 50% of stock acquired through equity pay programs until
reaching retirement and to report to shareholders regarding the policy in the
company's next annual meeting proxy.
This single uniﬁed policy shall prohibit hedging transactions for shares subject to this
policy, which are not sales, but reduce the risk of loss to the executive. Otherwise our
directors might maneuver to avoid the impact of this proposal. This policy shall
supplement any other share ownership requirements that have been established for
senior executives and should be implemented without violating current company
contractual obligations or the terms of any current pay or beneﬁt plan.
The Board is encouraged to obtain waivers of any current pay or beneﬁt plan for
senior executives that might delay implementation of this proposal. Requiring senior
executives to hold a signiﬁcant proportion of stock obtained through executive pay
plans would focus our executives on our company's long-term success, a
Conference Board task force report stated that hold-to-retirement requirements give
executives an ever-growing incentive to focus on long-term stock price performance.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 28 of 37Kathryn Hall
Mari SchwartzerThe Board of Directors' response to this proposal states that it shares the
proponent's focus on the importance of aligning the interests of Alphabet's senior
management with those of shareholders. This proposal will simply further align
executive pay with Alphabet's long-term success. Please vote yes, executives to
retain signiﬁcant stock, Proposal 17.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. We believe our existing stock ownership
guidelines and policies substantially implement the proponent's request. We have
had for many years robust existing stock ownership guidelines for our senior
executives that are reviewed and updated from time to time by our Leadership
Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee. These guidelines are
publicly set forth in Alphabet's Corporate Governance Guidelines, which can be
found on our Investor Relations website.
Under these guidelines, our Senior Vice Presidents must hold shares of Alphabet
stock equal in value to at least $7.5 million, and our Chief Executive Oﬃcer must hold
shares of Alphabet stock equal in value to at least $35 million, for as long as they
remain in their respective roles. We believe these required holding amounts are
signiﬁcant and help align the interests of our senior executives with those of our
stockholders.
In addition, we believe we have designed our Executive Oﬃcer compensation
programs to reinforce and maintain this stockholder alignment, using equity awards
to incentivize focus on long-term stockholder value and commitment to the
company. The Leadership Development, Inclusion, and Compensation Committee
annually evaluates the structure of our equity awards to ensure the right balance of
time and performance-based equity that supports the objectives of our
compensation philosophy, aligns with our business priorities, and considers the
perspectives of our stockholders.
For these reasons, we believe there is already strong alignment between our senior
executives and our stockholders. Our Board of Directors therefore believes this
proposal would not provide any meaningful additional beneﬁt for our stockholders
and recommends a vote against this proposal.
The next stockholder proposal is being brought by the NorthStar Asset
Management, Inc Funded Pension Plan. The proponent has submitted a prerecorded
presentation in support of the proposal. I recognize Mari Schwartzer for a period of
three minutes to present this proposal.
{BIO 20356237 <GO>}
My name is Mari Schwartzer from NorthStar Asset Management in Boston. I am
presenting Resolution number 18, a request that Alphabet's Board take all
practicable steps to initiate and adopt a recapitalization plan for all outstanding
stock to have one vote per share. We've been coming to this shareholder meeting toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 29 of 37Kathryn Halltalk about equal shareholder voting for many years since 2015, and year-after-year,
the vast majority of outside shareholders support our request.
We believe that it's clear that shareholders want to have a say in the important
matters of the companies in which they invest. Yet at Alphabet, ordinary
shareholders do not have an equal ability to weigh in on signiﬁcant matters of
corporate policy. The SEC calls proxy voting the primary way for shareholders to
make their views known to company management and participate eﬀectively at
annual or special meetings.
Alphabet's voting structure is weighed heavily to favor insiders given that Class B
shares are granted 10x the voting rights of Class A shares, and Class C shareholders
have zero votes per share. Without equal voting rights, shareholders' ability to
provide feedback to the Board and protect their investment is diminished. We
believe this share structure empowers the CEO and insiders to appoint a Board that
primarily serves the CEO and management, not shareholders.
While shareholders might accept this lack of input when proﬁts are up, we believe
that this voting structure constitutes a considerable risk to governance and
shareholder value during times of crisis, and our company is no stranger to
controversy. In its opposition statement, the company asserts that the current
unequal voting structure allows it to focus on long-term success and holds
management accountable. However, we believe that when company controversies
occur that could have been avoided with proper governance reforms. These are
examples of when poor governance leads to risk for shareholders.
Alphabet employees continue to speak out, criticizing and protesting the company's
technological decisions from its contract with the Department of Defense, to biases
built into its artiﬁcial intelligence systems. Additional incidents with ﬁnancial or
material social impacts can harm share value too. Shareholders, we urge you to vote
for proxy item number 18, a recapitalization plan for all outstanding stock to have
one vote per share. Thank you.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. Since its inception, Google has been
managed with a focus on the long-term. This focus was emphasized by our co-
founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin in their letter to our stockholders at the time of
Google's IPO in 2004, in which they stated that, we are creating a corporate
structure that is designed for stability over long time horizons. They reiterated their
commitment to our long-term focus in their April 2012 letter to our stockholders, in
which they stated that we have always managed Google for the long-term, investing
heavily in the big bets we hope will make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the world.
The implementation of our holding company Alphabet in October 2015 further
reinforces this view. Our success is owed in large part to the leadership and vision
originated by our Co-Founders and carried on today by Alphabet CEO, Sundar
Pichai. We have established a robust governance structure that ensures eﬀectiveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

accountable to the best interests of the company and our stockholders. Our Board
leadership structure is regularly evaluated and has been modiﬁed at times to uphold
strong independent oversight in our evolving business and operating environment,
including the establishment of the role of independent chair in 2018.
Further, we maintain and periodically enhance our governance practices and
stockholder rights, including annual elections of all director nominees and the
introduction of a majority voting standard for directors in 2021. These enhancements
are informed by feedback gathered from direct engagement with our stockholders,
which is shared and reviewed by our Board of Directors.
Our Board of Directors believes that our capital structure, which it evaluates annually,
combined with our strong governance practices have provided signiﬁcant stability to
the company and proven beneﬁts to our stockholders, and believes that
implementing this proposal would not be in the best interest of the company and
our stockholders, and recommends a vote against this proposal.
In addition to the 18 items of business described in our proxy statement, Christopher
Jones has provided prior timely notice of his intent to present a proposal today in
accordance with the advance notice provisions of our bylaws.
The proponent did not seek to have the proposal included in our proxy statement
for the meeting. This type of proposal is sometimes referred to as a ﬂoor proposal.
To vote on this ﬂoor proposal, you must do so during the meeting by logging into
our Virtual Meeting website and following the instructions on the screen.
As a reminder, the polls are currently open and will close after the presentation of
this ﬁnal item. The proponent has submitted a prerecorded presentation in support
of the ﬂoor proposal. I recognize Christopher Jones for a period of three minutes to
present this proposal.
Hi, I'm Christopher Jones, and I've been Alphabet's and before that, Google's
shareholder for over a decade. My proposal is simple. We should urge the Board of
Directors to better align senior management incentives with Alphabet's long-term
success by evaluating investing future performance stock units or PSUs over a period
of at least ﬁve years.
Our company grants equity to align incentives, building long-term value for
stockholders. This is great. As shareholders, we should all want Alphabet to succeed
for the long-term. The problem is that, as currently designed, PSUs don't reward
long-term performance. Instead, they're rewarding performance over three years.
That's too short to adequately and thoughtfully evaluate the impact an Oﬃcer has
personally contributed to the company's long-term success versus external factors,
such as the macroeconomic tailwinds, position in the business cycle, interest rates,
and the competitive environment within which Alphabet ﬁnds itself.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 31 of 37Operator
A - Kathryn HallPerformance stock units reward Alphabet's performance against the standard and
poorest 100. PSU payouts are determined over a three-year window, and they fully
vest at the end of those three years. PSUs were ﬁrst granted in 2019, with subsequent
grants to senior management in 2021 and 2022. The problem is that three years is
just too short. In fact, the Council of Institutional Investors' policy on corporate
governance considers long-term to be at least ﬁve years.
Looking at our compensation peers, the companies that our Board uses to compare
executive compensation accounts, several of them have longer vesting periods for
their equivalent to PSUs. Amazon, typically ﬁve years or more. Netﬂix doesn't do
them at all. And Oracle, in fact extended their period from a ﬁve-year window to an
eight-year window to encourage a longer-term focus on Oracle's performance.
Ironically, the equity that we grant our own employees here at Alphabet also
intended to align their interests with long-term success, vests over four years, not
three. Senior management's long-term incentive horizon shouldn't be shorter than
their employees.
In closing, I invite you to join me in urging our Board of Directors to better align
senior management's incentives with our company's long-term success. Three years
is just too short to evaluate our company's long-term performance, let's try ﬁve.
Thank you.
Questions And Answers
(Question And Answer)
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this ﬂoor proposal. While we share the proponent's belief
in the importance of aligning the long-term interests of our named Executive
Oﬃcers with our stockholders, we believe the current performance period already
reinforces this connection. We provide a majority of each named Executive Oﬃcer's
compensation via equity grants of restricted stock and performance stock units,
which incentivizes long-term thinking and performance.
As the proponent notes, the performance stock units granted to our named
Executive Oﬃcers will vest, if at all, based on Alphabet's TSR performance relative to
the S&P 100 over a multi-year performance period, subject to continued
employment on the vesting date. The Leadership Development, Inclusion, and
Compensation Committee considered peer and broader market practices when
establishing the performance period and believes that the current performance
periods are appropriate to encourage and motivate long-term performance.
As the compensation of our named executive oﬃcers is already tied to long-term
performance, their interests are closely aligned with our stockholders' interests, andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

period. As such, our Board of Directors recommends a vote against this proposal.
The persons named as proxy holders, including myself, have discretionary authority
in voting the proxies under Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act, and I hereby
intend to exercise such discretion to vote against this proposal. Because no further
business is scheduled to come before the stockholders, I declare the polls for each
matter voted upon at this meeting closed.
I will now review the preliminary results on the matters brought before the meeting. I
have been advised by the Inspector of Election that the nominees for election to the
Board of Directors have been duly elected. I have been further advised by the
Inspector of Election that a majority of the shares of our Class A and Class B
common stock entitled to vote and present at the meeting or represented by proxy
voted in favor of the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP to act as
our independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for the 2023 ﬁscal year.
The amendment and restatement of Alphabet's 2021 stock plan to increase the share
reserve by 170 million shares of Class C capital stock. The approval on an advisory
basis advisory basis of the compensation awarded to named Executive Oﬃcers, and
every three years for the stockholder advisory vote on compensation awarded to our
named Executive Oﬃcers. Therefore, each of these proposals has been approved by
our stockholders.
I have also been advised by the Inspector of Election that a majority of the shares of
our Class A and Class B common stock entitled to vote and present at the meeting
or represented by proxy voted against Proposals 6 through 18 described in our proxy
statement and against the ﬂoor proposal presented today. Therefore, each of these
stockholder proposals has not been approved by our stockholders. As soon as
possible after the meeting, we'll complete the ﬁnal vote tabulations and we'll
provide the ﬁnal vote results on our Investor Relations website and in a ﬁling with the
SEC. That ends the oﬃcial business of the meeting, and I declare the formal portion
of our meeting adjourned.
We will now have the question-and-answer session. We would like to thank our
stockholders for all of the questions submitted. We received several questions about
Alphabet's position on the stockholder proposals. The company's position on each
stockholder proposal was provided during the formal business portion of the

John Hennessy, Chair of the Board, Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Oﬃcer, Ruth Porat,
Chief Financial Oﬃcer, and Kent Walker, President, Global Aﬀairs and Chief Legal
Oﬃcer will be answering questions. Okay, let's get started. We'll focus on topics of

{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
This is Sundar, I'll answer this question. We are seven years into our journey as an AI-
ﬁrst company, so we've been working for a long time to incorporate AI into our
products and make them more helpful. Now, we are at an inﬂection point with
Generative AI and are working to take this to the next level.
In my remarks, I mentioned a few ways we are doing this in products people know
and love, including the new search generative experience in search, the Help Me
Write feature in Gmail, and the immersive view for routes and maps. We also want to
enable others to innovate with AI, be it through our cloud oﬀerings or developer
APIs. Looking ahead, making AI helpful for everyone is the most signiﬁcant way we'll
make progress on our mission.
Overall, I'm very excited about the possibilities here. I think AI has the potential to
impact nearly every sector from helping radiologists assess medical images, to
making diﬃcult or dangerous jobs safer and easier, to giving everyone a personal
tutor or creative collaborator powered by AI. So we are approaching it boldly with a
sense of excitement, and we are doing it responsibly in a way that underscores the
deep commitment we feel to get it right.
We ﬁrst published our AI principles in 2018, rooted in a belief that AI should be
developed to beneﬁt society, while avoiding harmful applications. We evolve our
approaches as technology evolves. So just as we are developing better algorithms to
detect spam, we need to do the same with deepfakes, audio and video, for example.
We are also working with governments, experts, social scientists, and others to
advocate for robust pro-innovation and responsible frameworks for AI ahead.
Thanks.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thanks, Sundar. We received a number of questions on our capital return strategy. In
particular, we have been asked whether we will be issuing dividends to stockholders
and/or increasing our share repurchases.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
This is Ruth. I can take this question. So the primary uses of capital are ﬁrst to invest
to support long-term organic growth, second, to support both acquisitions and
investments, and third, for capital returns. We continue to believe that a share
repurchase program is the best approach for us because it provides ﬂexibility, which
is valuable given we operate in such a dynamic and competitive area.
We're very pleased to have the new $70 billion authorization and we do remain
focused on repurchasing both Class A and Class C shares. We do regularly evaluate
our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital returns to
shareholders and we do not have plans to issue a dividend. Thanks for the question.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Thanks, Ruth. Next, some of our stockholders asked us to elaborate on our eﬀorts to
manage harmful content and ﬁght misinformation on our YouTube platform.
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
This is Kent. I can take this one. Our commitment to responsibility on YouTube starts
with our community guidelines, which set the rules of the road for content that's
allowed on YouTube. For instance, we have strict policies against hate speech,
misinformation, deceptive practices, scams, impersonation, spam and harassment,
and all kinds of other abusive content on YouTube. And we do regularly terminate
channels that repeatedly or egregiously violate those policies.
We have automated ﬂagging systems to quickly identify content that may violate
those community guidelines. And we also have thousands of reviewers around the
world who operate 24/7 to enforce our policies. In 2018, we introduced our
community guidelines enforcement report, which we update quarterly, that helps us
increase transparency and accountability around our eﬀorts to protect viewers. In the
fourth quarter of 2022 alone, we removed over 5.5 million videos for violating our
community guidelines. Over 90% of those were ﬁrst ﬂagged by our automated
systems and over 70% of those were removed before they had more than 10 views.
Our transparency reports include a metric called violative view rate, which helps us
estimate what percentage of views on YouTube come from content that violates our
policies. In the fourth quarter of last year, YouTube's violative view rate was roughly
0.1%. In other words, for every 1,000 views, only one was of content that violated our
community guidelines. That's down over 70% compared to the same quarter in 2017.
In large part, thanks to our investments in machine learning.
So with billions of people visiting YouTube every day, whether they're looking to be
informed, to be entertained, or to learn, we have a responsibility to connect people
to high-quality content, and we'll continue to focus on removing violative content,
raising up authoritative sources, and rewarding trusted creators. Thanks for the
question.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thanks, Kent. We also received a question about how we are balancing capital
returns with reinvestment in our business.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
This is Ruth. I'll answer this one. So I outlined our approach to capital allocation a
moment ago. And the capital return program is additive to our investment in the
business, and it does not crowd out where we want to, and can, and do invest in our
business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 35 of 37A - Kathryn Hall
A - Kent WalkerAs I noted, our primary use of capital is to invest in the business for long-term
growth, and we're investing aggressively in areas, including AI, Search, YouTube,
Ads, Cloud, Hardware, and Android. In terms of the numbers, last year we invested
$40 billion in research and development and another $32 billion in CapEx to support
our growth. We're very excited about our near and long-term opportunities, in
particular with the application of AI across our products and services, as Sundar and
John discussed.
We're also investing in long-term growth with acquisitions and strategic investments,
and you saw that with our acquisition of the cybersecurity company, Mandiant. The
share repurchase program is additive. It's a part of our overall capital allocation, and
each one of these steps contributes to long-term value.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thanks, Ruth. Moving on to the next topic, stockholders want to better understand
our philosophy behind our political contributions.
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
This is Kent again. I can address this one. We believe it's important to have a voice in
the political process to ensure that the Internet and technology more generally
remain forces for growth and for innovation. We're focused on issues like AI and
privacy, interoperability, transparency, rules protecting kids and families, and a lot
more. In general, we're advocating for balanced regulation that promotes
responsible innovation in the U.S. and around the world. Where it's appropriate and
where it's permitted by law, we make corporate contributions to non-federal
committees and organizations, state and local candidates, and other groups.
We haven't used corporate resources to make independent expenditures or fund
electioneering communications in support of or in opposition to candidates. We
want our engagement with policymakers and regulators to be open, transparent,
and clear to our users, to our stockholders, and to the public. That's why we regularly
update our U.S. Public Policy Transparency site, which outlines our public policy
objectives, our oversight and compliance work, our corporate political contributions,
and other key elements of our approach to policy engagement.
Our transparency eﬀorts and practices are actually recognized as best-in-class. For
example, the Center for Political Accountability's Zicklin Index of Corporate Political
Disclosure and Accountability has ranked us in their highest category for four years
running. We maintain Executive and Board oversight as well. Board and senior
management teams oversee our corporate political activity to ensure that we have
appropriate policies and practices in place and that those policies and practices
serve the interests of our stockholders.

{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thanks, Kent. We received a question regarding the company's strategy. Speciﬁcally,
what is our greatest competitive advantage? And how can we keep growing for the
next 10 years?
{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
This is Sundar, I can take this one. Our competitive advantage is our ability to focus
on using deep computer science to solve important user problems at scale. We
focus on putting the user-ﬁrst and building products and features that are helpful to
people. AI is an example of one of the areas where we've been investing for the
long-term, and you're seeing some of the beneﬁts of those investments today, both
in our products as well as our technical infrastructure.
Lastly, inspiration for these new tools comes from all levels of the company and all of
our teams. By virtue of working on some of the most diﬃcult problems out there, we
tend to attract some of the best people who then contribute to our innovation,
creating a virtuous cycle that beneﬁts our users and customers. Thanks for the
question.
{BIO 21799952 <GO>}
Thank you, Sundar. We have time for one last question. A stockholder has asked how
the Board considers directors' time commitments and risks of overboarding?
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
This is John. I'm happy to answer this question. We expect that each director will
ensure that their other existing and future commitments, including employment
responsibilities and service on outside Boards will not materially interfere with their
service as a director on Alphabet's Board. The non-gov committee regularly reviews
all of our Board members' outside commitments, both public and private, for
conﬂicts of interest and other concerns, and I have personally had conversations with
Board members on this important topic.
Our Board members are very engaged. In fact, many routinely attend committee
meetings, even when they are not formal members of those committees. Our
overboarding policy sets the maximum number of public company Board
memberships at four, including Alphabet. This policy was actually strengthened in
2021. Previously, we allowed a total of ﬁve memberships, and we believe that this
new policy is aligned with best practice. This policy ensures directors have suﬃcient
