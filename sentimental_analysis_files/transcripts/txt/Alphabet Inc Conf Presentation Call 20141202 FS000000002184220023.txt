Ellen read oﬀ the Safe Harbor statement. So take it away.
{BIO 19113967 <GO>}
Very exciting. I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make
today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's
future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance
of our businesses and our expected level of CapEx. These statements involve a
number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially.
Please note that these forward-looking statements reﬂect our opinions only as of the
date – today and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results
of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or
future events. Please refer to our SEC ﬁlings for a more detailed description of the
risk factors that may aﬀect our results.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
So like I said, I'm joined on the stage by Neal Mohan, who is the Vice President of
Display and Video Advertising. So thanks for joining us, Neal, and welcome.

Great. So, Neal, I don't think investors are as familiar with you. I think the industry
players are familiar with you, but I don't think they're as familiar with you. But I think
of you as the guy who built the entire display stack at Google. But will you talk a little
bit more about your background as well as – at DoubleClick and what you do on a
day-to-day basis?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Sure. So I'll do that fairly quickly. So my name is Neal Mohan. I'm responsible for
what at Google we call Display and Video Advertising Products, which are generally
speaking those products out of our core search ads set of products, so outside of
the ads that we run on google.com. And so my portfolio includes advertising on
YouTube, across the Google Display Network, our AdSense sites and, of course, our
DoubleClick platform, our programmatic solutions both for the sell-side, the
publishing side, as well as for the buy-side, the advertiser, and agency side. I came to
Google when we sold DoubleClick to Google about – nearly coming up on seven
years ago now, with really, as Stephen said, the purpose of building out a display
and video advertising business and capability for the company which is what I've
been responsible for and leading over the course of the last several years.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. So seven years on now, it's a lot of water under the bridge now, but what do
you think were the most crucial product developments for Google in that meantime
and where do you think you still have a lot of work to do?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean I think that when I started – when we, at Google, really started growing
the display and video business it was nascent. AdSense, which is kind of the kernel
of our display business was around, we were working with publisher websites. But
putting together, I think, sort of the deep relationships and customer expertise that
we had on the DoubleClick side of the business with sort of Google technology and
scale as represented by AdSense and AdWords into kind of a uniﬁed oﬀering that
works for 2 million plus web publishers, app developers from the smallest blogs and
app developers to multimedia publishing conglomerates on one end and then
having a solution that caters to the smallest mom and pop advertisers via our
AdWords on display oﬀering to the largest agency holding companies via our
DoubleClick suite on the high-end.
Having that sort of comprehensive complete solution, I think, has been our largest
accomplishment and throughout that process, we've remained very focused on one
thing which is what do our customers need both on the buy-side and the sell-side.
How can we deliver to them a comprehensive solution across display, video, mobile,
search, et cetera, and that's what we've been focused on, and so that's been, I think,
the kernel or the key ingredient of our success over the course of the last seven
years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02

Page 3 of 15Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal MohanIn terms of new opportunities, I think one of the areas that I'm particularly interested
in and that we're very focused on is really cracking the brand advertising nut for
digital. And so if you think about the overall display or overall advertising pie
globally, there is estimates between $600 billion to $800 billion. Digital
predominantly has addressed about one-half of that, which is the direct response
portion of that pie. And so the opportunity before all of us is that other half of the
pie, which is brand advertising predominantly spent on television today, but that
represents a huge opportunity not just for Google, but for all of our publisher and
advertiser and agency partners, and so that remains something that I'm extremely
excited about. We're obviously very focused on that with properties like YouTube,
our programmatic buying solutions, et cetera, and I think that's where you'll see a lot
of product innovation in the years ahead.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. You bring up YouTube and brand advertising, I think we asked Nikesh
(05:13) this on an earnings conference call several quarters ago, and especially as it
pertains to YouTube and brand advertising, safety as well as context are two hugely
important factors for brand advertisers. So it seems like given Google's core
technology competencies and I think of Google as the king of contextual
advertising. I mean there remains a large opportunity to do the same for YouTube as
well, so you can signal to your advertisers and say, hey, this is a safe place for you to
be placing your ad dollars. So where are you on that product initiative right now?
How are you signaling to advertisers? Yes, you can spend your money here.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. So the ﬁrst thing that I will say is that when we think about things like making
sure that digital is a safe and productive place for brand advertisers to spend money,
we don't think about it just in terms of how do we solve that problem for YouTube.
We want to solve that problem for the entire ecosystem. Like I said, we work with 2
million plus publishers who also are great places for brand advertising in addition to
YouTube. And so we approach it as an industry-wide, system-wide problem and it's
an area in that we've been investing in very heavily.
Obviously, Google has a deep heritage here, given our early days in terms of
weeding out fraud on the AdWords side, click fraud, et cetera. We want to extend
those capabilities to things like impression and view fraud, which is a challenge in
the display and video space. comScore had a recent study, I think, that said that
about half the ads on the Internet are never actually seen by human being. With stuﬀ
like that, nothing else matters. And so it's been an area of an aggressive investment
for us to solve that problem, not just for Google but for the entire – working with
partners across the entire industry. And so couple of things there.
We acquired a company called spider.io a few months ago that has deep expertise
and impression in view spam. We're building those capabilities into our entire stack.
And the idea there is ensuring that all of our inventory, YouTube, the inventory
available on our Ad Exchange, et cetera, is as clean and as fraud free as possible. But
just as importantly giving tools to our buyers to make sure that that's the case, notFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 15Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal Mohanjust for our inventory, but for all the inventory that they're buying across the Internap
and the app ecosystem.
So that's what I would say on the safety and fraud side of things. And in terms of
viewability, we've been, again, investing very heavily there, working with industry
bodies like the IAB to come up with viewability standards for display and video. We
have a technology called Active View, which allows brands to be assured that a
human being actually is capable of seeing the advertiser that they're running. It
sounds crazy, but that is a fundamental problem that still needs to be solved in
digital, and we have a technological capability that allows us to do that. In fact, we've
rolled that out across all of our media buying networks where we will only charge
advertisers when the ads are actually seen by human being, and we encourage the
entire industry to move to that type of the standard. We think it's good for the overall
ecosystem for publishers, advertisers and agencies. And so that's how we're looking
to address the problem systematically, not just on our own properties like YouTube.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got it. Now, that brings up an interesting question, attracting the TV ad budgets to
come online. So that's been an exciting theme that everybody is chasing after and
you're seeing Yahoo! recently as well as AOL positioning themselves to capture
additional share of those dollars. But this is an industry that's been doing things the
way they've been doing it for close to 60 years now, right? So what can Google do
to accelerate, I guess, the share gain for online and make it easier for advertisers to
spend?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean I think that to answer that question, you really have to, again, think back
to what the true ﬁrst principles. And if you think about it, brand advertisers really only
care about three things. They care about whether they're actually reaching the right
audience in the right context, et cetera. And so there, everything that I talked about
ﬁghting ad fraud, ensuring that ads are actually viewable by human beings on
desktop, mobile, all kinds of devices, that's table stakes, and we need to deliver that
as an industry.
Obviously, Google is taking a leadership position and making that happen across
YouTube and other properties, that's the ﬁrst step. But then, once you – the brand
advertisers are assured that they can reach in the audience that they're looking to
reach, we need to give them the tools to actually engage in that audience. And so
one of the great things about digital, of course, is that we have a slew of capabilities
there that you may or may not have in linear television in terms of making accretive
really something that works for an audience. And so an example of that is our
TrueView format, which, for those of you that aren't unfamiliar, is the skippable video
format that you see on advertising that runs on YouTube. And the idea there is can
we align advertiser and agency goals with consumer goals, which is users, if they are
not interested in the ad, can skip them, they don't have to watch them. And
advertisers don't have to pay if users actually skip those ads. And so it creates this
kind of positive feedback cycle where advertisers are very invested in building
beautiful creative, engaging creative, and that actually works for the consumers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 15And so a lot of the great viral video campaigns that you've seen have been
campaigns that have been built around this orientation of, if users skip the ad, it
doesn't matter. So let's create something that's truly engaging, funny, makes an
emotional connection with users, et cetera. And so we're investing very heavily there
in terms of building out those capabilities for creative agencies, media agencies. We
have YouTube Brand Labs where we literally will bring in creative agencies to help
them with concepts of how do you actually get consumers hooked during the ﬁrst
ﬁve seconds of an ad so that they don't actually skip when they can and those types
of concepts. We're also investing in terms of making it very easy for them to deploy
those creatives by making it very easy to buy, allowing them to buy that inventory
programmatically, which I think many of you know is the means by which many large
advertisers and agencies would like to deploy all of their digital media going
forward.
And then the ﬁnal thing the brands care about is not only did I reach actual – the
right audience was I looking for, did I engage that audience. But how do I actually
truly measure the eﬃcacy of these campaigns. And if I would articulate in a nutshell,
the biggest problem that needs to get solved in digital in terms of attracting brand
dollars, it's this third one, which is around measurement. And the analogy that I like
to use is that digital works for direct response advertisers because they can measure
it, impressions, clicks, conversion, it's all right there that can make the math work
seamlessly and that's the reason why it's such a powerful medium for direct
response advertising.
But what if we could actually invent or deliver that click, if you will, for brand
advertising, giving brand advertisers that clear real-time signal into the fact that their
brand campaigns are actually working the same way that DR campaigns do for
performance advertisers. And so that's a big area of investment for us. We're doing a
lot of innovation there. Ourselves, we're partnering with companies like Nielsen and
comScore as well. To give you an example of what we're working on there is we have
a product called Brand Lift. And this is the capability that runs for campaigns across
YouTube and GDN. We're trying to bring it to our DoubleClick suite, so we can run
across the entire – the rest of our advertising portfolio as well.
And we've run about 6,000 of these Band Lift studies and what they show to
advertisers in a very, very quick feedback loop is whether those brand campaigns
are working towards upper funnel metrics that they're looking to measure like brand
recall, change in awareness, change in consideration, purchase intent, those types of
signals which are important to brand advertisers and not so much to performance
advertisers who are looking for some kind of conversion event. And if we can give
that feedback signal to brand advertisers in near real-time, we've gotten to the point
where brand campaigns aren't just one-time events, they're campaigns that brand
advertisers can leave always on as long as they're getting those Brand Lift results that
they're looking for.
So as I said, we've run 6,000 of these surveys for brands like MasterCard, Mondelēz,
eHealth, et cetera, and not only are the results proving that digital works, but more
importantly, for me, the fact that advertisers are getting that feedback onFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal Mohanperformance in real-time and are able to tweak their campaigns almost immediately
to actually dramatically improve brand performance, while those campaigns are
running as opposed to getting some kind of report six months after the fact that they
are used to, say, in television and they can't do anything about until next season's
holiday campaign. And so I think that is the really big paradigm shift that's going to
occur for brand advertising that's going to make it so that those brand dollars really
start to ﬂow to digital. And the bang for the buck that brand advertisers see as a
result of their paid media deployments is going to improve dramatically, just as it did
for direct response advertisers several years ago.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yeah. When I look at Google, I think one of the very few companies out there that
has placements and properties that – to cater to advertisers in all parts of the
purchasing funnel, right, and I think if you talk to advertisers these days, they're
mainly concerned with the problem of attribution, they know that they can measure
the eﬃcacy on a direct response but not so much on brand advertising. So like what
are you doing from a product perspective to help people out to from the very top of
the purchasing funnel? It seems like all the properties are there, it's just a matter of
linking them and solving it for everybody. So what are you doing from a product
perspective to help people out?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. So I mean I think the real key there before we can even link that consumer
journey from the top of the funnel all the way to the bottom of the funnel is actually
establishing benchmarks for that top of the funnel, and so that's the reason, again,
why we are investing so heavily with things like Brand Lift so that we can actually
show – for example, the idea would be an advertiser starts with a top of the funnel
campaign, say, on YouTube or the Google Display Network or using one of our
DoubleClick products and we could show to them as a result of these brand
advertising eﬀorts, you are generating x, y, z in terms of lift. And lift around metrics
that you are already measuring through some kind of oﬄine survey for the television
world like, ad recall, awareness, consideration, purchase intent, all the stuﬀ that
brand advertisers are used to but we can actually now measure in real-time. And the
idea then is to be able to stitch that kind of feedback together with the feedback that
users might be getting – or advertisers are getting at the bottom of the funnel to
complete that journey.
But one of the things that we have seen is that the path of the consumer is not
always just a linear path down that funnel, right? Brand advertising works because it
creates this halo of awareness. Sometimes that might take years for it to pay oﬀ, for
example, in the purchase of a new car or something like that that's a long-term
considered purchase. And so it's not just about attribution up and down the funnel,
it's about actually establishing a currency and set of metrics for brand advertisers
that just works on its own and stands on its own regardless of whether that brand
campaign is tied to some kind of conversion event immediately or six months, a year
or two years down the road. And in order to make that happen, we need to establish
the link between those Brand Lift metrics at the top of the funnel and some sort of
sales activity that might happen sort of months or years sort of down the road. And
so those are the types of things that we're working on.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal MohanBut the real table stakes there for us are to be able to give brands this real-time
feedback in terms of the type of Brand Lift that they're seeing and the early results of
working with, like I said, we run 6,000 of these studies over the last several months
for a lot of our largest brands in the world, is that this is really what they're looking
for in terms of establishing this clique, if you will, for brand. This shallow indicator of
whether their campaigns are actually working to change perception around their
brands, change consideration, purchase intent and those types of things and so
that's what we are very focused on.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. You brought up the tool sets to help people purchase ad inventory earlier,
that begs the question of programmatic. So I mean 10 years ago, we were sending
insertion orders via fax to deploy ad dollars. But now, it seems like it's such a simple
and logical move. But what do you think has impeded more of a rapid advertiser
adoption of programmatic as a buying (18:47)?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. Well, I mean I would say from my experience programmatic and I've been in
the digital advertising industries literally from the very early days from the mid-1990s
and I have never seen a technology both on the buy-side and the sell-side of digital
media grow faster than something like programmatic buying and selling. So I'd say
at the outset, it's experienced incredibly rapid growth and there is obviously things
that we would like to see to see it grow faster and I'll name a few of those in a
second. But the growth has been truly phenomenal there in terms of the amount of
transactions that are occurring programmatically versus not. And the feedback that I
get from agencies and advertisers is they'd like to see it grow even faster, they would
like to deploy more of their dollars in a programmatic fashion. And the simple
reason is because it works, it delivers the ROI that they're looking for, it is more
eﬃcient, it allows them to deploy insights they may have about their consumers in a
much more eﬀective, eﬃcient manner and a real-time manner all capabilities that are
not possible to do in an upfront I/O sort of type of fashion.
For example, on our DoubleClick Bid Manager, which is the product that many
agencies and advertisers use to deploy their budgets programmatically, we have
seen doubling in the number of transactions that occur via that platform year-on-
year. And much of that growth is coming from things like video and mobile. So not
only is programmatic growing, but it's growing in some of the fastest growing parts
of the industry which are video and mobile.
On the publisher side, we're also seeing great results. One of the most interesting
things that we've seen over the last 12 months is that programmatic is no longer the
purview of sort of performance advertising inventory or sort of "remnant inventory".
It's really moving up the spectrum into more premium inventory. For example, the
amount of transactions conducted programmatically on our Ad Exchange at CPMs
greater than $5 grew something like, I think, 55% year-on-year last year, those at
CPMs greater than $10 grew 60% year-on-year. So lots of very high quality inventory
is actually now getting transacted programmatically.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02

Page 8 of 15Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal Mohan
Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal Mohan
Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal MohanAnother example is the program that we launched a few months ago called Partner
Select. And the idea there is, can we bring together the world's most premium sort
of video publishers on one end and the most premium sort of brands on the other
end and create a programmatic video marketplace that allows them to transact very
high quality inventory, very high quality brands, but do it in a fashion that isn't sort of,
let me book a upfront sort of one-time a year IO RFP process, but to allow them to
actually do it programmatically much more eﬃciently, much more eﬀectively. And
the response we've seen from publishers as well as advertisers has been incredibly
encouraging despite how new that program is.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
And so we're very encouraged by the growth of programmatic not just sort of across
the Google stack but for the entire industry and, in particular, I am encouraged given
sort of how quickly it's moving up the spectrum from sort of just remnant inventory
to much more premium brand-oriented inventory around things like mobile and
video, et cetera.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got it. What is your long-term pricing strategy for all of your ad tech services? It
seems like you guys are singularly focused on reducing the friction that exists in the
platform. So from a platform perspective, it seems like you should be looking at
pricing down as much as possible to get more rapid adoption of all of your
technology?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
I mean at the end of the day, it's not for us for – we want to enable – the way I think
about it is, what is the solution that our advertisers and our publishers are looking
for? Our advertisers are looking for eﬀective deployment of their media dollars.
There needs to be some way of sort of measuring the eﬃcacy and delivering sort of
the highest amount of ROI for those dollars whether they are DR advertisers or
brand advertisers. Hence, the focus on things like Brand Lift for brands and – et
cetera. And so our solutions are oriented around that and so that's kind of the way I
think about the buy-side.
And on the sell-side, the same sort of kind of principle applies. Fundamentally, our
publishers are looking for our solutions to deliver the highest yield from a
monetization standpoint.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yeah.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 15Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal Mohan
Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal MohanAnd so that means that the solutions – when they use our solutions, it should
generate higher yield for every single ad slot whether it's on mobile, desktop, et
cetera, compared to the alternatives that are out there. And so for me, it's not about
sort of driving down or driving up prices, it's really about sort of how our publishers
and advertisers can get the best out of both sides of our sort of technology stack.
And if we can do that, that's fundamentally sort of what grows the pie. Our business
only grows as we continue to sort of grow the pie for both our publishers and our
advertisers. And it's not for us, it's not about sort of how the pricing mechanics play
out. It's really about driving up yield on the publisher side. Last year, we delivered $9
billion to all of these publishers that we work on, that's how we grow our business by
delivering value to publishers. Similarly, on the advertiser side, all of the top 10 major
agencies globally use our buy-side stack. They do it because it delivers eﬀective and
eﬃcient results for their campaigns and that's what we're focused on.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Interesting. So, let's talk about the competition then. If you want to name names,
that's ﬁne also. But as you lined up the stack that you have built versus the others
that are being built right now and have already been constructed, like what would
you say are your most long-term sustainable advantages?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean I guess the ﬁrst thing that I would say is that and, again, I have been in
this business for a very long time. I think competition is great. It keeps us on our toes.
It provides choice to advertisers and publishers and our goal really is less so focused
on the competition and, again, back to what I said before, focused on what our
advertisers and agencies and our publisher partners are looking for.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
We think and what the direction that I give to all of my product team has been
deliver the most comprehensive scalable simple solution you can to both advertisers
and publishers, but do it in a way that's an open platform, so if they want to plug and
play other technologies in there, they can, but if they want a sort of comprehensive
sort of suite of solutions, then Google delivers that as well.
And so that's been the goal of our DoubleClick Digital Marketing solutions on the
advertiser side, DoubleClick for Publishers, our Ad Exchange, et cetera, on the
publishing side. And that's going to remain the goal which is how do we deliver sort
of the best and most comprehensive solutions to our partners? And we do that
through a combination of sort of very deep relationships with all of these partners on
the buy-side as well as the sell-side so that we have kind of the nuance insights
about what they're really looking for us to develop and that's how we develop a lot
of our roadmaps is in conjunction with our partners. And then deploy sort of true
Google technology and scale to solve the problems globally for all of these clients.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 15Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal MohanThat's what I believe has been kind of our sustainable advantage for the last seven
years and I think is what's going to continue into the future.
And from our perspective, the results play out. As I said, every one of the top 10
global agencies uses one or more components of the DoubleClick suite on the buy-
side. We, on the publishing side, the amount of transactions that go through our Ad
Exchange today is more than all the sort of stock and bond exchange of the world
combined and that continues to grow.
In terms of our programmatic technologies, as I said, the number of impressions,
transactions in DoubleClick Bid Manager has doubled year-on-year and that
continues to grow. Our mobile and video parts of this stack are growing nearly 100%
in both of those buckets. And so we're happy with the results, but fundamentally,
those results come from satisﬁed publishers and satisﬁed advertisers and agencies
and that is truly what we focus on.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. Now, much has been made some of competitors' access to data, right? It
seems like to me that Google has 10 plus years of consumer behavioral search data
that could be levered to better signal to advertisers the value of our certain
publishers' inventory including yours also. So where are you in terms of
implementing all of that data for your publisher partners as well as your verticals like
YouTube?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. So the way I think about it is less about sort of what type of data or insights get
supplied where, but really giving our advertisers and publishers the tools that they
need to deploy the insights and other assets like that they may have in the most
eﬃcient manner. And so, for example, the reason we've invested so heavily in our
programmatic stack is because a lot of advertisers actually have consumer insights of
their own that they would like to bring to the table and use to deploy from a digital
media standpoint. And so we've enabled that as seamlessly as possible and all the
growth including a lot of the numbers that I just rattled oﬀ are coming from the fact
that advertisers can do that.
In terms of – on the publisher side, similarly, sort of how do we give those types of
insights about how their audience looks and those types of things so that they can
deploy their inventory in a way that's most eﬀective for them is kind of how we focus
our business. And so I believe the answer in more of a general state in terms of sort
of what slice of type of data we use where and really say that our job is to enable our
advertisers and publishers to do that in the most eﬀective manner.
The other thing that I would say there is that, sort of the overriding principle in terms
of how we think about data and its use for things like advertising is, at the end of the
day, this is all about how brands and publishers make connections with consumers.
And so if we're not putting consumer privacy, transparency, control and choice front
and center, then we, as an industry, not just Google, are kind of missing the ball. And
so everything we do is really from that lens.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 15Q - Stephen D. Ju
A - Neal MohanAnd so to give some examples there, for all Google media, if users don't want any of
that data to be deployed, we have an Ads Preferences Manager where they can
easily opt out. You may have started to notice on all the ads that you see across the
Internet, a small X at the top of the creative where users can simply mute an ad that
they think is either irrelevant or don't want to see again and they can submit to us
the reasons why they don't want to see it and then can easily opt out from seeing an
ad from that advertiser. And so a lot of our innovation in terms of kind of how data is
used is done after we've actually deployed capabilities that we think are really good
in terms of giving our users control of the types of messages that they see. And from
Google, those are the types of things that you can look for more so going forward.

Got it. We've been talking about sort of the larger advertisers, the brand advertisers,
but SMB and local advertisers is also going to be a crucial part of your growth
trajectory over the longer term. So how will you look to adopt the tools and the
products that you've developed so that it's more appropriate for clients who
probably don't have the wherewithal to go outside and hire an ad agency?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, that's a good question. So I think as many people know, Google's heritage on
the advertising side has come from catering to the needs of small and medium
businesses. That's where a lot of the growth of AdWords has come from, AdSense
obviously starting with small publishers before they grew up into large publishers.
And that remains a very important critical part of our business. And so I talked a lot
about earlier, about advertisers and agencies kind of bringing their own data to
bear, their own insights to bear, well, of course, a lot of that is the purview of the
large advertisers and brands.
If you don't have those capabilities or if you don't have a staﬀ of sort of math PhDs
on hand to be able to optimize your campaigns every single day, AdWords has those
tools to be able to cater to your needs. So if you want to ﬁnd an audience that men
18 to 49 that are interested in, say, either sports or cooking or what have you, well,
we oﬀer those audience segments and the ability to ﬁnd those users in AdWords
today in a very simply couple of clicks. If you want to optimize your campaign, but
you don't have those statisticians on hand, well, there's tools like Conversion
Optimizer that do that automatically for you in AdWords today. And by the way,
when I'm using the term AdWords, it doesn't apply just to search, it applies to the
Google Display Network, YouTube, et cetera.
One of the other areas that we focused on for SMBs is making it very easy to actually
build the creative. So several years ago, this was a big challenge in the display space,
because it's relatively easy to create a text ad for search, but building kind of a rich
display ad is a lot harder. And so we built a product called Display Ad Builder
seamlessly integrated in AdWords where literally in a matter of minutes, an
advertiser can get a display ad created and up and running, a process that
previously would have probably taken dozens or hundreds of hours to build. We're
doing the same thing for video advertising. A few months ago, we acquired a very
small company called Directr that allows small businesses to be able to createFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02

integrate that experience into the AdWords experience as well. So everything from
sort of creative creation to targeting, to optimization, we want to make as seamless
and as easy as possible and take as much of that burden away from small and
medium businesses as possible...
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
...because we think that this growth that we're seeing in display and video and
mobile is not just the purview of the largest advertisers and agencies that should
apply to everybody.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. Now switching gears a little bit to the mobile side of things, I mean we
spent the last sort of 50 years optimizing ad targeting for the desktop only to have
mobile traﬃc start to become an increasingly larger percentage of the overall traﬃc.
So do you think targeting innovation for mobile, do we have to slough through 15
years of innovation to reach where it is on desktop? And on the other side of this
equation, where is the willingness of investors to step up – not investors, but
advertisers to step up for mobile inventory and what can Google do to help facilitate
budget deployment on mobile to take away some of the friction?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean so I think the ﬁrst thing I'd say is that, I mean advertisers are very
excited and eager to go where their consumers are. I mean everybody's seen the
stats, but 77% of consumers are on a second screen when they're doing something
like watching television. We recently saw that 90% of consumers begin a task on one
device completed on another. So it's not just a mobile world that we're all living in,
it's truly a 24/7 connected multi-screen world. And that's the environment that
advertisers and publishers ﬁnd themselves in. So everything that we've been talking
about for the last half hour or so is mobile is something that sort of should be front
and center in all of those pieces whether it's brand, whether it's programmatic,
whether it's SMB, used cases, et cetera.
And the ﬁrst thing is we can't sort of reinvent the wheel on a lot of things on mobile,
we need to be able to allow brands, for example, to be able to take creative
concepts that they have developed for desktop or even television and things like
that and deploy them seamlessly to mobile. And so, for example, we have a rich
media format called the Lightbox Ad that works on desktop where if you hover over
the ad with your mouse, it expands into kind of this full sort of full screen rich canvas,
while in mobile, obviously, you don't have a mouse for hover over. How do you
enable that, how do you make that ad work seamlessly on mobile with either a tap or
a swipe or something like that, and that should be technology that Google just
handles behind the scenes so that the creatives can actually focus on building
beautiful creatives. So it's a small example, but how to actually deploy creative in aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02

A - Neal Mohanmulti-screen environment is an important thing. Our TrueView video format, a big
chunk of its impressions come in a mobile environment now, so it's a format that
works seamlessly across desktop and mobile.
Having said that, there are unique things in a mobile context that we're – consumers
are in a diﬀerent context and we should be able to take advantage of those as well.
One of my favorite examples is the campaign that we ran with Nike during the World
Cup and we are running another campaign with EA during this year's NFL season,
and it takes into account sort of the real-time aspect of mobile advertising. And so
the idea for the World Cup campaign was anytime something interesting happened
with a Nike-sponsored athlete or team on the ﬁeld in Brazil, would it be possible
within seconds to be able to run creative that capture that sort of concept that was
happening on the ﬁeld on consumers' mobile screens all across the globe. And so
we developed sort of this real-time messaging capability with rich sort of display and
video formats for Nike and the success was pretty phenomenal. These ads, within
minutes of something happening on the ﬁeld in Brazil, ran and they would run across
– they ended up running across nearly 200 countries globally reaching millions of
users. Users could interact with these ads and it was an example of something that
could only happen on a mobile device because users were sitting in a bar on their
couch somewhere and they would immediately kind of see this ad around sort of
one of their favorite players, one of their favorite teams and it really tapped into kind
of a lot of these euphoria and excitement around the World Cup and it worked sort
of brilliantly sort of for Nike to be sort of in the midst of that conversation. Similar
concept that we are doing for EA around the NFL, so that's an example of sort of
capturing something that's unique about mobile vis-à-vis the consumer context and
that our ad solutions need to be able to cater towards, and so you will see more
things like that as well.
And then the ﬁnal piece that I will touch on in terms of making mobile really work for
advertisers is back to what I talked about in the brand space, which is measurement.
How do you actually show the eﬃcacy of this? So in AdWords, many of you may be
familiar for a while now, we have had something called Estimated Total Conversions
and it was ﬁrst rolled out on the search advertising side, we have rolled it out on the
display advertising side recently. And the idea there is conversions don't just happen
on the same device that you have seen an ad they might happen on your desktop
even though you might have seen the ad on a mobile device.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Is there a way that we can actually estimate what that picture of total conversions
looks like so that advertisers can actually truly measure what the ROI of their
campaigns are from one device to the other, maybe mobile is not getting enough
credit because it's the thing that actually drove people to convert but that
conversion was happening on desktop. And so kind of enabling that sort of cross
device measurement capability is something that we have been very focused on and
have rolled out to our advertisers as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-02

Got you.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Kind of a long answer to your question, but I think all of those components are the
things that need to come together that we are focused on to make mobile really
work for our advertisers.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. Now, we are running out of time. So I will pose this one last question. So
what are your priorities going to be over the next 12 months? And when you come
back to the conference next year, what do you want to be telling us that you have
accomplished?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean I think they fall into a lot of the things that we talked about. So as I said,
sort of cracking this brand advertising nut, not just for Google but on behalf of the
industry is a big priority for us, speciﬁcally around things like measuring the eﬃcacy
of those campaigns as I talked about, so that's a big priority and we look to have
results there over the course of the next 12 months. This mobile multi-screen
environment, so sort of tapping into a lot of these more mobile speciﬁc sort of used
cases, another big one that we didn't talk about is app install...
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
...and app reengagements, how do we continue to enable those and continue to
grow? They are a fast-growing part of our business today, how do we make that
continue for advertisers and our app developers. And then the ﬁnal piece is
programmatic has been a rocket ship, how do we continue to enable the growth of
that for the entire industry, advertisers, agencies, but also our 2 million plus publisher
partners.
