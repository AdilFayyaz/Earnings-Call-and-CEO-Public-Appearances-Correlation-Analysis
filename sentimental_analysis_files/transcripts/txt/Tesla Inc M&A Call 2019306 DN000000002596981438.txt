Elon R. MuskI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Dave Arnold, Senior
Director of Communications. Mr. Arnold, you may begin.
{BIO 20757721 <GO>}
Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. You should have all received
a copy of the blog and the links that were just published. If you haven't got those for
any reason, just email us at present at tesla.com and we'll send it over to you. Elon is
going to start the call with some opening remarks, and then we'll go right into Q&A.
Just a reminder, please keep your questions focused on the top of that's been
announced today, we are not going to be answering any oﬀ topic questions on this
call.
Also, this is a press call intended to give you the information you need to write your
articles. This is all in the record, but please do not publish the recording or a
transcripts of this call. Finally, any statements made today relating to our future
business or results are forward-looking statements and actual results could diﬀer
materially due to factors mentioned in our most recent Form 10-K ﬁling with the SEC.
With that, I'll turn it over to Elon.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Hi, everyone, we're incredibly excited to announce that the $35,000 Model 3 is
available at $35,000 before any incentives or gas savings with the range and
equipment as promised, in fact the interior will be slightly better than originally
promised. So, that actually considers to be slightly better than what was originally
intended with the -- that the standard interior. So it's -- that will be 220 miles range,
have all of the crash safety of all the other cars are safest car in the world, lowest
probability injury of any corner of the world, and it will have all the equipment
required to upgrade to autopilot or full self-driving. So, you can buy the $35,000 car
and in the future upgrade and add autopilots or full self-driving. It's just a software
update. So it has the sort of future proof in that sense. And it's an incredible car.
My twitter proﬁle pic is literally the car, you can buy for $35,000. You can actually get
that, and yes, so this is I think something we've been working for towards at Tesla
since we created the company. From the beginning this has been the goal, and it's
an incredible car, and at $35,000, there's still some pretty signiﬁcant consumer tax
credits that can be had. And then of course, the cost of electricity is much less than
the cost of gasoline. So, the cost of operation of the car is much less than the
gasoline car. And I think we're also conﬁdent that, that car insurance will be lower,
but that's something that we're working very hard towards. So that when you look at
total cost of ownership of a Tesla is actually much less than an equivalent gasoline
car at $35,000.
So, there's also some things we've been able to do for existing customers that are
pretty cool, but Tesla is as much a software company as a hardware company, and
we've been able to buy a ﬁrmware improvements, improve the range of the longFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-28

Q - Phil LeBeaurange rear-wheel drive car from 310 miles to 325 miles, this will eﬀect all customers,
including those that all long range cars shipped to-date and new cars, so with
existing and new customers will get a 15 mile range increase from 310 to 325. We've
also been able to improve the peak power output of all cars by approximately 5%.
So you get 5% of peak horsepower improvement across the board, and the Model 3
performance top speed, we've been able to increase to 162 miles an hour, obviously
we recommend doing that in a safe environment or on the Autobahn which is safe.
So that's an extra 7 miles an hour or an extra 10 kilometers an hour. And yes, it's really
an amazing vehicle in fact, that's what I am driving right now as my daily driver is a
Model 3 performance. So and yes, Model 3 ranks number one in consumer reports
on our satisfaction survey by I think pretty decent margin. And I think, yes, we're just
incredibly excited to ﬁnally achieve this goal. It's been insanely diﬃcult. A very
important point I'd like to say is, well, the Standard Plus, which is for a small amount
more you can get basically a whole lot more, like roughly 6% price increase gets you
10% or almost a 10% range increase and out of 6% power increase and mostly way
towards the premium interior.
So I think ﬁrst I'll recommend really getting the Standard Plus, but we have Standard
available as well. And another key point is we're moving all sales online. This is
extremely I think extremely profound worldwide, the only way to buy a Tesla will be
online, and you can buy your car on your phone in about one minute in the US. And
we will make it just as easy to, let's say one minute purchase in other parts of the
world as well. We will still have stores, but they will be converted to kind of galleries
and information centers, so you can go there and learn about Tesla or learn about
electric vehicles and buy some Tesla merchandise, but all sales will be online. So if
you do go to the store, they'll simply show you how to buy the car online. And then
in order to mitigate the need for a test drive, we're extending the return policies that
you can -- on the car for a week and drive for up to a 1,000 miles or 1,600 kilometers
and return the car for a full refund, if you don't like it. We're extremely conﬁdent that
you will like it. So, that's why we're willing to essentially allow somebody to use the
car for free for a week and return it for a full refund, and we're going to do super
easy to get a refunds like one click refund. So, people really should not have any
concern about placing an order or thinking that there's no reversibility. We want to
actually make it incredibly easy to hand the car back and get a refund, so that's the
main thing.

Q - Larry Magid
A - Elon R. MuskHi, Elon. Question for you regarding the pricing on the new vehicle, do you guys
have, I know you said that with the reservation backlog a while ago, couple of
conference calls ago, you guys said, look, we're not going to be discussing that, but
the question here is how much demand do you guys believe is out there, relative to
the reservation list that was initially there?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I mean, I don't know what the demand is, we'll see. I will ﬁnd out. There's obviously
would be speculation -- in terms of speculation with really no basis apart from like I
feel. I think there's probably demand for over 0.5 million Model 3s a year.
And is that based on anything in particular, is it based on hand raisers, is it based on
the reservation list originally, how many people peeled oﬀ the list?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
No. The reservation list is just like -- it was like a -- it's foolish to focus on reservation
list, that's like saying how many pre-orders did you get for a video game, that
doesn't mean anything. So if the video games out, okay, the car's out, what matters is
what is the demand, I don't know what the demand is, but if you're asking for my
consider judgment is for the demand, as I said it's 0.5 million cars a year.
Thank you.
Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Magid with CBS.
{BIO 15888964 <GO>}
Yes. Elon, thanks for taking the call. Couple of questions, you mentioned the range
extension on the long range Model 3, what about the mid range Model 3, and also
you also mentioned that the company put out a release saying that there would be

Did you get my question?
Our next question comes from Matt DeBord with Business Insider.
Hello, gentlemen. Thanks for the call. Congratulations on the $35,000 Model 3. I just
want to ask a question about the online-only sales model, the only thing, I'm curious
about is that going to -- are you anticipating you're going to hit some resistance that
the whole US kind of approach from the franchise car dealer world, which is typically
sort of a post this kind of thing? Thanks.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think this is actually going to online-only is incredibly helpful to us for selling in
anywhere in the US, because in many parts of the US we are unable to sell eﬀectively
because of franchise laws, whereas if the sales concluded online, we now have --
anyone could buy the car anywhere in the United States immediately. So -- this I
think really substantially opens up our ability to sell the cars, and it's 2019, people
also want to buy things online.
Yes. No. For sure. It's just -- I'm just wondering, do you think there's going to be more
intense push back than you've gotten in the past, and ironically you might get more
intense push back on this strategy than you would have when you were -- so we're
trying to do direct sales on kind of a state by state basis, this is sort of like (multiple
speakers).
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I'm sure the franchise dealers will try to franchise deals will try to persists in
some way, but to do this so would be a fundamental restraint of interstate commerce
and valid constitution. So good luck with that.
Alright. Thanks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-28

Hey, how is it going? I was just ﬁrst for all -- I'm just curious if you have any estimate
on when this version will be available beyond the US?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Probably available for ordering in probably three to six months, yes, and then of
course, it takes time to ship the cars -- takes like a month or two in some cases to
transport the cars in California to the new owner in Asia or Europe. So, but
something on the order of three months to six months.
And can you say anything about what's been -- you said the interiors are bit better
than you originally anticipated, I know a lot of people are just shopping oﬀ the
premium interior features when trying to ﬁgure out what the standard interior was,
can you speak a little bit more about what's changed or what's (inaudible) from the
premium?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
There are more racked [ph] parts -- there is no standard headlamp, more sort of just
pressed plastic parts and this interior has more of sort of racked parts that has a
better look and feel, and it's like -- dozens of small components essentially and the
same is really it's not enough toward making it look worse. I think it still looks really
good. I should point out a really big changes that everyone gets the all-glass roof, so
previously the Standard -- the Standard did not have -- it had a metal roof instead of
the sort of the glass roof, which I think for value changes the feel of the car
compared to most other cars.
Yes. I was wondering if that would make sense to keep that streamline the
manufacturing and it's beautiful look. Last question the reservation...

Hi, Elon. I'm curious about the closing of the stores, is this going to result in layoﬀs at
Tesla and if so, are they tied to the layouts you guys already announced earlier this
year?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We will be closing some stores, and there will be some reduction headcount as a
result, there's no question about that. Yes. There's no other way for us to achieve the
same as required to provide this car and be ﬁnancially sustainable. It's -- always
there's some other way, but unfortunately it will entail our reduction in force on the
retail side. No way around it.

Q - Tom Randall
A - Elon R. MuskHi, Elon. Thanks for taking this. I just wondered on the price point issue, and do you
think this is the cheapest car you ever be selling or do you predict that some future
model might go cheaper with this car might be sell for cheaper?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think this is the lowest we could possibly sell this car. We need to do a signiﬁcant
redesign and for the new manufacturing system to have a lower cost car. So this is
deﬁnitely not -- it was a -- it's excruciatingly diﬃcult to make this car for $35,000, and
still be ﬁnancially sustainable. Hence, the unfortunate need to reduce headcount
business note, I wish there were some other way to do it, but we neither, but we're
sort of (inaudible) like provide $35,000 a car and have fewer people or not provide
$35,000 a car. Will there be future models that cost less, yes, but they weren't be
soon, there would be at least two to three years, probably closer to three years.
And what kind of price would you be targeting with this lower price cars?
Not today's topic.
{BIO 20757721 <GO>}
Next question, please.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Randall with Bloomberg.
{BIO 7312874 <GO>}
Hi, Elon. Congrats on reaching this goal. You're pulling a lot of demand levers today,
obviously this is going to open the card to a larger addressable market. Does this
change your production plans at all compared to what you forecast in your earnings
call and your recent tweets like -- has there been a shift in production that allows you
to open this in a larger addressable market?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well. In the earnings call, if you say, if you look at the range of numbers that we
talked about, talked about basically a pretty wide range, because verticals predict
the future. We don't have crystal ball. So it's a 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3's, is
what I said in the earnings call. And then we expect to make somewhere between
70,000 and 100,000 of S and Xs. So the lower bound would be 350 plus 70, and the
upper bound would be 500 plus 100.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-28

Q - Ben Sullins
A - Elon R. MuskThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Coren with Quartz.
{BIO 16890674 <GO>}
Thanks. I was wondering what the biggest changes that were made to the car itself
beyond reducing the battery size to hit this price point, and what were some of the
cost savings that you achieved in the manufacturing or operations?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think we don't want to get too much into the weeds here. It's, however, really
diﬃcult to reduce the cost of the car. Well, the way I've described it to the company
is really getting a cost -- there are 10,000 parts and processes -- 10,000 unique parts
and processes in making the car. So each one basically costs about $3.50 or
thereabouts. And in order to make the car and still have enough left over for R&D
and overhead and that kind of thing we really need to be more like $3 on average
for the 10,000 parts and processes. That means we need to ﬁgure out how to get on
average $0.50 out of those 10,000. And so, I called this A Game of Pennies, it's like a
Game of Thrones, but Pennies.
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Sullins with Teslanomics.
{BIO 17277582 <GO>}
Hey, guys. Thanks so much and congratulations again. One thing that really sparked
my interest here was the ﬁrmware update and how you're able to add range there,
and I think that that's been one of the things we haven't talked a lot about. So, I'm
curious, if you see other updates like this possibly an app store or some other way to
churn the cars themselves into more of a platform with other services you can add
on top of it? Thank you.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well. Yes. We do ﬁnd ways over time. We've done this many times in the past where
we're able to improve the eﬃciency to see if the drive inverter or the motor or we
get a bit more comfortable with what -- how much energy you can extract safely from
the battery pack without causing it long-term harm, and so that -- as we get more
road validation and we're able to ﬁnd optimizations in this ﬁeld, but more complex
[ph], widening the margins and that's -- and then we just update the car and make it
better for free, that's been our philosophy for many years. But we're not planning to
make the car a sort of a big platform at this stage. I mean, maybe, if we have like tens
of millions of cars on the road at some point, then it would make sense to be a
platform, but I think, until you have sort of at least in the tens of millions, it's not
realistically a platform, except in the sense that the car has all of what we (inaudible)
all of the sensors necessary for full self-driving. And so, those upgrades will occur
automatically. And I should perhaps, just levered on sort of, if we broken out the,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-28

Q - Mike Liedtkewhat was previously enhanced autopilot into especially basic autopilot and full self-
driving. So autopilot or just basically autopilot is the car will accelerate and brake
and steer automatically within a lane. And then, the full surprising features are that
the car will navigate on autopilot. So it will automatically take from highway on ramp
to oﬀ ramp and it will switch lanes, change from one highway to another, overtake
slow cars and exit the highway. And that's the feature that anyone who ordered
enhanced autopilot will get, but is now moved into full self-driving. And unless
advanced summon, which also people who have ordered enhanced autopilot will
get advanced summon, but people who now order advanced summon where the
car will ﬁnd you anywhere in the parking lot. That has been move to now been
moved to full self-driving. So this was some features that we need to ﬁnish obviously
in full self-driving, we need the car to be able to recognize traﬃc lights and stop
signs and do turns and navigation on side streets, but that's the main thing that
needs to be ﬁnished in order for the car to take you from your house to your work
with no intervention required. Now, ﬁrst of course, this will need to be supervised by
the drivers -- because it will take us billions of miles to get to the safety level where
driver observation is no longer required. And then we will need to convince
regulators of this. So, there are some steps along the way, but in terms of being
feature complete for full self-driving, as I've said before, we are highly conﬁdent, I
really quite uncertain that we'll be featured complete with full self-driving this year.
But I -- as a risk of delivering the point, we feature complete full self-driving, but you
still need to, the driver will still need to pay attention, because the reliability level will
take longer to address, and then even after we feel we addressed the reliability, we
need regulators to agree that that is -- that driver attention is no longer necessary.
Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander George with Popular
Mechanics.
{BIO 20296610 <GO>}
Hi. Thank you. Can you repeat that detail about the top speed increase and how you
achieve that?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The top speed increase is essentially we'd electronically limited the Model 3
performance to 155 miles in an hours, so it's -- that was not a physical limit, but
electronic limit. The -- after a lot of testing, we now feel we can increase that limit to
by 10 kilometers in an hour or 7 miles in an hour. And that just ends up being RPM
increase in the motors. So, that the two motors just spin faster. And I think they're
going somewhere in order of 19,000 RPM.

whether you expect to make money here in the ﬁrst quarter potentially to continue
to make money?

Given that there is just a lot happening in Q1. And we're taking a lot of sort of a lot of
one-time charges and there's a lot of challenges getting cars to China and Europe.
We do not expect to be proﬁtable in Q1, but we do think that proﬁtability in Q2 is
likely.
Thank you. Our next question is from Kirsten Korosec with TechCrunch.
Hi, Elon. Thanks for taking my question. I'd a question about the full self-driving
capability. Two parts; one, is it a problem that you're calling this full self-driving
capability when you're still going to require the driver to take control or be paying
attention. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's coming
maybe later this year, which is this -- looks like some of these capabilities rolling out
to being in an urban city streets unlike highway?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I think we're very clear with the -- when you buy the car what is meant by full
self-driving, it means its feature complete, but feature complete requiring a
supervision, and then as we get more -- we really need billions of miles if not maybe
10 billion sort of miles or -- on that order collectively from the ﬂeet than (inaudible) in
our opinion probably at that point supervision is not required, but that will still be up
to regulators to agree. So we're just very clear like there's really three steps that's
giving feature complete full self-driving, but requiring supervision, feature complete
but not requiring supervision, and feature complete not requiring supervision and
regulators agree.

Q - Christian Prenzler
A - Elon R. MuskIt is a hard decision, but I think it's the right decision for the future, and I think
ultimately this will be a very strong competitive strength of Tesla, because we do not
have franchise dealers. So I think this is -- this will be a fundamental long-term
competitive advantage of Tesla that maybe only a startup -- only a startup could
replicate, but no one who has sold franchises could replicate. I think this was an
extremely important strategic decision and deﬁnitely the right one.

I think we're closer to releasing full self-driving features. So we're just weren't close
enough I thought at that time, and it was creating too much confusion, but now really
with the release on navigate an autopilot for highways, which is already released in
the US and parts of Europe and will soon go worldwide and with the imminent
release of advance summon and in the fact that I'm driving right now the
development version of autopilot, and it works extremely well in terms of
recognizing traﬃc lights and stop signs and is now starting to make turns eﬀectively
in complex urban environments. So, I'm conﬁdent enough at this point to say -- to
sell full self-driving. And yes, I think it's looking really good like the features I'm
talking about I'm driving in development mode right now.
Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Prenzler with Teslarati.
Hi, Elon. Thanks for taking the call. My question is surrounding kind of how these
new lower option low cost cars kind of will ﬁt into the production queue and now
you'll kind of ﬁt that in with all the international orders and high priced orders as
well?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, there's going to be a blend of vehicles in production. It's a mixture of
high price and low priced -- I mean I can't -- it's really getting into the weeds to
talking about exact percentages here, but there will obviously be a mixture of trims
that are made. Something that I should -- I forget to mention, we're also reducing the
Model S and Model X prices and transitioning to online-only. It eﬀectively reduces
our costs by about 5% maybe 6%, and so we've applied that to S&X as well as to
Model 3. So the S&X is also more aﬀordable.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-28

Good afternoon. What is that Tesla's proﬁt margin on each and every $35,000 Model
3 sold?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. We're not going to answer questions like that. Next question?

Next question?
Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Evarts with Green Car Reports.
Hi. I was just wondering if somebody wanted to order a short range base Model 3
this evening. How long you'd expect that it would take at this point for them to get
it?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well. The priority is for longtime reservation holders, so we ﬁrst need to assess how
many of the long-term reservation holders want $35,000 car. So, it really depends on
that and obviously this news has been embargoed until now, so we ﬁrst need to
assess how many of the reservation holders wish to buy that car. They will get priority
and then it will be new orders. But I should say that it is very likely that someone who
orders will get the car in the US by the end of June, let's say -- before the next tax
credit cliﬀ.
Thank you. And our ﬁnal question comes from Gary Gastelu with Fox News.
Elon, are the battery packs signiﬁcantly reduced with cells or is this more of a
software restriction and then also the autopilot and self-driving hardware, is this the
ﬁnal version or might these require an update down the road?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The Standard range pack has signiﬁcantly fewer cells, the long range pack has on
the order of 50% more cells as the range suggests. The -- it's not just a softwareFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-28

Operatorrestriction otherwise our materials cost would be too high. Sorry, what was the other
question?
{BIO 20757721 <GO>}
Autopilot.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The only upgrade that's sort of happening kind of in real time is the hardware three
autopilot computer, but this is like this is essentially invisible to the user, so yes, the
features that require the hardware three autopilot.
And that was our ﬁnal question.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Alright. Thank you. Thanks, everyone.
