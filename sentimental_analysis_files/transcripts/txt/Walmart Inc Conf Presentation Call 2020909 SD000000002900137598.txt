Presentation
Good morning, everyone. Thank you, again for joining us today at the Goldman
Sachs Global Retailing Conference.
It's my pleasure today to introduce Brett Biggs, Chief Financial Oﬃcer of Walmart,
and he's here to have a ﬁreside chat with us.
Walmart reported a solid comp with Walmart U.S. comps at plus 9.3% last quarter.
Our positive thesis on Walmart is based on the defensiveness of the business
beneﬁting from a long-tail food-at-home trend, new customer acquisition, market
share opportunity due to consolidation, newer initiatives like Walmart+ and the
company's proven ability to generate EBIT dollar growth in a steady-state
environment.
As I mentioned, we're here with Brett Biggs. Prior to his current role, he held the
roles of Chief Financial Oﬃcer for Walmart International, Walmart U.S. and Sam's
Club.
Before we get started, I just have to point to the safe harbor slide that you'll see on
the webcast.
With that, I think we can get started.
Brett, thank you for joining us today.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Kate. Appreciate it.
Questions And AnswersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 2 of 19A - Brett BiggsI thought we could start oﬀ with just talking about the current environment since it
has been so unusual and unprecedented. And just given Walmart's size and the
complexities, we wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you navigated the
past six months for your business, what some of the bigger challenges may have
been and maybe what you might do diﬀerently in hindsight.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It's been amazing 6.5 months. I was thinking back even this morning to our
Analyst Day in New York in mid-February.
At that time, I was looking through our script and we mentioned coronavirus one
time in that script.
To think about where we've come since then has been pretty incredible.
And what our associates have done is the ﬁrst thing I would mention, going from
fairly normal-type store environment to multiples of volume over a period of weeks
and months, particularly in March, April, May, with food volume and watching them
respond.
The caring that they showed customers, they showed each other, it's not surprising,
but it's always still amazing to see when I've been here 20 years with the company.
So what they've done and our ability then to give back in bonuses and other things
has been something -- those were fairly easy decisions to do that for associates, and
that's certainly something we would do all over again if we went through this again.
I -- the thing I think that is looking at again is just how quickly this company moves. A
lot of times, you think about a big company and it's slow to move, and that's not
what this company is. The ability to ramp up like we did in food in the stores and in
the clubs and distribution centers.
Then with stimulus that came in the U.S. in mid-April, all of a sudden, we became a
big GM business.
We've got a really big GM business, but even a bigger GM business and watching
the stores and clubs go through that and producing really good results at the same
time through all of this.
There's how you look back and there are so many things that -- and you could look
back and say we could have done diﬀerently.
We came in from a really lean inventory position into this. Who would have known
you're going to enter into a pandemic where probably having a little more inventory
would have been helpful, and we've been playing catch-up a little bit through the
Second Quarter and some into the Third Quarter.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 19A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett Biggs
A - Katharine McShaneBut I like how we were running inventory prior to that. I think we were in a really
good position from -- for a normal-type environment, which certainly this wasn't.
But we scaled up very quickly with the number of stores, that we could ship from
store, that was a big one.
We went from just two handfuls of ship-from-stores to thousands within a period of
weeks.
Some of those, now we'll make permanent. That will be a permanent part of what we
do going forward, shipping from stores in certain locations.
So I'm so pleased with how the business responded, the work that we did. Kate, you
were in the middle ﬁve years ago when we said we've got to invest in wages, we've
got to invest in e-commerce, we've got to invest in technology. That all worked and it
was a big part of how we were able to serve customers over the last several months.
So on that same note then in terms of just the period of investment you just went
through and how it kind of almost prepared you for what was to come, do you think
these last six months has had any impact on your longer-term plans?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. There's nothing that these last six months won't impact in some way, learnings
that we have or how we've seen the customer evolve. What it has done really is just
strengthen our belief in our current strategy.
The omnichannel strategy in building this ecosystem for a longer-term view of what
the company is going to be, it's strengthened that. I mean there are certain things
we're going to tweak coming out of this, but being an omnichannel retailer is the
right strategy.
It's really paid oﬀ during this time. It's allowed us to serve customers in all diﬀerent
kinds of ways that maybe we wouldn't have been able to as well three, four, ﬁve
years ago.
So I don't see any major shifts in strategy coming out of this, but I see us doubling
down in some areas that we knew were the right direction, but that the last few
months have accelerated trends -- over a period of months have taken trends that
would have taken years to get there.
And speaking of that, just going -- looking into Q2, there were a number of factors
that helped drive really strong sales not only in Q2, but Q1 as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 19A - Brett Biggs
A - Katharine McShaneBut when it comes to the sales deceleration that you mentioned you saw in July and
August, I wondered if you could walk us through some of the factors. I know you
ﬂagged stimulus, but do you think that's one of the bigger drivers?
Or did in-stocks become more or less of an issue as we got closer to July and
August?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Some of both. Stimulus, I think there's several things going on. Stimulus was a
big impact. Starting in mid-April, May, June, a lot of dollars ﬂowing through the
economy. So I think we were honest with ourselves and honest with investors that,
that certainly was something that beneﬁted us in the Second Quarter.
We also dollars freed up from people who were typically taking vacations and doing
-- spending money in other ways during the summer that I think found its way into
general merchandise categories, bicycles, camping, home improvement, all of that
dollars somebody got somewhere else came into those categories. You saw that with
results of other retailers as well, not just Walmart.
Inventory, there were categories where in some of the supply chain, some of it was
our ability just to get inventory in quick enough. You couldn't ﬁnd bicycles in the
middle of summer, not just Walmart, in a lot of places, things like that. Who could
have expected the type of impact you'd see on the category like bicycles?
And then as we talked about, back-to-school was a little slow to start.
Schools were going back later, some weren't starting at all, some students were
going back remote.
So that really made the back-to-school season choppy. It's going to take longer to
work its way through than we typically would see. So it's all of those things that kind
of got us back into a little more of a norm -- what I'd call a normalized comp range.
Food is -- food and consumables have remained consistent really throughout the
period. They were huge, obviously, March, April, ﬁrst part of May.
But food has been just a solid, steady business throughout the entire time, really
good foundation for us.
That's great. I know Doug has said in the past that if he had to thank his
predecessors for anything, it was sticking with food.
That's certainly the case more recently, too.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 19A - Brett BiggsBut probably where we're getting the most questions right now when it comes to
Walmart's business is on grocery. So when we get the questions, investors are trying
to understand the puts and takes of the Second Quarter and the environment we're
in. So when you think about the grocery performance versus your peers, how do you
think your positioning in grocery maybe helped or hurt, particularly during Q2?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, obviously, market share and measurements like that are things that we
watch all the time and are very, very focused on. It's really noisy right now and there's
a number of things.
I don't want things coming across as excuses, but there are reasons we think why it
looks so noisy.
One would be, we've kept prices down during this period of time.
Typically, you see a lot of promotions in the summer from competitors and you
didn't see that as much and actually, you saw prices going back up a little bit.
So from a dollar market share perspective, that has a fairly good impact.
We took operating hours down more quickly than some competitors and actually
took longer to take them back up.
We've just recently gone back to 10:00 closing. In our supercenters, we've gone to
8:30. There's a lot of business that gets down between 8:30 and 10:00 at night.
So bringing operating hours back to not 24 hours, but back to something that's a
little more normal we think will have a positive impact on our business.
There's a lot of things like that, that I think makes reading market share really diﬃcult
right now.
We're still trying to.
We know we took share in some general merchandise categories.
We beneﬁted some from some retailers that were closed, and we know that.
But over time, I still feel so good about our food and consumables business. I mean
if you look at even the Second Quarter, we grew the food business by $3 billion,
amazing amount of growth. In-stocks were impactful.
We ran -- as we talked about, we ran pretty lean coming in.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 19A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett Biggs
A - Katharine McShaneSo I think we got hit harder earlier by customers knowing they could ﬁnd everything
they wanted inside a Walmart store.
So I think we got hit harder earlier, and it was tougher for us to catch back up,
starting to catch back up now.
So overall, I just feel really good about the business.
I think we'll continue to grow share over time.
But it's a noisy read and probably will be for a while.
And could you maybe give us your view on how you're thinking about food-at-home
trends for the longer term?
That's a big question that we get, too. Just as things open up, how much can food-at-
home continue to outpace maybe the average of what we've seen in the last couple
of years?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think it will depend on area. You're seeing -- I mean you're seeing more people
-- for instance, here in Arkansas, you're seeing more people go out to eat certainly
than they were a month ago.
We want to see those restaurants and small businesses reopen. It's good for the
economy, it's good for employment, good for those communities. So we're glad to
see that happening.
There'll be some areas, maybe it's in New York that are going to be a little slower
because of how impactful the virus was in an area like that.
So we beneﬁted from that trend. And likely, that trend will stay for quite a while.
There'll be some folks that won't feel comfortable going back out to restaurants
maybe for quite a while. So we'll beneﬁt from that, certainly, but I think not to the
level probably we would have seen over the last four to six months as people get a
little more comfortable going out.
Okay. And you mentioned, again, just in terms of where there might have been a
diﬀerence in performance is that you continue to invest in price throughout the ﬁrst
half and maybe some of your competitors didn't. So moving into the second half,
and it's just something that we saw in one of our presentations this morning is that
we're hearing and seeing maybe grocers are stepping up back their priceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 19A - Brett Biggsinvestments from where they were. So how do you think about price gaps now going
forward?
And can we expect maybe even more price investment?
Or are you comfortable with the price gap narrowing a little bit, again, based on this
current environment?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes.
We've been really aggressive, and we held -- as you said, we held pretty steady in
the ﬁrst half of the year. Speciﬁcally talking about food and consumables, we -- price
gaps have widened for sure.
We have a pretty good idea where we want price gaps, and it's geography-based
and it's competitor-based.
So it's not just a broad peanut better spread.
We know where we want those to be.
And so there's -- I think there's plenty of room for us to do what's right for the
customer or what we want to do long term for the customer and still do -- conduct
business in a way that's shareholder-friendly.
That's the balance that we want to try to strike obviously starting with the customer.
As we look forward, we'll still invest in price. That's what we do. It's -- I think for us,
just having a steady kind of constant downward pressure on prices is what we want.
We'll be investing a little more in general merchandise than we have in the past.
We talked about for the last few years, we've spent almost all of the price investment
on food and consumables, and we'll be more thoughtful on general merchandise.
But we're always going to be the price leader. I think there's -- if you look at the last
few months, there's probably a little bit of an argument that can be made that
people got a little less price-conscious, which is somewhat counterintuitive.
But with all the stimulus dollars that were going through the economy, I think they
got a little less price-conscious, maybe a little more convenience focused.
We have that convenience factor. Price is going to matter forever as far as I believe.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 19A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett BiggsSo I feel good about our position.
Okay. If maybe we can pivot now to your e-commerce strategy, and there are many
questions that we can ask here.
But I think starting with the general merchandise business on -- with e-commerce. So
a big focus has been growing breadth and depths of your SKUs to push into higher-
margin categories like apparel and home.
But the way you're pursuing these goals looks like maybe it's changing a little.
We've seen some brand divestitures over the past year and a few partnership
announcements that complement the marketplace. So could you maybe just
contextualize -- ﬁrst of all, is that the right way to think about it, you're still pursuing
the same strategy but maybe in a slightly diﬀerent way?
And talk to us about
where you are currently and how you're thinking about it.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Great question. The framework of what we're doing, the framework of the
strategy hasn't changed.
We're -- we want to get more brands on to the side.
That could be ﬁrst party, it could be third party. And you've seen some things that
were -- as you mentioned, we're doing through marketplace.
We have divested some things that we acquired over the last few years and in some
cases, maybe something that felt like a better ﬁt three years ago than it felt today.
But in certain cases, we've gotten the value we want out of those brands and feel like
maybe there's just a better owner this period of time. So as the Shoes.com be -- we
had a -- we wanted to get more traction in shoes and -- shoe brands onto our site.
We've developed that.
We've developed that in our online and in stores, and that helped that shoe category
tremendously.
So the other thing I think you're seeing with us, Kate, is we're just going to make
decisions more quickly. If something ﬁt the strategy two or three years ago and nowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 19A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett Biggsit just doesn't ﬁt quite as well and we want to reallocate resources, we do that way
more quickly than we used to, much more agile with that. So the framework of the
strategy has not changed at all.
We want to get more brands on site.
We want to have a longer tail.
We're focused on growth and proﬁtability of that e-commerce business, and you're
seeing us take steps in both of those directions.
Okay. That's helpful.
I know, again, pushing towards the more -- the higher-margin categories and general
merchandise will help with the overall proﬁtability. In Q2, you mentioned that e-com
losses were signiﬁcantly lower.
We were just wondering, what is driving that signiﬁcantly lower e-commerce losses?
Is it the sales, just the strength in sales?
Or is there some cost control within that too that's helping?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. There's a little bit of everything.
We were -- we feel good about the direction of the proﬁtability on e-commerce for
several quarters now.
We said coming into the year, we thought losses would be lower. So we felt good
about what we were seeing.
It's in several categories.
One is just top line.
We basically doubled the size of the business in the Second Quarter. That helps a lot
of things when you get sales growth like that. The ﬁxed cost expense. So not only we
delevered the ﬁxed costs, but the ﬁxed costs, the rate of ﬁxed costs are declining
some the rate of growth.
That's what you would expect as the business matures a little bit.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 19A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett BiggsThe variable cost to fulﬁll has been getting better every quarter, every year. The big
one is contribution proﬁt margin. So what are we making on every product that we
sell?
And that has gotten better as we've gotten bigger in areas like home and apparel,
which have higher-margin structures. So as that number -- as that margin gets better,
the more you sell, the better it is, which is obviously what you want.
What we were able to see in the Second Quarter, which was really encouraging, is all
the things we've been working on, we saw in the First Quarter as well.
But the Second Quarter, all the things we've been working on and how that business
model works, we saw it. You could really see it over the last couple of quarters.
No. It doesn't take a 97% growth for that business to work.
But we saw all those elements really play out together, and it was really encouraging
to see, exciting.
In the same vein, we've seen some changes with regards to how you're thinking
about getting your product to customers. So I think you mentioned it in one of your
earlier questions that -- or one of your earlier answers in response to my questions
that you're looking towards the store, you're shipping from the store more than you
have before.
This again seems like a change from the DC strategy, which seemed more prevalent.
So can you talk a little bit about the decision to leverage the stores more, how it's
working?
And is it necessitated?
Was this always something you were thinking you would go to?
Is this one of these examples of being nimble?
Or is it more a result of what has happened in the last six months?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Some of both. It's hard to diﬀerentiate anymore almost what caused what. Some
of it was necessity in six months of just getting product to customer more quickly.
So there was some necessity to that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 19A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett Biggs
A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett BiggsBut we've always talked about these stores and how they could be many fulﬁllment
centers, and we always thought that could be part of what we do longer term.
There's a few hundred stores that we're going to make that permanent. That, it
worked really well.
The ability to get items to customers in a hurry, express delivery, those are done out
of the stores.
So I think it will be a big part of our strategy going forward. Fulﬁllment centers are
always going to be a big part of that strategy, the distribution centers that we've
always had. So you'll see us continue to expand supply chain and fulﬁllment centers,
distribution centers.
But that store is a really unique asset, and it's something that our competitors don't
have, for the most part, our big competitors.
And is there something unique about the stores that you have selected to do more
fulﬁllment from?
Are they located in more denser populated areas?
Or is it kind of the opposite, it's where a store maybe could have used or beneﬁted
from leveraging the capacity that was available?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It would be some of both.
Okay.
Then going to pickup versus delivery.
We're hearing and seeing from all of our retailers now curbside pickup, which, of
course, you guys have had, well, drive up for a long time.
But I -- the thing that's so exciting about pickup or curbside of course is that it is less
of a headwind I think to your costs. So how do you balance all of the diﬀerent things
that you're testing from a delivery standpoint, a digital fulﬁllment standpoint with the
economics of pickup versus delivery?
How do you balance that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 12 of 19A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett BiggsYes. I mean outside of membership, which we -- remember, Walmart+, we've just
done. I mean deliveries had a fee attached to it, so that helps oﬀset that cost. So it
really makes it somewhat agnostic to someone picking it up in store. The things
diﬀerentiated us picking up in-store or curbside is ours is free. Most of our
competitors are not free.
That's a big diﬀerentiator for our service, we believe.
It's a way to continue to get people into our ecosystem, customers in our ecosystem,
which is what we want longer term.
But we -- the idea is to be there in every occasion that customer wants to shop,
deliver to home, pick it up.
We were testing going into people's refrigerators. I still think that will be something
that we do longer term.
But we want to be there.
Then for the management team, we spend a lot of time making decisions and
ensuring that we can do it in a way that's attractive to our shareholders and that we
can keep growing operating proﬁt.
That's what I spend a lot of my time on is thinking through the various pieces and
how they come together.
The moves you were talking about earlier, ﬁnding things that we just don't want to
focus on anymore and just taking those oﬀ the table, we're a lot quicker to do that.
Okay. That's helpful. When it comes to pickup versus delivery, I would imagine the
customer characteristics are diﬀerent. Is there a way to leverage that information to
make yourselves more eﬃcient I guess in either way, either capacity?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Sure. I mean we're -- as you know, we collect a lot of data and looking at how
customers shop.
The delivery is still fairly new. It's something that we're still learning.
We're going to learn a lot more now with Walmart+, as we've rolled that out more
broadly, about what that delivery customer looks like and what they're looking for,
and are there ways to get them to interact more in our ecosystem. That's what we
want.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 13 of 19A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett Biggs
A - Katharine McShaneWe want them buying general merchandise from us.
We want them coming to the stores.
We want them shopping online. So we're excited about Walmart+ for a lot of
reasons, but one is that we're just going to learn a lot more about the customer.
And is there anything more to discuss with regards to Walmart+ today that you
haven't already revealed or mentioned?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes.
We're excited about it. It's a week from launch. It's something that we've been
thinking about for quite a while.
We've had a membership program, Sam's Club, for a long, long time.
So we're excited about it.
We wanted to ﬁnd the right time and the right way to launch and felt like the three
main services, delivery and fuel discounts and Scan & Go, that it was a fulﬁlling
enough oﬀer to go ahead and go out and particularly, the price point that we're at.
Over time, you'll see us add more to it.
We'll learn.
We'll -- but the idea again is to just to get people into our ecosystem to have to think
about Walmart, be top of mind as they go through the list in their head of where
they can get something.
We want to be number one on that list.
Okay. If I could switch subjects now to wages just because, again, the last six months
has been a big change with regards to that.
But when we think about the bonuses and the incentives related to COVID, do you
have any concerns that it might be diﬃcult to pull some of that back, especially if
other retailers' policies or wages are more sticky?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 14 of 19A - Brett Biggs
A - Katharine McShane{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Wages, obviously, for any retailer, it's a big part of the cost investment of doing
business, so we spend a lot of time on that.
It's really -- it's a very geographic discussion as well.
Diﬀerent geographies, obviously, you have diﬀerent types of wage structures. When
you look at our total compensation structure now for full-time hourly associate, when
you include beneﬁts, we're almost at $20 an hour. So just looking at start rate is not
the entire way to analyze that. You've got to look at the beneﬁts. You've got to look at
the total compensation. You've got to look at how many people get promoted into
management jobs, which is signiﬁcant for us.
We want to be -- start people -- a place where people can start their careers and
have a full career. You've -- so you've got to look at the whole picture I think when
you're talking about wages.
That's how an associate is going to go through it in their mind as well.
We've got to be competitive.
We want the best associates.
We want to retain associates.
So we've got to be competitive. It's going to be an interesting dynamic with the
economy I think over the next six to nine months and what happens from an
economic standpoint.
But so happy the bonuses that we were able to give associates over this period of
time, and we were generating additional cash ﬂow, obviously, as you've seen in our
numbers, and we wanted to make sure that our associates shared in that.
Okay.
I just really have two last questions from myself, and then I can look towards the
audience for their questions, but it has to do with holiday. The holidays last year were
a little choppy because there was a shorter season and there were softer holiday-
heavy categories. To the extent that you can, how are you approaching planning for
the holidays this year given the dynamic of last year and of course this year?
And are there any categories you're leaning into that maybe you wouldn't have
expected six months ago for holiday?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 15 of 19A - Brett Biggs
A - Katharine McShane
A - Brett Biggs{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It's -- that's -- there's a lot in that question.
All we've announced at this point is that we're going to be closing Thanksgiving Day,
which is something that we're glad to do with our associates, and we'll be
announcing more as the holidays get closer. From a competitive standpoint, we want
to maintain optionality.
Our merchants and operators are really good at ensuring that we can make
decisions close to the time. It's -- in the pre-COVID days, 2.5 months felt like a long
time until the -- or felt like it was quick for the holidays. Now it feels like 2.5 months is
a long time until the holidays. So we'll maintain optionality, and we'll be really
ﬂexible going into the holidays.
I do think people -- my instinct, I'm not the chief merchant of the company, but I
think people, what you've seen lately is they want to take care of their homes. My
guess is you see that going in the holidays as well. You're going to see people
they're going to want to decorate their homes and try to make the holidays feel
really special.
So I would expect categories like that to do really well.
Our merchants are great at thinking through all the implications of what do people
buy when there is an economic crisis before. This is really diﬀerent than that.
But there's a lot of history that the merchants have and are able to make those
decisions.
But it's just -- I think the holiday season will probably be a little longer, probably a
little more spread out. For most retailers, that's what I would expect at this point.
When it comes to the promotional environment, it seems like you have a bifurcation.
On the one hand, you have some retailers that are probably going to be pretty
competitive to make up for lost time and closed doors or whatever it might be.
But on the other hand, inventory is pretty tight in quite a few categories. So from a
promotional environment standpoint, how would you maybe predict that plays out?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Every holiday is so diﬀerent from a promotional standpoint. And like you said,
inventory is tight in some categories. There'll be retailers that aren't as good in
ﬁnancial condition going into the holidays, and that might impact how they promote,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09

see it play out. Again, I think we'll be ready for any type of competitive environment
that we see.
I expect this that relatively, we'll have a good holiday season and we'll be what our
customers need over that period of time.
And then my last question around holiday is a few of the major players are
introducing shipping rate increases for the holidays. You guys have been very good
at oﬀsetting costs. You've proven that over the last few years.
But is there anything you can do to help oﬀset some of these higher shipping costs
that you could see?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes.
We had some increased costs like 18 months ago or so as capacity got tight.
It impacts us but it doesn't impact us as much as our competitors because of our
dedicated ﬂeet that we have. That's a big advantage in situations like that. E-
commerce is a little diﬀerent with airfreight and things like that.
But again, we have -- we've said this before, we have so many levers that we can pull
as a company from a cost perspective, and we've been very focused on our costs, as
you know, our cost structure. So I feel like we'll be able to manage through pretty
much any scenario.
Okay. In these last couple of minutes, we have some questions from the audience.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Great.
I guess the ﬁrst question I'll ask is, what levers is Walmart going to pull in order to
grab customers from Amazon Prime and break their Prime habit?
Isn't it important short term to subsidize conversion more aggressively to build out
Walmart+?

A - Katharine McShaneYes. And Amazon Prime is a -- and membership services like that have become very
popular in the last several years, and customers have gotten used to memberships
and another reason why we thought this was the right time to do that. Again, it's
giving customers everything they need.
One big advantage we have over most competitors is that if you want to interact in
an e-commerce world, we have a really big e-commerce business not just in the U.S.,
but globally. You want to be in stores, we have the largest store base in the world. If
you want to order online, pick up in stores, we've got that for you, too. If you want
delivery, we've got that for you, too. There's really no competitor that's able to fulﬁll
all of these customer needs and customer shopping behavior.
We can do all of that. So we're in a really good position.
And now there's areas that we're just going to lean into and ensure that we can
make that customer happy that they chose that Walmart membership.
The $98 is also attractive. It's very attractive versus other things out in the market. So I
think when you put all that together, it's really attractive I think for a customer over --
and time will tell how we -- how we're able to leverage that membership to our
beneﬁt.
Okay. Another question focuses on holiday but speciﬁcally on toys. People are
wondering if there is going to be any pent-up demand in that category because toys
has been pretty strong the last two quarters.
Are there supply chain constraints that you're seeing in toys speciﬁcally?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It'll be diﬀerent. It's like everything you get into on supply constraints, it gets
really detailed.
As to types of toys and other types of things, electronics, gaming, all that has been
very, very popular during the pandemic, but there seems to be no end to the desire
for gaming and electronics. So that will probably remain strong over the holidays.
People have bought a lot of board games and other things like that, but they
continue to buy items in that category. There'll be some supply constraints and
diﬀerent pockets of toys, but it won't be -- we don't think it will be broad-based.
Okay.
Then the last question I'm going to ask and we can wrap it up is just, how you're
thinking about the evolution of your store footprint as you expand your e-commerce
oﬀering?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-09

Walmart+ and the number of SKUs you're keeping at each store?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Each store will be a little bit diﬀerent. E-commerce will penetrate more in some
geographical areas than it will in others.
We'll have additional space in some stores, which is -- over time, which is ﬁne
because we'll have more pickup, we'll need more back-end space, we'll have more
services in stores as we look to expand in health care and ﬁnancial services. So the
store footprint is going to continue to be a great asset for us. I don't anticipate us
adding a lot more stores, particularly in the U.S.
We're still growing stores, some in China and Mexico and some developing markets
like that.
But I don't expect the footprint to expand in the U.S. I think we, for the most part,
have a really good coverage of what we need for customers.
Okay. Great.
Well, with that, we'll wrap it up. Thank you, so much for joining us, Brett.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Thank you. Yes. Good to see you.
Good to see you, too. Have a good rest of the day.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Maybe in person someday.
Hopefully. Fingers crossed.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Good to see you.
