Presentation
Good afternoon. My name is Shawntay. And I will be your conference operator
today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Company
conference call.
(Operator Instructions)
Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your call.
{BIO 2134543 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor
Relations for Starbucks Coﬀee Company. Joining me on the call today are Howard
Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; Troy Alstead, CFO and Group President; and
John Culver, Group President of China/Asia Paciﬁc, Channel Development and
Emerging Brands.
This 30-minute conference call will include forward-looking statements which are
subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to diﬀer
materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in
conjunction with cautionary statements in yesterday's release announcing the
Starbucks-Kraft litigation decision and the risk factor discussions in our ﬁlings with
the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13

With that, let me turn the call over to Howard.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Thank you, JoAnn. Good morning. And thank you all for joining us. Yesterday, we
received a decision from the arbitrator in the Kraft dispute, which we strongly
disagree. But given the size of the award, we thought it would be helpful to provide
you with some context and transparency.
While we are all disappointed by the conclusions reached by the arbitrator,
regaining full operating control of our packaged-coﬀee business was, without
question, the right strategic decision for Starbucks, our brand. And our shareholders.
Since taking direct control of the business, we have changed the trajectory of our
CPG segment and our global strategy; developed an entire pipeline of innovation;
deepened our relationships with the trades; and signiﬁcantly grown revenue and
proﬁt, with more premium positioning down the aisle.
We have also built a leading and growing position in premium single cup -- an
opportunity that was not available to us under the Kraft agreement -- the fastest
growing segment in at-home coﬀee. As we reported on last month's earnings call,
Starbucks today is ﬁring on all cylinders, with record operational and client ﬁnancial
performance in both FY12 and the year that just ended in FY13.
And we are literally in the very nascent stages of building a multi-billion-dollar global
consumer package business. Having gained full operating control, we now have the
ﬂexibility and the freedom to control our own destiny and, most importantly,
preserve and enhance the Starbucks global business and brand around the world.
It is diﬃcult when a decision like this goes against you. But let's just take a look at
this. It is a one-time charge in a single moment in time. And now it is behind us. Our
plans, capabilities. And aspirations are well beyond where Kraft could've possibly
taken this business. We are moving forward and not in the least looking back.
Now I will turn the call over to Troy.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thank you, Howard. Earlier this morning we ﬁled a Form 8-K, which includes an
updated P&L reﬂecting the impact of the litigation expense in Q4 and FY13. The $2.2-
billion ruling, plus approximately $557 million interest expense and attorney’s fees,
which includes projected interest through the payment date, is recorded as an
operating expense as part of our unallocated corporate expenses.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 12John CulverFull ﬁnancial statement impact, including the balance sheet and statement cash
ﬂows, will be available in Starbucks annual report on Form 10-K for FY13, which will
be ﬁled later this month. Throughout FY14, as we report our quarterly results, we will
include a comparison of FY14 GAAP results with FY13 non-GAAP results, excluding
the impact of this litigation expense.
As we have discussed since the arbitration process got underway, Starbucks has
adequate liquidity to fund the payment, both in the form of cash on hand and our
anticipated issuance of approximately $750 million in additional debt during the next
three months. Note that the ﬁnancial impact of this litigation does not change our
strong earnings target for FY14. And we remain committed to delivering earnings in
the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, consistent with the target range we provided
on our recent Fourth Quarter earnings call.
Also note that Starbucks remains in a very healthy ﬁnancial position with strong cash
ﬂow generation. We will continue to grow our cash return to shareholders in 2014
and beyond by increasing, over time, both dividends and share repurchases.
Over the course of our relationship with Kraft, which began in 1998 for the
distribution, marketing, advertising and promotion of Starbucks packaged coﬀee, we
became increasingly dissatisﬁed with both the trajectory of the business and the way
in which the Starbucks brand was being positioned down the aisle. Kraft failed to
deliver on their responsibilities to our brand under the agreement. And the
performance of the business suﬀered and deteriorated as a result.
We attempted to work with Kraft management to resolve the issues. But to no avail,
at which point we determined that it would be within our right. And in the best
interest of our business and our shareholders, to terminate the agreement. Our
objective in doing so was clear.
By bringing the packaged coﬀee business in house, we could shore up our market
share, improve the growth trajectory of the business, bolster our brand positioning.
And build a robust leading position in the fast-growing premium single-serve
segment. Details of the agreement termination and arbitration process can be found
in our prior public disclosures. We're looking forward to putting this matter behind
us and further developing our global channel development business.
I will now ask John Culver to make a few remarks before we open the call up for
good[ph] questions.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Thank you, Troy. As Troy said, we are pleased to have this behind us. Taking direct
control of this business has energized the accelerated growth of Channel
Development and enabled us to build a very strong, direct-selling relationship with
retailers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Operator
Q - Jeﬀrey BernsteinMore importantly, beyond accelerating growth, this move has also allowed us to
further elevate and diﬀerentiate our brand while enhancing our positioning and
increasing our presence down the aisle. Over the past couple of years, we have built
very strong capabilities and invested in the talent needed to win and position us for
future success. And since 2011, our business results clearly demonstrate the beneﬁts
of the sharpened focus and strong execution of our partners throughout the
business.
Our innovation pipeline is now the strongest it has ever been. And we have the
leading market share of premium packaged coﬀee down the aisle. In FY13, Channel
Development reached $1.4 billion in revenue. Adding to a strong revenue base is
earnings momentum, with proﬁtability growing 47% over the last two years.
At the same time, industry-wide coﬀee category sales have grown 24% since 2011,
while Starbucks at-home coﬀee sales have grown 62%. As to premium single cup, in
two short years we have grown our dollar share to 18.4%, including the sale of more
than 1 billion K cups and 200 million sticks of VIA.
Our accomplishments to date, combined with our continued market-leading
innovation, including the early and quantitative success of our stars-down-the-aisle
loyalty program and Starbucks' signature aisle merchandising initiative, have made
our Channel Development segment a meaningful contributor to Starbucks' record
results and a key enabler of the strategic ﬂywheel we discussed in our Q4 earnings
call. Channel Development is now the Company's second-largest operating
segment. And we are well on our way to capturing the very large, global-growth
opportunity in front of us and building a multi-billion-dollar business.
In closing, the unique combination of value, rewards. And our premium positioning
will allow us to continue to build and grow our leadership in premium packaged and
single-serve coﬀee. Regaining full operating control of our packaged-coﬀee
business has positioned us to take full advantage of the large and growing
opportunity we have within our Channel Development business. And we are fully
committed to delivering double-digit top-line and bottom-line growth in Channel
Development in 2014 and the years ahead.
Let me now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Shawntay?
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Jeﬀrey Bernstein, Barclays.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Great, thank you very much. Two questions. First, from a ﬁnancial standpoint. Troy, if
you could just oﬀer any additional color. You mentioned the $750 million in debt youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 12A - Troy Alstead
Q - Jeﬀrey Bernstein
A - Howard Schultztook on or are taking on. I was just wondering whether there was any potential for
incremental debt beyond that, especially seeing that maybe this payout is more than
you were anticipating.
You mentioned, in FY14 guidance, still comfortable with that earnings range. I'm just
wondering whether this payout alters at all your investment or CapEx plans or the
share repurchase that you were expecting to be making in FY14. And I have one
follow-up.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thanks, Jeﬀ. Let me be clear about the debt. Very recently, just in the last couple of
months, as you know, we took out $750 million in debt.
The -- what I've referred to today in my comments is an additional $750 million that
we anticipate issuing in the coming few months. So those are two distinct debt
oﬀerings. And I just want to be clear. And that does reﬂect -- having received the
arbitration yesterday, that reﬂects our standard of that amount and the ﬁnancing that
we'll need to add to the strong cash that we have on hand.
Now, with respect to our future investments, absolutely nothing changes in how we
will invest into the future, both in terms of our capital spending for the year, in terms
of our renovation program, in terms of our new store development. We have a
strong expectations and plans for growing the business and making the appropriate
investments in it. And because of the healthy balance sheet we have, the
phenomenally strong cash ﬂow that our business generates, the healthy growth
plans that we have in place, we certainly won't deter any of the investments we are
making into the business for this year.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Got it. And just to clarify, John, I think you mentioned in terms of the Channel
Development, you said on a number of occasions a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.
Just because there are so many pieces in it and because we now do have the
headwind of the Kraft so on behind us, the largest components of that -- is it safe to
say that the two biggest pieces would be the single serve and the package? And if
so, a ballpark of what those represent in terms of percentage of sales or prioritize in
terms of proﬁtability just so we can get a look at that business going forward.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Jeﬀ, let me speak to part of it. And then I will have John add some qualitative
aspects. Packaged coﬀee is a, as you know, a nicely proﬁtable business for us, very
high margin.
We have grown proﬁtability of packaged coﬀee signiﬁcantly in the last two years
since taking direct operational control and really expanding our presence down the
aisle, deepening the relationship with the trade. All of that has been very signiﬁcantFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13

Page 6 of 12A - John Culver
Q - Jeﬀrey Bernstein
Operator
Q - Sara Senatoreto us and it's allowed us to grow both top line and proﬁtability of packaged coﬀee to
Starbucks.
Also during that span of time, as you know, we've rapidly grown to the leading
position in premium single cup. And we now have dollar proﬁtability in single cup
that is rapidly approaching the dollar proﬁtability we have in packaged coﬀee -- so,
very healthy components. All of that is incremental over the last two years.
And without putting speciﬁc numbers on that, you can see that all of that is
attributable, really, to us bringing that fully in-house and building the capabilities to
take that model directly to the trade. John?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yes. Jeﬀ, thanks for the question. Obviously, we are in the early days of building this
multi-billion-dollar business. And we have been able to establish a very strong
foothold and leadership position in the US and Canadian markets.
In addition, what we have also been able to do this year is built -- over the last
couple of years, is build a very strong innovation pipeline. And whether that is in the
K-cup area, whether that is with our stars-down-the-aisle loyalty program, or whether
that is with our signature aisle rollout that we have been doing just recently, these
programs have enabled us to accelerate the growth of the packaged-coﬀee business
and increase our position in the marketplace.
In addition, we also see tremendous opportunity outside of the US. Today, we sit in
29 markets. And obviously, we have a great opportunity to expand that beyond the
29 markets across the globe and increase the over 100,000 points of distribution we
currently have globally. So we're very optimistic and very conﬁdent about the future.
And we're looking forward to continuing to grow this business at the double-digit
rate that I have commented on already.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Great, thank you.
Sara Senatore.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Two questions, kind of related, one about the US business and then another sort of
follow-up on the global commentary. Can you talk about the outlook for packaged
coﬀee in the US?
If we look at some of the channel data more recently, it looks like maybe there has
been a little bit of a retrenchment since the nice uptick you had following the price
cuts. So I am just trying to ﬁgure out, should we think about that business asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13

Q - Bonnie Herzogsomewhat volatile and relatively slow growth, or are we at a point where maybe we
are going to start to see some real impact from a lot of the innovation you have
talked about in the core packaged coﬀee?
Then, the adjacent question was about, could you update us on where you are with
respect to China? Because I know that, that's something Howard has talked about,
the opportunity there. Have there been any developments in terms of points of
distribution or how you think about that market? Thank you.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Hi, Sara, this is John. As I said in our Q4 earnings call, I believe and am fully conﬁdent
that we are well positioned to navigate any volatility that exists in the US market as it
relates to packaged coﬀee or as it relates to the premium single-cup business. We
have got a very strong innovation pipeline starting with this holiday season and then
leading into Q2 and for the remainder of this year.
What you will see is that our performance for the business is going to build by
quarter, with the back half being stronger due to the impact of the list-price
reduction we took last year in May. And again, we are well positioned to deliver that
double-digit growth for the full year. Probably what you will see over the ﬁrst couple
of quarters is high single-digit growth. But that will accelerate in the back half of the
year. And we will deliver double-digit growth for the year.
In terms of China, we are well positioned -- with Jeﬀ Hansberry now in his role in
Hong Kong -- to drive the opportunity for growth in China. We have recently
introduced bottled Frappuccino in that market. Sales are going very well there. And
we are just in the very early days of building out that capability, that organization.
And we are well positioned to capture that opportunity going forward. So we are
very optimistic about accelerating the growth there as well.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Thank you.
Bonnie Herzog, Wells Fargo.
{BIO 1840179 <GO>}
I was hoping you could talk about new relationships you are forming and distribution
agreements you are assigning to build the multi-billion-dollar global packaged-
coﬀee business you mentioned. And what have been some of the lessons learned.
And what are you looking for in partners, especially as you try to increase your
global points of distribution, which could prove to be challenging?
Then also, could you provide an update on your relationship with Pepsi and how that
business is performing. And then possibly highlight some of the diﬀerences in thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13

A - Troy Alsteadrelationship that have allowed that business to ﬂourish? Thank you.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
I think under the direct model, what we have able to do is to accelerate the
relationships and build much deeper relationships with the key retailers here in the
US and abroad. We have now customer teams up against the top retailers across the
country where we have been able to go in and build out that -- the relationship and,
more importantly, increase our presence down the aisle.
As it relates to the international opportunity, we continue to accelerate the
relationships and business partnerships in that space as well. I will use Japan as an
example. We have a very strong relationship with Suntory, where we have a very well
established ready-to-drink business. We continue to accelerate that growth in that
market.
And when you look at the opportunities that we have to continue to build out
partnerships across our international markets, we are very conﬁdent that we have got
very strong relationships in place that we can continue to accelerate the growth. In
terms of the China opportunity, again, we feel very conﬁdent that China presents a
big opportunity for growth. And we will continue to accelerate in China as well.
Then lastly, around Pepsi, our Pepsi partnership is a very strong partnership here in
North America. We have been able to increase distribution this past year. And we
delivered a record year with our ready-to-drink business, as I commented in Q4
earnings call.
And we have been able to drive meaningful innovation in the area of delivering an
iced coﬀee product through the NACP partnership, as well as building out and
delivering a Discoveries product down the aisle as well. So we are very conﬁdent
that, that business will continue to accelerate and grow. And we're very happy and
pleased with our partnership with Pepsi.

{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Troy, can you say when the payment is due?

Joe, the exact payment date is not yet determined. That will be subject of some
further follow up with the arbitrator.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Q - Joe Buckley
A - Troy Alstead
A - Howard Schultz{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Okay. Then, I think you know that I have always viewed this as an acquisition with the
purchase price yet to be determined. And I am wondering if we think of it in that
light, if you could talk about the valuation maybe at the time you took the business
in, what the $2.27 billion -- $2.23 billion, rather, implies. And what that might imply at
today's run rate for the business on an EBITDA basis.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
I'll speak on it a bit, Joe. We don't, in our ﬁlings, disclose separately product line
proﬁtability. So I won't give you every bit of what you are looking for. But let me
speak to it in general terms.
Because there are, of course, two elements to the trajectory of the business, the
proﬁtability of the business. And if you are going to look at it as -- in terms of M&A,
you would look at both the cash ﬂows. But the opportunity and the expected growth
in those cash ﬂows going forward. Both of which -- by the way, as we have regained
operating control and really begun to build this business out in the last two years, as
John has described, both of those have grown signiﬁcantly.
So we have grown proﬁtability, cash ﬂow coming out of our packaged-coﬀee
business and anticipate to continue to be able to do that as time goes forward.
That's been a business we have been in for many, many years now, originally in the
Starbucks stores and then ultimately down the aisle. We have a leading share and
continue to hold the leading share down the aisle and generate incremental
proﬁtability over time. And have absolutely driven meaningful incremental
proﬁtability as a result of bringing that business under our direct control.
Also as a result of bringing the business under our direct control, we have grown a
highly incremental, signiﬁcant rapid pace of growth in the premium single-cup
space, which again is approaching -- in dollar proﬁtability to Starbucks, in dollar cash
ﬂow to Starbucks -- the proﬁtability of our packaged-coﬀee business. And we
anticipate as we -- the consumer continues to shift into single serve in the years
ahead, we can hold and build upon the strong leadership position that we have
already developed in single cup and continue to build that and grow proﬁtability as
time goes on.
So both of those, the cash ﬂows from those businesses and the trajectory we have
going forward, support a very healthy return to our business and what we believe to
be -- despite our disappointment with the ﬁnal answer from the arbitrator -- supports
what was a very, very good decision for Starbucks.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Troy, let me add one more thing about that. In the last earnings call, I think we shared
with you that the run rate for the 12-month period for FY13 that we actually had
almost $4 billion loaded on Starbucks cards. And then, going into Q1, almost $700
million. The reason I am bringing that up is that the level of innovation and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Q - Joe Buckley

Q - Michael Kelter
A - Troy Alsteadcatalyst for Starbucks growth at retail is directly integrated into a rewards program,
the card. And the innovation that we've brought and are bringing to mobile
transactions.
Over the last year, we have already seen over 1.5 million people redeem their stars
on purchases of ground or whole bean coﬀee down the grocery aisle. Now, we have
been sharing with you, I think for over a year now, the long-term strategy of being in
a position, of being the only consumer brand down the aisle that would have the
ability to integrate a signiﬁcant rewards and incentive program that would bounce
back into our stores. In addition to that, we are beginning to thread that into Teavana
stores and the Teavana brand as well.
The long-term plans that Starbucks has today is to build a multi-channel, multi-brand,
multi-category CPG business that is well beyond the size and scale of it is today. And
certainly, the aspirations and capabilities we have for that business, we never
could've had under the roof of Kraft.
So as diﬃcult as it might be to get beyond the sticker shock of this number, let me
tell you all that, once again, the future opportunity that we have well, beyond the
business today, to build a one-of-a-kind CPG business integrated into our retail
business and fully integrated into the rewards program is just in a nascent stage in
demonstrating to us the relevancy to the Starbucks consumer. And this is something
that we will not stop domestically.
{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Thank you.
Michael Kelter, Goldman Sachs.
{BIO 16370642 <GO>}
Actually, I have two questions. The ﬁrst is, you kept to your 2014 EPS guidance
despite this additional layer of interest expense from the $750 million of debt.
Where speciﬁcally do you anticipate upside from your underlying business that is
going to provide the positive oﬀset to hit that initial guidance range? The second
question is, how much of your current cash balance is overseas. And will there be
any tax implication from repatriating to make the payment?
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thanks, Michael. First of all, on your second question, yes, we do have a fairly healthy
chunk of cash that sits overseas, somewhere approaching $1 billion at this stage. We
do not intend to repatriate that cash in order to make this payment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 12Q - Michael Kelter
Operator
A - JoAnn DeGrandeSo we will, even after taking an additional $750 million in debt, be making the
payment as the arbitrator has indicated. We will still have cash on our balance sheet,
certainly some domestically but a fair amount oﬀshore. So there will be no
incremental tax expense as a result of repatriating cash. We do not anticipate doing
that at this stage.
Then, with respect to guidance, what I would say is we are extremely early in our
ﬁscal year. Our initial guidance every year is a range. And every year as we progress
throughout the year, we have new plans. We have -- we tend to be nimble in terms of
opportunities that come along. We will pursue new innovations.
We will adjust our growth plans as we go throughout the year. That is just our normal
way of operating as we proceed throughout any given year. And that is why we will
start the year as we did this year with a range that's a bit wide. And as we progress
through the year, tighten up based on what we learned.
The arbitration answer yesterday was a new bit of learning for us and does add a
little bit of pressure in terms of additional interest expense throughout the year from
what we had been previously anticipating. But at this early stage in the year, all that
ﬁts within that guidance range and a little bit of the ﬂuid plans that we would always
approach a new ﬁscal year with. So I am quite comfortable we are going to deliver
another strong year of earnings growth, another strong year of top-line growth. And
we are going to meet our commitments.
{BIO 16370642 <GO>}

This concludes today's conference. At this time we have no further questions. I will
now turn the call back to Ms. DeGrande.
