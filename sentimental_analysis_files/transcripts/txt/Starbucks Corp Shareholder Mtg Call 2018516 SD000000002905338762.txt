{BIO 22161440 <GO>}
Good morning. Welcome to Shanghai. My name is Jeﬀ Miller I am a 23 year
Starbucks partner. I just returned to our China business a couple of weeks ago to
look after retail operations in coﬀee engagement. I've spent -- I'm very proud to say
that I've spent 9 of my 18 years in Asia as a part of the China team.
Right now you should each have a cup of coﬀee in your hands. Please enjoy the
aroma and feel free to give it a taste as we share the story of this coﬀee with you. You
probably already know a lot about what Starbucks China is known for. But today we
want to share a story with you that you may not be quite as familiar with.
This is about a journey that starts about 1,700 miles to the southwest of here and
ends with a cup of coﬀee that's in your hands. To kick oﬀ this special gathering, we
want to take you to Pu'er, in the rolling foothills of Yunnan province and share with
you the eﬀorts of our partners there to improve the quality of Arabia coﬀee. In only 6
short years Alan Tong and his team have succeeded where no one else has.
Where less than a decade ago, Yunnan coﬀee was primarily used in mass coﬀee
products around Asia, Yunnan Arabicas can now can be found increasingly in
specialty coﬀeehouses around the world, including most recently as a reserve
feature at our Shanghai and our Seattle roasteries.
This is largely because of the work of our Farmer Support Center and our dry mill
operations. And this is only the beginning. But as important as the coﬀee is itself, is
the source of pride that Yunnan coﬀee has provided for our partners and our
customers and we're very excited to share this with the world.
So this morning it is a joy to share this with all of you and it is my privilege to
introduce Alan Tong, our director of the Farmer Support Center and dry mill
operations in Yunnan.
Good morning, everyone. The coﬀee in your hand is from Yunnan. Can't you taste
the good sweetness and the citric acidity? It is very, very balanced with some greenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 45Unidentiﬁed Speakertea like note. I roast it for you and brought it to you from Pu'er, where we have 1,700
farms with 17,000 hectares veriﬁed through our C.A.F. E. Practice.
In 2012, we started our coﬀee journey by establishing the Farmer Support Center
and the dry mill. We have 4 agronomists in the FSC and 33 operation staﬀ in the dry
mill. They both have very perfect collaboration, like a yin and yang in Tai chi. The FSC
gives the trainings and support. And the dry mill gives the premiums for the good
quality.
Over the last few years, my team and I, we spend most of the times in the vehicles
driving from one farm to another, getting to know the farmers, helping them
building the trust in order to get to where we are today. Now, it makes us the buyer
of choice to your local farmers with an annual purchase increment by 7 or 8x than the
year of 2013, when it was only 1,000 metric tons only. And never forget that no one
knew about Starbucks at the beginning. I was confused. Really? Huh. Am I going to
Michael J. Fox in The Back to the Future 4.
The ﬁrst time training that we had with the farmers, it was only 25 people. And I had
to treat them with very delicious dinner after that. Even today, I am not so sure. What
made them come for the training? My charm? Or that dinner?
And last November, more than 4,000 farmers drove for hours to the farmer
assembly. And taste their fruit of their labor and celebrate their dedications to
improve the quality for Yunnan coﬀee. Being a leader in my dictionary has 2
important keywords. That is "leverage" and "change." Because the years of hand in
hand hard work with the farmers, we are already part of the extended family. And the
leverage is constant. We could see many positive changes; not only to their
livelihood, to their farming practices, to their quality awareness. But also to the
recognition by the world for Yunnan coﬀee.
Starbucks is going to elevate Yunnan coﬀee industry. And that is for sure. The ﬁrst 10
feet is not a long distance, however, it takes us six years to get it here. Please, let's
take another sip of this coﬀee, especially for this occasion for you. Today, we are so
proud of that we have our own roastery in China, where we could have our best
Yunnan beans to be roasted and delivered to our stores for the customers to enjoy.
Let me introduce my partner from the Shanghai Roastery, (Hoho).
Thank you, Alan. Good morning, all. My name is Hoho I'm a established coﬀee
roaster at Shanghai Roastery. It's a such big honor to share our Yunnan coﬀee here. I
still remember the ﬁrst time when we roasted Yunnan coﬀee at Shanghai Roastery,
the 8 of us the ﬁrst bench of China roasters had just ﬁnished our training and they
are attentive Shanghai from Seattle. We were very excited, yet nervous about
roasting this coﬀee. That's so close and dear to our hearts. We discussed about
roasting plan again. And again with our master roasters. Trust me, you will be
amazed if I share all our ideas and the plans we went through.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

Page 4 of 45Jeﬀ Miller
Kevin R. JohnsonWhen the ﬁrst Yunnan coﬀee bean came out from the roasting machine, we cheered.
We hugged each other. We cried. What an incredible moment. Chinese coﬀee
roasting in China by Chinese roasters. Can you imagine how proud we were? You
probably can tell how proud I am right now.
So if Alan's team gave Yunnan coﬀee life, I wish we roasters can give Yunnan coﬀee a
great stage, it's just like Starbucks always does to us partners, we're not just roasting
coﬀee, we help coﬀee to show itself, to partners, to customers, to you and to the
world. We let coﬀee speaks for itself. Please enjoy this unique balance of this Yunnan
coﬀee. I will now pass it on to George, who present our Chinese barista and to tell
you what Yunnan coﬀee means to them. Thank you.
Thanks Hoho. Hi, everyone, I'm George and I am from Kunming, the capital city of
Yunnan. I started on my Starbucks journey in September 2012 as a part-time barista,
when I was a junior in (college) and now I am a store manager of the ﬁrst Reserve
store in Yunnan. And I'm very proud to share the Starbucks model of Reserve coﬀee
to all our customers in such a unique location.
My partners and I enjoy using diﬀerent brewing methods to present the best coﬀee
to our customers. I remember the ﬁrst time when my partners and I tasted the
Yunnan reserve coﬀee beans, we were stunned by its unique herbal ﬂavor. I want to
know more about the Yunnan coﬀee beans I can share with my partners and
customers.
Later on I had a chance to visit the Farmer Support Center in Pu'er and all my
questions for Yunnan coﬀee beans were answered. I got to know every single staﬀ
involved. But the big takeaway for me was, I realized every Yunnan coﬀee bean is a
result of the hard work of Yunnan coﬀee farmers and our partners, from the Farmer
Support Center.
After I went back to my store, I hosted a special coﬀee tasting to share my
experiences on the (inaudible) coﬀee with my customers. That day we sold out on all
the Yunnan coﬀee beans in my store. My partners and are honored to use our skills
to present the Yunnan coﬀee to our customers in the last 10 feet.
{BIO 22161440 <GO>}
Thank you very much, George. This is the China seed to cup story that makes our
partners and our customers so very proud. And what you've just heard is a true
testimony to the passion and the dedication that our partners have for everything
that we do around coﬀee here in China. So thank you very, very much for sharing in
the special coﬀee with us this morning. Thank you.
And it is now my great honor to introduce our CEO, Mr. Kevin Johnson and welcome
him to the stage.

Page 5 of 45Give him a round of applause. What a wonderful coﬀee tasting. Thank you. So much.
Well. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to China. It is an honor to host all of you
here for this 2-day event. I mean, this is the ﬁrst time we've had the opportunity to
host a China investor conference. And I must say, I have visited China many times,
numerous trips here. And it really is a second home to Starbucks.
But I must say, it's very diﬃcult to describe the experience that you have here in
China. You must experience it in person. And so, I want to begin by thanking each of
you for traveling and investing the time and the resource to be with us over the next
two days.
Now, Belinda Wong and her team have prepared a wonderful journey for you. This
journey will, I guarantee, will make it worth your time. And to really understand
Starbucks China, you must experience it. And over the next two days, you will have
an immersive experience on all aspects of China.
Jeﬀ and the team shared a little about the work we're doing in Yunnan, around
origin. You're going to have an opportunity to immerse with store designers, with
our product R&D, with our digital ventures, with our partners resources team and our
channels team. Every aspect of how Belinda and her team bring the Starbucks
experience to life here in China.
Now, let me set a little context before we begin. This represents a long-term growth
opportunity for Starbucks. And we've been in China for 20 years now. And we have
built this business in China, for China. In fact, it is clearly one of the top priorities and
it requires focus, it requires discipline. And it requires us continuing to take the long-
term view.
Now, this past year we have worked at the enterprise level to really amplify our focus
on the core value drivers for you, our shareholders. And let me summarize 3 things
that I believe are supporting our agenda here in China.
I want to take an opportunity to share a little perspective on streamline and how the
streamline eﬀorts are helping us really amplify the core value drivers, especially here
in China and the U.S.
I want to share some thoughts on the global coﬀee alliance that we announced last
week. And speciﬁcally how that global coﬀee alliance can also support our agenda
here in China. Then, third, I want to just share a little about how this ampliﬁed focus
on value creation combined with the management philosophy that we use to really
empower Belinda and the team you're going to spend the next two days with to run
this business in China.
There is more innovation coming out of Starbucks China than any other market in
the world. And that is much about the leadership team, the way they're empowered.
And we're going to take you through that over the next two days.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 45Now, let me just start by sharing a little bit about streamline. Over the last year, we
have communicated consistently with you about our activities to streamline the
company so that we can focus more of our energy, more of our capital, more
resources on the core value drivers going forward.
Now, I think about streamline around 3 main pillars. Retail alignment, business
simpliﬁcation. And this Global Coﬀee Alliance.
Now, speciﬁcally retail market alignment really is representative of the fact that we
have been aggressively licensing retail markets that have either lower returns on
invested capital or lower upside in terms of new unit growth.
Examples have included markets like Germany, Singapore, Taiwan and Brazil. We've
transitioned in those markets over 800 stores from company-operated to licensed
stores. And in addition to transitioning some of these markets to licensed we have
also deployed capital to acquire 100% of the joint venture in East China.
That is enabling us to now unify all of mainland China around a company-operated
model and create some synergies that Belinda and team will take you through later
this morning.
Now, the second pillar business simpliﬁcation is really about either divesting of non-
core slow growth assets and simplifying our internal business operation. We sold
Tazo Tea to Unilever so that we could focus on our core premium tea brand Teavana.
We also closed the Teavana specialty retail stores in the U.S. and North America
realizing that the place we were selling over $1.6 billion of Teavana was in Starbucks
stores. And as we took Teavana globally in Starbucks, that was just fueling additional
growth.
We also optimized items for sale in our stores in the U.S. through a SKU
rationalization process. And that resulted in roughly the reduction of about 30% of
the SKUs that we sell in the lobby and some eﬃciencies that we have on the food
and beverage side. The business simpliﬁcation is allowing us to get more eﬃciency
and put more of our energy behind core value drivers.
Now, the third pillar is something we announced just last week, which is a global
coﬀee alliance with Nestle. Now this is an opportunity to signiﬁcantly accelerate our
international CPG and food services business. Now, I think about this in many ways.
When we open Starbucks stores in a market, we establish the brand. And that brand
is established by the fact that customers come visit our stores. And the experience
we create for them in the stores sets the tone for the Starbucks brand.
Now, we have demonstrated in the U.S. and Canada that when we complement the
work we do in our stores by selling Starbucks products at grocery, mass merchants
and food services it becomes a brand ampliﬁer. So the customers that understand
the brand from their experience in Starbucks have an opportunity to purchase and
sample a wide range of diﬀerent Starbucks products at grocery, mass merchant, foodFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 45services that strengthens their aﬃnity for the brand and brings them back into our
stores.
There is a synergistic approach between CPG food services and our Starbucks retail
business. Now we have proven that in North American, where that business has just
been on ﬁre for the last seven years as we have growth that and as we have built that
business. But candidly, we are in 76 countries around the world and having a CPG
food service success in the U.S. and Canada means there are 74 other markets where
we have established the brand but either the CPG and food services businesses is
nascent or nonexistent.
So this global license agreement with Nestle allows us to continue to control our
brand and at the same time Nestle will leverage their massive scale and capabilities
for global distribution. This licensing partnership includes an upfront payment of
$7.15 billion to Starbucks, as well as ongoing royalty and product fees to provide
meaningful economic incentives for both companies, we are incented to continue to
grow this both strategically and economically.
Now that growth will come in a couple ways, one, our expansion globally into new
international markets, Nestle brings over 5 million points of presence in 189
countries. Now certainly, a subset of those points of presence are going to be places
that are very applicable for Starbucks products to be sold. And so our opportunity to
go market by market and build a thoughtful plan about how we are going to enter
that market with the right products, the right points of presence and we will prioritize
that following the close, we will work with Nestle on the next wave of plans we have
to expand that. But that is growth, growth opportunity.
The second aspect of growth is the fact that Nestle is opening up an espresso and
Dolce Gusto systems platforms for the ﬁrst time to Starbucks coﬀee. Now, let me just
remind you that Starbucks sold our ﬁrst K-Cup on the Keurig platform seven years
ago, we became the #1 premium brand on K-Cups in the United States on the Keurig
platform within four years of getting on that platform. And we have continued to
grow share every year since then.
Now today the Keurig platform is focused speciﬁcally on North America and we are
going to stay on the Keurig platform but the fact that an espresso and Dolce Gusto
platforms are global means that the installed base of systems that they have on a
global basis far exceeds that of Keurig. And so our opportunity to grow not only by
geography but by new products on the espresso and Dolce Gusto platforms opens
up a huge opportunity.
Now the third aspect of this global coﬀee alliance is around sustainability, we share a
commitment to make coﬀee the ﬁrst sustainable agricultural product. And this
means that we have an opportunity to embrace C.A.F. E. Practices that ensure that
farmers get paid equitably for the coﬀee they grow, we have the opportunity to
collaborate on the agronomy research that both companies do. And to leverage our
Farmer Support Centers in an open source model to share what we learn to helpFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 45coﬀee farmers around the world improve their yields, embrace hybrid coﬀee trees
that are rust resistant and help ensure that we continue to facilitate and embrace
coﬀee farmers to grow the world's ﬁnest coﬀee.
Now all of these streamline actions have netted in aggregate approximately freed up
about $8 billion of capital, approximately $8 billion of capital freed up through the
streamline actions that we have announced. Now, we redeployed $1.3 billion of that
capital into East China and you will hear more about that today but the net of all
streamline activities that we have done are accretive to both revenue and EPS in
ﬁscal '18 and '19 and they have enabled us to increase our cash return to
shareholders to $20 billion over the three years ﬁscal '18 to '20.
Now, all of that is allowing us to focus much more on China. Now, from the moment
we opened our ﬁrst store in China, in January 1999, we have been playing the long
game, we built and maintained a company that has a deep respect for the Chinese
culture, our customers. And the partners who proudly wear the green apron in more
than 100 cities throughout China.
No western company or brand is better positioned to beneﬁt from the rapidly
expanding Chinese middleclass and certainly we continue to be mindful of the fact
that we will evolve a coﬀee culture in China, where the reward will be healthy, long-
term proﬁtable growth for decades to come.
The extraordinary Shanghai Roastery, which we will host you out this evening is
building on our long history in China and it continues to exceed all expectations.
Now, the ﬁnancial returns from the full acquisition of our East China business are
already running ahead of our internal guidance and it will contribute 2 points of EPS
growth this year. And that proﬁtability and that momentum should accelerate as we
move into ﬁscal '19 and beyond.
Now, the leadership team you are going to see here today is fully integrating and
optimizing this for the future, in fact Starbucks manages, we invest in. And we grow
our brand with a global focus. We are playing the long game. And Belinda and her
team have done a phenomenal job and brought the Starbucks brand to life here in
China in a local way.
And that gets to the management philosophy, many times I have to decide what are
those things that we do globally. And what are those things we do locally. Certainly,
our mission, our core values and our brand are things that we embrace globally but
when it comes to everything else in China, it is done locally. Belinda and her team
are fully empowered to respond, to react, to adapt the Starbucks brand here in
China, which is why over the next two days you will see that we have integrated the
entire set of leadership functions needed to run China in a way so that China is built
here in China for China; the store development team, the product R&D team, supply
chain, digital ventures, partner resources, channel development all contained within
the China leadership team that you will meet here in the next two days.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 45Belinda WongAnd I will tell you the pace of innovation that is taking place in China especially in
Starbucks China is exceeding any other market in the world. We learn so much from
the work they do, whether it is work they have done around store design and the fact
that we have over 140 Starbucks reserve bars here in China, they invented the
concept. And it is a concept we are now taking globally. You look at the work they
have done on digital, they embrace social gifting. And you look at the fact that over
60% of their tender is now paid for through the mobile applicant. Innovation,
product R&D, we are going to take you through our R&D lab later this morning or
later this afternoon and you will have an opportunity to sample some new beverages
and get a sense of the work that is going on here from an innovation standpoint.
So this next two days is all about Belinda and her team, it's their show and they are
empowered and I am just here to serve them. So it is my pleasure to introduce you
to the CEO of Starbucks China, my friend and great partner, Belinda Wong, Belinda.

Thank you. Hello. Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, welcome to China. Finally.
Welcome to our Shanghai support center and welcome to our home so. So happy to
see you all here. Very excited to be able to share with you in person our ambitions
and in Starbucks fastest growing and most strategic international market.
The extraordinary business performance that Kevin mentioned just now in this
market did not happen by chance, it is the result of the love, pride and dedication of

most talented and dynamic leaders in the market on my leadership team.
And you have already heard from Jeﬀ, Jeﬀ where are you, Jeﬀ about our passion and

Page 10 of 45So over the next two days you'll be able to interact with them in person and I know
each one of them is dying to share with you their own Starbucks story and their
excitement about the opportunities ahead.
Almost 20 years ago, Starbucks pioneered the specialty coﬀee market in China. We
introduced a unique third-place experience in serving high quality coﬀee to our
Chinese customers. Fast forward to today, no other coﬀee retailer in China has the
depth of our coﬀee expertise or the breadth of our store footprint, partner
experience, product innovation. And positive impact in the community.
The Starbucks experience and the personal moments of connections our partners
have with our customers 6.4 million times every week simply cannot be replicated.
So how did we do this? You heard from Kevin before that Starbucks has cracked the
code in China. I would love to humbly, humbly share with you our experiences and
learnings.
As you sit here this morning, there are 3,300 stores across 141 cities in mainland
China. We're not just opening a new store every 15 hours. But a new store that is
proﬁtable and with great returns. This did not happen overnight and it is a result of
our disciplined growth. We tested our ability to accelerate our growth with no
compromise on our values and commitment to deliver the unparalleled partner and
customer experience.
Today, we have the world-class capabilities to open hundreds of new stores every
year. China is a very, very dynamic market. It requires us to learn from each new store
opening and innovate to build the next one better. And one of the most strategic
investments to enable our accelerated growth is our own China design studio, with
120 very, very talented designers we've delivered the newest class of enticing and
welcoming stores that is outperforming and delivering record transactions and
proﬁts far, far above any of our peers had.
We've also established Starbucks as tenant of choice. We have developed many
strategic partnerships with premium landlords. This is giving us unprecedented
access to some of the most sought after retail locations all across China with the
most preferential terms. Our stores are located in some of the most high traﬃc,
prime lifestyle locations, in malls, transport hubs. And the ﬁnest commercial centers.
This too, cannot be easily replicated.
China was a tea drinking country when we entered the market back in 1999. And it
still is. We had to learn how we can introduce a specialty coﬀee culture lifestyle to
our customers. We listen intently to the needs of our customers to translate the
unique Starbucks experience in a locally relevant way. We have to stay agile and
have the capability to innovate.
This commitment to innovation led us to open the ﬁrst Starbucks R&D center in Asia,
right here in Shanghai. This is another strategic investment we made to unlock our
dayparts with the right food and beverage oﬀerings. 85% of our beverage oﬀeringsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 45are created in China, for China. And we're developing 100% of our local food
oﬀerings.
While I see a great potential in our morning business, I love the fact that our dayparts
are so balanced. We've an equally strong lunch, afternoon and evening business.
Our passion and our focus is to continue to enrich each and every daypart and lift
the entire base of transactions throughout the day.
We take the authentic relationships we have built with our partners, customers,
strategic suppliers and other key stakeholders like government and media very, very
personally. We have to continue to earn our trust and credibility every day. Success is
certainly not an entitlement. We need to earn and preserve those trusted
relationships and friendships. That is what makes Starbucks so well integrated in the
fabric of the Chinese society.
The Shanghai Roastery, where we dreamed up and landed a never before seen
innovative experience, is one of the best reﬂections of the incredible relationships
we have built with the local government. Starbucks and our Shanghai Roastery have
been quoted on numerous occasions by the government as the role model to
support the country's innovation agenda.
I think we've done a pretty good job so far in translating the Starbucks experience
locally. And you'll hear more from each of our speakers later.
Right from the beginning we wanted to be a diﬀerent kind of company. We want to
be a purpose-driven company in China. Taking real actions and responsibilities to
role model what a for-proﬁt company can do for its people, society and for my
country. What makes me most excited about our new store openings is our ability to
promote a new store manager every 15 hours, a new district manager every week.
And an area director every quarter. We're doing our part to train the ﬁnest retail
leaders for the future. The best people leaders with great business values and ethics
for my country.
And we're also creating over 10,000 new jobs every year. The better we do, the more
we can invest back to our people and communities. We, our 45,000 partners, all
share the same purpose, pride and beliefs. The purpose-driven culture is what fuse
our passion and energy to do what we do every day. We want to achieve something
bigger than ourselves, unique to Starbucks in China is the culture, a family, a value
that is deeply rooted in the Chinese tradition.
As we continue to accelerate our growth, we recognize our increasing responsibility
to leverage our scale, to innovate around the partner experience and also to take
great care of their families. Success is best when shared. And we've launched many
unique partner beneﬁts in China already. We went beyond what most companies
would oﬀer to their people here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

Page 12 of 45We have the same comprehensive life, accidental and medical insurance beneﬁts to
the spouses and children of our fulltime partners. We also pioneered ﬁrst of its kind
critical illness insurance program for the parents of our partners. In my opinion,
there's truly no other retailer like Starbucks in China. Everything that we've done has
been laying the foundation for a much, much bigger dream. We are so excited about
the enormous opportunities ahead. I have spoken extensively in the past about the
signiﬁcant growth opportunities and the synergies or eﬃciencies we'll gain through
the integration of our East China business and additionally with a rapid pace of the
economic growth development taking place across China and the rising middleclass
with much higher disposable income will undoubtedly drive the coﬀee consumption
growth here in this market.
All this will boost the demand for Starbucks. We're so conﬁdent for our long-term
growth and development in the market, with that I am proud, very proud to share
with you our purpose-driven China growth agenda. Centered around our partners,
their families and communities we will be laser focused on strengthening local
relevant innovations, experience and moments of connections with our third place
strategy. Build even deeper relationships with our customers in the fourth place with
our digital ﬂywheel and extending our brand reach by weaving the Starbucks
experience into the fabric of the Chinese millennial lifestyles through Starbucks on
the go.
These 3 pillars together with our aspirations to give back to the Chinese
communities are our purpose-driven China growth agenda. And we will be
obsessed in delivering with results and pride in the coming years.
The third place strategy is a holistic, multi-sensory approach from the location, store
design, food and beverages, partners and customers connections, all the way to how
our baristas passionately show-oﬀ their craftsmanship and knowledge on coﬀee.
This is the theatre for the ultimate Starbucks experience and we excel in this area by
far. And that is why our brand resonates so well with our modern Chinese customers,
it's also the reason why the brand triggers so many Instagram or WeChat moments.
But the needs are forever evolving and we need to continue to push the envelope to
exceed the expectations of our customers. Leo will share in details what we have
been doing and the focus of our eﬀorts going forward to fuel our growth in that
area.
While it is important to win in our third place, it is equally important to win in the
fourth place the digital space. Chinese consumers now are among the most digitally
savvy costumers in the world. The third and fourth place need to complement each
other and redeﬁne a new retail experience. And Emily will share our plans to make
the fourth place an integral part of the complete Starbucks experience.

our disciplined growth approach and the ﬁnancial health of our business here.
In closing, it has been an absolute privilege to lead this unprecedented era of
growth and be able to work with our ﬁne partners here, who care so deeply for our
brand and for each other. My optimism for the China market has never been greater.
Our collective hard work and investments made in the past 20 years has set the
perfect foundations for us for our future.
With that I am thrilled to announce that we will be accelerating on our store growth,
Starbucks China will set a new goal to double our store count to 6,000 stores in over
230 cities across the mainland by 2022. That means we are going 20% faster,
growing 600 net new stores annually starting this ﬁscal year and entering into an
additional 100 new cities. We are still in a very early stage beginning chapters of our
purpose-driven growth story here in China.
We will continue to create history with Starbucks coﬀee company and I promise you
we will one day be larger than the U.S. market, thank you.
Now, It's my pleasure to introduce to you one of the heroes behind the early success
in Starbucks China, my great friend and our Chief Operating Oﬃcer, Mr. Leo Tsoi.
{BIO 19965066 <GO>}
Thank you very much, thank you Belinda. Good morning, everyone I am Leo Tsoi, the
Chief Operating Oﬃcer of Starbucks China. Welcome to Shanghai again. I am
delighted to share with you our strategic growth initiative to elevate our third place
strategy.
I joined Starbucks China in 2012. I was born in China and educated in Hong Kong. I
love our country. And I am incredibly proud to come to China to serve the Chinese
people with my understanding of China and (my brand) and commercial
experiences from P&G, Starbucks Asia Paciﬁc and PepsiCo.
After 15 years in China I continue to be proud and inspired by how our country is
developing on a daily basis. In fact this uniqueness requires us to build the Starbucks
brand in a dynamically diﬀerent way. And let me share with you some of the insights
that we have been seeing over the years. China's middleclass population is expected
to double to 600 million by 2022. Today, 450 million millennial in China aged
between 18 to 38; while the middleclass is known to be strivers, the Chinese
millennial are known amongst the most well educated and well-traveled.
They seek innovative experiences to fulﬁll their aspirational and global lifestyle but
they also have a strong pride and respect for the Chinese culture and heritage. And
this is why our holistic made in China for China third place experience has a strong
appeal to them. Also you must remember 1 important fact the nearly 150 million of
the population, half of the size of the U.S. population who was born under theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 14 of 45China's one child policy between 1980 to 2015, this generation, they crave human
connections either with their friends or to spend quality time with their friends and
families.
The sense of community that our partners have created in our third place will be
more relevant and important in the years to come. This aspirational consumer
lifestyle needs will continue to be the driver of our creation of future innovations.
And there are 3 key growth drivers, they are important to elevate the purpose driven
China growth agenda.
#1 is to drive the penetration in breadth and depth to meet the increasing and
evolving (mid stage) and importantly to acquire new consumers. Second, it is to
double down on our innovations to inspire new occasions and increase frequency.
And last but not the least, it is to elevate the Starbucks experience through
premiumization.
Now, let me explain how we are going to interpret these drivers into our third place
strategy. With 1 stall opening every 15 hours, Starbucks China has tripled our store
count to almost 3,300 in the past four years. This rapid star portfolio growth far
exceeds our peers had and is on par with our U.S. market in the early days of the
trajectory growth.
We have learned and continue to ﬁne tune our skills and ability to balance the
existing store sales with new store growth. And you are seeing almost all the stores
across China have achieved proﬁtability and solid ﬁnancial performances and proﬁt
growth.
And this is the result of a successful network goal strategy with a discipline to go
wide in the new cities and our intentionality to innovate in the city when we go deep.
Our going wide strategy requires a holistic approach across the functions. And
carefully consider and analyze in each and every city that we enter.
Behind me are the photos of the ﬁrst opening in a city like Qian'an in Hebei. Look at
the enthusiasm of our partners and the long lines of the customers waiting to enter
our stall, when we ﬁrst open. This amazing and excitement scene has actually
happened over 70x in the past ﬁve years when we enter the new cities. If fact, did
you know that all of them have achieved their proﬁtability starting from the ﬁrst year?
As Belinda just announced, we will bring this same experience and approach to
another 100 new cities by 2022. And let me remind with another important fact. The
majority of these new cities are home of an average of 4 million people,
approximately equivalent to the size of Los Angeles.
Everyone, what this means is that we are going to be introducing the Starbucks
experience to a population nearly 100x of Los Angeles in the next ﬁve years. Now,
how can I not be excited about this amazing runway of growth ahead of us?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 15 of 45Now, let me also share with you our strategy to deepen our existing stores when we
enter into -- when we have entered the cities. We grow with our customers with our
Starbucks discovery journey. We intentionally elevate our store proﬁle and portfolio
as we scale in each city.
Importantly, we also introduce new concept and new format, in the city where we
open our store, to enhance our reach and deepen our connection with our
customers. Our customer's ﬁrst engagement with Starbucks is typically through our
beautiful core store.
Now, as they grow, we begin to strategically to rate relevant experience, to exceed
their evolving needs. One example, it's the Brew Bar they were pioneered back in
2013. Now, Brew Bar it's an engaging handcraft platform, that we use Siphon,
Chemex, Pour Over, to brew to handcraft our beautiful cold coﬀee, such as Kenya
and Sumatra.
We deliberately make our Brew Bar low, close and neat, because this is the stage
where we handcraft taste, share the passion, share the love and the quick taste of
our beautiful coﬀee with our customer, one-on-one.
And over the years we reﬁned our Brew Bars by up-leveling the brewing technique.
But we also push ourselves hard to keep it simplicity, because we know the key is to
enable this connection between our partners and our customers when they are in
the Brew Bar.
Now, I'm so proud to share with you, we have introduced Brew Bar in more than
1,000 stores in China. This high level engagement Brew Bar actually inspire us to
evolve this experience when we introduced the Starbucks Reserve brand in 2014.
Now, when a city and our customers are ready, we will introduce the Starbucks
Reserve Bar to invite our customers to lean further to a even more premium
experience. Our Brew Bar brings to life a even higher level of coﬀee craftsmanship
and importantly showcase, we can go beyond the product experiences by delivering
an elevated multisensory experience when people are in the store.
And only the certiﬁed Red Apron coﬀee masters can operate our Brew Bar and brew
and handcraft our premium Reserve coﬀees. And today, we showcase our Reserve
coﬀees in over 150 Starbucks stores in the Reserve Bars in China. And we expect to
reach 200 stores of our Reserve Bars by the end of ﬁscal year '18.
But that's not all. We need to constantly evolve ourselves with our customers, as we
continue to expand in a city. For example, the Chinese customers are probably some
of the most mobile consumers in the world. China has the world's largest railway
network, 4x bigger than Japan.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 16 of 45So we are building more stores in transport hubs across our cities to serve the 1.5
billion passengers passing through these 5,500 hubs every year. Additionally, we are
also introducing new core stores with diﬀerent format and proﬁle, to elevate the
Starbucks experience with the rising middle class.
Our residential store format, it's actually a neighborhood store build with and
designed with the comfort of a living room and a (sail through) bar where our
partners and our customers hand you coﬀee side by side. You're looking at a store
that we opened last year in a community in Changzhou, Jiangsu with 20,000
residents.
And similarly, our new pet friendly store, we invite our customers to come up for a
coﬀee with their pet-friends. So each and every of this format are actually decide
intentionally to create more occasions to build a daily coﬀee ritual.
Then there's our ﬂagship portfolio. Our ﬂagship is -- the statement to our brand in
China. It's a complete multisensory, theatrical experience at the next level. Since our
ﬁrst ﬂagship opened in Beijing Kerry Center in 2013 we now have 6 ﬂagship stores
built and opened across China.
Successful programs such as our bar element, product oﬀerings, are all replicated
across the regions. We learn from each other to make the next one better. And even
with more inspiring and innovative experiences.
And today, I'm so excited to share with you our latest ﬂagship evolution, the Beijing
(One) store, opening soon in June in Beijing. This the largest store aside from the
roasteries. It is the store 1 km away from Tiananmen Square. With this 10,000 square
feet space, we are featuring 3 distinct platforms the Reserve bar on the ground ﬂoor.
And then a Teavana bar and then mixology bar on the top ﬂoor. This ﬁrst of its kind
immersive star experience outside the roasteries of Shanghai. It's actually a tribute of
our relationship with the Beijing community, where we started in China nearly 20
years ago.
Now, the growth story in Beijing is not a one oﬀ. In fact, it only highlights our
intentionality to create the regional and city center to bring this Starbucks
experience alive, region after region, from the east to the west and city after city,
from Beijing to Shanghai. And from Guangzhou to Chendu.
Now everyone, what I just took you through is a ﬁrm demonstrations how Starbucks
China has been able to create, to test, to launch and importantly to land the next
generation of innovations and creations to ﬁt our ever-changing lifestyles and the
consumer needs here in China. This is an important capability that we must have to
win in this market.
Now, the third place strategy is not just about our store and the beautiful space. It is
also about our product experience. Our customers discovery journey actually
continues across our 3 key beverage platforms, the core, the coﬀee forward. And theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 17 of 45seasonal oﬀerings. The Caﬀe Latte, the Cappuccino and Frappuccino. And other
Starbucks core classics are all delivering signiﬁcant sales in our portfolio.
You have to remember, this product in a new city like (Tiemenguan)they deﬁne the
ﬁrst taste of our customers with Starbucks and they form the foundation to pure daily
coﬀee ritual for the many years to come among this group of customers. Now, in the
past few years, we also tailor make our (menu brought) to facilitate easier and faster
decisions, when people are in front of our bar.
Over time, of course, some of the customers, they will gradually shift to our coﬀee
forward oﬀerings, when they seek to know more about coﬀee. Did you know that we
have already rolled out our (inaudible) in all our 3,300 stores in China? Now, within
the past 18 months we also introduced Nitro Cold Brew in nearly 400 stores. Also, in
the past nine months we have introduced our Avocado platform in 260 stores in the
market.
We are so excited to see this coﬀee forward platform, leading our growth with 59%
CAGR over the past four years. Now, of course, here in China we have to talk about
tea, right? Everyone, you are in a tea nation, where tea is signiﬁcantly larger than
coﬀee. We have introduced Teavana with a creative interpretation of the Chinese tea
culture an element in 2016.
Our re-imagined tea innovations, posed an exceptional 45% -- sorry 40% CAGR
growth in the past four years. I really cannot wait to have you visit our Teavana bar
later tonight. You will be excited to see, it has far exceeded our expectation. And the
reason is simple. Because we're creating an familiar, yet unexpected experiences on
tea, when people are in front of the bar, it is unique and very premium.
Our seasonal beverage oﬀerings are also helping us to create new occasions in our
stores, as our customers love all kinds of celebration, holiday and festivals. Our
China R&D and marketing team have created relevant beverages for the modern
celebrations. For example the Singles Day on November 11, I think you all know. And
you probably also know the upcoming May 20, the China's Days of Love, because in
Chinese, it's reads, "wo ai ni" "I love you" and all these innovations and products are
created to really attract and delight our millennial customers.
This again demonstrates our ability to remain agile and (inaudible) and importantly
to respond swiftly to the emerging consumer needs. And we have taken a
complementary approach with our food innovations to elevate our core daypart and
develop the new consumer behavior.
For our strongest afternoon daypart, we are constantly evolving and innovating on
our iconic cake series as a coﬀee treat for the aspirational middleclass. And of
course, we are also innovating to ﬁll our morning and lunch daypart with unique
food oﬀerings for every occasion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 18 of 45Emily ChangThe food options, like our proven U.S. breakfast sandwich and bakery line, as well as
the newly introduced Greek yogurt series are the re-fashioned of the latest
consumer taste preferences. And for holidays, the mid-Autumn festival in September.
And Dragon Ball festival in May, we also create modern interpretations of this 1,000
years festivals and occasions. And also give solutions to the middleclass and the
millennial. For example, our Moon Cake retail up for almost USD 100 a box. It's
highly sought after a premium and exclusive gift, when people are looking for
something to express to their loved ones. And this is why our Moon Cake has
exceeded 30% CAGR growth in the past two years.
Now, everything that we do from the store design to our innovative food and
beverage oﬀerings to the gift occasions and options has holistically elevated the
Starbucks experience. They build on each other to truly deliver a premium
experiences within the third place. And this is the reason why the third place remains
the most preferred gathering point and has resonated so well with the modern
Chinese customers.
That said the beautiful store and innovative product are only part of the story. Our
partner's passion to perfect the coﬀee crop is the real key for the success of our
brand. The craftsmanship is actually embedded in the 1,000-years history of China,
as you all know. This comes to life in our store, when pairs of customers serve as
(servu) the Chinese mentor and through the apprentice, just like in the movie Kung
Fu Panda.
So by joining this traditional bond and together in the store, a culture of family is
formed in each and every store we operate. It's culture, it's ampliﬁed by the retail
and coﬀee education program available through our Starbucks China University.
As our partner gain deeper understanding of the bean to cup journey, they graduate
to the next stages, from our core store to Brew Bar, to Reserve Bar and to ﬂagship
and ﬁnally to the highest level of our coﬀee craft, the Shanghai Roastery.
Now, in closing, I am so excited with our third place strategy under the (purpose
chief) on China growth agenda. We are the undisputed leader to bring the Starbucks
third place experiences alive. In a way that was steeped in a deep respect of our
culture here in China and also responsive for the ever-changing needs. I know this is
only the beginning and I cannot describe to you the enormous opportunity ahead of
us when coﬀee becomes a daily ritual here in this market. Thank you, everyone.
And with this, I will hand you to Emily, our CMO, one of the smartest persons I have
worked with. She is going to tell you how we're going to merge digital in third place
and redeﬁne new retail.
{BIO 17006844 <GO>}
Thank you, Leo. It's so inspiring to see these images of the third place and we know
that because of digital, our customers' engagement with our brand begins before
they ever set foot into the store. It extends into the store experience and continuesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 19 of 45even after they leave. And this is what we call the fourth place. It's really one of the
biggest reasons I joined Starbucks about a year ago.
Good morning. I'm Emily Chang and a quick self-introduction. I started my career
with 11 years at Proctor & Gamble, where I immersed in brand management and
consumer insights. Then I was really excited to move to Asia, where I led Apple retail
marketing for the Asia-Paciﬁc region. And in the last four years I've been able to
serve as the chief commercial oﬃcer for IHG looking after a portfolio of 7 brands and
really focusing on that digital engagement.
So with a collective 10 years working in China, I thought I would start oﬀ today by
sharing a little bit about the digital landscape here. You have all heard that China is
diﬀerent. And I guess let's try and talk a little bit about what's diﬀerent.
Let's start with a practical. For instance, you guys have YouTube and we've got Youku.
You've got Google and we've got Baidu. You've got Amazon and we've got Taobao.
Essentially, everything digital in China rolls up to 3 Internet giants we refer to as BAT;
Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.
So what's the meaning behind the fact that we're in a pretty integrated space here.
Let's look at an example, WeChat for instance, the social platform on Tencent. With 1
app I am able to access all the functionality of the suite of apps in the U.S. So just you
can imagine the convenience of going to 1 place and having everything you need in
that ecosystem.
In addition to this integration, we're essentially a non-cash community. What does
that mean? When I go out for my run on Saturday morning with my mobile device,
I've got my running app, I've got my health monitor, I've got my music, my e-book
and my wallet if I want to stop for a cold brew on the way home.
On the other hand, Packaged Facts shares that 79% of American consumers are still
making monthly cash payments. Now that's a pretty material diﬀerence. And with
being non-cash, delivery is ubiquitous here and it's part of our everyday experience.
So we order our food, both prepared and fresh. We order our personal care with a
tap of an app. I can have my masseuse meet me at 9:00 o'clock tonight at my door --
and I'm thinking that sounds like a great idea.
We can order anything. Our family actually ordered our pet bunny Mochi on Taobao
and she was delivered to our home. So this is a little bit about what it's like to live in
the China digital ecosystem. We call it OMO, online merges with oﬄine.
In the States you might have heard the phrase O2O, which is online to oﬄine or
oﬄine to online. The reason China is blown by an O2O model is the two implies
you're starting in one place and then moving to another. But actually it's a fully
integrated experience, right? If you're online you're already looking for oﬄine stores.
If you're in the store oﬄine you're searching online for social commentary on whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 20 of 45you might be considering to buy. And frankly, if we're not delivering an OMO
experience we're not meeting our consumers' needs.
Here's another buzz word coined by our partners at Alibaba, new retail. Daniel
Zhang, group CEO, calls it the harmonious integration of online and oﬄine. Again,
this is digital marketing meets ecommerce meets traditional retail bundled together
to innovate new brand experiences.
So why does OMO and new retail resonate so well here in China?
Our consumers are truly digital natives. Here are a couple of statistics to bring that to
life. For instance, 29% of Chinese consumers, their purchases are inﬂuenced by
social compared to globally, 13%. 41% of Chinese consumers receive their
promotions via social, compared to 34%. And here is a big one. Absolutely true. My
husband is one of these people. 52% of consumers shop daily or weekly on their
mobile phone. My next-door neighbor receives 10 to 15 packages a day, compared
to globally 14%.
So as you can see there's some pretty big diﬀerences from the integration of
platforms, to being essentially a non-cash community, to looking at the lives and the
behaviors of digital natives. Let's transition now from the digital landscape to the
Starbucks digital ﬂywheel and let's start with loyalty because this is all about the
power of our brand.
Chinese customers love Starbucks, they love it. When they're carrying a cup it's like a
badge of honor. And when they walk through the doors of our store, there's a
feeling that they've made it. This is an incredible privilege for us and a deep
responsibility.
You may know as well that the My Starbucks Reward Loyalty Program in China is
diﬀerent than in the States. It's a paid membership here. And nearly 7 million
customers are actively engaged with us, paying to become a part of our community.
This is a really strong connection and it often starts in store between the barista and
the consumer. It's a really meaningful relationship that sometimes runs very deep.
But in the last four years our membership has actually tripled. This is a really fast
growth rate and it's continuing on because for us this isn't about buying one-time
trial. This is true loyalty. It's about human connection and it doesn't end there. We
take that relationship in the store and we extend it into the fourth place. We engage
our consumers, our customers. And our valued members with personal and
delightful content. Did you know that 90% of active app users are using our app.
Loyalty members are using our app.
So how do we get to this level of engagement, where we have these 90-day loyal
members that are actively engaged with our app? Well let's go back to OMO, online
merges with oﬄine. Like in the U.S., Chinese loyalty members can receive beneﬁts
like a free birthday drink and stars with every purchase. In addition, we bring it into
the store. So we have an annual members' night where we invite 5,000 of our mostFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 21 of 45loyal members to about 150 of our select stores and we recognize and we reward
them. We celebrate with them. So they check in digitally and often you'll see like this
customer here, she immediately shares, "Guess where I am tonight?" They enjoy the
sense of community. It's not just online, it's real, it's oﬄine. It's with our baristas,
coﬀee tastings, as well as with each other. This is about community and
connectedness.
And it's not just this loyalty event because we also have an annual coﬀee festival that
extends across all 3,200 stores. Last autumn we had over 50,000 customers join us
in coﬀee tastings all over the region and this really comes back to our core purpose
of being. Starbucks is a diﬀerent kind of company. We celebrate individual customer
needs. And the customer always comes ﬁrst.
You might have heard this statistic that in China we have about a quarter of the
stores of the U.S. and about half the active members and growing. Again, this tells
me that our brand is strong and engaged and beloved. And it's my amazing job to
strengthen and nurture these shared moments of genuine connection because
Starbucks is an experiential brand.
We spent nearly 20 years in China creating these moments of connections in our
coﬀeehouses and in the fourth place we can build on that trust to go further. You've
probably heard of our social gifting program, Say It with Starbucks. It's a program we
co-created with Tencent but it's about so much more than gifting, because if the
third place, Leo talked about, is about curated stories and experiences with our
partners, the fourth place enables a diﬀerent sort of community, storytelling,
discovery and experience. With, Say it with Starbucks, we come back to the core
purpose, creating moments everywhere we are.
You see in Chinese culture there's a bit of an inhibition and sometimes we struggle
to share our innermost feelings. Let me bring this to life, as a Chinese American, here
is my schizophrenic side. As an American if I call my mom, I would call her and say,
"Hi. mom, how are you doing? I haven't talked to you in so long. I love you and miss
you." And a Chinese daughter would have the same heartfelt emotion, right? But she
would express it diﬀerently, she would say, "Mom, it's getting cold out. Are you
warm? I just went and bought you some long underwear."
How do we help our consumers express their deepest emotions and when is it most
relevant? Well Chinese New Year is not only the largest human migration in the
world, it's also the most emotional holiday we have in China. It's when we all go
home and see our families. This year over Chinese New Year, Say it with Starbucks
reached out to our customers and we asked them, what do you most wish you could
say to your parents when you see them this year. But you're afraid you're not going
to be able to? What do you most anticipate about going home? And what do you
most dread?
And again, because we have such an engaged customer community we received
over 200,000 feedbacks overnight. We collected that feedback and shared it backFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 22 of 45out in the form of an infographic and we shared some interesting facts with our
community. For instance, did you know that more than half of you guys have shouted
to a celebrity "I love you" but only 18% of you have told your mom and dad you love
them?
You told us that the #1 thing you wish you could tell your parents this Chinese New
Year is, "Mom and dad, I know everything you've sacriﬁced for me." This is incredibly
deep. And what an opportunity for us to help our consumers express something
that's really important to express. So we're really inspired by this.
We took the most desired messages and we turned them into digital gift cards. The
bestselling gift card is this one right here. "I understand all that you've sacriﬁced for
me." We have some cute ones as well. "Yes, mom, you're always right."
And some other just really cute and meaningful messages that we were able to help
our customers say for the ﬁrst time to their loved ones, to Say it with Starbucks. This
social gifting platform, it's so powerful. It enables shared connections and two-way
conversations and this ties back to our core purpose at Starbucks. It's just so
powerful and humbling to be able to use this kind of scale for good and it brings
customers into our digital ﬂywheel.
See when I send you a Say it with Starbucks you may or may not be a Starbucks
customer. But you're going to go into our store to redeem and enjoy your gift and
what I love about this is when you do you'll meet our passionate baristas and you
deepen that connection with the brand.
And I'm delighted to share that the Say it with Starbucks social gifting is now
available also on the Alibaba platform. So whether you use Tencent or Alibaba, our
customers are now all able to Say it with Starbucks.
Okay. So sometimes you see a photo like this one and it's a robotic arm and it's
called digital. I would like to pause here and say I don't see this as digital
enablement. Because to me what matters to me in terms of digital is something that
enables a deeper and more meaningful human connection. So what digital
enablement enables more human connection? It may not look sexy like a robot arm.
But what's really sexy to me is digital payments.
As you have heard we're over 60% digital tender between WeChat Pay and Alipay
and when you look at all of our payment types in the store we're 80% cash free. This
is an incredible beneﬁt because I know what my customers are buying and I know
their preferred payment types, it's a great opportunity to send customized and
tailored messages that better delight.
It extends beyond a beneﬁt with the customers as well to our partners. Did you know
that on average in a store our partners spend 7.5 hours processing cash? In one
month now we're freeing up 30 hours per store to further engage with our
customers, to deepen that human connection and to perfect our coﬀee craft. To meFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 23 of 45this is the point of digital enablement. It's not about a robot arm or a driverless
coﬀee, it's about purpose-driven innovation, it's smartly and creatively leveraging
digital to tell stories, to engage customers and to share our coﬀee craft.
Speaking of coﬀee craft, you've heard of the Roastery and you have probably heard
of the AR experience we've created. I'm excited to share it with you later today. And
did you know that we've already extended our AR experience to all of our core
stores?
Again, speaking of Chinese New Year, this is the Year of the Dog, super cute year,
very close to my heart. And we knew that over Chinese New Year this market would
be overrun with dogs and we asked ourselves, how do we extend a warm genuine
Chinese New Year greeting to our customers as only Starbucks can?
So once again we partnered with Alibaba and we created this -- an experience
where a customer walks up to the store, they scan the siren and one of 12 Chinese
New Year greetings pops out at them through AR and they receive a digital red
envelope, in Chinese it's called the ang-pau and it's the customary gift we give each
over Chinese New Year. The digital cash in a red envelope immediately slots into the
customer's digital wallet. This is how it looks when you actually walk through the
store.
(presentation)
And we've really only just begun, just over the Chinese New Year period that was
scanned 8 million times. There's so much more that we can do with AR in-store
digital experience. With digital payment we're creating seamless, more convenient
experiences, social gifting is enabling those two-way conversations and that
connection that we talked about and as we talked about as well, digital payment.
Loyalty is starting to really bring the entire digital ﬂywheel to life.
Do you know that even some of our coﬀee machines in stores are IoT enabled?
Imagine the online merging with oﬄine experience that we can unlock. Can you tell
that I'm excited to be here and I love my job? And as Belinda said, it's absolutely
true. We have to earn this right to be here every day. We have to earn our customer's
trust. And I believe that every disruptive elevated experience we create has to be
thoughtfully crafted.
I can't tell you how excited I am. I've been asked to lead our delivery experience.
And this is going to meet our Starbucks mission of inspiring and nurturing the
human spirit. One person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time might I add
wherever you are. It's about uncompromising quality with the product. So wherever
you are it tastes just like the barista has just handed it to you over the counter.
And though I've just been here about a year, I'll tell you I've spent hours riding on
the backs of these scooters with delivery riders. We've ordered hundreds of
packages and products. We want to understand end-to-end the experience, whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

wait to share more with you on this soon because I believe our meticulous approach
to this really important element of a digital customer experience is going to be
delightful, authentic and only Starbucks.
So let's wrap up the fourth place. It's about how we strengthen and deepen
connection with our partners, our customers and our communities. Our stores are
beautiful and it's about more than the number of stores we open. Digitally, it's about
more than the number of clicks and taps and impressions, because it's about the
quality of each and every relationship. Authenticity and trust that our customers have
with our brand and to me that is our new retail. Thank you.

All right, everyone that concludes the ﬁrst half of our presentations. We're going to
take about a 20-minute break right here. So everybody get up, we'll stretch, we'll
have some refresh sampling of food and beverage for you and we will back to start

Welcome back, everyone. We'll give everyone a moment to get seated here. We're
all kind of assimilating here. So to kick oﬀ the second part of our day here, it's my
pleasure to introduce David Hanson, Vice President of China Asia Paciﬁc Channel
Development.
{BIO 20936171 <GO>}
So good morning. I'm David Hanson. And I have the pleasure of leading the Channel
Development Business for China and the Asia Paciﬁc region.
For the past three years I've been continually humbled by the way our Chinese
consumers welcome and love the Starbucks brand. Each day, Channel Development
works to extend the Starbucks experience beyond our retail stores that Leo and
Emily worked so hard to create. Channel Development is poised to bring new
customers to our retail stores by introducing them to the brand where our stores and
locations don't exist today.
I've lived and worked in China for almost 10 years now, previously working for
Proctor & Gamble and now Starbucks. I joined Starbucks in 2010 during the early
days of Channel Development. I moved back to Shanghai in 2015 to lead our
Channel Development business. And today, we've the opportunity to lead the
rapidly expanding ready-to-drink market with tailor made beverages for China in
China.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 25 of 45Now, you've heard many interesting insights about the rising middleclass and their
aspirational lifestyles that does represent tremendous growth opportunity. Let's take
a moment and consider what this means through the lens of the ready-to-drink
coﬀee and tea business.
While the China RTD coﬀee category is worth about $1.2 billion annually and
showing double-digit growth, it's still just a fraction of the size of Japan and half the
size of the U.S. Our consumers, primarily drink coﬀee in the afternoon. But today's
millennials are busier than ever. Some of these consumers have actually started
drinking coﬀee immediately after they leave home on their way to the oﬃce or at the
oﬃce. Plus drinking coﬀee throughout their day.
Disposable income is also on the rise. Chinese consumers born before 1995 spend
far more money on travel, entertainment and shopping. Starbucks RTD aligns to
these on-the-go occasions and it's becoming even more convenient than ever to
ﬁnd our products. In fact, the emerging convenience store channel now has over
50,000 stores with new stores opening literally every hour. You'll ﬁnd them in literally
every apartment building or oﬃce as you travel.
E-commerce is another emerging opportunity. It's becoming a major shopping habit
of choice and making shopping convenient no matter where you are. So to better
understand the Chinese millennial and our opportunity, let's zoom in on the day of a
life of one of our consumers. Let's talk about Tiﬀany. Tiﬀany is a 28 year old digital
marketing manager working right here in Shanghai for a multinational company.
Tiﬀany is like many other Chinese professionals. She works incredibly hard at her job.
She earns a reasonable income. In fact, she earns almost twice as much as she would
have earned just 10 years ago.
Her typical day, she starts on the metro. She's drinking one of our new Starbucks
Doubleshot and she is skimming the news on her iPhone and she heads into the
oﬃce where she's ready to take on the day.
This gives here an early start to the day and, besides, there isn't a Starbucks store in
her oﬃce. Well not yet, it's coming. But because of her busy lifestyle, she's that new
generation that is drinking coﬀee before starting work.
After her morning meetings she'll break for lunch at exactly 12:00 o'clock with her
coworkers. On the way back from lunch she'll stop at a newly opened convenience
store in her building and buy herself an afternoon pick me up. She will pay for that
using Alipay on her phone as she does for almost all her purchase.
Later that weekend her and friends decide to celebrate their hard work and may go
to see a movie at a new premium movie cinema. They head out shopping after the
movie and they stop by their favorite Starbucks store for a celebratory Peach
Blossom Tea Latte.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 26 of 45Tiﬀany's journey will oﬀer Starbucks more and more opportunities for us to interact
with her lifestyle. And there will be more and more Tiﬀany's in the marketplace. So
we're challenging ourselves to create new beverages in new locations in China for
China. And with the support of our local strategic partner, (Tingyi) China's largest
beverage manufacturer and distributor, we're already addressing key opportunities.
So let me start to introduce our ready-to-drink lineup starting with bottled
Frappuccino. Similar to our approach we take with retail, we sat down with RTD
consumers to understand their beverage taste preferences and occasion trends. This
local insight combined with our China dedicated research and development team
led us to introducing 6 tailor made ﬂavors, including Starbucks signature coﬀee and
2 entirely new to the world, tea blends.
Matcha Green Tea and Black Tea Frappuccino already represent over 20% of our
Frappuccino business. We've already heard this is a tea centric culture and so our
opportunity for growth in this area is plenty. Consumers love the taste and they love
the iconic bottle. In fact, they're reusing that bottle for arts and crafts and in-home
decoration.
Since the launch of bottled Frappuccino we've already placed Frappuccino in over
50,000 places of distribution. We have access to distribution in over 200 cities. And
we're making it easy for consumers like Tiﬀany to ﬁnd our products throughout the
day.
In less than two years we've delighted our on-the-go consumer with over 40 million
servings. And although we're still a relatively small player in China, we've already
tripled our market share and we're the leading coﬀee brand. For perspective, it took
us almost ﬁve years to achieve the same sales and market share status in Japan.
With 10 years local expertise we have access to China's elevated premium specialty
channels, cinemas, high speed trains, 5 star hotels and of course, your favorite
premium grocery and convenience stores.
The success of Frappuccino led us to the recently launched tailor-made Doubleshot.
And when I say recently, I mean just 4 weeks ago, we launched Doubleshot as the
preferred energy boost to fuel today's busy lifestyle of our millennial.
Starbucks Doubledshot was launched in 4 China exclusive packaging with 4 tailor-
made ﬂavors. It's convenient grab-and-go single serve size makes it easy to be
distributed across China even as we speak today. These initial ﬂavors are just the
beginning. Our China R&D team has a full range of plans to launch new concepts
and formulations for future release.
But the opportunity doesn't end here. In fact, I'm proud to announce for the very ﬁrst
time the launch of Starbucks Chilled Cup, arriving on shelf June 12th. Our new
Chilled Cup is a premium coﬀee and tea refreshment in our retail inspired cup. You
can enjoy it at home, on-the-go or right now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 27 of 45Now, I apologize to those of you on the webcast. But you'll have to wait till June 12th
and enjoy it in one of your favorite stores. But please enjoy. I've put a few tasting
notes here. Pop the little straw out and away you go to enjoy our newest
refreshment. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.
Our new cup combines the most refreshing dairy and Starbucks signature coﬀee to
bring consumers the creamy latte experience with every sip. Chilled Cup has been
incredibly successful in Korea and Japan and continues to grow. And we know with
the retail connection of this brand, this will be a huge success here in China.
So considering what we've launched in a relatively short period of time, the future
innovation plans that we have, we expect our ready-to-drink business to dramatically
grow in the next ﬁve years. We expect to move from our current 50,000 points of
distribution to 125,000 points of distribution. We'll move to being available in
around 200 cities to being available in over 400 cities across China.
And we expect to grow from 40 million servings that we've served to date to serving
over 200 million servings annually. This is an increase of more than 5x our current
business and will clearly establish Starbucks as one of the largest beverage
companies in coﬀee by 2023.
This means Channel Development will clearly extend the Starbucks experience well
beyond our retail stores and be a complement to our Starbucks retail stores.
But this is only within ready-to-drink. We now have a new opportunity through our
recently announced strategic alliance with Nestle to capitalize on the wide space we
haven't even touched today in the areas of single serve, at-home coﬀee and
premium food service. As Kevin shared, this alliance opens the door to accelerate
our pace to enter the single serve space and Nestle's established machine platforms,
whether it's Nespresso or Dolce Gusto. It also elevates our at-home coﬀee
experience by leveraging Nestle's vast reach and scale through their current
business with convenience stores, grocery stores and other established channels.
Importantly, it addresses our signiﬁcant wide space opportunity in food service,
giving us access to premium oﬃces and 5 Star hotels across China. So we're
conﬁdent of the channel development opportunity, especially when you consider
ﬁrst; we have a strong Starbucks brand in China. Second, we have the right local and
global strategic partners to help us win. And third, we have a growing consumer
base that's discovering how coﬀee ﬁts into their aspirational lifestyle.
The in-China for-China channel development opportunity is immense. And I promise
you, we're ready to win in China. Thank you.
Now I appreciate your patience because I know you've been waiting for the ﬁnancial
reports and analysts. So without further ado, please I would like to welcome Weiwei
Chen, our CFO.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

Page 28 of 45Weiwei Chen{BIO 18793166 <GO>}
Thank you, David. Good morning. Welcome to Shanghai. Welcome to my
hometown. I'm Weiwei Chen, China's CFO. I was born and raised in Shanghai and
have been working here for the past 19 years. I am a 3-year partner. Prior to
Starbucks I was with Young China where I learned a lot about retail from a strong
China QSR operator. I joined Starbucks for the love of the brand that I have been a
loyal customer for 25 years. I joined the company also for my career goal of being
part of a fast-growing business.
The past three years has been a very rewarding and fulﬁlling journey for me. The
numbers on the next slide you will see are the best testament. I am extremely proud
to be part of the team that contributed to this outstanding performance.
What I would like to highlight today is that our success is not only attributable to our
scale, to our ability to scale and innovate. But also a direct result of our disciplined
growth approach.
For nearly 20 years we have been practicing our Kung Fu as we grow. Learn to ﬁnd
the real estate, recruit and train the right people to open stores, build relationships
with the local government and community. We repeat the same for each new store
we build and each new market we enter. We have in place a stringent investment
approval, monitoring and reporting processes and cross-functional collaboration
mechanisms to address any performance issues. As a result of this, I see many of you
are taking photos. As a result of this very disciplined approach our business is in a
very healthy state.
We have had tremendous growth on both top and bottom line over the past four
years. The biggest driver behind such growth is our store development, which grew
from 1,000 stores back in FY '13 to close to 3,300 today. We also achieved fantastic
comp growth. China comps have stood in the mid-single digits for the past 34
consecutive quarters.
We are in people business serving coﬀee and continuing to elevate our partner
experience is the most important investment we make. As you can see here, in the
top two charts, turnover in our retail and support center partners is much lower
compared to industry average. This is one of the reasons behind Starbucks China
being awarded employer of choice multiple years. This also means that our
investment helped to retain a very stable workforce, enabling us to deepen the
partner and customer connection.
At the same time, the beneﬁt of low turnover helps to improve our labor productivity
and eﬃciency when coupled with scale growth. The bottom 2 charts, as you can see
here, show average store headcount and (IPL) both improved double-digits
respectively in spite of our (salivative) store development pace, which required us to
have partners hired, trained and in place to operate new stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 29 of 45As I mentioned earlier, our China growth is largely driven by store development and
it will continuously to be so in the foreseeable future. Over the past ﬁve years our
overall store cash proﬁtability signiﬁcantly improved by more than 800 basis points
to 39%. This kind of result can only be achieved through a very disciplined approach.
Looking at ﬁrst year new store cash proﬁtability and ROI, you guys have to agree with
me they are best-in-class performances. Not to mention that these numbers were
achieved while we accelerated our new store development pace.
In addition, you can see that our ﬁrst -- our new stores in top tier cities continue to
generate very healthy returns, while lower tier cities beneﬁt from better labor and
rental structure are generating even more impressive results.
I can't stress enough how hard our retail partners worked to achieve this kind of
returns, particularly when they have to leave their families to open new markets.
These economics give us the conﬁdence and credibility to continue to execute our
store development strategy, go wide, go deep.
As you just heard, we're going to accelerate our store development pace by 20%
from 500 new stores each year to 600. We look forward to entering to 100 new cities
in the coming ﬁve years where we can bring our Starbucks experience to even more
Chinese customers.
Now, let me talk about our largest category beverage, which accounts for more than
70% of our sales mix. Over the past four years we have seen this category growing at
a CAGR over 30%. While our core and our seasonal category -- our seasonal mix are
growing very strong. What I would like to highlight is brewed coﬀee and tea
categories, those still small in mix but have been our biggest growth drivers.
The growth of our brew coﬀee category has been the result of our intentional coﬀee
forward strategy. Today almost a third of our portfolio is coﬀee forward stores. The
AUVs for these stores are on average 20% higher for the same age class and have
on par proﬁtability compared to same age class core stores, despite higher
investments for the elevated customer experience. Our coﬀee-forward strategy is
working in China. We want to continue investing in this strategy.
The launch of our Teavana Iced Shaken Tea platform over the past couple of years
has helped to drive the growth of our tea category. Our Chinese customers love this
new innovation, which combines our core iced tea, with the unique freshly steeped
fruits that is useful, refreshing and relevant to their taste. I encourage all of you to
really try this new innovation while you're here.
In addition, tea is actually a strong brand recruiter, about 17% of our new customers
ﬁrst Starbucks purchase is a tea beverage, as tea is an approachable, welcoming
beverage to the Chinese customer.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 30 of 45We see Teavana as a viable platform to grow our brand appeal and the Roastery
Teavana innovation gives us great conﬁdence to continue to grow this category.
Let me now turn to some of the growth opportunities that we're working on, which
will deliver very exciting results for us.
Let's talk about dayparts. Chinese dayparts are quite evenly spread throughout the
day. This is actually a unique advantage in terms of asset utilization. Unlike the U.S.
dayparts, where morning is 50% of the mix, we have the ability to better deploy
labor throughout the day. We can also avoid investing extra store equipment that are
required to beat the peak hour capacity needs. We have seen an emerging faster
morning daypart growth as our customers are developing their morning coﬀee
ritual. To expand this daypart we are building more stores closer to oﬃces and
residential communities that can bring morning convenience to our customers. In
addition, we are increasing food oﬀerings that speciﬁcally target to this daypart. Our
bakery products and Greek yogurt cups are big hits. Today, we see a much higher
morning daypart mix for top tier cities due to a more developed coﬀee ritual and
higher Starbucks store base. We believe that the morning daypart mix will continue
to grow while we expand into lower tier cities as consumption behavior catches up
to top tiers over time.
Let us talk about East China. East China by far is Starbucks' largest investment. The
East China integration will allow us to scale faster and help to prioritize investments
holistically across China.
Let me highlight a few areas of opportunities for you. We see opportunity and
leverage the East China talent pool that has strong operation expertise we can
deploy at national level to accelerate our growth. We can also leverage our branded
Starbucks China University training and development programs to beneﬁt the entire
45,000 partner population.
Furthermore, we see synergy in partner investment programs that enable us to make
holistic decisions at national level to continue to elevate our partner experience. We
see synergy in the supply chain as a result of combined skill. For sourcing we can
drive upstream commodity management in terms of price competitiveness and
quality management. Let me give you an example. Today 2/3 of the East China
procurement base has diﬀerent suppliers. We see opportunity to integrate the 2
supplier bases over time, which can give us signiﬁcant cost advantage.
Through more synergistic supplier management we can also execute better on our
food safety goal standards to deliver a consistent brand experience. Our logistic
network we see synergy introducing competition through logistic provider selection
and more optimized planning for distribution centers and delivery routes.
As we advance our China digital ﬂywheel we can leverage the combined market to
seamless deploy programs like delivery, MOP and MSR personalization. We see
opportunity in speed to market now that we no longer have to rely and negotiateFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 31 of 45John Culverwith the former JV partner. Furthermore we see opportunity in cost eﬃciency as
there is no longer a need to duplicate investments in 2 markets.
For marketing, we have moved from 2 seasonal campaigns to 1. We can move from 2
oﬃcial websites to 1 integrated site with better presentation and cost eﬃciency. For
market insight we can reduce redundancies and analysis, consumers research and
reporting.
We see opportunity to integrate 2 full programs leveraging Starbucks R&D
capability. We believe our China R&D lab's new innovation can beneﬁt the East
China market to provide our customers with relevant and consistent food oﬀerings.
As a matter of fact, the East China market has a larger morning and lunch daypart
compared to rest of China. This gives us opportunity to bring better breakfast and
lunch food programs to the East China market to fully leverage and grow these 2
dayparts.
I am certain there is more out there for us to uncover as we go deeper over time. In a
nutshell, the East China integration will enable faster decision making, faster
execution of roll-out, better cost eﬃciency where we have a uniﬁed market. With all
the China growth strategies my peers highlighted earlier, we see immense growth
opportunity for East China. Again, we are only ﬁve months into East China
integration, there is much more learning ahead of us. I am happy to report that the
ﬁrst ﬁve months business is stable so is the East China organization. The China team
is committed to make this integration a success.
In conclusion, we see tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us. We will
continue our strong store development strategy to further penetrate in key markets
and expand into lower tiers. We will continue to work hard on our third place, digital
and out-of-home innovations to delight our Chinese customers and drive growth; at
the same time applying our disciplined growth approach in all investments and
executions to take us to the next level.
On the basis of FY '17 actuals, which include East China as a joint venture, we expect,
there should be a next slide -- we expect China's revenue to more than triple and
operating income to more than double by the end of FY '22. This is a very exciting
time for China. The China team is both energized and committed to deliver these
growth targets. And I am eager and proud to continue elevating this team through
this historical growth in China.
Now, let me introduce John Culver, our Group President, International Channel
Development to talk to you about building an enduring company in China. Thank
you very much.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody and ﬁrst oﬀ I just want to take this opportunity to
welcome all of you to Shanghai in our ﬁrst ever Investor Day in this market. I would
like to remind you that not only are you in China. But also in Shanghai, where weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 32 of 45have more stores than any other Starbucks city around the world. And it is just the
beginning of what is going to be the largest market for Starbucks that we operate
anywhere in the world.
I hope that over the course of this morning you've gotten a sense for the type of
company that we are building and the type of business that we have been able to
build over the last 20 years. And more importantly, the tremendous work that the
team has done here over the last ﬁve years to really accelerate the growth, to do it in
the right way. And to really bring to life through our partners this love, this passion,
this sense of family. And the sense of belonging that has made Starbucks one of the
most admired and respected companies doing business in China today, whether it is
a Chinese company or whether it is a multinational company. It's something that we
are very, very, very proud of. And it is something that we take very seriously.
I also hope that you walk away, not only from this morning. But more importantly as
you go through your day-to-day, as well as tomorrow, this sense of the opportunity
that we have for Starbucks' growth in China. We have outlined for you. And you will
get a strong sense, as to why we believe Starbucks has decades of growth ahead of
us here in this strategic market.
I also hope that you understand that the team that Belinda and the leadership team
has assembled here is world class, unlike any other leadership team that exists for
any retailer doing business in China. It's their depth of experience, it's the
knowledge of the Chinese customers, it's their unwavering commitment. And more
importantly the way in which they have been able to elevate the 45,000 partners
and build that passion and pride in creating a great Starbucks experience for our
customers each and every day. It is built on the mission and values that have made
Starbucks a great company and it is something that is at the core of our success and
will continue to be at the core of our success here.
I have no doubt in my mind that China will continue to lead the way for Starbucks as
the fastest growing market with an unprecedented growth opportunity, where we
will have tens of thousands of stores one day and we will deﬁnitely be the leader for
Starbucks globally.
Now, before I take the opportunity and go into the Q&A with everybody and I know
you probably have a lot of questions. I wanted to take this opportunity to take a step
back and to zoom out a little bit. So that you can understand how the immense
China opportunity ﬁts into the bigger construct of the CAP region as you know it.
So the CAP Region consists of China, it consists of Japan. And there are 14 other
markets that we operate across this region. 3 of the top 5 largest markets for
Starbucks sit in this part of the world in terms of store count, in terms of revenue, in
terms of operating income. And in fact, CAP, the segment, represents our highest
margin segment we operate in the company outside of Channel Development. And
we're just getting started.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 33 of 45Across the region, we have 122,000 partners who serve 21 million customers a week.
We have over 8,000 stores. And as you have seen through our performance, these
stores and these markets perform very, very, very well. And if you look at the overall
growth rate across CAP in the most recent quarter, we grew revenue an astounding
54%. When you take and you normalize for FX and you normalize for equity
adjustments, we actually grew (13%), leading the way for the company.
More importantly, two years ago, we outlined for you growth targets that we would
achieve by 2021. In December of 2016, we talked about our ability and belief in CAP
that we would deliver what we called a triple double 2x revenue growth, 2x store
count growth and more than 2x growth in our operating income across these
markets. We are well on our way to achieving those goals. And we will update those
goals in December when we are together in New York.
Now as you look across the region, there are 3.5 billion people that live in this part of
the world. 30% are under the age of 29. And the GDP growth in this part of the
world is an astounding 5%. Really the themes that you'll see are really in 3 key areas.
First, the increasing growth of consumer spending, the rising middleclass, the rapid
urbanization that is taking place. And the strong sustained economic growth that is
expected for the foreseeable future.
There are going to be millions of new consumers who are going to add trillions in
spending power over the next few years in this part of the world. And as their
aspirational lifestyles expose them to new brands, to new experiences, many of them
will be coming to Starbucks for their very ﬁrst cup of coﬀee. The strong growth, the
momentum across the region, is going to drive the future growth for Starbucks as a
company around the world.
Now, let me drill in to a few of the markets in particular that I'd like to share with you.
And let's ﬁrst talk about Asia Paciﬁc, okay? Asia Paciﬁc consists of 14 markets, from
Singapore, where we opened our ﬁrst store in 1996, to our newest market,
Cambodia, which we opened in 2016. Across Asia Paciﬁc, we operate 3,400 stores
and we have over 40,000 partners.
A key statistic here is we are opening a store each and every day in Asia Paciﬁc. And
our stores, similar to what we're doing in China are pushing boundaries in terms of
the design, in terms of the coﬀee and beverage innovation. And more importantly, in
terms of the partner experience and the customer connection.
Moving to South Korea, South Korea, we opened our very ﬁrst store in 1999. We were
a joint venture partnership with Shinsegae group. Not many people know but South
Korea is our ﬁfth largest market today. We're approaching 1,200 stores and our
system sales exceed way over $1 billion. What is really great about Korea is the digital
experience that they have been able to create. And in particular they were the ﬁrst
market to introduce siren order, which is actually the ﬁrst evolution of mobile order
and pay as well as Starbucks Rewards in this part of the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 34 of 45Today in Korea we have over 4 million My Starbucks Rewards members and we are
increasing membership 30% a year on a year-on-year basis. Last month we
introduced voice ordering in Korea. And the initial reaction from our customers from
the market overall has been far above the expectations that we had.
Now, another market that not many people pay attention to is Indonesia. And we see
a tremendous opportunity for growth in Indonesia. We have 330 stores. GDP in
Indonesia is expected to grow 5% this year. And the overall population is 270 million,
expected to be 270 million by 2021. And that represents about 13% of the total Asia
Paciﬁc population. Indonesia is an opportunity for us to continue to accelerate our
growth.
Let's go to India. India, as many of you know, has demonstrated very strong GDP
growth from 5% to 8% historically and projected to do that over the next several
years. India, 1.4 billion people. We now have been in this market for ﬁve years. We
have over 110 stores and we just opened our seventh market and city in India. Similar
to China, where we've been here now for 20 years, we are taking a very long-term
view on India. And we believe that if we can continue to focus on building our brand
the right way, building the connection with our customers and our partners the right
way, that one day India will be one of the top 5 largest markets for Starbucks that we
operate in the world. I have no doubt.
Now, let's talk about Japan. Starbucks Japan was the very ﬁrst international market
outside of North America. This year we celebrate 22 years in Japan. And we operate
more than 1,300 stores across all the prefectures in Japan. In Japan we're focused on
continuing to expand our store footprint. We've now accelerated the growth of our
stores and are opening over 100 stores a year in that market.
We've elevated our core oﬀerings and we've made investments in the digital
ﬂywheel. We recently launched Starbucks Rewards in September. And during that
time from September to the point we are now, we now have over 2.4 million
Starbucks Rewards members who have entered that program, which has far
exceeded the expectations. And in the most recent quarter, we delivered positive
comp in Japan for the ﬁrst time since 2017.
Going forward, we're going to continue to focus on how can we continue to
accelerate our growth in Japan while capturing share in that strategic and major
market. Still a big opportunity in Japan. Now, I often get asked the question by
people of what has made Starbucks successful in this part of the world. And what has
been the secret to our success. And it's very simple. And I think you're going to see
this over the course of the next two days.
At the end of the day, the reason why customers continue to return to Starbucks.
And new customers continue to seek the Starbucks experience is because of our
people. It's our partners who deliver an unparalleled Starbucks experience each and
every day to the customers that they serve. And it's literally one cup at a time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantIf you think what Leo talked about. And you talk about the Brew Bar, we are actually
educating Chinese customers one by one on what high quality is. And our partners
are at the center of bringing that to life. And it's because of that we have been able
to create and demonstrate that Starbucks is much more than a coﬀee retailer. We are
humanity, we are community, we are connections and we oﬀer a daily dose of
optimism in a third place where anyone and everyone is welcome.
Our transaction levels in this part of the world have never been higher and we see a
continued opportunity for upside. And nowhere is the Starbucks experience alive
and well more so than right here in China. And you will see and experience that,
Starbucks has cracked the code in China in a way that few other brands have been
able to do so. But we recognize that our past success is not an entitlement and we
have to continue to earn the trust, the respect, the loyalty of our customers and the
love of our partners each and every day.
Throughout the 20 years that we've been here, we have strived to build a diﬀerent
type of company and I am very proud to say to Belinda, to the leadership team, to
the 45,000 partners here in China I am incredibly proud of what you have been able
to build, the way in which you bring it to life. And more importantly the way in which
you represent our company. And represent the mission and values that we hold so
dear. Thank you very much.
Now I have also had the opportunity to work in this part of the world to lead the CAP
region over the last 12 years for the company. And I can honestly say and
unequivocally say that our China business has never been stronger, our aspirations
have never been greater and our future here in this part of the world has never been
brighter. And we commit to you that we will continue to grow this business the right
way, we'll commit to you that we will continue to drive this success of the business to
make everybody proud, our partners, our shareholders, our customers. And each
other.
So thank you guys so much for being here, thank you for making the investment to
travel here, this is an historic moment for our company here in China. And we're
proud to have you all here to be a part of it. So thank you.
So with that what we're going to do is we're going to go to Q&A and what I'd like to
do is invite the leadership team to come up and join me as well as Scott and Kevin
and then we will get into Q&A session all right?

Q - John Stephenson Glass
A - Kevin R. Johnson(Steven Jurn, Baird) My question is about the East China business, I think you shared
some very impressive metrics on sort of the low returns but I think that was excluding
East China. So I was wondering if you could maybe just directionally even talk about
what the returns on the new units in East China are so that we can frame up sort of
how to think about that and then perhaps -- if you think about 600 units a year let's
talk about how many -- what proportionate could come from East China versus the
rest of China.
I'll take the ﬁrst part David and commit that when we come back in the December
Investor Day we'll give you an update of all of mainland China including East China
store metrics, you can imagine with the integration going on we're getting arms
around all of the return. And we know the market pretty well but we really want to
make sure that we can give you the right level of historical performance and current
performance for East China. So we'll do that in the December Investor Day, we just
want to run the market for a couple of more quarters and as far as the growth
opportunities maybe I'll turn that to Belinda.
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
The new stores are performing pretty well and will continue -- I am very pleased to
say that we are track on our new store growth this year as well, even though we are
ﬁve months into the integration. So what else do you want to on Weiwei on theâ€¦
{BIO 18793166 <GO>}
I think the question was, how would you be balanced in between the 2 markets in
terms of stores, I think we work making sure that we capture all the opportunities
executing the -- executing our strategy in terms of the go wide and go deep. So
obviously, now having combined market and to take into consideration will not be
separate -- instead of setting separate targets rather setting targets holistically for
China.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Thanks, it's John Glass from Morgan & Stanley, 2 question what is -- just got -- just
very basic one how what is the percentage of proﬁts that come from China today if
you pro forma it for the acquisition, we all done a back of the -- math envelope but I
just-- envelop math but I just want to make sure it's right. Secondly, when you talk
about the expansion with -- it's all right in unit growth, how do you think about tiers
of cities so what's the current estate from tier 1, 2 to the -- through the ﬁfth tiers and
where is that incremental growth coming, is it pro rata or are you're pushing more
into lower tier markets because there is a greater opportunity to grow vis-a-vis let's
say the larger tier markets.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}

as far as maybe the tier cities Belinda, do you want to talk about that?
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Yes, I am very excited about new store target, we have had a strategy to make sure
that we focus on the key markets in China and we're going to continue to do that
because it's important that we continue to nurture and build the brand in the key
strategic markets. And the lower tier cities, as you can see the economics are doing
fantastically well for us and it's such a privilege for the partners -- for the customers
to be to now really waiting for Starbucks to enter their city and we have a certain
percentage of going to key markets, which is a majority and then we are not going to
just go chase after store counts we are going to do that in a very disciplined way
winning in our brand and in China. So I'll let Leo to talk a little bit more about it if you
want anything to add.
{BIO 19965066 <GO>}
Thank you, Belinda, actually Belinda was just sharing about the 100 store, 100 city
entry in the next ﬁve years and pretty much all of this 100 cities are in the tier 5 as we
deﬁne it. So what it means is every year we're going to bring the brand into another -
- around 20 cities of this tier 5 cities that are entering into. And as Belinda just said,
all these cities requires are patience and discipline to grow because it typically take a
few years to really work with our customers and the market there to (view) the coﬀee
rituals and gradually we can see the acceleration of a city of that scale.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
It's John Ivankoe, J.P Morgan, the question was on opening 600 stores a year and
obviously we understand when you put in mobile order and pay in the United States
there are some operational changes and maybe some physical changes that needed
to happen in the U.S. store base and delivery is another complication perhaps to add
the store design and store operations as well. So the question is when you do
contemplate these 600 new stores a year, how much are going to be speciﬁcally
optimized for mobile order and pay and delivery capability. And the question is also
how easy or diﬃcult is it to begin a retroﬁt some of your current estate to some of
that next generation digital new type of an issuance which were clearly where the
market is going?
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Great question. I have the privilege to run the market that I opened 600 stores and I
only have 3,300 right now. So I can do whatever I want on the new stores. So
meaning that I am building my new stores with the space and -- all ready for our
future innovations to make sure that we're spending on investment wisely. So in
terms of the future MOP or delivery we've already thought about that and how we
could allocate the space and make sure that that investment the ﬁrst time its
covering the basic infrastructure at the store and the service level that we needed to
have. So and I think you heard us say many times today that running China is real -- I
can't really just describe to you how dynamic it is because we are in 141 cities and it's
like running 141 markets. Once you enter you have to nurture. And then you have toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

platform, we have new stores are being built every 15 hours, that's already thinking
about that.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Jeﬀrey Bernstein from Barclays. 2 questions, maybe just one from an industry
backdrop perspective being that most of us don't have our feet on the ground here
and we don't necessarily have the same third-party data that perhaps we have in the
States. So I was just wondering if maybe you could just frame for us just the size of
the category that we're talking about, maybe the -- your biggest competitors. But
other than your competitors just -- then maybe the categories growing the food-at-
home versus food away-from-home, just something to kind of size up the scale of
the opportunity that who you're going up against and within what category. And my
other question was just on government relations, which I know you mentioned one
of the people you pointed to kind of work on that very closely. Just in the current
environment, I was just wondering if you can provide some thoughts. How are the
relations, how do the maybe your approach here diﬀer from other countries
especially now we're seeing lots of U.S. political tension. So I'm just wondering how
you guys think about something like that.
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Talking about the size of the market? Man, I wish I knew because it's every day it's
growing. And when I say that the coﬀee market in China, it's not even possible to
size it up but what we've been doing in the last 20 years have been focusing on
getting the experience right in our retail stores. But as you've heard today from
David, we're now entering into the wide space, right? The on-the-go and also the
Nestle opportunity in the at-home coﬀee. So this is entire coﬀee space as more
customers pick up the coﬀee consumption habit and then slowly become a daily
ritual. Now, remember every city, every person is going through this journey slowly. I
just know and my focus right now is to be bigger than the U.S. soon.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
I would just add the context on that is the consumption and I know we talked about
this at the shareholder meeting and it was highlighted again today. Less than a half a
cup of coﬀee is consumed here per day in China across the population compared to
much higher levels in the U.S. So the upside -- 300 in the U.S.. So the upside is
enormous as we build that daily coﬀee habit and the daily ritual and the opportunity
to really deﬁne what high-quality coﬀee is for the Chinese consumer. And again, go
back to the fact that literally we are educating customers 1 cup at a time. And it's
amazing to go into the stores and see and you saw it in some of the pictures the
level of engagement of customers with their phones, taping the baristas,
understanding how to make a pour over, understanding Chemex, or understanding
what's the diﬀerence between Kenyan or house blend, right? There is a thirst and a
hunger here in China with the millennial population to understand that. And I think
what we've done, Belinda and her team have successfully tapped into that
sentiment. And our partners, again, help bringing this to life through their passion,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participanttheir engagement. And their love of coﬀee. And the way they express it, it is
something unique and something very special. So on the government side, I don't
know if you want to talk about that.
Yes, I'll take the question on the geopolitical side that you asked. I think, as we've
demonstrated in the discussion we had this morning that we've been in this market
for 20 years and every step of the way we have been very thoughtful and intentional
to build this business in China for China. Do it in a way that is true to our values of
taking care of our partners and innovating around things like catastrophic insurance
for the parents, healthcare, the exchange programs that we do. And building trust
with our partners. And that then extends to our customers coming into China with
great respect for the culture and the customers. And so we've built this business on -
- based on respect for the culture, based on trust. And based on the values that our
company stands for. And I believe that in continuing to build this business true to
those values will be very helpful to us in the relationship that we have not only with
our partners but with our customers and the government in China. That said, nobody
is going to be immune to geopolitical issues. But I think our approach is to continue
to do the right thing every step of the way and with the belief that we are here for
the long-term and if we do the right thing that that will be the best outcome in the
long run.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. So going back to the slide that had the 5-
year targets for China that had 3x the revenue but 2x the operating proﬁt, why would
operating proﬁt be growing so much slower than revenue? And going back to the
prior 5-year target that had operating proﬁt growing in line with revenue presumably
China would have had to be close to that to be doing that at the segment level, also
what's changed since we got those targets?
{BIO 17370352 <GO>}
So if you go back to the Investor Day in 2016, I think we said 3x revenue and 2x
operating proﬁt. And so now we're saying greater than 3x revenue and 2x operating
proﬁt. The reason that operating proﬁt is growing more slowly is really because of
the change in the accounting and the JV network versus revenue. So when we take
all of that revenue in, when we change the accounting, you get is 100% of the
revenue versus under the old accounting method you had some very small fraction
of revenue and 50% of proﬁt. So it's just the math and the accounting. The actual
margin, when you get into '19 and beyond, we will see margin expansion. In other
words, operating proﬁt in China will grow faster than revenue. But as you move from
'17, which was under the old JV accounting with almost no revenue to '18 under the
fully consolidated accounting with all the revenue, you just get that mathematical
impact.

earlier. Is it is a problem of addressing the (needs) people are on their way to work?
Is it the price point where people are used to picking up a bowl from a street vendor
on their way or what is the issue there?
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Okay. First of all, you have to understand China customers usage of coﬀee is very
diﬀerent than the U.S. So in terms of the more -- we have 3,300 stores right now and
the portfolio of our stores in oﬃce buildings which is tailored mostly for our morning
business and/or the similar lifestyle -- as the U.S. -- the coﬀee lifestyle that you have,
it's still a small portfolio. And these stores are mainly in key cities like Shanghai,
Beijing, Guangzhou. And Shenzhen where big companies will station their oﬃces in
these major cities. So it is truly very diﬀerent. And a lot of our stores, a core majority
of our stores are in very prime commercial centers, the shopping malls that were
right smack in front of the mall and in fantastic locations. And these malls, although
we have separate entrance, these entertainment centers don't really open until like
10:00 even sometimes. So ﬁrst of all, the fundamental diﬀerence is that Chinese
customers, right now, using coﬀee, it's very diﬀerent and it also has a layer of
complexity or diﬀerences on diﬀerent cities and the whole Starbucks journey based
on that customer. Does that make sense?
(Nick Atian from Wedbush) A couple of questions, #1 is just a clariﬁcation. When you
talk about 60% digital-- in terms of payment at the store and the 80% non-cash,
what's that 20% diﬀerence?
{BIO 17006844 <GO>}
Sure. The over 60% refers to WeChat Pay and Alipay speciﬁcally. We've got other
payment tender types like digital coupons, Apple Pay, et cetera. So we add up all the
diﬀerent payment types and you'll see them today when we go in the store. That's
where we get to the 80%.
And credit cards and UnionPay?
Yes, credit cards really is the majority of the 20%.
Got it. Then just you talk about the diﬀerence in terms of coﬀee usage between how
we think about it in the U.S. and China. Can you compare and contrast the role of the
loyalty program in the U.S. versus here in China? It seems to me like the point of the
loyalty program is to drive frequency in the U.S. Here it seems to me like it's brand
aﬃnity more so than anything else. So let me just compare to contrast it to loyalty
programs.

Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Belinda Wong
Q - Dennis GeigerI'll start ﬁrst and I'll pass it to you. So I'm very proud of our MSR program, because --
well, before that, our job in the next decade is to have -- to do 2 things very well.
One is to introduce new customers to Starbucks and the brand and start their
journey with the brand. And the other half of the job is, once we enter the city and
once we touch them, we have to cultivate that relationship with them. So to make
sure they enjoy and they go through the Starbucks journey. So our MSR program, a
paid program, you heard from Emily, it's something that it's very unique to Starbucks
in China, where people see that as a status and they are -- they're using that as a new
customer as well as like existing customer to increase the frequency. So you want to
talk more about the MSR program?
{BIO 17006844 <GO>}
Yes. I think whether you're in the U.S. or China, the My Starbucks Reward program is
all about loyalty. It's a foundation of our digital ﬂywheel. It beneﬁts multiple areas.
One is it certainly does represent the power of the brand. In addition, we also see
that we have higher frequency of loyalty members versus non-loyalty, similar to the
U.S. A signiﬁcant piece of our payment tender is also by our loyalty members. I think
it's mid 30s in the U.S. and it's about 50% here. So what I would say is our consumers
are part of our community and that's really ultimately what it is when we talk about
the third and the fourth place.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
Dennis Geiger, UBS. Scott, we touched on this, some at the break and Belinda you
just talked about a balanced approach to growth. But can you just touch on the
balance of comps and development going forward, thinking about cannibalization,
obviously you've had robust development rates in recent years, comps are industry
leading. So that hasn't been an issue thus far. But just thinking about how you
manage that going forward would be great?
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
This is a real Kung Fu that we have to learn how to do in the past 19 years. And as we
accelerate more so, because I think Weiwei touched on it and let me just reiterate.
Our growth in China, 75% of that is from store growth, new store growth. And the
rest is from comp. So it's really a balancing act in terms of the speed of growth in a
particular city, if you want to go in and put a handful of new stores, if you want to win
quickly. And but you know that in a very short time it may impact your existing sales.
But because we're in this long-term commit -- long-term view, right, our aim is always
to make sure that we capture the market share timely, not too fast, not too slow. So
that comp -- the balancing of comp, it's how we -- that's how we look at it. So it's
interesting. If you think about it, we have 600 stores in Shanghai. Now, if I want to
post a fantastic comp, I can stop growing. But no way, you cannot stop me from
growing Shanghai. I'm going to go faster too, because this is such a strategic market.
But I'm going to do that very thoughtfully and making sure we enter the trading
areas, we study it. And we enter. And then we look at the eﬀect. And make sure it is a
disciplined growth.

A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerAnd maybe one more if I could and Kevin maybe this is for you. Just given the
incredible performance that China has demonstrated, what can the rest of the world
and even the U.S. learn about the execution, the innovation and the experience in
China? If you could just touch on that quick.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well I think as Belinda and the team have demonstrated and as you'll see this
afternoon as you do the immersions and visit stores, I think 3 things, #1, the level of
store design that they have created is superior to any other market in the world. And
so much of what we have been doing is learning and understanding how we can
take some of the innovation that they have done in store design and then bring that
to other parts of the world. In fact, Andy Adams, who now is running global store
development he was -- he came from the team here in China a year and a half to run
global store development. So we've actually taken talent that was a part of creating
the innovation around store design and elevated Andy to a global store
development role. And that's what led to things like the Reserve Bars that we're now
building in other parts of the world. It's part of what led to the thinking around the
Roastery and Reserve, the Reserve brand, in fact. And what they've done here. So #1
is store design. The second, I think, is the way when they look at food and beverage
innovation. And I think food and beverage innovation, we want to leverage -- we're a
company that leads by diﬀerentiating on our beverage and then we attach food. But
we realized that even with our core beverages, ﬁguring out how to stay true to sort
of the coﬀee forward beverage. But then innovate in ways that make those
beverages relevant to the market that we're serving. I think they have created a
model and approach that we will take you through later today in the product R&D
team and you get to sample some new beverages and learn how they do it. But it's a
combination of the approach and the way they embrace coﬀee. But then adapt it to
things that are unique in that market. Then, third, digital. Digital in many ways, as
Emily highlighted, with Alibaba and Tencent, the whole digital, the pace of digital
innovation in China is greater than that in the rest of the world. And so I think in
many ways, for example, the work they did around social gifting and embracing
social gifting, is an opportunity for us to leverage in other parts of the world. So I
think it comes down to the management philosophy that I highlighted in the
opening, which is, our job is to make sure that we have given Belinda and her team
the resources that they need so that they set up every discipline and function it takes
to run a Starbucks and then empower them to do that in a way to bring it to life in
China. Knowing that the 3 things that we've got to stay true to our mission, our
values and the brand. And what you're seeing is a shining example of what happens
when you take that philosophy.
Let me just add one other thing, if I may. I think if you go back in history of our time
here in China, right, back prior to 2010, we operated China as Mainland China. And
I'm sorry, we operated as Greater China. And that encompassed not only Mainland.
But also Taiwan as well as Hong Kong. And a lot of the support was coming from
Seattle to drive the growth. And to put that into context, back in 2012 and I may have
my numbers a little bit wrong. But they're pretty close. We had a total of less than
500 stores in China. We operated in 24 cities. And that year we had opened less
than -- I want to say 45 stores. In that time we made a conscious decision to build theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

accelerate the growth. What did we do? We built the China-based leadership team,
#1, #2, we invested in design and store development, which you'll see. #3, we
invested in R&D. #4, we invested in technology. #5, we invested in supply chain. And
what you're seeing today is the fruits of those investments paying oﬀ. And as we look
to the future in China and we say, what is the opportunity going forward, we're going
to continue to make investments in this team up here to drive the success. And at the
same time not only from an infrastructure standpoint. But how do we engage our
partners? Okay. 15, what is it -- 15 how many store --store managers. We open 1.5
stores a day in China, right? We're adding signiﬁcantly to the store manager base
here, district managers. We've got to make sure we're engaging our partners the
right way. And that is critical to our success going forward. So I just wanted to add
that.

We've time for about 2 more questions.
{BIO 3948570 <GO>}
Matt DiFrisco, Guggenheim. Quick question I guess, in respect to sort of what we're
seeing in the U.S. with the changing of the retail landscape, can you give context
here what you're seeing with the 3,300 restaurants and as you describe them they're
not traditionally intercepting people going to work. But they're sitting in front of
malls and big movie theaters. What are you seeing as far as your potential
changeover, the pace of changeover of those co-tenants? Are you seeing more
restaurants come in and will there be more competition, direct competition in those
lifestyle centers over the next coming years?
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Right. You can -- maybe you can add that after I give some context. I well -- ﬁrst of all,
China is a developing country, right? So we're very pleased to be able to -- while
we're growing in an accelerated pace, we're also entering into these new malls that
they're building. And these new malls -- we didn't have -- these new malls didn't
exist 10 years ago. There's not a need to overhaul the experience that's what they're
building it that is right for now. So when Emily talked about the OMO experience,
the new malls that they're building right now is really an entertainment center and
there's a lot of interactive activities to bring crowds in. So the good news is in China I
don't have a problem that there's a lot of traditional malls as already built in the U.S.
like what you have. And I -- and we have to kind of change our model. I'm going in
right now to be a part of the entertainment and to bring crowds in so that people
can -- it's already integrated in the lifestyle when they go out and with the digital,
with ecommerce buy and all that lifestyle.

I cannot agree more. Actually, what we're seeing in the retail dynamics today in
China, it is changing very fast. And when we work with the strategic landlords are our
partners in the real estate industry, you see that they come to us asking for a
diﬀerentiated experience, because in today's China retail market people are not justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

A - Thomas Shawcoming in for a coﬀee, I mean they come in, they want to sit down for a coﬀee,
because that's the moment when they want to spend time outside of home, outside
of their digital or even stay in our store for the digital experience. So what we have
been doing is we've been intentionally create a diﬀerentiated portfolio. Example is a
-- in a recent mall store that we opened in Tianjin, you're going to see them
downstairs in the design studio, that is a third store that we opened in the same mall.
And what we've been seeing is -- and we're working with the landlord (Cofco) that
we intentionally elevate the entire store to a completely diﬀerent manner and since --
after the opening we are seeing even more coﬀee occasions and customers come
into our store, the new one, whereas our 2 existing ones, 1 downstairs at the metro, 1
the other nearby the cinema, they continue to perform as solid as they were. So it
says a lot about the occasion that you're able to create for here, for the gathering.
And for diﬀerentiation even in the same model we operate.
Quick question, Dave?
Just a question on volatility and managing the business. One of the things that we
saw from other companies is they spun oﬀ China, there's a variety of reasons that
companies do what they do. But one of those is that the business got bigger and as
the business got bigger the dependence on that business also got greater and the
volatility of that market became -- it jeopardized the algorithm of the host company
and so there was a capital markets reason perhaps to split it oﬀ. You're going the
opposite direction. You're kind of streamlining this to be a U.S. and China retail store
in a way. And -- but how does the China team think about managing volatility and
then should we just keep our eyes open to the fact that maybe the algorithm will be
a little more volatile going forward as China becomes a bigger part of the pie?
I'll go ahead and kick oﬀ an answer. At this stage of the evolution in China we felt it
was best for us to deploy capital to acquire East China so we could unify all as one
company operated mainland China and that's really as recognition that we are in a
growth phase right now. And that growth phase we felt was best served by being
able to deploy capital and get the kinds of return on invested capital that we're
getting and to make the investments for the team here to enable us to take the long-
term view in building what we believe is a phenomenal asset for our shareholders.
And so that's the decision we made and that's why we made that decision. And
clearly, the growth numbers that the China leadership team and CAP, as John
highlighted, have been putting up, have been accretive to the overall agenda for
where we're trying to take the company. And so I think at this point in our evolution
this is going to best serve our shareholders and allow us to capture the opportunity
and do it in a way that really empowers this team that you see here today to deliver
on the vision that they've outlined for you.

notice a letter. So some people are lucky A and they will be with me, they will be A
through E and this will designate where you are going for both the booth tours but

just please note that there will be a couple of booths that will have photo restrictions,
including the R&D lab and the digital venture booth so please acknowledge that. We
will be back here for a quick lunch featuring Princi food after that, a couple of bonus
