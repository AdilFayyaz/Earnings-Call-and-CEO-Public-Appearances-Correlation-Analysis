Sustainability Priorities & Practices at the World's Largest Retailer. Hi, it's Oliver Chen,
Cowen's new platform retail and luxury analyst. We're thrilled to have Kathleen
McLaughlin, she is Chief Sustainability Oﬃcer at Walmart; EVP, President and Chief
Sustainability at Walmart. Inc and President of the Walmart Foundation.
At Cowen, we view Walmart as a leading omni-channel ecosystem and an online
grocery leader as our surveys consistently show that over 50% of all online grocery
shoppers use Walmart. We have an outperform rating on the stock in a $107 price
target. Kathleen is responsible for programs and help Walmart, create economic
opportunity through jobs and sourcing, enhance sustainability of food apparel and
general merchandise supply chains and strengthen the resilience of local
communities. Through business initiatives and philanthropy her teams work with
Walmart associate suppliers non-proﬁt organizations and others to deliver lasting
improvements to economic, social and environmental systems. In last year, the
company awarded more than $1.4 billion in cash and donations including over $975
million in food donations. Kathleen, thanks for joining us today for this important
(inaudible).
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Well, thank you, Oliver. It's really great to be here with you.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
So just broadly, what surprised you most in 2020 as Walmart really became a
prominent, go-to retailer for most Americans and what have your priority has been
amidst the pandemic?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 2 of 11Yeah, well, 2020 was the year that surprised us all, isn't it. So I imagine the things that
surprised me and us are the things that surprised everybody who is tuning in today.
So ﬁrst of all as a retailer, just how critically important access to food and essentials
has been throughout the pandemic and our omni-channel model just got
accelerated -- any plans that we had to expand grocery pickup or home delivery just
got magniﬁed accelerated because of the pandemic and the need to provide
people with options to get food and essentials including coming into a store, but
also avoiding a store, still being able to get what they needed.
And so that's one. Second it was really the scaling up of the safety protocols, so how
could we adjust our operations to keep our people safe, our associates and our
customers all the things that we put in place, not only in terms of physical
protections, but other things extending emergency, paid time oﬀ leave and a lot of
other protocols to help people be safe at work and customers be safe while they're
shopping. And it's really challenging in terms of just the sheer number of
government ordinances, local ordinances that were extremely variable across the
country even within states across counties and municipalities and so managing and
network in that complexity was a surprise and challenge for everybody.
Third, just the role, how important, especially now with administering vaccines and
trying to be part of that solution and help the country move as quickly as we can
toward herd immunity and vaccine uptake. And then really the pandemic and just
see events of 2020 including the murder of George Floyd really also accelerated the
conversation and the reality of the role of business in society. And the way that we
can serve and address issues, beyond the customer or the shareholder. So for
example, in addition to the things I've mentioned already, just the role that we were
able to play as a bridge employer, we hired hundreds of thousands of people and
completely wired our hiring practices to be able to hire people within a day, so that
we could not only have additional people coming to work and relieve the pressure
on our associates to feel like they had to come in, if they weren't feeling well, what
have you everyone to get lots of people around to alleviate that but also for many
folks, we acted as a bridge employer as people might have lost their employment
temporarily they can come and work for us for a while and some of them actually
stayed on and have become permanent.
Associates and others have come back to working on the places, also the role that
we played and continue to play with suppliers, helping to provide apps to customers
for suppliers to keep their businesses going across categories, and also to help
manage volatility around supply and demand. And then just in terms of even things
like racial equity which we can get into a bit later in our chat in (inaudible) of April,
May, June and so on, I think prompted everyone in the country to reﬂect and raise
aspirations on what we can do to advance.
Equity and combat systemic, racism, systemic inequity in our society. And then ﬁnally
just community resilience. The role that we've tried to play, not only through
employment and access to food and essentials and so on but in local community
response. So you mentioned our food donations we've been engaged in food
security for a long time. So, partnering very closely with looks like Feeding AmericaFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 11Oliver Chen
Kathleen McLaughlinand others to try to get access soon to basically address the volatility and in cases
where we had overages, certain items to get them out people quickly into people's
homes to alleviate huge spike in food insecurity throughout this pandemic.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Kathleen, you mentioned the role of business and society. I mean, we really do
believe in the stakeholder approach to companies and thinking about fairness and
equity, but what should we know about your role and society as a business and how
that has evolved and as you do mention George Floyd and other factors what's
important to Walmart?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yeah, well, it's a couple things, one is in the last few years, there has been a great
dialog about the role of business and society. And increasingly our recognition ﬁrst
of all that the only way a business can create, sustained value over time is by serving
stakeholders, what we call shared value, Michael Porter's phrase we really adopt that
at Walmart, you can't create long-term shareholder value unless you are addressing
needs of your customers, your associates or employees, suppliers, communities et
cetera. Those things can't be separated. But the only path to sustained ﬁnancial
value creation, sustaining success was a business, if you're doing a great job serving
the stakeholders. So for us, the events in the last year have just really validated that
philosophy that approach and that's really central for us. And so when we consider
ESG investing the big uptick in interest in this and somewhat, it's not surprising at all
to us and what we try to do is articulate for investors for others, once the ESG
investment thesis in a company like Walmart and we actually think investors in
general should take that approach, every company should consider things that way.
What's the reason that you would invest a dollar in Walmart, if you care about climate
change, if you care about racial equity, if you care about COVID response, if you care
about equitable access to food, whatever the issues are that are relevant for our
business, what's our ESG investment thesis, meaning why is that issue relevant for
business and society. What's the approach that we try to take at Walmart to address
that issue and what are the strategies that we're putting in place to pursue that, what
are the results disclosing progress and so on and -- for me, in a nutshell, that's what
ESG is all about. And that's what we try to convey through our own disclosures and
engagement.
And a couple of reﬂections on that and what's really I think been shown to be true in
the last year or two is already mentioned this notion of shared value that the ﬁnancial
value creation for shareholders is hand in hand with the stakeholder value creation.
But a couple of other things to point out. One is that the challenges we face as a
society right now, whether you take racial equity or climate, degradation of
ecosystems COVID whatever the issue, they are so signiﬁcant and so pervasive that
we are now at a point that we need to regenerative solutions, solutions that actually
transform the systems that we rely on.
So it's not enough anymore for our business or anyone in society to say well, my
approaches to be quite sustainable. I'm just going to operate in a way, right andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Oliver Chen
Kathleen McLaughlinminimize my impact. That's not enough if ever what you know to address those kinds
of issues in a way that creates value for business and helps us make progress on
those issues requires a regenerative approach, meaning, we actually have to
contribute to solutions that improve the situation that renewed, that restored, that
regenerate, not just who;e steady and not that requires transforming systems.
The second observation I would make that we really strongly believe at Walmart is
the path to transforming systems to create those better outcomes for society in
terms of any of those issues or the past that we're going to build bridges across
divides that are going to unite and not get caught up in polarization or extremes. So,
so much of our discussion, certainly in our country, in the US is about the extremes
and the divide and polarization. Well at Walmart, we serve everybody. Our customer
base reﬂects America and people have a lot of diﬀerent views and we live in a three
dimensional world, not a single dimension world. And what I mean by that is, if you
take polarization on any issue, it's one dimensional, we think there is ample scope in
the -- and bringing people together and transforming systems to create outcomes
that are really in the interest of everybody and that's where we try to focus.
And then the last thing I would say is there is tremendous synergy in solutions where
it's a false trade oﬀ to say where we can have business or society or we can sustain
the environment or grow the economy, we think those are false trade-oﬀs that the
most creative solutions are at the intersection and optimized for social,
environmental and economic outcomes where business is at the table working
collaboratively with civil society with governments as a partner and that's where
we're going to get the best solutions, that really move us towards a sustainable
climate, racial equity, getting through the pandemic like you name it. And there are
lots of examples of that.
So really coming back to your question in investors what would be want them to
understand? It is to approach this in that way themselves. So all of the time and
energy that investors put in to analyzing companies, creating the investment thesis,
thinking about a ﬁnancially that's great build on that now and you incorporate the
Environmental Social Governance factors. It's a holistic approach and there ought to
be as much energy and thought into analyzing companies on that basis and
understanding the links to value creation and to addressing issues of society.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Yeah, Kathleen. So what do you ﬁnd Wall Street may under accretion most about
your sustainability eﬀorts. What are you prioritizing those and what might be the
hardest to achieve?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
You know, my observation around Capital Markets asset managers, investors in
general is that people are evolving towards this more integrated understanding and
value creation. And I've just seen that even the last three, four years where when we
engage teams from our investors, three four years ago, it might have been one team
and then there was like ESG group that maybe would call a few weeks later. Now, it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Oliver Chen
Kathleen McLaughlina single conversation and you know for us as walmart, the priorities that we have our
four issue areas that we think are most relevant for us as an omni-channel retailer. So
economic opportunity for our associates, for our suppliers, it includes racial and
gender equity and our role that we can play and unleashing those things and
advancing them through our jobs, our purchase orders our engagement community.
Second sustainable supply chains and transforming supply chains to decouple
consumption from environmental social outcomes basically to create much more
regenerative products supply chains that are not only sustainable in terms of
environment and people, but again the notion regeneration add back or better drive
down emissions, restore ecosystems elevated people. Third is community resilience
and the role we play locally to enhance the resilience of communities in terms of
social cohesion, food security, disaster response those kinds of things. And then
fourth as a global business. Aiming to operate with the highest standards of ethics
and integrity and bring that into our policies and practices around things like Digital
Citizenship for example stakeholder engagement and so on.
So those are our four priorities and what we try to get across to investors is, why are
those relevant for business value creation and for our stakeholders. And what are our
strategies, what's the progress we're making and again what's that ESG investment
thesis. Why is the dollar invested in Walmart, a dollar that would not only returned to
the shareholder, but would actually help make progress on things like climate action
or racial equity or COVID or again any of those four big themes I mentioned.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Kathleen, what would be some highlights of things that you're measuring and
tracking in that Wall Street should measure and track and see your progress as well. I
mean it's a big open-ended question, but would love your thoughts?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
I'll give a couple of examples, one would be around climate action and the other
would be around economic mobility. So advancement at entry-level people through
work and in particular at the opportunity that the retail sector has to be a
springboard for racial and gender equity through work and through advancement.
So on climate -- for few years now, we've been informed by the guidance of the task
force on climate related ﬁnancial disclosures in terms of doing a risk assessment
around climate, modeling out 2030, 2050, what does it look like in a three-degree
world, four-degree world. The answer is not good. And then, what does that mean
for our strategies and what we need to do to contribute to a net zero future. And so
our climate strategy includes science-based targets for emissions reduction. We
were the ﬁrst retailer to set science-based targets back in 2016. And that includes our
own operations, as well as the supply chain, what people call Scope 3. So we set
targets that are aligned with the Science Based targets framework. And then last year
we elevated our ambition to say what we actually want to go farther and get to zero
emissions, in our own operations by 2040. And so we just closed our progress we've
been disclosing for over 10 years now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 11Oliver Chen

Oliver Chen
Kathleen McLaughlinHow are we doing in terms of our emissions overall, as well as on a carbon intensity
basis the strategies we're pursuing to drive down carbon in our own operations and
through the supply chain in a program we have called project giga tonne. We now
have over 3,000 suppliers engage with us to decarbonize retail supply chains and
what's great about that is those suppliers, supplier, all the other retailers too, right.
So when they're taking actions, it's not just for Walmart like they're changing their
supply chains and that beneﬁts everybody. And that program is very speciﬁc
strategies around energy, product design, waste, packaging, sustainable agriculture,
forest and so suppliers are taking actions in each of those six areas we support them
with tools and programs, we help them get the ideas for how to go faster and to
report through CDP to our platform.
So we've been really driving focus toward reporting, it is one of the reasons that CDP
rated Walmart with an A both for our own emissions progress on climate action, but
also what they call their Supplier Engagement leader board because we're trying to
democratize climate action and retail sector and get everybody engaged in moving
more quickly to decarbonize supply chains overall. So we just close this in some
detail in our ESG reports, and are tracking and disclosing this emissions numbers as
well as the speciﬁcs around those pieces of packaging and waste and energy
eﬃciency and renewable energy and so on. So that's one. The second is around the
role that we can play as a retailer around entry level workforce and developments
and I'm happy to describe it as well. But let me just pause to see you or it could go
into that or -- it something out.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
On that question, Kathleen. We've had incoming questions on labor and wages.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Can you discuss your philosophy on raising starting wages and what may happen
over the longer term. And how might Walmart Academy intersect with us as well.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. So the opportunity for retail as a sector. In the broader labor market
and economy is to be a place where the barriers to entry into work are minimal
removed. So could we have in retail there are a lot of entry-level roles. So be a place
where people get started and work. But then, whatever their starting point invest in
upskilling those people on the job, so they're learning while they're earning and
then creating pathways that help them advance quickly, that's the particular role that
retail can play.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 11And it's a really important role and it does require a shift in people's approach,
especially in terms of investment in human capital helping people acquire skills in
ways that they can while they're on the job and get access to those career path. So
that's really been our focus. It's been about access to work, stability in the job and
then mobility through investment and training and career paths.
So when it comes to wages, we pay competitive wages by role, by format in the
geographies where we operate. So our starting wages and our average wages
simply reﬂect what is the local market average for that type of job in that format, in
that market and what I mean by that. Well, Walmart is an omni-channel company in
the US is really a company with multiple formats embedded in it, so we have our
supercenter and our grocery formats.
We also have a Club format, which is our Sam's Club. We also have an e-commerce
warehouse company if you want to think about that way -- in terms of our DCs
fulﬁllment centers and so on. And the wages that we pay, both at a starting point and
on average are reﬂective of the dynamics in those formats. So for example, Club
format if you want to compared to, let's say, a cost, where we have you are wages are
very similar than north of 15 for the vast majority of our people. Same thing in terms
of e-commerce warehouse fulﬁllment center and so on, our starting wages are north
of 15.
So, and it's important. I think there some misconceptions out there, some people
think that Walmart pays minimum wage, which we don't we -- our lowest possible
wage anywhere in the network is $11 but then people think that's our starting wage
for all of our jobs. And it's just not -- our starting wages is very completely
depending on what's the role and what's the local market condition. So just to give
you an example, even within our grocery format or supercenter format, we have a
whole career ladder of diﬀerent jobs with diﬀerent skill requirements that have
diﬀerent starting pay, depending on what results, the already talked about the Club
format and the warehouse within the stores organization.
So for example, for our digital associates, our stockers for grocery pickup and things
like that. The starting, wage just can vary anywhere from 13 to 19 as a starting wage.
So the starting wage is 19 for those who are also getting in the market so system
important to say. So our focus is then. Okay. We're paying competitively in the local
market for that job, whatever it is warehouse or Club format or in the stores and, but
that's just the starting point, and what we have found for the most part people
coming to us, they may or may not have had a chance to ﬁnish high school, they may
be new to the country and learning to speak English, our retail job oﬀers an
incredible opportunity to get scale on the job to move up.
So our focus then is on providing a package of beneﬁts paid time oﬀ, access to
aﬀordable healthcare, quarterly cash bonuses, which are over and above the wage,
discounts and so on which I can talk more about in terms of beneﬁts. So people are
stable in the role in terms of total compensation. We have a majority full time
workforce not per time as many retailers, because we recognized for many people.
That's their job and the more hours we can give them the better.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-06

Kathleen McLaughlinScheduling practices that provide ample notice and ﬂexibility to trade shifts with
other people or to have a ﬁxed schedule for months at a time. So we've spent a lot
of time designing those jobs to improve the quality of the job to provide the stability
around total compensation and scheduling and so on.
And then importantly, the investments in upskilling and we do that in a number of
ways. So in the purposes, we want to develop that workforce and provide that access
to career paths for the beneﬁt of our associates, but also for our business again
come back to shared value. It's in our interest to have a highly skilled workforce that
stays with Walmart, that's excited it moves up in his with us. So 88% of our open
positions are ﬁlled internally, 75% of our store managers started as hourly or our
management in general will be store managers in the (inaudible) and so in those job,
store manager earns $180,000 a year job.
So we're trying to see that pipeline and move people up.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
So our investments in the Academy and training are to help people get the skills on
the job in advance, so the ways people learn are on the job coaching in a whole
variety of programs that people will get day to day just through their work
experience and their interaction with their boss and their teams and digital tools, we
have a number of apps that we use to coach people and help build soft skills as well
as technical skills.
And then the Academy, which is advanced training to take on supervisory and
specialty roles and then what we've done is extend that was something called Live
Better U, which provides free high school completion, English as a second language
and so on and then advanced degrees. So two year and four-year degrees in ﬁelds
that are relevant for jobs, the retail supply chain management, pharmacy tech those
kinds of things. For a dollar a day in terms of cost of the associate and there are a
bunch of supports we provide and so on, because we're trying to drive to
completion. So all of that is in service of really helping people come into the
workforce, get the skills they need to advance into positions of higher pay or higher
responsibility whatever it is that people want as their career path.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Thanks for that. Kathleen, very helpful and comprehensive. A couple more came in
gun control has been a hot-button issue in the US and you've taken a leadership
position also electric vehicles are quickly gaining popularity, could you just share
with us some quick thoughts on those buckets of diﬀerent kinds of questions?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Oliver Chen
Kathleen McLaughlinYeah, happy to. In terms of the gun control. Yeah, I mean we had a horrible situation
a couple of years ago with the shooting, and one of our stores in El Paso, which I
imagine most people may recall it was a really horrible situation and it's not the ﬁrst
mass shooting in our country. So it did cause us to reﬂect and put in place some
changes to our approach.
So Walmart we have a hunting and ﬁshing department, many of our customers love
to go camping hunting and ﬁshing, that's in the past time for many, many people. So
the question was how can we continue to support those customers, but in a way that
can respond to the situations that we've experienced.
So many years ago, we have discontinued some forms of ﬁrearms, so long time ago,
we used to sell hand guns. we got out of the long time ago, that wasn't an issue
when it comes to hunting, riﬂes so we had some more tactical ﬁrearms and so on
that we also discontinued a number of years ago. So really it was a question of what
we were left with in terms of hunting riﬂes and things like that ammunition, that we
have with them.
So we took a look at the ammunition and we discontinued many of the items, that
we didn't feel were necessary for the hunting and then we also asked our customers
not to open carry which in many seats people open carry loss that as a private
company, where we can put in place what we'd like to. So we asked them not to do
that, because it's alarming to people to walk around and see people carrying guns,
so that was an important step. And we had also raise the age, number of years ago
for purchase to 21. And I think most importantly we have incredibly stringent,
processes and standards to apply for licenses and to actually purchase, ammunition,
ﬁrearms and so on. And those background checks we won't sell, if they don't come
back clean. We've got a number of IT systems that we are sharing with other retailers
quite happy to share that information so people can adopt some of things, if they
would like to and so those are all important steps that we took. And it's a good
example of trying to ﬁnd solutions that aren't -- put in but actually are common sense
and forward, even make sense for everyone.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
The other question Kathleen was on electric vehicles and EV charging stations and
the last one on our mind is also actually mental health, admits the pandemic and
how you're thinking about that and employee welfare and any closing remarks you
may have, as we're bumping up against the end of the time. Thanks, Kathleen.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Well, I'll just brieﬂy EV charging. we're pretty excited about, because as you know
that things are moving in that direction there are more and more car companies
seems like every day, people talking about and moving towards electric vehicles. So
I'm looking to see the exact number of that, I don't want to give you the wrong
number but we have well over a thousand EV charging stations around the country
and what's great about Walmart is we tend to be pretty close to major roads. So it's a
pretty convenient place to come and plug in obvious whenever 1,400 in 41 statesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-06

Kathleen McLaughlinand that's just a start. Right. So we'll see where we go, but it's great to keep -- can
pull in charge their car go do their shopping come out the cars charge enough they
go and that's really ideal and it's a great shared value example great for our
business, great for our customers, great for the environment. So we're obviously
we're incredibly bullish on renewable energy with a goal to get to zero emissions by
2040. So this is all part of that journey.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Thank you and I am curious about your thoughts around employee welfare and
mental health. And it's the pandemic in many ways Walmart pharmacies are
important part of the fabric of communities as well and any closing remarks you
might have.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yeah that's been another thing, I think we're all learning and still coping with if I give
any are sitting here in my house I have been trapped in here, I mean lucky to have a
home. First of all, let me be very clear, but I think all of us, it's diﬀerent ways. It's been
stressful for us. So for employee well-being, we have a program called resources for
living, which is available to all of our associates, and it's a counseling service on
demand and helps people with mental health challenges, among other things.
We also have a partnership with Thrive Global, which provides additional resources
to our associates for mental health and adjustments to lifestyle for well being, there
are number of other programs that we've been running for years one is called CP
Wellness which helps people connect with each other and makes small lifestyle
changes or behavioral changes in service of their mental health, physical health and
so on.
And then in our clinics, which we are piloting experimenting with extending we have
an integrated mental health care oﬀering that we've been testing, which we think is
really important and fundamental for physical well being as well. So it's a critical
issue. I would say it's early days for many companies including Walmart, in terms of
scalable solutions, but we are investigating and testing many.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Well, that was really, really interesting Kathleen. Thanks for sharing with us your
priorities and also the real approach to transforming and enabling and bridging, one
of the world's most important companies for sure. Thanks for your time.
