Presentation
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
All right. Thank you very much. So I'd like to Rob Csongor, Investor Relations VP of
NVIDIA, to talk about all things graphics and Tegra.
I do apologize. But I need to give a quick safe harbor to start. Please note that all
important disclosures, including personal holdings disclosures and Morgan Stanley
disclosures, appear on the Morgan Stanley public website at
www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures, or at the registration desk.
So what, maybe you could just start us out, just give kind of a few minute overview of
NVIDIA's position in the market. And then I have a bunch of questions to ask you?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Okay, sure. I guess I would just start that, in arguably one of the toughest years, I
think, for the PC market, one of the things I always like to mention to people right
before we get into whatever the newest headwind is on NVIDIA, that we were able to
achieve a record year. We had record revenues, record gross margins, record cash.
We announced a dividend. We repurchased shares.
We had a record year for Tegra. We said we would grow the Tegra business by 50%
and we did. And I don't know any business in tech last year that grew by 50%.
And this was despite one of the lousiest years, I think, in memory for the PC market.
And one of the toughest environments for mobile. I think at this point last year -- last
year versus now, I mean, we started last year with a ﬂood in Thailand. We had supply
issues with our 28-nanometer with TSMC. The Android market was in a -- had a very
rough start, I would say. So at that time, there really wasn't a low-price point, $199, for
a quad-core tablet. And all those things, basically, developed over the year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 16So I think we're very proud. We're very proud that we were able to execute through
that. I think one of the things that we don't often do and we'd like to do is to just
highlight and showcase the fact that we've been executing pretty well through some
pretty tough headwinds over the last four years.
I think one of the number one questions we get, as a company, is how is it possible
for your GPU business to grow when the PC market is ﬂat or declining? And we've
been trying to show the Street a little more transparency into our business and show
that, really, 5% of the PC market, which represents PC gaming, work stations. And
high-performance computing, really drives the majority of our business in terms of
gross margins. And those segments of the market are very robust.
So if you look at the last four years, our GPUs have grown consistently. We grew our
GPU business 8% last year, excluding the chipset business, which we're exiting. I
already talked about the Tegra business.
And I think going into this year, our position this year versus last year is just night and
day. Last year we had Fermi, our Fermi generation of GPUs. This year we have Kepler.
Last year we didn't have any real designs and Android was in disarray. This year we
had a good year and established our position in tablets. Last year we had no LTE
modem. And now we do.
So I would say that this is probably one of the most signiﬁcant developments in
terms of why our position is better now than it was last year. This week we
announced the Tegra 4i, which is our ﬁrst integrated LTE processor, mobile
processor. This opens up a fair amount of the mobile market for us. This is the focus
of our acquisition with Icera. And at this point we're extremely pleased that roughly
20 months after acquiring Icera we now have a world-class integrated LTE processor
and we're engaging the market with it.
We announced Tegra and i500 at CES. So right now, our family of products at the
application processor side starts with a best-of-class app processor, as well as an LTE
modem. But now we have the additional integrated part that allows us to address a
larger segment of the phone market.
So I think, going forward for the year, I would say there's lots of questions. We also
announced a few surprises this year. We have a new GPU business, a new growth
business for GPUs, which is called GRID. This is selling GPUs into the cloud. And
server-based products, basically GRID Enterprise, GRID Professional. And GRID
Gaming. We're going to talk a lot more about these new segments and this new
business at our upcoming GPU technology conference, as well as our investor day
on April 11th.
And of course, in terms of our core business, I would say for this year the status of
our business going forward to this year, I think we have Kepler this year, PC gaming
continues to be strong and robust, I think notebook, the notebook market we see as
declining. But we're looking forward to another year of good share on notebook.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

Page 3 of 16Q - Joe Moore
A - Rob CsongorThe Quadro business, which had declined last year some amount, is ﬁnally
transitioning to Kepler. So you may noted in Q4 that our Quadro business was up
10% after several quarters of relative weakness.
So -- and then Tesla is a growth business for us right now, one of our growth
opportunities, which is to sell GPUs into high-performance computers.
So I think just relatively, year to year, I would say that's kind of my quick summary of
the state of the business and why I think we're looking forward to the next year and
beyond, versus last year.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
All right, that's great. NVIDIA, to me, is one of the more intriguing stocks that we
cover, in the sense that there's a lot of opportunities that are diﬃcult to model,
diﬃcult to know exactly what they're worth. And yet all seem pretty exciting. So I'd
like to walk through some of those. And I'll go through the product portfolio and
leave some time for questions at the end. So I may not get through everything.
But I think the most mundane thing that could really work out for you guys is
graphics. And I think the -- I'm pretty bullish on the attach rate commentary that you
had, that the gamer market continues to be robust. But also, what about
competition? Your competitor, AMD is in a lot of diﬀerent things on a stretched R&D
budget, is spending money on varying consoles. And I just -- it seems like they're
stretched a little bit thin.
Is this a time when you guys should be putting more money into PC graphics to sort
of accelerate away from them?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Well I'm just smiling because you're the right person who's asked me why we're not
spending more money on PC graphics. Frankly, at this point, we're in the position
right now of leveraging the investment we made in Kepler. So we're going to enjoy it
for just a few seconds.
I think we gained a lot of share this year, thanks to Kepler. I think we'll enjoy good
share again this coming year. We're going to enjoy the beneﬁts of Kepler throughout
this year.
Now, having said that. And people always ask about AMD, we've been telling people
that AMD doesn't -- AMD is there. And we expect them to ﬁght just as hard as they
ever have. So as far as we're concerned, we said it last year and we said it -- we're
saying it this year, we expect nothing diﬀerent, nothing diﬀerent.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

Q - Joe MooreThey are our competition for GPUs. And we're going to ﬁght them just as hard this
year as we did last year. And just as hard as we fought them the year before. So
there's no change.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Great.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
But for now. And, by the way, you know that it took us years to develop Kepler right?
So instead of doing game consoles or instead of doing Xbox 360 or Wii, we were
developing Tegra. We were developing GRID. We were developing virtual GPU
capabilities into the GPUs. We were developing CUDA and high-performance
computing. So the -- we have to pick and choose where we invest.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
That makes sense. Then, with GRID, again, I don't have a lot of numbers around GRID
for my model. I mean, can you talk about how GRID could play out and what the
revenue opportunity is for you guys? Who, ultimately, is paying you. And how much
they're going to pay you. And how big it could be?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Well the short answer is no, I can't tell you today. No. We're going to talk a lot more
about GRID this year. And coming up very soon, in fact. So at our upcoming GPU
technology conference, which we're actually -- we're opening up to the ﬁnancial
community. Jen-Hsun is actually going to give a presentation immediately following
his keynote which is speciﬁcally targeted at the investment community.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
So -- and we're going to talk a lot more about the new businesses that NVIDIA is in.
In a lot of ways, NVIDIA's business is changing quite a bit.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
And so, we know that there's lots of questions about these new businesses.
Sometimes it's better for us to get -- make a little headway into the market, establish
some customers and stuﬀ, before we roll it out to you guys and say, hey, guess what
we think.

Q - Joe Moore
A - Rob CsongorSo you're not going to tell me today how to model it.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
I'm not going to tell you how to model it today. But we, obviously, believe on each
one of the -- I can -- let me talk a little bit, maybe qualitatively about it.
Our GRID is divided in three. We have a GRID Enterprise product. I think the value
proposition of GRID enterprise is that we'll accelerate an existing VDI
implementation. So we'll accelerate an existing Citrix or VMware type of setup. So
the good news there is that there's obviously a market for VDI. For those of you who
have used it, it's very convenient and very good. And could use a little performance
boost. And acceleration, particularly for graphics-intensive applications.
So that's what we've done. We've worked very closely with Citrix and VMware and
Cisco and all of these guys to accelerate an existing implementation. And we think
that's going to -- we think there's a market for that.
The second market is a little bit of a tougher one to try and size. It's -- we're -- it's
called GRID Professional and we're deploying, basically, a -- we're working with
partners to accelerate and deliver certain speciﬁc applications as a SaaS, software as
a service. So applications like SolidWorks and Autodesk.
The third one is GRID Gaming. And that one's a potentially very large business. And
we demonstrated it and we've demonstrated it on stage as somebody's simply
interacting with a television. There's no game console connected to it. There's no PC.
There's no set-top box. It's just a television with an Ethernet wire.
So if you look at it from that perspective that what's the available market that NVIDIA
can deliver the goodness of a GPU to, it's gone from a PC with a large power supply
and a GPU to any display that's connected to the Internet.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
And this is, arguably, bigger than the console market in terms of the way people are
looking at --
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
It's potentially -- let's -- I mean, we haven't gone out and positioned this as a console
competitive.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
But you have announced partners. And they're interesting partners, because they're
actually working with carriers on actual implementations, right?

Q - Joe MooreYes. We announced a number of middleware partners. To people who are in that
industry, they know exactly who those middleware guys are. To most people, I think
they don't know them.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
But if you look closely, you realize these are the guys who are building a lot of the
infrastructure for some very large service providers and carriers.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. That's helpful.
Then on Tegra 4, there's been a lot of back and forth about who has the best
products in apps processors. I was probably a little too cynical on Tegra 4 before it
was announced. But you've put out some pretty impressive stats, I mean, much lower
power consumption, the same use case, a higher number of design wins at this point
than Tegra 3 had over its life.
The -- what is it, you think, that's making that a compelling sale. And how do you
broaden it out beyond what you had in Tegra 3?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Well Tegra 4's position is to be the fastest -- the world's fastest mobile processor.
And that's our anchor position. It was our anchor position last year with Tegra 3. The
only diﬀerence last year was that we were the world's fastest mobile processor
without a modem.
So when you have the world's fastest mobile processor without a modem, you can't
sell into a lot of phones. We could sell -- so, what we did is, we sold into tablets. And
that's what you saw. So when our business grew 50%, we jumped on the tablet
market and we were able to grow it, really, with just a couple designs.
This year, you're going to see a lot more tablets and a lot more SKUs from vendors, a
lot more ﬂavors. Everything, I think, in the Android world is going to be better --
more functionality at lower price, more oﬀerings, more options. I think you're going
to see a lot more connected tablets this year, because the telcos and the carriers are
oﬀering modem support, basically, as a family plan thing. You basically throw it in, as
opposed to you get a new bill every month now.
So let's see, what else? Well we were talking about the idea of --?
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, it's worth noting just how high your market share was and how last year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

Oh, right, right.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Of the merchant market, which was limited, because Samsung and Apple have so
much share. But, I mean, you guys had -- you swept almost everything else, most of
the Windows RT stuﬀ --
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
-- as well as a lot of the other tablets.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
That's right. So the Tegra 4 position relative to Tegra 3, then, is that, yes, we -- I think
with the benchmark results that you were talking about, we reestablished our
position as the fastest mobile processor. But the diﬀerence now is that we have LTE.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
And we have a modem. So the i500 is out there and selling and sampling. I think this
week the ﬁrst phone guy announced. So I think ZTE announced this week that
they're building a Tegra 4 phone. And they're building an upcoming phone that will
also have Tegra 4, as well. It's an i500.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
So I think you'll see more announcements, particularly on the phone side, later in the
year as you get closer to production.

Page 8 of 16Q - Joe Moore
A - Rob Csongor
Q - Joe Moore

Q - Joe Moore
A - Rob CsongorSo I think the -- the quick answer to your question is, NVIDIA's entering the
connected device market this year, which we think is very signiﬁcant in things far
beyond just phones.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
And I think -- so this comes down the LTE modem. And I think this is tricky for
investors, because we're so used to thinking of an existing ﬁeld of baseband
competitors. You guys are relatively news to this. When we go and ask your
competitors what they think of this kind of software-deﬁned approach that you're
taking with Icera, they're all cynical, because they're your competitors, maybe. But
can you talk -- can you give us any comfort that this is going to be something that
you can have a large presence.
I mean, it sounds like you're sort of the second guy to market in the LTE space. Is that
right? And are you going to -- would you expect that to turn into that type of
baseband market share position that is number two that would have.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Well I think we have a secret sauce. I mean, we have an architectural strategic
position. Our position is a software-deﬁned radio, as opposed to a ﬁxed-function
device. The implications of that are pretty signiﬁcant.
What it means is that Tegra 4i is half the size of the competing product from
Qualcomm. That's pretty signiﬁcant.
So now you have to prove yourself. And you have to get qualiﬁed. So you have to
prove yourself by going through all the same battery of tests that we're very familiar
with. So we did a couple designs last year, with some phones and tablets to kind of
cut our teeth and get ourselves in.
To many people, they may think of this as the ﬁrst product from NVIDIA. But, I mean,
Icera's been making modems since 2006.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
They have 95 diﬀerent carrier qualiﬁcations in a large number of countries. So
they're very, very familiar with the process and this is not their ﬁrst modem.

{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
If we can deliver advanced features. If we can deliver performance. If we can deliver
it at low power, then I think it'll make -- I think we'll be ﬁne.
So if you're in Mobile World Congress this week, that's exactly what we're showing.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. And the fact that you've been qualiﬁed already on data, I mean, that, in itself, is
fairly relevant, because you still have tablet opportunities and things where

{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Right.

But anyway, of course. I mean, we've done voice qualiﬁcations.

Yes.

We -- the tablet I use right now is an Asus Vivo RT with an LTE modem. It's an Icera

would describe this year, I mean, from NVIDIA's perspective, this is an extremely
exciting time that we're engaging the connected device market and the market -- the
market is welcoming an alternative solution.
So I think for us, going into this, it's very exciting. But in terms of devices, visibility, in
terms of revenue, I think this year is primarily a build and validate year, build and
certify.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}

just tell us your view of what this is?

Q - Joe Moore
A - Rob Csongor{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
I was never going to show our engineering department your email, because it would
just be such an insult.
Yes, I mean, the Tegra 4i has been a focus. I talked about it earlier. And I'm not
kidding. It is the focus of everything -- it's the number one focus product since we
acquired Icera. That product is designed for one purpose and one purpose only, to
just nail perf per square millimeter and perf per watt.
So when we looked at that chip, we looked at it from a complete top-down re-
architecture of taking everything, the best of everything we've learned so far. The
modem side was relatively easy. It's pretty much an i500. The rest of it was pretty
diﬃcult, though. I mean, that's all basically custom architecture.
So we had a number of potential engines that we could use. We had our Tegra 4
graphics engine. We had this new second generation four-plus-one, which is
basically our battery saver, the ability to have a single core running at very low
power. So we had the second generation implementation of that.
So we basically, if you look at what Tegra 4i is, it is the Tegra 4 graphics engine, 60-
core instead of 72. It is -- it uses the same Chimera computational photography
engine that we have in Tegra 4. It has a very diﬀerent CPU architecture, though. So
what we did is we basically created a custom, souped-up version. And again, you're
looking at perf per square millimeter, perf per watt. You could go quad A15 or you
could go quad A9, 1.0 gigahertz, the original engine.
So the variant that we built, internally we refer to as R4. So it's a custom co-
developed with ARM that is basically a souped-up Cortex A9 four-plus-one, clocked
at 2.3 gigahertz.
So it's -- it is the sweet spot, we believe, of perf per square millimeter.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
And what does that translate to in terms of the price of the phone that you're
enabling.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Well the target, everything that we've been -- we kind of look at the market or, at
least, similar to -- if you look at how Strategy Analytics or some other market research
ﬁrms look at it, they -- anything above, like, $200, $299, is a super phone. We can
address that with our discrete GPU. But the large segment of the market that we
believe is opening up for us now is that $99 to $199 range of the market, which is not
quite at the low end, the low end that's kind of currently addressed by companies
like MediaTek. But the $99 to $199. And at that segment, it's us and Qualcomm.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Right, a fully -- I mean, basically what you're looking at is, the sweet spot of the
market next year as being a 1080p LTE smart phone.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Any questions from the audience? I have more, if not.
(inaudible). Sorry, can you talk about the R&D investment proﬁle? There's clearly
been a lot of investments in things like Kepler and Tegra.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Right.
(inaudible), et cetera. I mean, should we know be -- have we now got past the peak
of the R&D investment proﬁle?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Yes. So it's a good question. I mean, we get the question on our OpEx. Last year we
grew our OpEx, we targeted $1.4 billion non-GAAP. And we came in just underneath
it. So we basically spent exactly what we said we'd spend.
In Q1, our OpEx went up, again pretty much exactly as we expected it to, because --
and in the earnings call that we recently had, we articulated the reason why. We're
bringing LTE to market. It is absolutely the right thing to do.
Now, in terms of R&D expense, all of the projects that we currently have on our plate
are funded R&D project. We're -- you, obviously, know that if we built Shield last year,
for example, we had -- we were paying engineers to build it last year. So in terms of
Kepler, Shield, GRID, LTE -- all of those products are basically products that were
funded out of last year's OpEx.
The increase in Q1 is largely based on taking LTE to market, which is -- I mean, this is
our time to do this.
So I think, in general, if you look at our proﬁle, OpEx as a percentage of revenue, I
think over the last four years you'd see that we're pretty consistently right around
31%. But during that time, we've grown our operating income considerably. So
operating income four years ago was at -- OpEx was 31% as a percentage of revenue.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantBut operating income was at 8%. That grew to 20%. So we -- yes, we've spent more
every year, in terms of a percentage of revenue, it stayed pretty ﬂat. And we've
grown income quite a bit during that time.
Yes? I'm going to let Joe pick them.
You guys are typically pretty reluctant to talk about Project Denver. But I'm
wondering what is your view, maybe big picture wise, of the ARM server market and
what segment do you think you guys have the best capability to play in? What sort of
broad brushes will you give us?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
So your ﬁrst assumption was correct. Yes. We're not talking a lot about Project
Denver right now. But I think we will, relatively shortly. I mean, it -- the things that
we've disclosed and we've talked about are things that you probably already know.
I don't think it's any secret that power is important to more things than your cell
phone battery. I think that most people know that the exaﬂop initiative, which is the
initiative to build an exaﬂop supercomputer by the year 2018, the number one
technical obstacle to building that supercomputer is power.
So anyone who's familiar with supercomputers in the server and data center market
knows that power is a major obstacle and a hurdle to achieving a breakthrough. So
we've, obviously, invested in a lot of high-performance computing, parallel
computing, CUDA. We have a lot of experience in deploying the next-generation
supercomputers. You guys know that in Q3 we launched Titan, which is now the
world's fastest supercomputer, which is now driven by 18,000 GPUs. So it's,
obviously, a segment of the market that we care a lot about.
Now, today, all of those implementations are x86. And we've disclosed that we're
working on something called Project Denver that is a ARM-based product. And the
only thing we've said other than that is that it's not a general purpose 64-bit CPU,
because somebody was -- somebody had started propagating some information
that, oh, we're just going to go into the general purpose CPU business. I mean,
NVIDIA never does that. We never do -- we never just do a general purpose CPU.
Typically, we're going to go ﬁnd a diﬃcult problem and build something very custom
to solve that problem. And it's typically very diﬃcult to do.
So other than that, I don't -- there's just not a whole lot that we're talking about yet.
But hopefully we will soon.
In April, with this other stuﬀ, would that come up or is it post-April?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

I don't know is the honest answer. I think this -- for the upcoming GPU technology
conference, you're going to hear a lot more about GRID and I think right now, in
terms of the milestones of new opportunities for NVIDIA, we, obviously, have
enough of them right now. But the GRID is the one that I think a lot of people are
interested in. We're already generating revenue with it and we're already kind of well
along with our alpha customers. So the time for us to talk more about that business
is probably coming up.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
We have time for one more.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Okay.
How do you look at your high-margin Quadro workstation business. And in
relationship with the big boy coming in to the competition, what do you think of that,
because that's a pretty high margin business and you can surprise to the upside, I
think?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Okay, which big boy are you talking about?
I mean the biggest boy in the world.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
The biggest boy in the world?
I don't know. Intel showed some interest --
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Oh, in the Tesla business.
Yes.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Oh, the -- yes. Okay, sorry, I thought you said Quadro.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

A - Rob CsongorSo your question is about Tesla, right? Okay. We continue to believe that the Tesla
business represents a great growth opportunity for NVIDIA. It's been relatively slow
developing because it's a new paradigm and a new way of doing compute. The
early adopters for the Tesla business have predominantly been a lot of -- the
universities and supercomputers. In each of these cases, there is custom work that
people are doing, basically. And the revenue is very lumpy. We'll do an installation
and then it kind of -- the installation's done and then the revenue drops down.
You may have noticed that in the last quarter, after we were done with the Titan
installation, revenue went down. But not quite as -- it didn't go down all the way. And
the diﬀerence now is that we're starting to develop a run-rate business.
And the deﬁnition of a run-rate business is, a designer designing a landing gear can
open up his newest version of ANSYS, which is one of the standards for doing
physical simulation. And he has an oﬀ-the-shelf product he bought from Dell, a
PowerEdge server or something like that. And it is simply accelerated by Tesla
without him knowing it, oﬀ-the-shelf software, oﬀ-the-shelf hardware.
You know what I mean? They don't have to write code and develop a code. So I think
you're seeing a pickup in the run rate business of it.
Intel coming into the market, ﬁrst of all, of course, validates the market, for us. I don't
think Intel does anything unless they think its a big potential market. And I think they
simply can't ignore the beneﬁts of high-performance computing.
So I think that helps us. That helps us validate the market.
But in the meantime, we have six or seven years of code writing that we've been
doing that we think competition has to catch up on.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
And unfortunately, with that, we have to wrap up. We're out of time.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Thanks very much, Rob. I appreciate.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
All right. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Joe.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26
