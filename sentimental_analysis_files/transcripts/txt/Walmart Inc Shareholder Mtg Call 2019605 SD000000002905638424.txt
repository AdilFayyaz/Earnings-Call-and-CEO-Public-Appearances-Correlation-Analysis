Good morning. It's my honor as Chair of the Walmart Board of Directors to welcome
you and formally open our 49th Annual Shareholders' Meeting. It's always notable
when a member of the U.S. Senate takes time to visit us. And I want to welcome
Senator Sanders today.
The inspectors of election today are from Broadridge Financial Solutions. And based
on their report, we have a quorum and may proceed with the business of the
meeting. Therefore, our meeting is now oﬃcially called to order. It's 10:35 and the
polls are open. Only shareholders who held shares as of the close of business on
April 12, 2019, or their proxy holders are entitled to vote shares. If you have not voted
your shares or wish to change your vote, please raise your hand and the ushers will
pass you a ballot.
Like last year, as you arrived, the rules of conduct for the meeting were being
handed out. These rules are designed to ensure we have a productive and orderly
meeting today. And we ask that you review and follow these procedures. If you need
any assistance locating that information, please ask one of the ushers.
Now I would like to acknowledge our director nominees. All 12 director nominees
are here with us today. Thank you for your willingness to continue to serve.
I would also like to welcome Cesar Conde, who ﬁrst joined our Board by

Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for your interest in our
company. Thank you, to Senator Sanders and all the shareholder proponents for
being here today.
This past ﬁscal year was a strong one for Walmart. And I'd like to start by thanking
our associates. This team of ours continues to amaze me. Their ability to change and
grow is impressive and so important during these times.
I joined Walmart more than 28 years ago as an hourly associate loading trucks in a
distribution center. And I worked all over our business. And I've never seen the pace
and magnitude of change in retail like it is now. Retail history teaches us that those
that fail to adapt will struggle and eventually perish. So these past few years, we've
made signiﬁcant investments to put us on a stronger path. We've invested in our
associates with higher pay, training and education and new technology for our
associates and lower prices for our customers and our eCommerce business to
ensure our future.
Our operating margin percentage is slim. And these investments hurt earnings for
multiple years. We would like to thank our shareholders collectively for
demonstrating understanding and some degree of patience.
Taken together, these decisions are working. Our store traﬃc, store sales and
eCommerce sales for Walmart U.S. have been growing. Just a few years ago, our U.S.
comp sales ran down for 5 quarters in a row. But we now run up in comp sales for
the past 19 consecutive quarters. Last year, excluding fuel and tobacco, Sam's Club
comps increased 5.7%. And our International markets delivered positive comps in 8
out of 10 markets.
Our top priority is to serve customers. Sam Walton was called a merchant with a
servant's heart. And we still embody that mindset today. Over the years, we've
learned that the best way to serve our customers is by creating shared value among
a broad group of stakeholders. This means we consciously work to balance the
interests of our customers, our associates, suppliers, communities, shareholders and
our broader inﬂuence on the world. Those of you that follow the company closely
know that we've changed a lot over the years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-05

Page 3 of 8Let me share a few examples of the recent changes we've made for our associates
that reﬂect both the heart of the company and sound business strategy. We've
moved up our starting wages in the U.S. by 50% in the last four years. And we
continue to adjust up on a market-by-market basis to recruit and retain the talent we
need to run a good business. In fact, over the last four years, we've invested an
incremental $4.5 billion in pay beyond our traditional annual wage increases for our
U.S. store and club associates. It's clear by our actions and those of other companies
that the federal minimum wage is lagging behind. $7.25 is too low. It's time for
Congress to put a thoughtful plan in place to increase the minimum wage. Any plans
should take into account phasing and cost-of-living diﬀerences to avoid unintended
consequences.
In addition to our investments in pay, our hourly associates earned $793 million in
quarterly cash bonuses last year on top of their hourly compensation. We
established training academies here in the U.S. and in several countries around the
world. We promoted more than 215,000 U.S. store associates last year. Across our
total U.S. workforce, 57% of our hourly promotions were to women and 45% were to
people of color. 75% of U.S. store management started as hourlies. We've hired more
than 225,000 U.S. veterans since Memorial Day 2013 with a goal of hiring 250,000
by 2020. We launched $1-a-day college program. And so far, more than 7,500
associates are participating. This week, we're announcing the expansion of that
program to include technology degrees, more schools and support for high school
students.
We've expanded parental leave to as much as 16 weeks of paid time oﬀ for
birthmothers. We added a $5,000 child adoption beneﬁt, which was an idea that
came from an associate during a town hall meeting. We created centers of
excellence partnering with providers such as the Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins for
associates facing a health crisis. And we oﬀer health care options for associates that
start as low as $28 per pay period, which is 40% less than the national average. We
cover 1.1 million associates and family members here in the U.S.
Our work to create a more inclusive company has been recognized by the
Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, the Disability Equality Index and the Human
Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index. We've also signed on to several
initiatives, including Catalyst CEO Champions for Change, CEO Action for Diversity
& Inclusion and Paradigm for Parity.
Our work extends beyond customers and associates as we take advantage of the
size of the company to do good in the world. In 2005, we set an aspirational goal to
be supplied by 100% renewable energy. And globally, we're now up to 28%. We
launched Project Gigaton, an initiative to avoid emissions in the supply chain by 1
billion metric tons by 2030. And more than 1,000 suppliers have signed up. We set a
goal of eliminating waste from our system entirely. And we now divert 78% of our
waste from landﬁlls. Through Acres for America, an initiative that protects an acre of
our nation's parks for every acre we develop, we've developed -- been able to
protect 1.4 million acres since 2005. And we set a goal of selling more sustainable
items and more sustainable packaging and have taken action to reduce salt andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-05

prices on fresh fruits and vegetables.
Our eﬀorts extend to philanthropy as well. Last year alone, we gave $1.4 billion in
cash and in-kind gifts to projects that create opportunity, enhance sustainability and
strengthen communities. To ﬁght hunger, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have
provided 4 billion meals to those in need since 2014. And because of our presence
in local communities, we're there when disaster strikes such as the devastating
California wildﬁres last year and the current ﬂooding we're experiencing, including
here in this region. As we do with hurricanes and other disasters, we're supporting
the community ﬁnancially and with much needed supplies.
Finally, we've invested in ethics and compliance around the world. We expect our
associates, suppliers and contractors to champion a set of values, which include
treating all people with respect, acting with personal integrity and complying with
the laws of the communities in which we operate. We provide a variety of resources
for our stakeholders to raise questions or concerns, including a global helpline and
the website, WalmartEthics.com.
When I was 16, I came to my ﬁrst Walmart Shareholders' Meeting with my dad, who
was a dentist. And he'd taken some of the money that he earned and bought
Walmart stock. As I learned more about Sam, his business philosophy, his family and
the company, I was beyond impressed. That was more than 35 years ago. And I have
never been more prouder of this company and of our associates. We're not perfect.
But together, we're listening, we're learning, we're changing. And we know we can
help our customers even more. And we love the challenge of helping our associates
pursue their dreams through the opportunities that Walmart creates. This is a
company you can be proud to invest in. Thank you for your interest in Walmart.
Now please allow me to introduce Rachel Brand, our Executive Vice President of
Global Governance and Corporate Secretary. She'll take us through the proposals.
Thank you.

Thank you, Doug.
As Greg mentioned, this meeting is being conducted under the established rules of
conduct. Consistent with those rules and our practice for many years, each person
presenting a proposal will have 3 minutes to present it. The speakers were informed
of these rules in advance. The clock will be visible to the speakers on both sides. And
if necessary, I'll provide a reminder when time has run out.
There are 6 matters to be brought before the meeting today. Only these 6 items, if
properly presented, will be voted on. The ﬁrst 3 items are the company proposals
listed in the proxy statement as proposals 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The ﬁrst is the
election of 12 directors. Information about each director nominee can be found in
the proxy statement. The second proposal is a nonbinding advisory vote to approveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-05

ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the company's independent
accountants for the ﬁscal year ending January 31, 2020.
Now we'll move on to the shareholder proposals. The ﬁrst appeared as proposal #4
in the proxy statement. Ms. (Paula Anne Curtis) will present this proposal on behalf of
United for Respect. Ms. (Curtis), you have 3 minutes.
Mr. Chairman, I oﬀer the following resolution for United for Respect. Resolved:
Shareholders of Walmart urge the Board of Directors to strengthen Walmart's
prevention of workplace sexual harassment by formalizing the Board's oversight
responsibility aligning senior executive compensation incentives, reviewing and, if
necessary, overseeing revision of company policies and reporting to shareholders by
December 31, 2019, on actions taken or meeting -- of meeting conﬁdential and
proprietary information.
My name is (Paula Curtis). I am a 19-year Walmart associate in Citrus Heights. I love
serving my customers and consider many of my coworkers my family. But I am
deeply concerned that Walmart's response to sexual harassment protects harassers
and not keeps us safe. A Walmart support manager repeatedly harassed one of my
coworkers. When she refused his advances, he retaliated by telling the managers
that she was not doing her job. She bravely went to speak to the comanager. And I
went with her. We told him that she was being sexually harassed. We told him that
the support manager had also harassed other associates, including pinning a
coworker up against a pallet against her will. The comanager said he would look into
it. Meanwhile, the support manager continued harassing. We heard nothing from
management about our complaint. But management apparently told the harasser
about the complaint. And he cornered me and asked me to lie on his behalf and say
that he was innocent. I refused. six months later, we still didn't hear anything, any
results for our complaint. Instead, Walmart ﬁred my friend. The support manager,
who was doing harassing, was simply transferred to another store.
My experience is not unique. At United for Respect, we surveyed 1,000 women at
Walmart. 48% said they were concerned about women being sexually harassed or
feeling unsafe at work. That is not right. Walmart has faced multiple lawsuits and
EEOC charges for sexual harassment. Not only does harassment hurt associates, it
also bad for our bottom line, potentially impacting our company's reputation,
associate retention and ultimately, even our stock price.
So Mr. McMillon, we know harassment is happening at Walmart. The question is,
what are we going to do about it?
Currently, we have a weak policy. And associates don't trust management to take our
complaints seriously. As the largest corporate employer of women in the U.S.,
Walmart should be a leader. So let's strengthen our harassment policy by giving
survivors a clear time line on your investigation...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-05

Thank you, Ms. (Curtis). Your time has expired. Please conclude.
I'm almost done. And a commitment to let them know the results. Let us track all
complaints so that we know if a manager, for example, is a repeat oﬀender. Let's
hold the harassers accountable with meaningful discipline, including dismissal. And
we should use top executive pay to communicate the importance of achieving real
progress.
Finally, let's bring harassment out of the shadows at Walmart and make the company
a safe place to work by adopting these proposals. Thank you.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. (Curtis). We appreciate your viewpoint and your service as an
associate. Although we don't support this particular proposal, we do agree with you
that sexual harassment or any type of discrimination in the workplace cannot be
tolerated. We take very seriously any allegation of misconduct. And we do have
strong processes in place for investigating claims and taking corrective action. More
information about that can be found in the proxy statement.
Next, we'll consider the proposal mentioned in the Other Matters section of the
proxy statement. It was submitted by Ms. (Carolyn Davis). Senator Bernie Sanders will
present this proposal on behalf of Ms. Davis. Senator Sanders, you have 3 minutes.
{BIO 13388480 <GO>}
Thank you, Madam Chair. And let me thank Walmart employee, (Cat Davis), for
introducing this resolution. And it states and I quote, "Resolved: Shareholders of
Walmart urge the Board to adopt the policy of promoting signiﬁcant representation
of employee perspectives among corporate decision-makers by requiring that the
initial list of candidates from which new nominees are chosen by the Nominating
and Governance Committee include hourly associates. The policy should provide
that any third-party consultant asked to furnish an initial list will be requested to
include such candidates." End of quote, end of resolution.
Madam Chair, the issue that we are dealing with today is pretty simple. Walmart is
the largest private employer in America and is owned by the Walton family, the
wealthiest family in the United States, worth approximately $175 billion. And yet
despite the incredible wealth of its owner, Walmart pays many of its employees
starvation wages, wages that are so low that many of these employees are forced to
rely on government programs like food stamps, Medicaid and public housing in
order to survive. Frankly, the American people are sick and tired of subsidizing the
greed of some of the largest and most proﬁtable corporations in this country. They
are also outraged by the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in AmericaFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-05

Gregory Boyd Penneras demonstrated by the CEO of Walmart making 1,000x more than the average
Walmart employee.
Last year, Walmart made nearly $10 billion in proﬁt. It paid its CEO over $20 million in
compensation. And it has authorized $20 billion in stock buybacks, which will beneﬁt
its wealthiest stockholders. Surely, with all of that, Walmart can aﬀord to pay its
employees a living wage of at least $15 an hour. And that is not a radical idea
because many of Walmart's major competitors like Amazon, Costco and Target have
already moved in that direction. Further, Walmart should give a voice to its workers
by allowing them seats on the Board of Directors. The concerns of workers, not just
stockholders, should be part of Board decisions.
Today, with the passage of this resolution, Walmart can strike a blow against
corporate greed and a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that exist in
our country. Please do the right thing. Please pass this resolution. Thank you very
much.

Thank you, Senator Sanders, for your presentation and for your viewpoint. While we
don't support this particular proposal, the importance of listening to and investing in
our associates was reﬂected in Doug's remarks. And you'll hear more about it later in
the meeting.
We'll now move on to the ﬁnal shareholder proposal. It appeared as proposal #5 in
the proxy statements. Mr. (Martin Jeringoso) will present this proposal. Mr.
(Jeringoso), you have 3 minutes. Is Mr. Jeringoso present today?
We're not aware that he's arrived.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
Okay. It appears that Mr. (Jeringoso) has not arrived and, therefore, his proposal will
not be voted on at -- during this meeting. In that case, that concludes the business
portion of our meeting. It is 10:54 and the polls are now closed. We will announce
the informal results later today. And the formal results will be ﬁled with the SEC at a
later time.
At this time, Greg Penner will provide some additional remarks, followed by a brief
video. I declare the meeting to be adjourned upon the conclusion of the video.

Page 8 of 8Thank you, Rachel. Thank you, all for being here today. And thank you to those who
presented proposals.
At Walmart, we're always striving not just to be a better business. But also a better
company. We are focused on serving our customers, caring for our associates and
making a diﬀerence in our communities. Broadly speaking, there are serious issues
facing our country, our workforce and our economy, which require all of us, our
government, the private sector and our fellow citizens, to work together. Walmart is
doing its part to help address these challenges. No other company in America is
making a college education accessible to more than 1 million of our fellow
Americans for only $1 a day. No other company has provided enhanced workforce
education for hundreds of thousands of people in just the past year alone. No other
company has hired more veterans in the last six years. And no other retailer has
consistently delivered high-quality, aﬀordable items to so many people that are
looking for value for their hard-earned dollar.
Our associates are doing an incredible job. And we will continue to invest in them.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are proud to represent them. And we will
continue to work with those who are interested in ﬁnding common ground and
making progress.
In closing, we will share a video that captures how we think about our associates and
the great contributions they make to our customers and our communities. Thank
you.
