Good morning. And thank you for calling Costco Wholesale Corporation. I'm Jeﬀ
Elliott, Assistant Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. And this morning I
will review our sales results for the 5-week retail month of March, which started on
Monday, March 3. And ended on Sunday, April 6.
For comparable sales results, this 5-week period is compared to the same 5-week
period last year, speciﬁcally Monday, March 4, through Sunday, April 7. March
included 35 selling days this year versus 34 days last year, reﬂecting the timing of the
Easter holiday.
Before I begin, let me start out by stating that the following discussions will include
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements
that address activities, events, conditions, or developments that the Company
expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, or performance
to diﬀer materially from those indicated by such statements.
These risks and uncertainties include. But are not limited to: domestic and
international economic conditions, including exchange rates; the eﬀects of
competition and regulation; uncertainties in the ﬁnancial markets; consumer and
small business spending patterns and debt levels; breaches of security or privacy of
member or business information; conditions aﬀecting the acquisition, development,
ownership, or use of real estate; amounts expected to be spent on expansion;
actions of vendors; the rising costs associated with employees, including healthcare
costs, energy. And certain commodities; geopolitical conditions; and other risks
identiﬁed from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports ﬁled
with the SEC. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update these
discussions due to subsequent events or circumstances.
Now with regard to sales, as reported in today's press release, net sales for the
month of March came in at $10.43 billion for the 5 weeks ended April 6, up 8%
compared to the $9.67 billion reported for the same period last year. This year's 5-
week period included 35 selling days compared to 34 days last year, reﬂecting theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-10

operate.
This calendar shift positively impacted this year's total and comparable sales by an
estimated plus 1% to plus 1.5%. Thus, the positive of the extra day was more
meaningful than the negative shift of holiday and preholiday sales into April.
For the 31 weeks ended April 6, the Company reported net sales of $64.65 billion, an
increase of 6% from the $61.02 billion reported in the similar period last year.
Comparable sales results for the 5; and 31-week periods were as follows. US 5 weeks
plus 6%; US 31 weeks, plus 4%. International 5 weeks plus 4%; international 31 weeks
plus 1%. Total Company 5 weeks plus 5%; total Company 31 weeks plus 3%.
Comparable sales for the 5-week and 31-week periods, excluding the negative
impacts of gasoline price deﬂation and foreign exchange, were as follows. US 5
weeks plus 6%; US 31 weeks plus 5%. International 5 weeks plus 9%; international 31
weeks plus 7%. Total Company 5 weeks plus 7%; total Company 31 weeks plus 5%.
In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights for the
month of March were as follows. On a regional and country basis, US regions with
the strongest results were the Midwest and Southeast. On an international basis in
local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Japan, Korea, Mexico. And Canada.
The strong comp sales results in Japan were largely driven by an increased
consumer demand, prior to a 3% increase in the nationwide sales tax which went
into eﬀect April 1. This beneﬁted total international comps by approximately 1%.
Moving on to merchandising highlights, the following comparable sales results by
category exclude the negative impact of foreign exchange. Food and sundries
comparable sales for the month were in the mid to high single-digit range. Within
food and sundries, the departments with the strongest results were candy, cooler.
And frozen foods.
Comp sales results for hardlines were positive low to mid single-digit for the month.
Better performing departments were oﬃce, automotive. And hardware. Consumer
electronics comp sales were ﬂat year-over-year.
Softlines experienced positive comp sales results in the low double-digit range.
Better performing departments within softlines include small appliances,
housewares, domestics. And apparel for both men and women.
Fresh foods experienced positive comp sales in the high single-digit range for the
month. Produce, deli. And meat all experienced strong results.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-10

Page 3 of 4Within the ancillary businesses, hearing aid and optical produced the best comp
sales increases. Gasoline comp sales were up in the low single-digit range year-over-
year. The average sale price per gallon was down 4.5%: $3.55 this year compared to
$3.71 last year. Overall, gasoline pricing deﬂation had a negative impact on March
sales of a little over minus 0.5%.
Weakening foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the US dollar resulted in a
detriment to our reported March sales of approximately minus 1.5%. Total
international comps for the 5-week period came in at plus 9% local currencies. But
resulted in a reported comp of plus 4% when converted to US dollars.
The average transaction was ﬂat year-over-year, which includes a minus 2-point drag
impact for the foreign exchange and gas deﬂation combined. Comparable traﬃc
frequency was up just a little bit over 5%; and of course, that includes the traﬃc from
the extra sales day.
Looking ahead, the 4-week April sales month will include 27 selling days this year
compared to 28 days last year, due to the timing of the Easter holiday. March was a
5-week reporting period that beneﬁted by about plus 1% to 1.5% for the extra day.
I would expect the loss of the day in April -- during the 4 weeks of April, that is --
reporting period would be more impactful: 4 weeks instead of 5 weeks. So probably
the range of minus 1.5% to minus 2% is my best guess for April, the detriment from
the loss of a day.
The April reporting period will end on Sunday, May 4. And will be compared to the 4
weeks ended Sunday, May 5, last year. We plan to announce April sales results on
Thursday, May 8.
Costco currently operates 650 warehouses, including 462 in the United States and
Puerto Rico; 33 in Mexico; 87 in Canada; 25 in the UK; 19 in Japan; 10 in Taiwan; 9 in
Korea; and 5 in Australia. Costco also operates electronic commerce websites in the
US, Canada, United Kingdom. And Mexico.
