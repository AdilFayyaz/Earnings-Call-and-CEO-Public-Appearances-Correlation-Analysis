Hi. Welcome to our next session. We're here with Microsoft. We're talking gaming.
Before we start, Tim, Catherine, maybe you can brieﬂy introduce yourself, and then I
go straight into the gaming part.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Great. Catherine, why don't you go ﬁrst?
Thank you, Tim. So I'm Catherine Gluckstein. I run product and strategy for Project
xCloud, which is our cloud gaming eﬀorts at Microsoft.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
I'm Tim Stuart, Xbox CFO. I've been at Microsoft and Xbox almost 20 years now. So
we can talk a little bit about the history of gaming throughout that if we need to.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. So yes. We're both getting gray. Yes. Hi. Just to set the scene a little bit,
like we've seen quite a few changes over the last couple of years, couple of quarters
as well in terms of like gaming at Microsoft. Can you give us a little bit of a
background from when we started Xbox ﬁve years ago to kind of what gaming is at
Microsoft today that's kind of very diﬀerent?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Oh, yes. Yes. Well said. Especially over those 20 years, a lot has changed in the
console space and in the gaming space writ large around the world. Over the last 20FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

A - Catherine Glucksteinyears, we've really seen a growth and we talk about a lot of content services, think
subscriptions, think games, think digital distribution. A lot have changed over the last
cycle.
And even really, over the last 4 or ﬁve years, a lot had changed. It wasn't too long
ago when we were thinking a lot about discs and how you walk into a store and buy
games and you play a game for a few hours, you're done and move on to the next
one. Game creation has changed, how you experience games have changed, the
services like Game Pass, Xbox Live, things like Fortnite, how subscription models
have changed. So it's an extremely exciting time to be in the industry.
I'd say at Microsoft, we're -- Xbox here, we're over $11 billion a year now. Our goal is,
as we think about just how do you reach the billions of players around the world?
And we'll talk about that later, but that's kind of the evolution of where we take this
business next into the future. So a lot had changed in the industry, a lot had changed
here at Xbox over the past few years and really, really excited about where it's going.
Absolutely, Tim. I mean I think what's really interesting as well as you track what's
gone on at Microsoft, but you also need to track what's gone on in the wider market.
Streaming has become mainstream. We estimate there are 3 billion gamers in the
world. It's a huge number. It's one of the fastest-growing areas of entertainment all
up. Obviously that's just an area we want to embrace as Microsoft.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. I mean like there -- let's stay on the recent news now. I guess the next
evolution would for me be like streaming. There, we saw the, what you call, like -- do
you actually call it xCloud? Or is this, as you call it, xCloud, xCloud game streaming?
So maybe like to get everyone on the same page now, how do you like -- set the
scene a little bit what it is, and then I have a couple of questions there.
Totally, totally. So just to set a scene on name, Project xCloud is our internal working
name for cloud gaming. And cloud gaming right now is pairing Xbox Game Pass
Ultimate, but that's just lots of terminology. Essentially, what it is, is this.
So if you think about gaming and the compute that it takes to render games on
diﬀerent devices, you've seen that silicon in devices support diﬀerent types of
games. So on consoles where you can have pretty high CPU, GPU, you can get these
very high-ﬁdelity games and much lower res games perhaps on mobile phones.
What cloud gaming does is it takes all of that and it renders the games literally in the
cloud. So you have any amount of compute. Then you take the games from the
cloud and you literally stream them to any device, which allows us as Xbox to stream
our high-ﬁdelity games from our consoles in the cloud right to Android phones as
we're doing today with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 11A - Raimo Lenschow
A - Catherine Gluckstein
A - Raimo Lenschow
A - Catherine GlucksteinEssentially, it's just a video stream. The way that everybody should think about it is if
you're able to stream Netﬂix or YouTube on your phone, then you're able to stream
any game from the cloud. So what that means is we can take any game made and
distribute it to any device, which as you can imagine, just opens up the opportunity.
In a world where there are 200 million consoles, we can now reach any device with
these games and our TAM opportunity just opened right up. In terms --
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Sorry. No, go ahead, sorry. Go ahead, sorry.
I'm sorry. In terms of what we are doing, we know this is going to be a journey to
perfection. There's a lot to get right with latency and the streaming eﬀorts. If you see
what's happened in video over the years and how it's improved, we know we're on
that journey with gaming. But we started about a year ago in what we called Preview,
which is where we just opened it up to everybody. So come and test them with us,
and an amazing hundreds of thousands of people did that.
Then in September of this year, we launched in 22 markets into Xbox Game Pass
Ultimate, which is our ﬂagship subscription product with more than 100 games to
stream and play right then and there on Android phones. Then since then, we've
opened up a number of other markets, and we'll enter with -- into 4 new markets
next year with Game Pass Ultimate, Japan, Mexico, Brazil and Australia. And just this
morning, we announced that we're also going to bring streaming to PCs, both as
part of the native app and on browser and to iOS phones through a browser. So you
can see that we're on this steady march to increase countries, to increase devices
and to reach this TAM.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
And so there's 2 questions I had on that, Catherine. One is like you're trying this, I
think -- but there are other guys as well like Google, Amazon, PlayStation, et cetera.
Like what's the diﬀerentiator? How do you try to diﬀerentiate here?
Yes. It's an awesome question. So the way we think about it is this, and I think Tim
sort of launched it at the beginning. We are a gaming company. We've actually been
in games even longer than Tim's been at the company because it's 40 years since
we ﬁrst entered gaming on PC. Over the last 20 years, we've been building the Xbox
brand. So we're a gaming company through and through.
We have a broad ﬁrst-party studio. These are studios that are part of Microsoft. We
have 15 of them, and with the ZeniMax acquisition, we'll add a further 8 studios. This
allows us to innovate in really interesting ways because, obviously with ﬁrst parties,
we can look to do things that we wouldn't look to do with other types of content. We
went day-and-date with ﬁrst party in Game Pass, which was an inﬂection point for
Game Pass. And even as we learn in the cloud, we've been working with the team of
Minecraft Dungeons to build native touch controls.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

Page 4 of 11A - Raimo Lenschow
A - Catherine GlucksteinWe also -- because we've been in gaming a long time, we've built a community. We
think a community is absolutely key for gaming. You play games together, you play
with your friends. We have more than 100 million people on Xbox Live. Then, of
course there's the cloud. Sorry, that's my dog, there's nothing like being at home.
Then, of course there's the cloud, and we have Azure. 66 regions, 140 countries. That
means we can get within streaming distance of more than 80% of the sort of 3 billion
gamers on the planet today and we're only expanding that.
So a ton of things that we really think that it plays to our strengths. The other thing
that we've done that's maybe a little bit diﬀerent to some others in the market is
we've actually taken our consoles and we built cloud play. So we've put it in the
cloud. So we actually have the technology to stream any of the games ever built for
Xbox. That is thousands and thousands of games. So really interesting.
Perhaps the ﬁnal thing that I'd add here just because I think it's a way when we look
at TAM to think about things is we obviously have a very large Xbox consumer base
today. What we're seeing, again early data because we're early into market, there's a
couple of things. One is that for people who have -- we call them console-ﬁrst game
-- from console-ﬁrst gamers. They're people who've joined us on console or PC and
they stream as an additional part.
What we're seeing with those gamers is as they stream, they're actually playing
longer on their native devices as well. So you kind of see this enhancement for the
current user. Then really excitingly and obviously part of our expansion to empower
every gamer on the planet is this idea of a stream-ﬁrst user. In speciﬁc markets, you
know that we went and tested with SKT in South Korea, we're seeing gamers we've
never seen before. Those are some of the most highly engaged gamers that we're
seeing on our streaming platform.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. The other question around cloud is like this kind of works or doesn't work based
on latency, I would think. Like so -- and that's -- going back to your points, like if I
have Netﬂix, I can play games, but can I? And where are we on that latency journey?
Because you need to have that feedback loop back to be able to play.
Yes. It's such a smart question, and it's always the one that we think about most. This
is why we took this journey with Preview because it wasn't just about learning what
the market would be like, it's learning how the technology works.
The way to think about it is that we've optimized our stack to basically run at sort of
10 megabits per second. So it's actually a very reasonable size, which is in line with
how Netﬂix runs. So if you can -- as I said before, if you can run Netﬂix, if you can run
video, you can run these games.
Then what we did as part of Preview is we took a whole selection of diﬀerent types of
games. Some of the most demanding sort of Twitch-type games, from Killer InstinctFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 11A - Raimo Lenschow
A - Tim Stuartto Destiny, and we tested them. Interestingly, what we found is they worked really
well. I think the way we can tell that they worked really well is, yes, we did tests and
we benchmarked it. But more than that, Destiny, during Preview, was our most
engaged game.
So obviously if it's going to be our most engaged game, people are getting a very
satisfactory experience or more than satisfactory experience. The scores and the NPS
scores that we got back were incredibly solid. So we have conﬁdence.
And what we've learned from that is it's not latency alone that matters. It's
consistency of stream. So where our human brains get upset is if things jump around
and change. But if you've got this consistency, so along with our partners in
Microsoft Research, we've been working on enhancing that. So it's something that
we're pretty conﬁdent about, and I'm really proud of the advances the team has
made there.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. So it's funny, that kind of brings me then slightly diﬀerent subject, but then the
question is do I need to chase you because Tim, I was trying to kind of ﬁnd out
what's the situation on the new Xbox X and S because I do hear about supply
constraints and a little bit -- and Christmas is coming up and the kids are asking. Well
I'll be for that, but then maybe I go straight to the cloud there, but maybe that's the
only Xbox perks, yes?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. On the Xbox side, ﬁrst is we've seen unprecedented demand for what we have
in the market, which is a great sign out of the gates. I really, really love the SKU
proﬁle we picked, the power proﬁle of these consoles and ultimately, the price
proﬁle as well. We talk about the world's most powerful console at $499 and the best
value in gaming at $299 with Xbox Series S. I really think Raimo, the combination of
both of those combined with what we've seen is really unprecedented engagement
in gaming as of late is really driving demand for these consoles.
We're at max capacity on supply. We will be for as long as we can see and really
catch up to that demand proﬁle. But as you say exactly right, we are supply
constrained right now, and we're doing our best to get consoles onto the hands of
consumers.
The consumers, at this point in the stage, are some of your best Xbox fans, your
highest lifetime value when you think of -- these are the -- we call them high-value
gamers because they play a lot, they buy a lot, they spend a lot. They have the most
friends online. They're really your most actively engaged consumers. So having
consoles in their hands out of the gates to really jump-start the generation is really,
really key.
And I may add on that one. We've seen in the past something like 50% of console
generation units come at $299 and below. So what we do with Xbox Series S is reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 11A - Raimo Lenschow

A - Tim Stuartﬁnd a price point that resonates with that consumer group, which resonates with the
broadening of the audience to bring forward that console demand. What it turns
into is high demand in holidays and a supply portfolio that we're working to fulﬁll as
quickly as we can.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. And how do you think about consoles going forward in a way? Like I mean if --
will we have another Xbox X after this? Or is it going to be all cloud? Is this kind of
the last generation, and hence, I need to buy it even more?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. That's a great question. I think over the 20 years that I've been here, we've sort
of said this is the last console generation for a while. But really, what it turns into is
the console becomes the cornerstone and the foundation of our strategy. The
console has a world where 3,000 games work on the console.
And to Catherine's point, you can lift and shift those games into xCloud. You can
stream them out of the gate. You can put them in our Azure data centers, reach 90%
of the world's gamers with the geo footprint we have because of that strength in
console. Having that content pipeline, which I know we'll talk about in a second,
having games built, having the community of players there, that console piece of the
business is so important to have out of the gate, which we're very, very excited
about. But yes, it's a very diﬀerent cycle.
One of the things I'd highlight here, too -- but some of the diﬀerences is when -- this
time around, we think about console as a piece of the puzzle as opposed to the
puzzle. We're not doing things like making Halo Inﬁnite exclusive to the next-gen
consoles. We're not doing things like making our controllers exclusive to these
generational consoles, which really puts the user at the center.
We think about an ecosystem, not unlike Netﬂix talks about subscribers or Facebook
talks about monthly active users. We think about that ecosystem and that community
of users, of which console is important, but growth at Microsoft and growth in this
category is all about PC. It's all about mobile. It's all about geo expansion. How do
you get into Africa and India? How do you create new business models? Console
helps us establish that and console is so important for us to win in. But that really
creates that foundation of where we're going.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Okay okay. That makes sense. Okay. Then from a -- now I'm the Wall Street guy
who cares about numbers. Let's -- and numbers were -- the thinking has changed in
our industry as like, "Oh, I want subscriptions." So talk a little bit about Game Pass as
the way to have a diﬀerent monetization model.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 11Yes. That's great. Yes. So for the audience, what Game Pass is, is it's a monthly
subscription to access to hundreds of great games. Depending on the region you're
in or SKU, it's $14.99 with Game Pass Ultimate, which gives you streaming, which
Catherine talked about earlier; or $9.99, which is you get it for Xbox on the console
or on the PC. So that's kind of Game Pass in a nutshell.
One of the things that we really, really like about Game Pass is how it drives
engagement. I talk a lot about how engagement equals currency. You want to have
users on your platform. You want to have players playing the games. And Game Pass
has really changed the game for us.
When you think about a user coming in, they have access to more games. They have
access to more of their friends playing those games. On the ﬁrst-party side, when we
think about ﬁrst-party content pipeline, we put those games in day-and-date in the
Game Pass.
So I think not unlike Netﬂix will launch Orange is the New Black then Stranger Things
then House of Cards. We want that exact high-quality ﬁrst-party content going into
Game Pass, drive top-of-funnel excitement so users come in and really decrease
churn out of the bottom. They always know something new is coming every single
month or every single quarter, and they can play those games and go forward.
So from a business model standpoint, I love it. It's sort of a classic new recurring
revenue. I get the -- you get the revenue and annuity over time. But more importantly
is you engage with that customer on a recurring basis. We don't have to have that
customer acquisition cost to go ﬁnd a new customer.
We don't have to go have that, will they buy a game in the spring and maybe they'll
buy a game in the fall. It's that recurring revenue stream that is critically important.
That -- which leads us into the content pipeline discussion, which is also going to be
key to that Game Pass bet. But out of the gate, I love it.
One of the things I would say about Game Pass too is from a third-party standpoint
or when you think about content pipeline, third parties can come into Game Pass.
Grand Theft Auto from Take-Two is a great example. Grand Theft Auto, one of the
most successful games ever you would think that almost everybody has purchased
Grand Theft Auto for $60 and then played it over time. It turns out there's a lot of
users that haven't bought the game. So Grand Theft Auto goes into Game Pass, they
can acquire new users in the Game Pass subscriber pool.
And as we talked about earlier a little bit, the evolution of gaming, these games as a
service are all about monetization from there. They can sell maps and skins and
missions as downloadable content. So they reach a new content or new customer
pool and then they ﬁnd the ability to go engage and monetize that pool as well. So
they're seeing revenue growth as well from a third-party side. Then the Microsoft
heritage as a platform when our partners do well, we do well. So it's all about driving
that ecosystem.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

And how do you think about like exclusivity because like that's -- and I like -- if I think
about Sony and their games, there's still kind of a big element of that. Like how do
you feel? Like do you need some exclusive titles? Would it be helpful or --
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes, yes. I mean you think about one of the cornerstones of ﬁrst party is driving that,
we'll call it, exclusive content. When you think about Halo or Forza, what we've done
with Gears of War over time. Any strong platform, any strong subscription service has
to have that cornerstone platform, the cornerstone, the ﬂagship content to come in.
That's really something we're focusing on as well. How do you bolster ﬁrst-party
content pipeline? How do you think about content from our studios coming in and
driving our platforms?
Now as Catherine mentioned, as we put the customer at the center, it's going to be
less about, call it, exclusivity to a speciﬁc device and more about we want Game Pass
on every device, whether it's a console or a PC or a mobile phone. So that content
pipeline that we have to drive a Game Pass service to get that Game Pass service
onto any device in the world, that's the goal. That's really why we want a strong
content piece of the puzzle in there to drive propensity to the subscription. Then you
can play the subscription in whatever device you happen to be on.
Yes. That's a really interesting point that layers on top of what Tim -- which is just said,
which is when you start thinking about the true network eﬀects of gaming. So if you
think engagement equals monetization, you want to up the engagement through the
network eﬀects. You can do that with Game Pass because everybody shares the
same library.
So if I want to play Destiny with you, Raimo, we can because we both are subscribers
and we both have that. When there's very little friction to getting into the service
because it's available on multiple devices, you can just jump in and play. So you start
thinking of all of that virtual cycle that can start to exist together. And community
takes up a new way of thinking about it, if you think.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes, yes, yes. And like talk a little bit about content. I remember when you were last at
our conference, I think that was two years ago, I asked a question about the
acquisition. You were like, no, no, no, we kind of feel really comfortable about our
content. And now we saw like -- I mean it looks like a very interesting deal coming in,
in the last couple of months. How do you think about more broader terms? How
much content do you need? How much -- like how do you solve that puzzle?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Yes, yes. Well said. Yes, so we -- you're referencing the ZeniMax acquisition, which is
one of the bigger ones Microsoft has ever done. It really hits on a key strategic point.
We think Game Pass -- or we know Game Pass is one of our core bets. We have
announced 15 million subscribers in Game Pass.
And as you think about the path from 15 million to 20 million to 50 million to 100
million Game Pass subscribers, you have to have a content pipeline that supports
that because you're talking about a much broader set of customers, a much broader
geographic base and much broader elements of play style, whether it's ﬁrst-person
shooters or RPGs or strategy games or whatever it is. You're going to have that
content pipeline that supports hundreds of millions of people playing these games.
And our acquisitions really reﬂect that. We're now to 23 studios on the ﬁrst-party
side. We did, I think at the time of the last conference in 2018, we're just on our way
to sort of 7 or 8 acquisitions back then.
And really, what we see is content being that key diﬀerentiator, content being the
driver of Game Pass subscription, content being the reason we play which is why you
watch Netﬂix or Hulu or listen to Spotify, it's the content.
As we thought about an acquisition like Bethesda, it gives us access to a great set of
IP. Some of the best content creators in the world are in Bethesda or in ZeniMax. And
really what it allows us to do is when that content is in our ﬁrst-party portfolio, we can
take that, make it day-and-date, meaning we can launch it into Game Pass the day
that we launched the game publicly.
And that's really one of the cornerstones of Game Pass value prop is I can play those
games right when it come out. Not unlike what HBO Max is going to be doing with
some of the titles you see launching now, which is day-and-date into the service to
drive propensity to the subscription.
So that's really the cornerstone of why we think about Bethesda being an awesome
piece of that puzzle. It really creates that pipeline, the demand of what it means to be
a Game Pass subscriber.
Then I'd say maybe lastly on this one. As Catherine noted, going to diﬀerent devices
like PC, diﬀerent devices like mobile, they're not going to be all console gamers. We
talk about the market size of console being 200 million or 300 million consoles, PC
is 200 million or 300 million and then mobile audience is billions plus.
That's Microsoft scale that we're thinking about. How do you go reach the 3 billion
gamers in the world? How do you leverage Azure to go reach those gamers? And to
get to scale that big, again you have to have that content diﬀerentiation. ZeniMax has
a great piece of portfolio. They have some awesome mobile IP. That's really -- as you
think about that kind of expansion into new users and the new audiences where
acquisitions like that are going to be so critical. So when we think about, again thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-09

Bethesda and ZeniMax ﬁts right into that strategy.
{BIO 4664646 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. Now that's really interesting. It's funny, I'm just getting the warnings here
on time. The -- I could talk for hours here on this one. Like maybe like last question
then for me is like there's a lot of kind of amazing stuﬀ coming together with the new
Xbox, streaming, expansion of the content, et cetera. Like what's next for you guys?
Like what's the stuﬀ that keeps you awake at night that we don't know yet without
you launching it here, yes?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. No, it's a great question. First and foremost, it's growth, it's Microsoft scale. How
do you expand beyond where we're going today? And we're -- I look at the date
here. We're a month or so into the new console generation. So the next 3 or four
years are going to be all about, how do you just go -- how do you go expand? How
do you go win share? How do you go get as many consoles as we can into the
market as a piece of the puzzle?
When we think about our next steps of growth, when we think about a decade from
now, getting Game Pass to hundreds of millions of subscribers, it's really the goal.
That's going to drive such a demand to our service. It's going to drive such a
network eﬀect.
Then Catherine, on her side with -- when we think about Project xCloud, a lot of
good, yes, not yet announced products we have coming to really go reach those
gamers. There's going to be amazing experiences where people can pick up a
mobile device, play a game they want when they want and really have that sort of
seamless devices go away in the future. So that's going to be key. And Catherine,
you can hit on that one too.
Yes, yes. No. Sorry, Tim, I didn't mean to interrupt you there, but that's absolutely
right. So Raimo, when you think about this, think about innovation in business model,
continued innovation there as we target diﬀerent markets and diﬀerent segments.
Think about continued innovation in product. Tim talked about the seamless,
frictionless. When I can literally jump into a game with one click, it changes
everything, right?
And think about innovation in the technology with our partners in Azure and our
telco partners as we look to continue to reﬁne that experience when you have the
rollout of 5G. It's really -- this is so exciting when you bring the content together with
the technology, with the business models and the product, we create a Microsoft
scale future.
