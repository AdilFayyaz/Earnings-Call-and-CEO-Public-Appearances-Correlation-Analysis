Company.
The purpose for today's call is to discuss updates to Starbuck's loyalty program.
Scott Maw, our CFO. And Matt Ryan, our Global Chief Strategy Oﬃcer, will lead the
discussion and for the Q&A session, they will be joined by Aimee Johnson, Senior

will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and
uncertainties that could cause our actual results to diﬀer materially from these
statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with
cautionary statements and risk factor discussions in our ﬁlings with the SEC including
our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any
of these forward-looking statements or information.
This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available

{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Thanks Durga and good morning everyone. The purpose of today's call is to
announce some exciting changes to our loyalty program to be called Starbucks
Rewards for the US, Canada and Puerto Rico. Matt will go into details on the program
changes which are based upon the number one customer requested update, more
stars awarded based on what customers buy at Starbucks no matter how often they
visit. That means giving stars for every dollar spent on everything, coﬀee, mugs,
drinks, food and more.
Before I hand over to Matt, I just want to reiterate how important our loyalty program
is today to both our customers and to our ﬁnancial performance. Speciﬁcally, we
have over 11 million active loyalty members, a number that has increased 50% over
the past two years. Our members spend three times as much as nonmembers and
they generate more proﬁt driven by increased frequency of visits. And we continue
to enhance the program by adding features and beneﬁts such as integrating
Spotify's music service and the convenience of ordering ahead via mobile order and
pay. And we know that our loyalty program continues to add to the overall
momentum of our US business.
This includes the cumulative eﬀect of the incrementality associated with more
members joining the program, 1-to-1 marketing to our existing members. And mobile
order and pay. We also believe that the new Starbucks rewards program has the
potential to further contribute to our comp store sales growth over time. In fact, the
new program is one of the main reasons along with the launch of mobile order and
pay that our ﬁscal 2016 comp store sales guidance is somewhat above our long-
standing mid single-digit target.
Our recent trend of strong comp store sales over the past several quarters plus
newer drivers such as mobile order and pay and these loyalty program changes give
us conﬁdence in our comp guidance for the year.
With that I will turn it over to Matt for more details. Matt?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-22

Thanks, Scott. Before I go into the details of the program changes, let me provide
some additional context for why we are making these changes.
As Scott mentioned, we are approaching this change to the program ﬁrst and
foremost through the lens of our customer as the number one request we receive
from them, to tie the rewards to not only to how often you visit but also to what you
buy. By designing in this way we are providing opportunities for our customers to
earn more rewards each time they visit which will increase the value of the program
to our customers and to us.
We are very proud that we have more than 75 million customers coming through our
doors each month in the US but we estimate that fewer than one in six of those
customers are a loyalty member, a rate of participation far lower than companies in
other industries see. Naturally we think there is a lot of upside especially since we
see signiﬁcant revenue and proﬁt incrementality associated with every customer who
joins.
One of the other things we know is that some dissatisfaction with the current
structure of the program manifests as transaction splitting in which customers ask
baristas to ring up items they are buying separately in order to earn stars for each of
those items. This is challenging for other customers who are forced to wait and to
our baristas who have to perform extra work, a burden on them that adds cost to our
P&L by extending the transaction time. We estimate that recently approximately 1%
of our total transactions are from customers who request two or more separate
transactions to get stars.
With the shift to the new program, we expect to see transaction comp go down by
approximately 1 point while ticket comp will go up by the same amount simply as a
result of avoiding transaction splitting. And while we are pleased that the new
program will remove this distraction from our store operations, the real beneﬁt will
be to our customers as it increases customer satisfaction and motivates more
customers to join our loyalty program.
Now let me get into some of the speciﬁcs because starting today we will be
communicating the details of the new Starbucks rewards program through direct
email to our customers. As I mentioned. And most importantly, stars will now be
awarded based upon what you buy no matter how often you visit rather than on just
frequency of visitation. Instead of awarding a star per visit customers will receive two
stars for every dollar spent.
Under the current program, the customer who buys a tall cup of coﬀee, a round of
beverages for the whole family or merchandise all get just one star. In the future,
stars will be calculated on the total purchase which will provide more value to more
customers. Because all customers will be earning many more stars per transaction,
we have reset the number of stars you need for a reward at 125 stars. As always, youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 13can use reward earned on food or beverages. This choice of redemption is a
cornerstone of the appeal of our program.
It is important to note that in aggregate the rate at which our customers earn rewards
will not change and that the total % of revenue we provide back as rewards will
remain constant.
To explain this in more quantitative terms, in the current program customers with
gold status get a star for every transaction which averages a little over $5. Most
transactions are very close to that average so most customers earn a reward when
they spend a little over $60. In the new program, the math works the same way. At
two stars per $1 spent when a customer spends a little over $60, they earn a reward.
This is a very important point as there are examples of companies in other industries
who use changes in the loyalty program as a way to reduce the value of rewards at
the expense of customers. As we switch the mechanics of the program, we are not
using it as an opportunity to opaquely weaken the rewards proposition.
But we know that not all customers are alike and if these changes may aﬀect them in
diﬀerent ways. If customers simply engage -- continue to engage as they currently
do instead of engaging more as we believe they will, the vast majority of our
customers will earn rewards just as fast or faster than they would today. A small
portion of customers will experience a signiﬁcant increase in the pace at which they
earn rewards even without changing how they engage with us.
At the same time, there is a small minority of customers whose current purchase and
redemption habits will result in earning rewards at a slower pace. For customers
seeking to maximize the value of the program, the rewards structure still allows them
to redeem for any item on the menu which we believe is a great way for customers
to discover new products and establish new taste preferences.
An additional beneﬁt of resetting how customers earn and redeem stars is that the
unit cost of the star is now much lower than it is currently, more than 10 times lower.
This will allow us signiﬁcant ﬂexibility as we ﬁnd new ways of awarding stars to
customers as whole stars can be awarded in the context of very small transactions,
something that the unit price of stars has historically prohibited.
The potential this has for new ways customers can earn stars outside of our stores is
tremendous. As our customers love additional ways to earn stars as evidenced by
the success of our Stars Down the Aisle program in grocery. While we don't have
new partnerships to announce today, we have begun to realize this idea with other
like-minded companies such as Spotify, New York Times and Lift and this is just the
beginning.
Reducing the unit price per star is a key part of the long-term strategy here and we
have more news to share on this in the coming months.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-22
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Scott MawWe are also taking advantage of these program changes to simplify our membership
tier structure. Currently we oﬀer welcome, green and gold levels each with diﬀerent
tiers of beneﬁts. In the Starbucks Rewards Program, we are simplifying to just two
tiers, green and gold. When a customer signs up, they will now immediately become
a green member with all the beneﬁts that tier provides including a free drink on your
birthday, free reﬁlls on brewed coﬀee, tea as well as mobile order and pay and more.
We will also be introducing new beneﬁts like monthly double star days where every
month gold members can earn double stars on all the things they love, getting to
their reward even faster.
As in the current program, our gold level allows customers to earn stars on every
purchase they make at a rate of two stars per every dollar spent. As we convert to a
spend-based program, the qualiﬁcation requirement will convert accordingly. Now
as soon as you accumulate 300 stars, you reach gold regardless of how often you
come. Just spend $150 or even less if you are taking advantage of our bonus star
oﬀers. With this transition in April, customers maintain their current status and any
stars in the customer's account are converted to the new star system.
We have also made the decision that is part of the initial stars conversion in April,
every individual star will convert to 11 stars representing their full value which reﬂects
a slight adjustment up in the customers' favor.
Finally, one of the most exciting parts of these changes is coming mid-April where
any customer making a transaction at the welcome or green level will be
automatically awarded gold status for a full year and anyone making a transaction at
gold status will also get their gold status extended for a year. This is not only
assurance that anyone who is on their way to earning gold will get there. But that
there has been no better time than right now to join our loyalty program.
As you can see, the changes we will be making are with our customers' best interest
in mind which translates to increased customer loyalty and engagement as well as to
incrementality in both revenue and proﬁt.
With that, I will hand it back over to Scott.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Thank you, Matt. In closing, I would like to reiterate four key takeaways about our
new Starbucks rewards program. Our new loyalty program should continue
contributing to our comp store sales growth over time. We see the potential for
deeper customer engagement because the new program is designed to incentivize
through 1-to-1 marketing and personalization which will contribute to revenue growth
and ﬂow through to the bottom line.
The reduction in transaction splitting will speed transaction time for our customers
and partners while increasing ticket which we estimate will cause an approximately 1FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-22

Operatorpoint switch between traﬃc and ticket within comp. Traﬃc will go down and ticket
will increase by that same amount.
Our increased comp store guidance we gave at the beginning of ﬁscal 2016 includes
the impact of the new program.
In summary, we were once again listening to our customers and elevating our digital
ecosystem via a stronger and more relevant loyalty program. We will now take
questions about the information discussed today so please limit your questions do
these changes.
With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Keith Siegner, UBS.
{BIO 6299571 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Just a question in terms of thinking about some of the
technical aspects of this. Like for example, Stars Down the Aisle, great program. It is
not the easiest program in that you have to take that little sticker oﬀ and enter the
code. How does that evolve with this? Does that become a dollar spend, does it
continue to be a certain amount of stars per transaction? Is there an easier way to
get that reﬂected in your account? Any information along that would be helpful.
Thanks.
{BIO 20799603 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks. Customers are still able to earn stars on grocery items. Stars earned on
specially marked Starbucks products sold in grocery store will now vary depending
on the item's suggested retail price.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
So what that means, Keith, is for slightly larger items, we will give more stars. The way
to redeem those stars will be similar. Obviously we are always as we've discussed in
the past looking for ways to make that easier. But the good news is you still earn
Stars Down the Aisle and in this case based upon a little bit more about what you
spend.

{BIO 6061984 <GO>}
Thanks. Good morning. Have you tested this change? And are you concerned at all
that there might have been a simple elegance to the old system in that it was very
easy to understand and therefore motivating and that you might be losing a little of
that with this change? Thanks.
{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
Yes, of course, we look very carefully at everything we do here. We don't do things
haphazardly. What I can tell you is that there is an elegant simplicity to this new
system and it is the number one most requested change we get across all those
Starbucks to do it this way. It is what people are used to with loyalty programs right
now and we think we will be matching what people want and expect.
John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Thank you. Maybe a slightly diﬀerent direction. Can we talk about where the usage is
currently of mobile ordering and at what point Starbucks really starts to kind of look
at that relative to the total transaction count and start to drive awareness whether
using my Starbucks reward or through traditional marketing?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for the question, John. As you know we have north of 20% of our
transactions today on mobile payment. Mobile ordering is about 15% of that as we
exited the quarter, about 3% of total transactions. And as we said at the earnings call,
we saw that accelerate over the course of the quarter and we ﬁnished rolling that out
in September. So we are really happy with what we are seeing. At our busiest times
and our busiest stores, those percentages are much, much higher which we would
expect.
And I think it is really important and we said it in the prepared remarks, mobile
ordering is another beneﬁt for MSR customers that we are adding to the program.
So we continue to expand beneﬁts, we continue to leverage things around oﬀering
bonus stars. And so one of the big things that we are focusing on both with MSR
broadly and also speciﬁcally with mobile order and pay is getting awareness up in
stores. And honestly as we roll this program out and as we get through the
advertising and the notiﬁcation process with our customers, that is a great chance for
us to emphasize all of the beneﬁts of MSR including and I would argue especially the
beneﬁts of having the ability to order ahead at the busiest times.
So that is all in the plan to continue to expand that awareness and drive more
members into the program.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-22

{BIO 4139501 <GO>}
Thanks. Sorry if you guys covered this but could you explain exactly again when
customers will see this change happen on their phones I guess from what the stars
conversion looks like? How are you dealing with if the transaction comes in at 250,
are you going to round up to three stars at that point or do you have to go over the
dollar per each star that you are going to get?
{BIO 20799603 <GO>}
So customers are going to see the changes as early as today. We are going to be
sending emails out to our customer base as well and there will be some (inaudible)
information on our website. We will actually start seeing the stars rolling to your
individual account in April. That is when you will be able to log onto your phone and
see the changes. In regards to star conversion, we are actually -- customers get
stardust, they get credit for everything they are spending so there will be no
rounding, customers will get exactly credit for what it is they spend with us.
David Tarantino, Robert W. Baird.
{BIO 15144105 <GO>}
Good morning. My question relates to how this change will ultimately end up being
a comps driver. I think you mentioned, Scott, that you expect it to drive comps yet
the reward structure seems very similar just a change versus the value of the stars
rather than the amount of beneﬁts people are getting. So I guess maybe if you could
at a high level talk about why this change ends up being a comps driver, that would
be helpful.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Thanks, David. The main reason is because it is the number one requested change
and we hear about it a lot, we know that customers want more value based upon
what they spend and so what we believe is given the signiﬁcant capabilities we have
around driving diﬀerent behavior with 1-to-1 marketing and overall with the rewards
program, we believe that customers because they earn more, they will spend more.
And we have seen that as we have done bonus stars through 1-to-1 marketing, we
have seen that across the entire history of the program that when we make the
rewards easier to get, people spend more and they drive more activity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-22

Q - John GlassAnd so it is really that simple. By giving customers more based upon what they
spend we believe they will spend more and that will help with comps.
{BIO 15144105 <GO>}
And if I am still on, Scott, is the idea then that this will beneﬁt comps mainly through
check growth or do you think it will also increase frequency?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think we believe we have the chance to do both. I think you will see most of it in
ticket.
{BIO 15144105 <GO>}
Great, that is helpful. Thank you.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
David, I'm going to use this opportunity just to talk a little bit and Matt touched upon
this about personalization. So one of the things that we have been talking to you
about for some time now is our increased investment in capabilities around 1-to-1
marketing and personalization. And you will recall that when we started the year we
talked about partner and digital investments for this year in the neighborhood of
about $250 million to $300 million on a run rate basis.
In the most recent quarter we took that up from $275 million to $300 million for the
year and that step up was mostly driven by increased investment in personalization.
And that has something to do with the change in this programming capability
around that but it goes to what we are seeing from a return standpoint about
investing in personalization, about understanding our customers better, about
oﬀering them more frequent ways to accrue value. And so that is associated with this
program but also a really important part of what these changes mean for us.
John Glass, Morgan Stanley.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Thanks and good morning. I know, Scott you said most of the transactions are
around $5. But how is it distributed around it? There are a number of people
including myself that are probably in the lower end of that. So how many customers
are going to be negatively aﬀected or are going to get less of a beneﬁt from this?
And if you know anything about their loyalty or do they tend to be more easily
defectors for example to other brands because they tend to spend less?
Then also just the check splitting, how long has that been going on? Has that been
embedded in traﬃc for as long as eﬀectively as long as we have been able to see or
has that been a more recent phenomenon that has actually been a driver of the
traﬃc over the last four to eight quarters?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-22

A - Matt Ryan{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
Sure, let me take both of those. The check splitting one is easy. That has been going
on for quite some time. It is nothing new and it continues to be at around 1% of our
total transactions.
As for the question of the distribution, what I can tell you is the vast majority of
transactions are very close to that $5 plus number that I referenced. We are not
going to give out the very speciﬁc bell curve distributions or anything like that here
in this call. But what I can tell you is there are a small minority of people who will
either be advantaged or disadvantaged here. But I think it is worth pointing out that
there are other beneﬁts to the program besides just the star's back. For instance, if
anybody is a brewed coﬀee drinker, there are free reﬁlls on brewed coﬀee or tea so
those beverages that may be at the lower value end of the spectrum already come
with a terriﬁc beneﬁt in the program.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
And just to build a little bit, John, when Matt says for some time, this transaction
splitting has been an issue for years, not quarters but years and so it has been there
in the underlying numbers for many years now.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Okay. But there is no incremental beneﬁts for the low-end that you are getting with
this new program, it is just you are pointing out the existing beneﬁts for the free
reﬁlls that have already been there?

That is right.

Okay. Thank you.

{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Thank you for taking the question. When you look at international markets that have
also rolled out a version of My Starbucks Rewards, have they all been also star-based

these also changes we can expect to roll to international markets that have been on
the stars per transaction sort of base?

that is part of the reason why we have moved in this way.
{BIO 17433865 <GO>}
Great, thank you.
Matthew DiFrisco, Guggenheim Securities.
{BIO 3948570 <GO>}
Thank you. I just have a question, a follow-up. I wonder -- it sounds like you are going
to have more gold members when you switch over because you are going to be
grandfathering in and then you are going to be promoting up some guys that are on
the fringe about to earn that. I assume that is correct. If so, is there any risk of
earnings implication as that gold customer -- there might be more people getting
the reﬁlls, etc. and some of those beneﬁts that might not be as high-margin as that
person just paying for an extra drink?
Then my follow-up question was with respect to I guess -- I think it was David that
asked the question about the simple elegance of the ﬁrst one, I personally -- I think a
lot of people don't really think about the reward of spending $60 but more so just 12
simple visits. So I wonder -- obviously you mentioned it was the number one request
to change.
Have you really vetted -- can you give us conﬁdence that you that you vetted this out,
that there aren't a quiet majority that like the simple elegance of going for the 12
times and getting that reward, that you really do feel like you have a ﬁrm handle on
how many people -- because you've done a great job -- it is a big loyalty program
already and some of that I think is attributed to how easy it is to understand.
How much have you vetted that there isn't this quiet majority that really like it?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Thanks, Matt. I will take both questions. On your ﬁrst question, there is a small
ﬁnancial impact from the gold conversion in April but that is all in our guidance and
it is not a big number.
On the second point, I think I would say a few things. First of all, because it is the
number one requested item, it gives us a level of conﬁdence just around how much
activity and questions we have had around that and the fact that this is the right
change.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-22

extensive of research and focus groups and surveys around diﬀerent changes to the
program before we launched this and so we are pretty conﬁdent that this is the right
thing to do.
The third thing I will say and perhaps this is the most important, is there is a very
small minority that is negatively impacted by this. Matt mentioned that. The vast
majority of our customers will be equal to or better and we think that is going to
help us as we work through these changes.
R.J. Hottovy, Morningstar.
{BIO 7448110 <GO>}
Thanks. Just had a question with respect to the stars partners and I appreciate you
not wanting to give out any information about potential new partnerships that
maybe in the works. But really just wanted to kind of ﬁgure out at this change who
you might be going after in terms of partnerships in that regard? Just any kind of
color to that regard if this program does change who you might be able to target
really? Thanks.
{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
It is actually quite exciting and I think that is one of the reasons why we have talked
about this on guidance in the last few calls. The hold up has been the fact that we
have not had the ﬂexibility of a smaller unit value on stars. With this conversion you
earn and burn at higher rates so that basically means the value of the star become
lower and therefore the star becomes more useful in the context of more and more
kinds of economic activity. So you can imagine that there are lots and lots of places
where the value of the star priced as it is now all of a sudden become something that
you can actually use whereas before you couldn't. That will open up a lot more
categories.
I'm being a little bit coy about which ones at this point in time because I don't want
to make an announcement before we make an announcement. But I can promise
you that there is a lot in the works right now that will be very exciting in the months
to come.

retail partners? How did you think through keeping it as whatever drink or food you
want versus making it more like a dollar redemption? Thanks.
{BIO 18012513 <GO>}
We certainly considered that. We looked at a lot of diﬀerent possibilities and through
extensive conversations with customers, we realized that one of the things that
people really love about our program is the ﬂexibility to use the reward on anything
they want from our food and beverage menu. And we decided with all the changes
that we are making we didn't want to layer on yet one more change and that that
powerful anything on the menu reward will be something that will be very motivating
and we wanted to keep it that way. And it is also something that we see as being a
way for customers to sort of discover and experiment with diﬀerent kinds of items on
the menu. So it is valuable for us for people to use it as a tool to basically have the
choice of anything that they would like to have on our menu.
