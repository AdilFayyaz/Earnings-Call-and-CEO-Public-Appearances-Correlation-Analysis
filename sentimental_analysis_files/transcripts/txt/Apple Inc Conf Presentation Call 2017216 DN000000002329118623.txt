Good afternoon. My name is Simona Jankowski, Hardware and Comtech Analyst at
Goldman. And it's my distinct pleasure to welcome here, Luca Maestri, the CFO of
Apple. Thanks for joining us today.

So Luca, where I wanted to start today is, this year is the most momentous in Apple's
history in that, it marks the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone. Yet it comes after your
ﬁrst ever decline for that business.
So just wanted to get your thoughts as you look out to the next 10 years, do you still
view the iPhone as a growth business?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Q - Simona Jankowski

Well, that's obviously a great question. I want to point out ﬁrst of all, that actually
during the December quarter, we went back to growth with iPhone. It was actually
very good for us to see. We deﬁnitely continue to believe that there is a lot of room
for growth with our iPhone business.
It starts with the fact that when we look at the smartphone as a product, as a
consumer product we really believe it's become more relevant to people's lives than
it was 10 years ago, ﬁve years ago or even two years ago when you look at how much
people rely on their iPhones in every aspect of life, for iPhone payments, in the car, in
the home, and so I think that's a great foundation. The fact that the product is
extremely relevant to people's life is very important.
We also believe that there is a lot of innovation left in the iPhone, when we look at
the key foundational technologies that go into the product, when you look at
processors, you look at sensors, displays, batteries, and cameras, right. We made a
lot of progress during the last few years on those dimensions, and we think that
there is a lot -- a lot of that is left. So we think innovation kind of continues to help us
grow the business.
When we look at the markets around the world, there is a lot of growth that is
available to us in emerging markets, starting from China to India, many places
around the world where the demographics are such that we can expect a rise in the
middle class, we can expect that LTE adoption and smartphone penetration will
increase over time, and our market share to start with is extremely low. In a lot of
these emerging markets our market share is low single-digit. So we can only grow in
a lot of these markets. When we look at our customer metrics, they continue to be
extremely strong. We look at loyalty rates, we look at customer satisfaction. We look
at engagement on our platform, which is extremely high, and that is very good in
itself for the future of the iPhone business and for the fact that we also have a
services business that is very much related to the installed base of iPhones, which
continues to grow very well. And so the sum of all these things, I think we really
believe, bode well for the future.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
And I think, if I were to unpack that answer -- and that was very helpful, if I were to
unpack it a little bit, clearly you are looking for share gains into emerging markets
where your penetration is quite low. When you talked about innovation, should we
interpret that as suggesting that at some point the replacement cycle could
accelerate again for the iPhone.
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Well, I think we play a huge role in that. Clearly, if we can come up with products that
are very innovative, that inspire people, we obviously know that we can drive
upgrade cycles. We've seen it with iPhone 6; the level of upgrade rates that we had
with that cycle was very high. And it was driven by the fact that there was a lot of
pent-up demand for large screen iPhones, and if we're able to put that level ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Q - Simona Jankowskiinnovation into future generations of iPhone, deﬁnitely we have a very important --
we have a responsibility in that respect.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
The iPhone has been a real success story in China. Yet last year we had a few
quarters when your business in China was down on the order of 20% to 30% and
obviously that improved quite a bit in the December quarter. Can you talk a little bit
about why you think your sales in China were challenged last year? Was it as simple
as comps or was there anything else going on?
And since some of your services are still banned in China, like books and movies,
what can Apple do to rejuvenate its iPhone franchise in that region?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Well, I think it's important -- in this speciﬁc case, I think it's really important to step
back for a second and look at the success that we've had in China over the years. In
ﬁscal '16 we had a $48 billion business in China. It was $3 billion just in ﬁscal '10. So
we've gone from $3 billion to $48 billion in a very, very short period of time.
And if you take out, for a second, this very strong cycle that we had in ﬁscal '16, just
moving from ﬁscal '14 to ﬁscal '16 in the space of two years, our growth in China was
50%. So we've had an incredible level of success in China and we think the success
has been driven by a number of factors; some macro factors, the fact that clearly
there's been a lot of economic development in the country, to the fact that LTE
penetration has improved a lot. But also I think very, very importantly we've been
able to create in China, the same type of ecosystem that we have here in the United
States. So the type of customer experience a Chinese consumer can have around an
iPhone is similar, very similar to what we've got here. We now have Apple Music,
Apple Pay, of course the App Store in China and -- that helps us tremendously.
The services business in China is doing extremely well. We doubled the size of the
services business in ﬁscal 16 and we grew it very, very strongly also during the
December quarter. So we see that part of the business continuing to do very well.
There are a couple of macro issues in China, starting from the fact that the currency
has weakened about 6% against the US dollar and obviously the Hong Kong market
is aﬀected by the fact that the currency in Hong Kong is pegged to the US dollar, and
so as a trading destination Hong Kong has become less attractive than it used to be
in the past, right.
So when you normalize for those things, and when you really take a longer-term view
of the market and you think about the opportunities still for the middle class to rise
in China, and we are very excited. We continue to make a lot of investments. We
continue to open retail stores in China. We opened a lot of new points of sale. And
as I said, we've --we continue to expand our services business.

Page 4 of 13A - Luca Maestri
Q - Simona Jankowski
A - Luca MaestriOne thing I did want to clarify about China is Tim's comment on the last earnings
call, that your decline in China, in the current March quarter would be comparable to
what you saw in the December quarter, which was 12%. And I think he was
suggesting that the comps don't get that much easier until the June quarter. But
when I look back, last year in March I think China was down about 26%. So it would
seem to me that comps are already quite easy in the current quarter.
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
I think Tim's point was around the fact that the declines a year ago in the third and
the fourth quarters were larger than what we're seeing in the March quarter. There is
a couple of things that make the compares a bit more diﬃcult than they would look
on the surface.
The ﬁrst one is, as I said earlier, is the currency. So the currency on a year-over-year
basis is 6% weaker. So that -- that has just an impact on the actual reported results,
that the fact that the currency is weaker also means that the Hong Kong business
continues to be at the depressed level, even more than a year ago. And then there is
a technical issue around Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year this year was sooner
than it was a year-ago, and typically what happens with sales trends, they tend to be
up until Chinese New Year, and then they come down. And so we got a couple of
weeks of very diﬃcult compares in China this year.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
That makes sense. Thank you. I want to shift gears now to your services business,
which has been incredibly successful, it's been accelerating for two quarters in a row
now. I think last quarter, on an organic basis it was something like 30% and you guys
gave a new target for the ﬁrst time of doubling that business, looking out four years.
And I'll come back to that speciﬁc point.
But what I wanted to start on this topic is, we're also seeing some interesting shift in
the market. We've seen a big move away from downloads, where you guys were
innovative with iTunes, just streaming video and then we've seen incredible success
for services like Netﬂix and Amazon Prime. So what do you say to investors who
basically look at Apple and say yes, they're very successful with apps, but are they
really as well positioned in video and music as they could be?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Well, obviously, I think overall the services business is doing very well, and we've
been growing it for several quarters now at 20%. And the reason why we've given
out this goal, it's our internal goal, and I think it's important for us to send the
message to the investor community that this is a business that today on a standalone
basis, this year is going to be the size of a Fortune 100 company.
Obviously, if we're able to double it in four years, it's going to be even bigger. And
we don't know exactly how we're going to get there, although we see a lot of trends
that are very positive for us. And so we will continue to push on all these -- on allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

Page 5 of 13Q - Simona Jankowski
A - Luca Maestrithese fronts. And so, as you said, the App Store is doing incredibly well. The level of -
- the quality and the quantity of content continues to improve all the time.
You were asking about music and videos. Starting with music, I think it's important to
keep in mind, we are by far the largest player in digital music, when you combine
our download model with our streaming service, which comes from the Beats
acquisition and is gaining a lot of traction, the combination of these two business,
we're clearly the number one in music.
We've got a long association with music. It's one of the most important use cases for
customers on our devices. And so we really want to provide the best possible
oﬀering on the music side. And we think we are actually doing that, because when
we look at customer satisfaction surveys, we come up on top. And we continue to
improve the service from a user interface standpoint and also in terms of content.
One thing that we've learned, having been associated with music for a long period
of time, is that exclusives and exclusive content make a diﬀerence. They make a
diﬀerence in terms of the number of transactions that happen on our stores, in terms
of the conversion rate, in terms of the free trials that happen on the streaming
service. So we do understand the value of exclusive content.
And therefore, when we think about video, which again, already today for us, is a
large business because we are a very large distributor of video content already
today. Obviously, it's something that we're looking into and we've made a couple of
announcements recently about some of the shows that we are starting to experiment
with, that initially are going to be available on Apple Music and we will see -- we will
take it from there and we're going to learn a lot out of these initial examples.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
I think, Tim said in one of the recent earnings calls that Apple has an interest in the
creation and ownership of content. And I think we've seen, as you mentioned some
of the shows that you guys have been working on like the trailer for The Planet of the
Apes, out today looks really interesting.
But what would it take for Apple to move past kind of dipping your toe in the water
with a couple of shows, and making a more signiﬁcant commitment to content,
especially given the obvious beneﬁts to the ecosystem, the fact that that you've got
signiﬁcant cash, that hopefully you will get access to, if we have something like
repatriation. So what would be evidence of success or benchmarks that you would
be looking at?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Well, I mean, as I said, we know that original content is important. We've seen it on
the music front. So I think for us it's a matter of experimenting a bit, see how we do
with these initial shows and we'll take it from there. There's really -- I don't have
anything to announce today but --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

A - Luca Maestri{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Obviously it's something that we look at.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Okay. And just to turn that topic, for a second -- so there's been a lot of interest this
year in the policy changes that are underway with the new administration. One of the
big ones that looks reasonably likely to pass is repatriation, and Apple is certainly on
the top of the list in terms of overseas cash, which is over 200 billion. Can you share
with us anything that to the extent you can on the priorities for you, for that cash.
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Yeah. We have been pretty vocal for years now that the US tax code needs to be
reformed. The situation that we've got right now is not good, corporate tax of 35%,
it's the highest tax in the world. It's punitive for US companies. It creates international
tensions, across jurisdictions, because of this deferral system that is in place in the
United States. And so we've been saying for a number of years that we really need
reform, corporate tax reform and we think that there is broad agreement, not around
the speciﬁcs, but around the concept that tax reform should happen. And hopefully
there is a good chance that something is going to happen this year. And obviously
one important element as you said is the repatriation of accumulated earnings, and
of course we have a lot of that overseas, because now two-thirds of the company is --
the revenue is overseas.
We, obviously we would be looking to bring the cash back, and that would give us
additional ﬂexibility around our capital return activities. We got this, I would say
unprecedented capital return program. We've already returned $200 billion since
we started it 4.5 years ago. And until reform happens, we will continue to do that, we
will provide an update in the spring on the program. But if and when reform
happens it gives us more ﬂexibility, and we could do more, more quickly.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
That makes a lot of sense on the capital return side. I wanted to touch on the
optionality around M&A as well. One of Tim's comments recently was that Apple is
open to acquisitions of any size, that are strategic value and I think a few of us
interpreted that as being a little bit of a diﬀerent nuance than kind of the historical
focus Apple has had, which has been more on smaller technology buys or tuck-ins.
So is that a fair interpretation?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Now I would say, Simona that our approach has not changed. We have, and what
Tim said during the call, is something that has been true for us forever. We've always
looked at any size of acquisitions, and to be honest, the size of the check is not whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 13Q - Simona Jankowski
A - Luca Maestrimatters to us. We are in a very fortunate position, we can -- we can aﬀord them. The
issue, as Tim said, is the strategic ﬁt, and the issue is, do we believe that we can
create value for our investors as we make acquisitions.
In the past, it's been the case that the vast majority of our acquisitions have been
small companies. We buy between 15 and 20 companies every year. And we've done
it pretty regularly, and typically it's around these great technologies, great
intellectual property that we're very excited about, that either allow us to ﬁll a gap in
our product portfolio or allow us to accelerate our product roadmaps.
Siri was an acquisition, the Patch AD [ph] was an acquisition. It's beautiful to bring
this great idea into Apple and then being able to scale it very quickly. But for
example, Beats, which was a larger acquisition, certainly for us because we ended up
paying $3 billion ﬁt this two criteria very well, a great strategic ﬁt, because we know
that we had a hole in our portfolio around streaming music, and Beats had a great
service that really ﬁt what we wanted to do.
And on the headphone side, we could see that we could generate a lot of value
because the components they use for those products are very similar to the
components that we purchase. And because Beats was very strong in the United
States and we were able to take those products outside the United States because of
our distribution capabilities.
If we are able to ﬁnd companies that ﬁt the strategic element and the value element,
it's not the size that creates an issue for us.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
That's clear. Thank you. One of the other policy changes under consideration is the
move to destination-based tax regime, under which US revenues would be taxed.
However the imported cost of goods would not be deductible. And given that most
of your products are manufactured overseas, technically that would be counted as
an import. So just curious to the extent you've looked into it so far how would this
kind of a change aﬀect your cash ﬂow and P&L?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Well, we obviously are looking at anything that is happening in the tax arena, very
closely because it's obviously a very important matter for the company. It's very
diﬃcult to speculate before any legislation is enacted. If we step back for a second,
and we look at the proposals that are out there right now around tax reform I would
maybe categorize them into three major buckets.
There's the issue around repatriation of the foreign cash. And I think in that respect
there is a lot of consensus that, that cash should be brought back at a signiﬁcantly
lower rate than today. So I think there I think -- I don't think there's any disagreement.
And when we look prospectively into the future there's two elements, there's the
foreign earnings and the domestic earnings. On the foreign earnings, also in thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Q - Simona Jankowski
A - Luca Maestri
Q - Simona Jankowskirespect when we look at the proposals that are out there, there is a general
agreement that, that rate should come down versus the 35% that is the current rate.
We think it's important that a rate be applied to foreign earnings because I think we
believe that US companies will tend to rely on international markets more and more
over time just because of the global nature of business.
And then, the third element where there is still not a very clear commonality of intent
is how domestic earnings should be taxed and then this issue around border tax.
Without getting into the speciﬁcs of it, because again we do not -- we haven't seen
written legislation around it, it is very hard for us to imagine that a border tax would
be good for the US economy, because it is a tax that would end up burdening the
end consumer, and because it presupposes, as an idea, the fact that the dollar would
have to appreciate very signiﬁcantly versus where it is today, which is already too
strong.
And so when you think about the competitiveness of the US economy, when you
think of jobs creation in this country, when you think about investments in this
country, it doesn't feel that there would be a positive outcome.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Yeah. And recognizing that it's not necessarily a positive, and it may not even be
where we end up, I think the economy is just a sign [ph] about a 20% probability of
the border tax adjustment system coming into play. But could you help us think
about the feasibility of Apple's manufacturing and supply chain moving to the US, if
such a change were to happen?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Well, I think again, it's very, very diﬃcult to speculate at this point. One of the point
that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large
contributor to US economy during the last decade. We made billions of investments
in the United States.
We've created -- in the last 10 years we created about 2 million jobs in this country, in
the developer community, in our retail stores, in our call centers and through the
supplier chain. And so I think it's important to keep that in mind. And those are
investments that we will continue to make into the future. I think you know very well
because of your job that essentially the supply chain for the tech industry is not in
the US today, right.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Yeah. Maybe shifting gears to gross margins, which is another topic that is much
discussed in the investor community. Commodity prices have been stubbornly high
in the last year, whether you look at memory or LCD panels. And you guys, keep
adding a lot of new features and innovations and we're looking forward to hopefully
more with the next iPhone.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 13A - Luca Maestri
Q - Simona Jankowski
A - Luca MaestriAnd as you mentioned earlier, FX is not cooperating. So when you consider all of
these items, which seem to be adding pressure, how should we think about gross
margins for you on a go-forward basis, and the diﬀerent oﬀsets that you have at your
disposal?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Yes. Of course we fully understand that gross margin is a very important metric for
investors, and I think if you look back at the last ﬁve years, our gross margins have
been in this 38% to 40% range, in this range, in spite of the foreign exchange
moving up and down.
We have a good track record at managing all the diﬀerent levers in the business,
recognizing the fact that because of what you said, because essentially the success
of the company is around innovation. Every time we launch a new product, every
single time we launch a new product, the cost structure of the new product is higher
than the cost structure of the product that it replaces. It is because we are adding
new technologies, new features and therefore we have that pressure.
We have been able to oﬀset that pressure in a number of ways, starting with our
ability to take those structures down, during the course of certain life cycle of the
product, and we've done a very good job at that, with use [ph] pricing to try and
oﬀset some of the margin pressures, the cost pressures. And of course the fact that
the services business is growing well, it helps us mitigate some of the pressures.
I said in the past that our services business, in its totality, has a margin proﬁle that is
accretive to company margins. So if we are able to continue to grow that business
well, that will provide us with some oﬀset. At the end of the day though as much as
we understand the importance of gross margin percentages, the way we try to price
our products, and to bring the products to market is to ensure that we maximize
gross margin dollars, because I think it would be very easy to have very high gross
margin percentages, but then we wouldn't be selling very much, right.
And so at the end of the day also I think for investors it is important to think that we
really try to optimize gross margin dollars.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
One of the levers that I think you guys have also had, maybe not at your disposal,
because it's not necessarily in your control, but it has happened, I am delighted [ph]
this mix shift, that we've observed with the iPhone 7 to the larger form factor, which I
think has been helpful to gross margins.
Do you see that trend continuing on a go-forward basis in terms of the mix shift to
the higher -- to the larger phone?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 10 of 13Q - Simona Jankowski
A - Luca MaestriWe were expecting that, that mix shift would happen. We've been surprised during
the December quarter by the extent of it. Clearly demand for iPhone 7 Plus was
stronger than we were anticipating and we attributed to a couple of factors. I think
the main one is the fact that this was the ﬁrst cycle when we introduced into 7 Plus
version, a unique feature that is not available on the 7, which is the dual camera
system.
And clearly even though we priced for it -- clearly there was a lot of customer interest
and therefore the mix has moved more towards the 7 Plus. In general it is quite
possible that customers are getting more and more used to larger screens and that
is a trend that might continue in the future. It's very true certainly in certain
geographic areas like Asia without a doubt.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Wanted to ask you also about R&D, and so we've seen our R&D intensity more than
double in the last four years. But at the same time top line growth has actually
slowed down in that period of time. So maybe just help us understand how you think
about R&D and is the reason, it's expanding so much because you need that much
more R&D, just to support what is now an ever-increasing base of devices and
customers, or is it because you're working on some amazing new features that
hopefully we'll see in the not too distant future.
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
So all of the above. And I think it's important to think about R&D spend, both in
absolute terms and in relative terms, right. If you just talk about, ﬁrst about the
absolute level of R&D spend that we have, it's clearly higher than it was in the past. I
would say there's four primary reasons for that. The ﬁrst one is the fact that our
product portfolio today is much larger than it used to be.
We now develop three iPhones. We used to develop one. We develop multiple
iPads, we used to develop one. We now have the Watch, we have got AirPods, we
have Beats. So the product portfolio is larger, and obviously we need more R&D to
develop those programs.
The second element is that the services business has grown a lot, and to grow the
business, we need to make engineering investments in services like iCloud, like Siri,
like Maps. And so clearly the spend, R&D spend that we have on service is
signiﬁcantly higher than we used to have.
The third reason I think is a very strategic one and a very important one that allows
us to keep our diﬀerentiation from the rest of the industry, and it's the fact that today
we do much more in-house development of some fundamental technologies than
we used to do a few years ago when we were leaving more of that to the supplier
base. Think of the work that we do around processors or sensors, right, much more
work that we're doing today in-house than we used to.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 11 of 13Q - Simona Jankowski
A - Luca MaestriIt's very important for us, because we can push the envelope on innovation, we have
better control over timing, over cost, over quality, and so we look at that as a great
strategic investment for us, right.
And then ﬁnally, the point that you were making, around the fact that, yes, we are
also working on things that do not generate revenue today. And those expenses are
meaningful. In the total scheme of things they're not very large, but obviously they
add up over time and hopefully those are good bets that we're making for the future
of the company. In relative terms, you can look at us compared to the rest of the tech
industry, and I think it's almost diﬃcult to compare, because our R&D eﬃciency is
much better than the rest of the tech industry, that is [ph] diﬃcult to compare with
other tech companies.
When we look at Apple today versus the past, then you look at that percentage
growing, I think that's where some of the concern -- of the investor concern comes
from. But I would tell you that it's actually pretty intuitive that, that percentage goes
up. If you take the extreme where we are only developing the iPhone, and I look at
the engineering eﬃciency of our iPhone programs, right, that eﬃciency has not
changed over the year. And it's obviously the percentage is very low because the
smartphone market is so large.
We are now developing a lot of products that participating markets are much smaller
than the smartphone market, and therefore it is pretty intuitive that when we develop
the watch, for example, which is very successful in itself, but obviously because the
wearer watch [ph] market and the -- the smart watch market is much smaller, it is
obvious that on a percentage basis it's more expensive to develop the watch than to
develop the iPhone and so on.
But the alternative is not a good one, right. We cannot just work on the iPhone right,
and as we add other products it is normal and natural that, that engineering
percentage of revenue goes up a bit.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Got it. So just as we think about modeling the business, OpEx as a percent of sales
was about 11% or little over 11% last year. Historically it was closer to 10% but we
shouldn't necessarily think of that 10% being an anchor or something that you're
trying to get back to?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
No. We set pretty clear targets around OpEx in absolute terms. So every line item of
our OpEx is we have our own planning process, and we set targets for that. But in
absolute terms, because then the relative success of our products in the marketplace
will dictate if the percentage is 10%, 11%, 9%, 12% whatever -- whatever that is.
I think what you've seen during the last several quarters is that, clearly we try to put
all the investments that we need to make into R&D, and the R&D number has been
going up quite a bit. But on the SG&A side of the business we try to squeeze asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

'16 our SG&A was essentially ﬂat if not slightly down, right. So and I think you'll
continue to see those dynamics -- investments for the reason that I talked about in
R&D and try to manage SG&A pretty tightly.

You mentioned the Apple Watch and I did want to ask you a question on that. It had
a great holiday season.
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Is that product now closer to fulﬁlling its potential or do you feel like you're still
scratching the surface?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Yeah, we think it's still very early stages, right. I mean, we feel very good. It was the
best quarter we've ever had. Units, revenue, across the board, was very interesting to
see the mix. We could have sold more, to be honest, and we were supply
constrained. We now, we have a Series 1 and a Series 2 in the marketplace, and
customers seem to be very, very attracted by the Series 2 which has all the new
features and technologies and so that's great to see. We continue to expand points
of sale. But I think, we think it's a great platform to innovate on, for example in
spaces like health and research and ﬁtness. And so it's early stages, but we feel very,
very good about the momentum. And in general when we look at Apple Watch, we
look at the AirPods that we just launched recently, and we look at Beats and we put
them all together as the wearables category of the products that we sell, we feel that
in all cases, a lot of momentum and it's a business that on a standalone basis, is
already becoming a very signiﬁcant business.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
And last question from me, you're moving to your new headquarters this year.
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
What are your hopes and expectations for that space?
{BIO 15738533 <GO>}
Well I mean, the new campus, I really think is going to become like a national
landmark. I think there's going to be a lot of -- a lot of interest from tourists to come
and visit. We will need to ﬁgure out exactly how to manage that. But this is reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-14

teams. And his view was having an oﬃce space that really fostered collaboration and
the way the work spaces are designed and the layout very much encourages the
type of -- the type of collaboration and we think it's going to be a great place for our
people to innovate for many, many years to come.
It's also very environmentally friendly, natural ventilation, all natural light, very smart
building controls and very energy eﬃcient, because it's going to be -- the electricity
will be generated on site through solar and fuel cell. So I think it's going to be -- we
would be very, very happy to host you.

Thank you.

Very soon, and unfortunately we are delayed a few weeks because of the rain here in
California, just it's so unusual that -- now they will be doing the landscaping. So it's
going to take a few more weeks, but we're almost there.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Well, good luck with the move and thank you so much for joining us today.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
