Okay. I'll get going here.
Sorry. I was not expecting just some silence there. Good morning, everybody. It's a
real delight to have Microsoft present to us.
We once again appreciate everybody taking the time out of their days to -- the next
several days to dial into this conference. We have to make it a virtual conference
given everything that's going on in the world.
But we're really proud to present an absolutely amazing lineup here.
Our next guest here, who we'll interact with, is Rohan Kumar, who is Corporate Vice
President of the Azure business.
So with that introduction, quick introduction out of the way, Rohan, a real delight to
be able to host you on this conference call, or meeting, shall we say, virtual meeting.
And thank you, Jonathan Neilson, for everything that you do. Jonathan is here on the
line here with us as well.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Rohan, maybe if you could just give us an introduction. What is your role at
Microsoft? What are the things that you've worked on in your past several years
serving Microsoft?
That would be a good context to jump into some Q&A.

A - Rohan KumarSounds good. First of all, thank you so much, Kash and team, for having me at your
conference. I really appreciate it.
Just by way of a quick introduction, I'm the Corporate Vice President leading
engineering for what's called the Azure data and analytics team inside of Microsoft.
So that's the team that's responsible for everything that we do around data and
analytics, both on-prem and in the public cloud, so starting with the SQL Server
product, which is an on-prem database and then all the managed services that we
have in Azure, our operational databases, SQL, of course, open source, everything
we do around NoSQL analytics and governance of data.
So that's basically the team that I lead. Being at Microsoft for 21 years, grew up as an
engineer and working on the Windows team and then moved to SQL. And I've been
there ever since.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
I have to share with you a very ironic thing. I was the worst -- I majored in
engineering back in India. And I was the worst programmer on the campus. I could
program and the jobs do not run on the mainframe.
So I decided to be a software analyst instead.
But I've been having a blast. Ironically, had I been a good programmer, I would have
been a programmer and I would not have had a chance to cover the industry at a
20,000 feet altitude related to.
So you're doing this for 25 years, I cannot believe that I failed programming, but I'm
covering the software industry while coming up on 25, 26 years.
So with that funny -- a slightly embarrassing self-disclosure about my background
out of the way, let's talk about the topic that is on people's minds, the coronavirus
impact. It looks like Microsoft's Azure business is actually beneﬁting from this. Can
you talk about how customer buying behavior or priorities might have changed for
the better or worse with respect to coronavirus and your particular line of work on
the Azure Data side?
{BIO 19488761 <GO>}
So thanks for that question, Kash. It's obviously a very relevant and important one.
But ﬁrst and foremost, what I would say is our focus, frankly, has been helping our
customers, the communities, our employees and partners, just dealing with such a
challenging time, Deﬁnitely ﬁrst responders, health care workers has been a priority
for Azure and, in fact, all of Microsoft. We deﬁnitely, to your point, seen some growth
in Azure consumption, particularly when you look at workloads that enable remote
work. I mean I think we've publicly spoken about the growth in the usage ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14Microsoft Teams, which, of course, internally relies on a lot of the Azure -- core Azure
services.
So that's deﬁnitely an area where we've seen growth. The other workloads, of
course, the virtual desktop, Windows Virtual Desktop and the usage of Active
Directory.
Now speciﬁcally, it's interesting, as you called out, when I look at the data and the
analytics business, it's been fascinating. And Satya sort of has mentioned this, where
we've seen two years' worth of transformation in a couple of weeks. And we
deﬁnitely see that in several industries who are looking into digitally transform
themselves.
Over the last, I'd say, at least 3, 3.5 years, we've been in conversations with several of
our enterprise customers, both medium and really large ones, around their own
digital transformation, which could be related to them -- everyone's looking at
becoming a data-driven company where you have decisions that are made based on
systems that actually give you the insights that are needed. This could be around
better engaging with customers, building better products.
So even the class like saving in operational cost by having a very deep
understanding of the value chain. And at the heart of it, any such transformation
causes a modern data platform, especially heavily focused on a cloud-native design
that allows you to very economically scale, do predictive analytics, and so that's been
-- that's the journey a lot of our customers have been on.
Apart from newer renovation, there is -- what I will say is there's a lot of cost savings
element as well, right, which is now you're able to sort of really pay for the services
that you're using and you're not pre-provisioning a lot of resources like you had to
do on-prem.
So if anything, I've been hearing from several of our customers who have been on
this journey who are looking at what happened with COVID as a way in which they
can signiﬁcantly expedite their transformation.
So in that sense, what I feel is just given disruption that you're seeing happen around
digital transformation, we deﬁnitely see that as a trend that's going to have a positive
impact just all up on the data analytics business. And speciﬁcally, if you look at -- I'll
sort of speak about a few products like Synapses, our uniﬁed analytics story that we
launched at Ignite last year, and there's been a signiﬁcant interest in our customers
in leveraging Synapse because the simplicity it creates, everything from data
integration to data warehousing to big data analytics into a single uniﬁed product,
right? So there's a cost element there where our customers are looking at that and
saying, look. How do I move to a cloud-native service that signiﬁcantly reduces not
just the time but the cost?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14A - Kasthuri Rangan
A - Rohan KumarAnd so -- and then -- and on the operational side, of course, we're seeing signiﬁcant
growth in the migrations.
So imagine existing SQL server customers who are looking to move their workloads
to the public cloud to save on cost and build more intelligent applications by
extending their workloads. The same thing we see with Cosmos DB, where a lot of
the NoSQL workloads around Mongo, Cassandra, draft databases. Essentially, a lot
of our customers are looking at moving their -- expediting their move of their
operational databases to both SQL, Cosmos DB and our open source oﬀerings.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. And speciﬁcally, what about COVID, Rohan, is catalyzing this?
{BIO 19488761 <GO>}
I think there's two things. There is deﬁnitely a value piece, I would say, Kash, which is
every industry at this point is looking at the investments that they're going to make
to -- speciﬁcally, how do they -- there is the whole cost element, right, which is how
do they save. And so there is that -- those discussions that are happening, which is
the business requirements don't go away. If anything, if you look at driving the
business based on clear insights, it becomes even more important.
So the investments that they have to make to modernize their data platform,
analytics platform, if anything, the urgency is built out. The discussions we are having
because of COVID is they're saying, okay. So it's not just about the innovation piece.
How do we actually get a lot more value in terms of lower cost? Right?
And that's really where if you look at one of the key pieces of innovation, what our
customers are expecting is, as they modernize their data platform, there is a ton of
friction today, like if you look at -- I'll give you a speciﬁc example.
If you look at modernizing of the core enterprise data warehouse, you may have --
most of our customers have an on-prem system like a multi -- like a massively
powerful processing architecture, where you have a scale-out design, which
eﬀectively is, in many ways, has reached its limits in terms of how far it can scale.
Now to go from that system to something in the public cloud, the amount of services
that need to be stitched together to create a solution is very high.
So this was a problem we realized about three, 3.5 years ago, and we were working
on this service called Synapse, which greatly reduces the friction.
So it's both in terms of time to insight and the cost it takes, the amount of
engineering eﬀort you need to do to stitch together is drastically reduced, right,
which directly translates into not just savings on time, but savings in cost,
maintenance or software that you don't need to write, which the system is taking
care of you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 14A - Kasthuri Rangan
A - Rohan KumarSo COVID, I'd say, has deﬁnitely pushed -- our discussions with our customers are
really pushing to understand that aspect, which is, okay, great. This digital
transformation, we have to continue this journey obviously.
But what COVID has pushed forward is how do we do the same thing while reducing
cost.
So the aspiration doesn't go away, but the discussions have turned a lot more into
the value creation piece. Does that make sense?
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Absolutely. It certainly does. Just a quick reminder to clients that are dialing in or
have dialed in, if you wish to ask a question, please chat the question up on your
portal. I will pick it up here, and I'll pose it. And I will not mention you by name. It will
sound really smart because the question is going to come from me.
So I'll take the credit for your smart questions, but I will not identify you by name.
Another question for you, Rohan. Microsoft and certainly other software companies
have talked about how there has been increasing usage of the Azure platform within
a set of customers in certain verticals, whereas other verticals have seen usage come
down. What is the net eﬀect of this on the Azure business, the up versus the down?
{BIO 19488761 <GO>}
Again, it's a very good question. What I will say is, as it's expected, right, I mean,
every customer that we sort of speak to in every industry, almost just across the
board, everyone is sort of going through a very, very challenging time, right, just in
terms of the situation they ﬁnd themselves in. And it is fascinating, though, like if you
take a look at certain aspects that are clearly changing at a very fast pace. One of
them we talk about is this whole notion of remote everything. That has like
foundationally changed how people work. And for the foreseeable future, this is sort
of going to remain. And as Satya mentioned, the discussions that we've been having
with maybe CIOs, CEOs, CTOs, in terms of the investments that they plan to make,
like everyone's eﬀectively acknowledged that the pace at which they're transforming
has sort of become very, very signiﬁcant.
There's clearly a call to reduce the TCO while maintaining their innovation agenda.
They're looking at business continuity plans. I mean, that's a pretty big thing we look
at. They're getting at where people are like, hey, what happens if a speciﬁc region is
not accessible, how do we ensure that our business continues? So overall, we do
believe that we are very well positioned to capitalize on all these trends given the
oﬀerings that we have, both for the changes in terms of how we work, how we live
that we're seeing and also, like I mentioned previously just the whole push towards
getting -- having this data-driven culture where insights are truly driving your
business, which means you have to invest in the data platform infrastructure.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14A - Kasthuri Rangan
A - Rohan KumarNow in terms of the overall trends, what I will say is, especially for the Azure business,
security, productivity apps, where we basically -- our business applications, the
investments we are making for developers, we are seeing a ton of traction around
there. And speciﬁcally, if I look -- had to just take a look at structural changes, the
whole play we have with digital twins and IoT, that's sort of we see there's a lot of
traction happening around that because there is this whole notion of like how do we
replicate a lot of the IoT infrastructure very quickly to make progress.
So everything around smart building, automated factories, remote selling, curbside
pickup, just given the restrictions that are there, all these are leading to areas where,
in the past, we hadn't maybe seen a lot of growth but because of the changes that
we're seeing.
Now overall, what I would say is, while it's hard to sort of -- clearly, in certain verticals,
we are deﬁnitely seeing a lot of what we believe is a temporary contraction as they
deal with the challenges they're going through, but we absolutely remain very
bullish and have an encouraging view of what the future holds just given the
oﬀerings that we have.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Wonderful. It used to be that Microsoft SQL server was not that highly regarded. Like
15, 20 years back, people would always consider the Oracle Database or the Sabre
database is the truly enterprise-worthy database, and Microsoft SQL server is
departmental installation. And we do our IT buyer surveys. Perennially, over a period
of time, Microsoft had always come in second or third in terms of consideration. Now
in the last two years, Microsoft has shot up in #1 position with respect to what
customers are looking at, and Oracle slipped to #2 position. How did this happen?
And what does this mean for the future of the database market? This is not an
insigniﬁcant market. This is even bigger than the cloud computing market as at
stands.
But of course, cloud computing market, the compute and storage is going to
naturally overtake databases.
But databases are the highest value item in that IT sector. It's always baﬄed me why
you can spend $40,000 per processor when you spend $3,000, $5,000 per instance
for the operating system.
So this highest value part of the IT stack where my job is now coming out of the left
ﬁeld and rising in terms of customer priority. Talk to us about the signiﬁcance of this
going forward, Rohan.
{BIO 19488761 <GO>}
Thank you again. I think it's a great question.
So to the ﬁrst point that you raised around SQL Server 20, 25 years ago, it was more
of a departmental database. I mean that's a fact, right? I mean if you take a look atFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14how we sort of started oﬀ, clearly, you had Oracle and others who had been in the
market for a long time. And especially when it came to sort of I remember back in
2000 earlier, that's between 2000 and 2005, that was the time I sort of joined the
SQL Server team as well. That part was clear where a lot of the departmental apps,
like the Tier 2, Tier 3 kind of workloads, SQL Server was gaining prominence.
But to your point, there were questions around, hey, what about really running the
Tier 0, Tier 1 mission-critical enterprise workloads.
So what I will say, Kash, is over the last -- deﬁnitely over the last almost 20 years now,
there's two things that we are very, very clearly focused on, of course, being very
driven in terms of the technology trends that we've seen, the -- our relationships that
we're building up with enterprise customers to learn how best to serve them.
So there's two things. One was, clearly, we had to make substantial investments,
which we've done over the several releases culminating right now, most recently with
SQL Server 2019. If you look at the journey we started oﬀ of SQL Server 2005, which
was a very pivotal release in terms of making like fairly substantial changes
architecturally to enable very high scale, very high throughput, very low latency. And
ever since then, we've expanded the total types of data we're dealing with. If you
look at the focus we've had around high availability, disaster recovery, the focus on
in-memory processing, just looking at hardware trend, how do we leverage SSDs, a
lot better GPUs. More recently, if you look at process and memory, that's still
becoming a big thing.
So there's been a very laser and intentional focus on meeting the needs of the
highest class of demanding enterprise customers.
So that's been one part.
The other thing really has been around -- the focus around the developer
experience, the ease of use. Frankly, if I had to reﬂect back, the thing that really got
us to be successful in the enterprise was this whole combination we had with the dev
tools experience Microsoft was building inside .NET and Visual Basic and all that.
And just the ease of you, the ease of managing.
So that core aspect of making things easy, your database is not complex, was very,
very critical. In fact, that's one of the pieces of feedback we heard where the
adoption of SQL Server grew because you don't have to learn like 50,000 diﬀerent
knobs to go set up your database. There's a lot of intelligence that we embed to
make things very easy. If you wanted to build a highly performant application, you
don't have to be a rocket scientist to do that, right?
Of course, there's a certain amount of understanding of the system, relational model,
relational algebra to see this thing and all.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 14A - Kasthuri RanganBut that's a constant area of focus for us, how do we make it simple. And part of that,
like I reﬂect back on that, Kash, is the genesis of Azure, the -- you go back to our
mission, we talk about empowering every human and every organization to achieve
more, it's really the basis of that comes down to us being a tools company and how
do we sort of provide that to make things easy.
So it's been fascinating. I mean, we've seen several analysts, of course, like you
mentioned, in a lot of reports, we are coming across as the preferred vendor to run
mission-critical applications.
Over the last four, ﬁve years, and this is -- I actually -- this is my hypothesis on what
foundationally changed us and put us right at the top of the data platforms is not
only do we have this deep understanding of our enterprise customer market
because of our heritage with SQL Server and how we grew with that.
But if you look at the pivot since 2010 we've made into cloud computing, and having
oﬀerings to manage not just SQL Server, but open source databases, now we're
getting big into analytics, we have a fairly wide portfolio of services that we oﬀer.
And when I speak to a lot of the CIOs, and frankly, with the CTOs, they say, look, we
prefer SQL, we prefer Microsoft because we have a path towards -- we have -- we do
want to sort of bet on a company that is well positioned for the future.
So the investments that I make, let's say, on-prem today, even though I may move to
the cloud over the next maybe one or three years, how do you ensure that all the
investments we made around the app model, business model, et cetera, carry
forward. And there, with all humility, I say this, I do believe as a data platform, both
on the tech innovation we've done and the business model innovation to ensure that
our customers who've been betting on SQL Server gets signiﬁcant value as they
move to the cloud has been super beneﬁcial.
So focus on like performance and scale, ease of use for developers and then the
long-term bet, just given our portfolio in the cloud and our innovation agenda, has
really resonated very well with customers.
Sorry, that was a long-winded answer, but I just wanted to –
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
It was very passionate, and so I completely appreciate that. When you look at the
PaaS market, I think Mike Schutz[p]h has said for a number of years now that there
will be a pivot within the Azure cloud business to PaaS. And PaaS has certainly higher
value, higher retention, higher margin, less capital-intensive, albeit versus compute
and storage. Can you talk to us about what the future of the PaaS business looks like
for Microsoft? What are the biggest things Microsoft is investing to be successful in --
on the PaaS side? Because our sense is that your exposure to PaaS is a lot higher as a
percentage of your overall business relative to, say, an Amazon or a Google. Because
this is Microsoft's legacy. This is where you're really -- this is where you came out,
right?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14A - Rohan Kumar
A - Kasthuri Rangan
A - Rohan Kumar{BIO 19488761 <GO>}
Absolutely.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Can you talk to us a little bit more about what are your aspirations for PaaS?
{BIO 19488761 <GO>}
No. I mean -- and just again, what I will say is, I think, the -- our point of view really is
where we believe, Kash, the investments are going to happen in the future.
So there's multiple trends that are going on right now. There's clearly this element of
what we call lift and shift modernization where a lot of our customers have strategic
assets in terms of applications and workloads that they want to move to the cloud.
And of course, they want to move to the cloud with very little investment on their
side in terms of changes they need to make, right? So there's a whole -- and when
you look at trends like that, while the oﬀerings that we have in PaaS have signiﬁcantly
improved in terms of compatibility, we do see -- just to sort of reduce any change
that they need to make, it's easier to move from, let's say, you have an application
deployed in a virtual machine on-prem, and you just basically want to rent a virtual
machine into the cloud to host that. That's deﬁnitely, in terms of friction and all that,
it's the easiest way.
Our belief is, while, of course, there is -- we have a huge business around
infrastructure, and we support our customers with both Windows Server and SQL
Server, that's a very key play for us, that migration motion. If we look at the future of
how applications will be written, especially when you sort of start thinking around the
intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, where the applications will tend to be very
distributed, what PaaS a layer enables you is you focus a lot more on your business
logic, your scale requirements and not worry too much about how the underlying
resources are getting provisioned, right?
So when you look at like these new server-less or micro services designs that are
becoming extremely popular among the developer community, those inherently, at
their foundation, require a PaaS service, let's say, for your data layer, right? And now
the oﬀerings that you need, the purpose build, let's say, you need a relational
database, you need a NoSQL database, you want to sort of use open source like
Postgres, MySQL and MongoDB, that -- those are developer preferences.
So that compatibility is important, but the notion of creating a VM, provisioning desk,
provisioning the network, tying it all together, all that complexity and making sure
that you're behind -- securely locked behind the virtual network, all of those things,
eﬀectively, the PaaS layer makes greatly simpliﬁed.
So when you think about time to build an application, get ready, get the app running
and going, there is no question where -- and this is a very strong point of view we
have, is that the investments we have made in all the path up, like services that weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 14A - Kasthuri Rangan
A - Rohan Kumarhave on the data and the analytics side, the way we are sort of thinking about
functions is the app model where you basically just write your code and then the
compute just gets provisioned for you to sort of get going, the simplicity for the
developers that it creates is going to be pretty amazing.
So if I look at all app usage right now, I would say migrations is deﬁnitely a very, very
strong play.
But I do believe if you play out the next maybe three to seven years, over that time, I
do believe lots and lots of new applications, that's going to be written into the PaaS
model.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
I heard from one of your resellers that last ﬁscal '19, I believe, and I won't mention
numbers here -- expose anybody here, but there were a certain number of
databases installed by the incumbent market leader that were actually replaced by
Microsoft Azure SQL Server. Can you talk to us about what are you hearing from
customers and partners with respect to any appetite, or is it just completely made
up, to replace on-prem databases, albeit their superiority and what-not with a
Microsoft cloud-based database?
{BIO 19488761 <GO>}
So there is a lot of discussion around that. And it's -- and there's two, I'd say, maybe
broadly two things that are driving this discussion, Kash. The ﬁrst, of course, is there
is a general approach towards like a company imagining, hey, as we sort of digitally
transform, how does our -- all our compute data footprint look like, right? So there is
a very natural thing around, okay, I don't want to sort of manage data centers, I don't
want to manage physical machines, I don't want to manage power and everything
that comes with it.
So there is that strategic bet around, okay, let's go move our workloads to the public
cloud.
Now as a part of that, obviously every customer is looking at their spend, and they
may be using diﬀerent versions of on-prem databases on-prem, and then they're
looking at, okay, as we move to the cloud, both in terms of what is the modern
architecture, what's the cloud-native design that helps me as I move, as I transition?
Even if it may not be the ﬁrst step, you may move to an IaaS-based model, but then
for the strategic workload or a strategic application, how do I get to the design point
that essentially helps me scale, saves me cost, helps me build out intelligent
workloads where I'm able to leverage machine learning and AI in a way that takes
me forward? So we basically have both these discussions around -- independent of
which database you are sort of coming out from. There is a very healthy trend in
terms of migrations that we see from even competitive databases, on-prem, not just
to SQL server, but even to things like Postgres, to things like Cosmos DB, depending
on the nature of the workload that they're running. And this -- these move to
eventual PaaS services essentially gives them that assurance, right? Like, if you
believe that this speciﬁc application is going to be strategic for you ﬁve years fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 14A - Kasthuri Rangan
A - Rohan Kumarnow, making that investment that essentially modernizes it, so you can -- both from a
performance, scale, security, ease of use, predictive intelligence, integrating that,
and there's lots of high-value capabilities we've added to our PaaS services.
So we deﬁnitely see a lot of discussions around that. In fact, what I will say is
migrations, not just of SQL Server, but a lot of the on-prem databases and their
corresponding workloads to the cloud, is our #1 motion.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
That's amazing. We always like to simplify complicated things in the technology
industry into very easy to understand terms.
The way I explain what's going on in the database market is, I would say to clients,
look. Ferrari is a great car, but the use case for Uber is very diﬀerent. So -- and
people at the margin want Uber. They don't need more Ferrari.
So that's how I would characterize a shift to the database market from on-prem to --
it's not a question of this or that, but where the incremental demand is coming from
is more Uber.
In the couple of minutes that we have, I'm curious to get your perspective. Azure's
competitive advantage is a diﬀerentiation over AWS and GCP. If you want to just stick
to database, that's okay.
But if you have a broader perspective, how should we think about the edge that you
have over AWS and GCP?
{BIO 19488761 <GO>}
Got it. Yes. No. I think it's -- that's a very fair question. In fact, we get that asked all the
time. The thing I always sort of start oﬀ with is, while, of course, it's important to be
aware of what trends, what investments are going on, the thing that fundamentally
drives our innovation agenda is what we're hearing from our customers, our own
point of view that gets built up in terms of how best to serve them.
So that's -- it's interesting because it's not like -- when I take a look at my own day,
I'm a lot more worried about, hey, what issues our customers are running into with
where we have and how we're getting the signals from them because that's really
the richest thing that we have in terms of the investments we make.
Now some of the things that I normally share is what we've heard from our
customers, right? Like when they're successful in Azure, they basically share multiple
things.
The thing that in many ways sort of stands out is our focus just around enterprise
security governance. These are the things that we've learned, having worked with
customers for more than 25 years now, where -- while there is a lot of talk aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 12 of 14performance, scale and predictive intelligence and how AI is going to change the
world, which is all true and great, the reality is some of the biggest things customers
worry about when they look at any major transition like this is, hey, is my environment
going to be secure?
If I'm putting my data somewhere else, what are the guarantees you're providing
around encryption, isolation, just given everything else that they've heard around
leakage, et cetera, right?
So basically, that trust around Microsoft and the oﬀering. And it's interesting, you
look at like how we've led in a lot of our products is the core capabilities that we've
built around security, privacy, governance of data and sort of leading with that, and
that's what our customers tell us that, hey, you have a very unique and a strong point
of view there, which resonates very well with them, especially for ones that are from
regulated industries like ﬁnancial services, health care, government, manufacturing.
So these really resonates.
The other thing, like you said, is we sort of brieﬂy discussed is this whole -- our focus
around not just the current lift and shift in what you really need to do maybe in the
next one to three years, but how do we believe our world evolves.
Like we have very speciﬁc patterns that we talk to our customers and a very deep
engagement manner around, depending on their business need, depending on the
time frames they're looking at, they could go down the path of IaaS ﬁrst and then
pick the strategic workloads. Or if they have a more longer lead time, how do we
sort of short circuit that.
And that's the other thing that we heard from our customers -- which is Microsoft has
such a clear point of view based on our requirements. We don't force them on to go
here, go there. It's always a discussion based on -- and we talk about what we've
learned, right?
Because in many cases, migrating to a diﬀerent database may not be the best option
if you're looking at completing the move, let's say, within three months or six months
versus just coming, saving the cost and then really looking at how do we do that
transition because some of that, it could take a little longer.
And that part, which is having that clear point of view of where the future we believe
is, why do we believe that, and we also always talk about what Microsoft is doing.
So for us, when we oﬀer these services, Kash, it's not just -- one of the things I always
talk about in a customer presentation is, let me tell you how Microsoft has evolved
and what decisions we made and why did we make them?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02

requirements for us, is Azure should be the computer for the entire world and
Microsoft, of course.
So we talk about our own journey, what are the best we are making, and that
resonates very well.
So it's not we do something diﬀerent and we are selling a whole bunch of services or
products to our customers, but a lot of the learning, that Microsoft scale that we've
had, helps us create that very clear point of view.
And then ﬁnally, if you look at how publicly we've spoken about our investments in
IoT, the intelligent edge, which we believe is going to become so critical, so it's not
just about the cloud. It's not just about applications of the future. Almost everything
that's connected is going to be intelligent. It could be all your consumer devices. It
could be all your manufacturing plants, connected cars, whatever you have.
And we have invested for the last three years in an application model which gives
you consistency across all of these.
So you don't have to worry about am I deploying this to an ARM device, which has
low power? Or am I deploying this on a public cloud, which is like thousands of
cores.
The programming model is consistent, the security aspect is consistent. And as
people get to understand more of this, they'll realize that the consistency, like today,
for example, SQL Server, I'll give you an example, runs on everything from an ARM
device, which is maybe less than 1 GB to 1,000-plus nodes running a Synapse query,
right, across petabytes of data. And as a developer, you write the same T-SQL, and
the security models, all the built-in AI is exactly the same for you to score. And that's
super powerful, right, as these applications become very distributed.
So I actually think -- and part of this comes from our genesis, our understanding of
the developer community and the broader reach we're having with open source
right now.
So those are the things I'd call out is stuﬀ that our customers tell us is diﬀerentiated,
and that helps us sort of build out our agenda. Hopefully, that was useful.

Absolutely. Now that -- we're at the end of our allocated time, but it was very in-
depth, very insightful. Thank you very much, Rohan. Thank you, Jonathan, as always,
for your support, for everything you do for our conference.
So with that, I just have a quick announcement to make. I believe the next
presentation we have will be, one -- my colleague, Wamsi Mohan, will be doing a ﬁrstFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
