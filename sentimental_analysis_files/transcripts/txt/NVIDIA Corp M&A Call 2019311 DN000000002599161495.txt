{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thanks, Simona. And thanks everyone for joining on short notice. Today, we're
announcing our proposed acquisition of Mellanox for $6.9 billion. Mellanox is
headquartered in Israel and is world-renowned for its high performance datacenter
interconnect technology. We have worked together for many years and have
partnered to build many of the world's highest performance datacenter systems.
We are combining two of the world's leading datacenter and high performance
computing technology companies today. Between us, we power over 250 of the
world's top 500 supercomputers, and we name every major computer maker and
cloud service provider as our customers. Let me tell you why this makes sense for
NVIDIA and why I'm so excited about it?
As you know, NVIDIA is focused on high-performance computing. Because of
workloads such as artiﬁcial intelligence, scientiﬁc computing and data analytics,
performance demands on hyperscale and enterprise datacenters are skyrocketing.
From a computer architecture point of view, two dynamics are particularly important.
First, CPU performance advancement is slowing just as computing demand is
skyrocketing. As a result, accelerated computing and accelerated networking, or
otherwise known as CPU oﬄoading, is a fundamental path forward.
Second, as data and compute-intensive workloads like AI and data analytics are
growing exponentially, they require thousand -- tends of thousands of server nodes
working together. To support these new workloads, the computing nodes and the
connecting fabric will form a datacenter-scale compute engine. Optimal design will
translate directly to higher datacenter throughput and utilization and lower
operating cost.
To accelerate applications, NVIDIA optimizes across the entire application stack from
architecture to chips, to systems to algorithms. In the future, we want to optimize
datacenter-scale workloads, again, across the entire stack from the compute node to
networking to storage. For this reason, Mellanox's system-to-system datacenter-scale
interconnect technology is important to us. We believe our platform would be
stronger and deliver the best possible performance for datacenter customers by
innovating across the computing, networking and storage stacks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-11

Page 3 of 11Eyal Waldman
Colette KressBeyond these signiﬁcant product synergies, we're excited about the tremendous
cultural ﬁt with Mellanox. Like NVIDIA, they have performance-driven culture with a
focus on innovation. I look forward to working even more closely with their talented
employees and visionary leaders to invent the future of computing. Great to have
you on the call Eyal.
{BIO 3215622 <GO>}
Thank you, Jensen. I am delighted to the vision that Jensen has set out for
accelerated computing is one that we fully share at Mellanox. The future of
computing will beneﬁt from holistic innovation across the entire technology stack
from compute, to networking, to storage. Combining our two companies is a natural
extension of our existing partnership and a great feat, given our common
performance-driven cultures.
We have built Mellanox-based on technical excellence, innovation and staying
nimble even as we've grown, and NVIDIA is an excellent match for us. Combining
our companies will be good for our customers, who will beneﬁt from accelerated
innovation in high-performance computing, good for our partners, who will beneﬁt
from optimized solutions across the entire computing and networking stack, and
good for our employees, who will have new growth opportunities and challenges.
Let me now turn it over to Colette to give more to give more details on the proposed
transaction. Colette?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thanks, Eyal. Today we are announcing the acquisition of Mellanox for $125 per share
in cash, implying a total enterprise value of $6.9 billion. We expect the acquisition to
close by the end of calendar 2019, subject to regulatory approvals in various
jurisdictions, as well as approval by Mellanox's shareholders. The transaction has
been approved by both NVIDIA's and Mellanox's Board of Directors.
In addition to the strategic rationale Jensen outlined, we believe this is also a
ﬁnancially compelling transaction. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive
to non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP earnings per share, and free cash ﬂow, even
before assuming any cost or revenue synergies.
For those less familiar with the company, Mellanox generated approximately $1.1
billion in revenue in calendar 2018, up 26% from the prior year. Calendar 2018 GAAP
gross margin was 64.3%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 69.2%. GAAP operating
income was $112 million and non-GAAP operating income was $270 million.
Mellanox's customer base and channel partners have signiﬁcant overlap with our
own, and customers include large hyperscale and cloud service providers, as well as
many of the world's largest super-computing centers, direct customers, including
many of the same large IT infrastructure OEMs that we partner with for our go-to-
market. We believe that there will be opportunities to cross-sell and enhance ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-11

A - Jensen Huangbroader solution set over time given each company's technology assets and
customer bases in high-performance computing, enterprise, and hyperscale. But we
are conservatively assuming no initial revenue synergies.
We are also not modeling any cost synergies at this time. It is a very strategic deal
and we highly value Mellanox's employees. We will continue to invest to go after the
large (inaudible) we see for the combined company.
Lastly, let me touch on capital allocation. We view the proposed acquisition to be a
terriﬁc use of our cash, not because it's immediately accretive from a ﬁnancial
perspective, but most importantly, because it is a strong strategic ﬁt from a
technology and cultural perspective. Further, this announcement does not change
our capital return program for the year. Of the $3 billion we intend to return to
shareholders by the end of ﬁscal 2020, we've returned $700 million through share
repurchases during the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2019. We still plan to return the
remaining $2.3 billion to shareholders through the end of ﬁscal 2020 in the form of
dividends and buybacks.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for
questions? Thank you.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instruction) And your ﬁrst question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
Question -- I guess Jensen, ﬁrst question, can you talk a bit about the strategic
rationale here, particularly around which end markets you're looking to target? HPC
is obviously the biggest potential, but would also love to hear is public cloud the
main focus here, is it more of oﬀering a platform solution now like DGX into the
enterprise?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes. C.J., That's a great question. The datacenter market today consists of high
performance computing or supercomputing, which is the initial target of our
companies CUDA architecture. It also includes hyperscale for internal consumption
of Internet services, provisioning of Internet services, cloud service providers oﬀering
them as cloud infrastructure and then enterprise computing. These are really the
major segments if you will from the way we look at datacenters.
As you know that one of the most important drivers in the datacenter world today is
a new type of workload that's emerged and it's a data-centric type of workload. It
requires an enormous amount of data and a huge amount of computation to infer
insight, to extract insight out of data. We call it artiﬁcial intelligence and machineFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-11
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Q - C.J. Muse
A - Colette Kress
Q - C.J. Muselearning and data analytics. This type of workload is just simply too big to ﬁt on any
one computer. And there's a couple of ways that you could solve the problem, but
the dynamics are basically related to, on the ﬁrst hand, CPU scaling has slowed. And
so, without oﬄoading the algorithm somehow and accelerating it using new
accelerators like what we do with GPU computing and what Mellanox does with
accelerated networking, it's really not possible to continue to scale computing as
Moore's Law ends.
The second is, because the data size and the compute size is so large, it won't ﬁt in
any one computer, and so, thousands of computers have to be networked together
to work together. The dynamic that is happening here is that, in the future, it won't
just be server-scale computing that people do, but it will be datacenter-scale
computing, where the network becomes an extension of the computing fabric. You
see early trends of that already, software deﬁned networks, intelligent networks, but
long-term, even some part of the computation will go into the network. And so,
where the compute node starts and ends and where the networking starts and ends,
as part of the overall computing fabric will be very diﬃcult to discern and we'd like
to be able to -- we want to take a lead in architecting and developing solutions that
innovate across all of these stacks.
Now, of course, the solutions will have to be open because everybody's datacenter --
everybody's datacenters are diﬀerent and everybody's amount of supporting
traditional software stacks or new software stacks like containers and Kubernetes are
going to be a little bit diﬀerent and datacenters will be heterogeneous for a very
long time because of that. And so our ability with Mellanox to be able to support
supercomputing networks from InﬁniBand, all the way to hyperscale datacenter
networks with Ethernet, and to be able to put acceleration and intelligence into the
entire fabric is really, really powerful. And so I hope that answers your question. But
basically, we would like to accelerate growth into our datacenters by being able to
architect across both the compute as well as the network fabric.
That's very helpful. And if I could ask a quick follow-up, Colette, you talked about no
cost synergies at this time. Are there any cost savings from the combination of two
public companies, et cetera, that we should be thinking about?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for the follow-up question, C.J. As we discussed, this acquisition is
certainly about driving accelerated growth and improving our position in the
datacenter. Mellanox is well managed and it already has quite a lean organization.
We have many areas of operational leverage that we can accelerate for both of our
development plans as we move forward. And over the long term, we certainly see
opportunities for operating leverage of bringing these two companies together.
Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-11

Q - Aaron Rakers
A - Colette Kress
A - Jensen HuangAnd your next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Congratulations on the transaction. One housekeeping item and then one
architectural question. First of all, Colette, just any color on, is there a breakup fee,
the size of the breakup fee, any details on that? And then on the architectural
question, there is a lot of discussion around the role of InﬁniBand in the context of
HPC and I understand what you just said around bringing intelligence into the
networking. I'm interested, Jensen, how you see Mellanox's Ethernet switch business
particularly playing into the portfolio, given the traction that the company has started
to see over the last couple of quarters? Thank you.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, let me start ﬁrst. We're going to concentrate over the rest of the calendar year to
focus on closing this deal. We need regulatory approval in the US and China and a
couple of other jurisdictions, but this time, we think that's our right focus before
closing.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yeah. So, ﬁrst of all, the easiest way to think about that, is that, I think the world of
their Ethernet solutions, and the reason for that and the reason why we -- as you
know, we work with them in high-performance computing datacenters all of the
world, as -- CSPs all over the world. We have our product called T4, which is about
scale-out accelerated computing. And wherever we do scale-out accelerated
computing, scale-out meaning, small number of GPUs accelerators inside a large
number -- inside each node and many nodes are being connected together, build a
little bit diﬀerently than DGX for example. DGX is a scale-up architecture. And so T4
was designed to be a universal accelerator for hyperscale datacenters and it's
intended for scale-out. In those kind of environments, we see -- we work with
Mellanox a lot. And the reason for that is because of the software stack.
It turns out, that the best way to accelerate a datacenter is to oﬄoad the CPU, to
keep us little of the data movements from being copied around as possible. And so
the software stack, the RDMA software stack and the RoCE software stack that
Mellanox has created over the years, and the body of work that they've developed in
accelerating the networking stack, is just world-class. That's where you get the
greatest value of extending the compute node and the networking nodes --
networking fabric to become an extended computing fabric. You want to make sure
that as much of the software is optimized as possible. And they do this really
fantastically throughout.
Now, we're going to continue to work with switch companies all over the world and
the reason for that is, of course, datacenter is heterogeneous by nature, there are
parts of the datacenter where certain partners are going to be particularly great at.

A - Eyal Waldmanvaluable. And so we have to work together as an industry, and our goal is to make
sure that the computing fabric is as optimized as possible and Mellanox plays a
really important role in that. And so, I love all of their product lines, and particularly, I
love their software stack and their architecture, on which the software stack runs on is
just extraordinary.
{BIO 6649630 <GO>}
Very good. Thank you.
And your next question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.
{BIO 19683324 <GO>}
Hi, gents. This is Pradeep Ramani calling for Timothy Arcuri. I think you just touched
on the software stack aspect of it and that's exactly what we wanted more details on.
So from a software perspective. I guess, how much more work do you have to do in
terms of closely integrating RDMA and RoCE with NVIDIA products? And can you
talk about the capabilities that you have in-house in terms of the software
engineering capabilities to do that and just the roadmap in general?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes. As you know, we do a lot of software inside the Company even for networking
and the reason why we do it is because we do it for NVLink, which is a processor-to-
processor in system interconnect. And Mellanox develops system-to-system
interconnect. NVLink and Mellanox are complementary and the reason why we work
so closely together is because of the complementary nature of these two
interconnects. And so, we have a great deal of expertise in both companies in how
to manage networking and how to optimize the networking stack for the highest
throughput and the ability to connect the largest number of computers. And so,
both companies has a great deal of expertise in this area.
The important thing is, at the highest level, these are two -- we are two of the world's
leading high-performance computing technology companies. Between the two of
us, we power over 250 of the world's top 500 computers. And so, there's a great
deal of expertise in both companies. I would love to have Eyal answer some of that
question too just so that we can have him do some talking, Eyal is a visionary leader
and he has, as you guys know, built Mellanox from the ground up and I'll love it, if he
would take part of it.
{BIO 3215622 <GO>}
Thank you, Jensen for the warm words. Yes. So I think there's a lot of synergy in the
architecture between the GPUs that NVIDIA designs and sells and the interconnect
that Mellanox designs and sells. We can now move onto the next stage of integration
and build more eﬃcient datacenters for wide number of applications and markets.
The way we've done it now is through external connectivity. The next stage of
building smarter, more eﬃcient and more productive datacenters will be higherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-11

Okay. Thank you.
And your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was curious how long you've been
exploring this purchase in earnest before the announcement today, was it weeks or
months, like how long have you actually been in this process before actually closing
on the deal today?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yeah. That's great questions. Eyal knows I've loved Mellanox for years. I have loved
Mellanox for years for several reasons. One, we collaborate. We've been working
together for very long time and we've built high performance computers together.
They are in every one of the DGX servers, the AI supercomputers that we make. So,
in our own products they are in every single one. They're all of our datacenter, the
ones that we use to achieve and deliver the world's highest performances on MLPerf.
We work hand-in-hand with their engineers to achieve those results all the time.
We've been working together for years. And so, I've loved this company for a very
long time.
I believe for a very long time also that NVIDIA will go from me a chip-level company
and -- to a server level company to essentially datacenter-scale company, and then
when we think about architecture even from that perspective. And so, I've loved the
company for a long time. And in terms of when the acquisition talks ﬁrst happened,
that's going to be in the proxy and -- but obviously, it was more recent.
{BIO 16423886 <GO>}
Okay. Just to follow-up, maybe housekeeping. How are you going to account for
Mellanox's revenues when you report, are you going to leave them, split out in their
own segment, or are you going to put them into your datacenter segment?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Hey, Stacy. This is Colette. I'll try and answer that question. At this time, we're not
changing our guidance that we just provided about a month ago for the current
ﬁscal year. When this deal actually closes, I will be able to give you more color
regarding what we see going forward in terms of guidance with the two companies
together and we'll talk about the overall reporting at that time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-11

Thanks, Stacy.
Your next question is from Will Stein with SunTrust.
Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on this transaction. Jensen, I'm
hoping you can put this acquisition in sort of a historical perspective for us relative to
the other ones you've done. What lessons would you say you learned from the prior
acquisitions that's sort of encouraged this transaction and what lessons might you
have learned from the prior deals that might provide a diﬀerent approach or
diﬀerent tactics around this one? Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yeah. From a scale perspective -- from a proportional -- from a scale perspective, this
is surely the largest one. From a percentage or proportional size perspective, our
integration, our acquisition of 3dfx was the largest and -- at the time. And at the core
of the core, it's really about several things. One, it has to be -- and just as a
statement, almost every single 3dfx engineer and employee that has joined us at that
time are still here and many of them are on NVIDIA's management team today on
the staﬀ [ph] today. And we wouldn't be here if not for the incredible work that the
people did that came to us. We are just such a diﬀerent Company as a result of that
acquisition.
And I think this acquisition would also be transformative for us, changing us from a
from a chip and a system-level company, to a datacenter-scale level company. And
several things that I learned. One, there has to be an alignment about the purpose of
companies, the culture of the company, and just the core attitude, the principles that
govern the companies. And I've worked with Eyal for a long time, we've worked with
Mellanox for a very long time, and our two companies are driven in very similar ways.
We're both best in our class. We're singularly focused on high-performance
computing, we're very performance-oriented and you just can't help and love the
fact that this company is also based Israel, so that the population of great technical
excellence is high. And so I'm thrilled about that part of it. And so, I think number
one is the alignment of purpose and culture.
The second is just alignment of vision of the future of the industry. We both see it the
same way, that this transaction is about uniting the two of the leading technology
companies in high-performance computing, it's about doubling down it's
datacenters, it's about inventing the future of datacenters, which is going to be
workloads that run across the entire datacenter. Imagine one application that's splitFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-11

Q - Mark Lipacis
A - Jensen Huangup in containers that's operating in servers all over the datacenter and results are
being sent around from one server to another server over the network fabric. The
entire datacenter becomes one giant compute engine. And this is the future. And so,
where compute starts and networking starts and ends, it's going to be harder to see
and it's going to be one continuous compute plain. And so the second is the
alignment of the future, vision of the future of the industry.
And then, thirdly, it has to make all the economic sense that the strategy would
suggest. This deal is going to be immediately accretive. You have two companies
that are growing. Our strategic tenants are still fundamentally sound. We believe that
the future is going to be about acceleration. Mellanox's business is growing and
they're growing fabulously and for all the dynamics, the reasons that I've already
outlined is the reason why they are growing. And so we have two growth companies
coming together, two best-in-class companies coming together, two cultures that
were built from the ground up coming together, and we see a common future, a
common vision of the future.
{BIO 15106707 <GO>}
Thank you.
And your next question is from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jeﬀeries.
{BIO 2380059 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the,announcement. I had two
questions, one software and one interconnect. On the software side Jensen, you've
discussed transforming NVIDIA from a chip company to a platform company for a
while. And I'm wondering if the Mellanox acquisition necessarily mean that you're
not going to be extending what you've done with CUDA on GPUs to a higher level
software capability then you had before with what will become the combination of
Mellanox and NVIDIA? That's the softer question. On the interconnect question, you
talked about system-to-system, is it -- does the Mellanox interconnect capability,
does that extend down to the chip-to-chip level and does it -- does it mean that you
consider multi-chip packaging architectures in the future, is that on the roadmap? I'll
stop there. That's all I have. Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes. I'll go backwards. NVLink is unquestionably the best processor-to-processor
interconnect that world has today. It is just incredibly high-speed and it's designed
so that CUDA programs could view all of the processors that are connected together
as if one large computing engine. And so, NVLink has a very special purpose and it's
really about connecting processors to processors within one system. Mellanox is
about connecting multiple systems also with the same sensibility of very low latency,
very high throughput and just incredibly well optimized software stacks that are
integrated with the gigantic body of software that's running on top of the datacenter.
If you look at their body of work, whether it's in high-performance computing,
supercomputing, enterprise computing or in hyperscale computing, their softwareFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-11
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 11Q - Mark Lipacis
A - Jensen Huang
Operatorstack is integrated deeply into the world's body of work if you will. And so, I think. I
think their interconnect and our interconnect, their software and our software, has
very speciﬁc places to exist, and they're going to evolve from there.
At the higher level, it is very clear that compute and networking will be one large
connected compute plain, if you will, that the networking will be an extension of the
compute fabric, or another way to say it is that, in the future, computing will be done
not just within the server, but computing of an application will be done at the
datacenter-scale. One application will run across the entire datacenter. It's either all
of the servers coming together, all of the nodes coming together, working together
to solve one problem or the application has been broken apart into a whole bunch
of little containers with AI programs running within it, and the results of one as been
essentially email to -- if you will, sent to the input at the [ph] other. And so, the traﬃc
inside datacenters has exploded because of those phenomenon. And -- but at the
highest level, the easiest way to think about that is, in the future, we're looking at
datacenter-scale compute engines, the servers will be connected by networks that
will create a compute plain that is continuous and the best architecture is going to
have to contemplate this holistic nature.
{BIO 2380059 <GO>}
That's helpful. Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
This is the last question? Okay. You guys, this is the last question. Thanks for joining
us. This was a real -- this is a really exciting day for our Company. And I'm super
delighted that we were able to acquire Mellanox today and announce the
acquisition of Mellanox today, and this is going to be the beginning of a new NVIDIA
that I look forward to sharing with you as time goes. Thank you.
