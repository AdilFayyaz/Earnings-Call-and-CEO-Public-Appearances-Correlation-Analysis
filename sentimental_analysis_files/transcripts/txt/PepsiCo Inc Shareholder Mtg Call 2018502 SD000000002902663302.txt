Good morning. Good morning, everyone. On behalf of our Board of Directors and
senior management team, thank you for joining us either in person or via webcast
for PepsiCo's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. It's wonderful to be back in New
Bern with all of you because this is our seventh consecutive meeting here in New
Bern. It's always exciting to gather in the shadow of Caleb Bradham's old drugstore,
the cradle of our beloved Pepsi-Cola. And I must say each visit is more special than
the last.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-02
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 10But this year, 2018, is particularly special as it marks Pepsi's 120th birthday, adding
that to the incredible milestone for one of the world's most iconic beverages and
one of the world's most beloved brands. And while we've come a long way since
Pepsi was known as Brad's Drink, we are as proud as ever of our New Bern roots.
So to everyone here in this town, it's an honor to join you for this historic celebration.
And thank you, once again, for being such warm and generous hosts.
Let me begin by introducing our Board members who are here with us today. And I'll
ask each of them to stand as I read their names: Shona Brown, George Buckley,
Cesar Conde, Ian Cook, Dina Dublon, Richard Fisher, William Johnson, David Page,
Robert Pohlad, Dan Vasella, Darren Walker and Alberto Weisser.
With me on stage is Dave Yawman, Executive Vice President, Government Aﬀairs,
General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. And let me also introduce other members
of our leadership team who are here with us today: Ramon Laguarta, our President;
Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Oﬃcer; Laxman Narasimhan,
Chief Executive Oﬃcer of Latin America and Europe Sub-Saharan Africa; Jon Banner,
Executive Vice President of our Communications; and Ruth Fattori, Executive Vice
President and Chief Human Resources Oﬃcer.
Let me also say what a privilege it is to be joined once again by Paul Finney, CEO of
Pepsi Bottling Ventures, our largest bottling partner in North America. Paul, welcome.
And Jeﬀ Minges and his sons, Miles and Landon. Jeﬀ, Miles, Landon. Jeﬀ runs
Minges Bottling Group, our bottling partner here in Pepsi-Cola's birthplace and
across Eastern North Carolina. Thank you for all you do day in and day out. For our
partnerships with Paul and to Minges, thank you very much. And thank you to
everyone who's here today. I want you to consider that -- I want you to know that I
consider it not only a responsibility but a privilege to come here and tell you how
we're honoring the trust you place in us, how we're making good on your
investment.
Now I've been in business for roughly 40 years. And I've rarely seen a time so
disruptive, as full of change in our industry and in all industries, as what we are
experiencing today. I'm reminded of the words of a wise man. "Change," he said, "is
the only constant in life." Change is the only constant in life. In the more than 50
years since Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay merged to form PepsiCo, we've done our best
to heed those words, to adapt to change. We've continued to scan the horizon,
strived to identify new and emerging trends and focused on making the necessary
investments and strategic moves to navigate them successfully. And that's how we've
delivered good returns that have grown consistently and sustainably year after year,
decade after decade.
In fact, over the past ﬁve years, organic revenue grew at a 4% compound rate. Core
constant currency EPS growth averaged more than 9% annually. Our annualized
dividend per share increased by 50%. And we returned $38 billion to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases combined.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-02
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 10And I'm pleased to say that we built on that progress last year. In 2017, we delivered
organic revenue growth of 2.3%. We expanded core operating margins by 45 basis
points. We grew core constant currency EPS by 9%, exceeding the 8% goal we set at
the beginning of the year. We generated free cash ﬂow, excluding certain items, of
$7.3 billion, exceeding our goal of approximately $7 billion set at the beginning of
2017. We expanded core net return on invested capital by 140 basis points.
And we also met our goal of returning $6.5 billion to shareholders through
dividends and share repurchases combined while increasing our dividend for the
46th consecutive year -- a dividend increase that beneﬁts nearly 2 million retail
investors, many like you. And these results have generated solid shareholder returns.
With our most recent dividend increase and based on yesterday's stock price, our
dividend alone is generating a 3.7% annualized return. Our dividend alone is
generating a 3.7% annualized return. And this is before taking into account stock
price appreciation and future dividend increases. For those of you who bought the
PepsiCo stock 20 years ago, your total return with dividends reinvested is over 265%.
Now, more recently, our stock price and the consumer staples sector overall, have
been a bit volatile. And that is a function of broader macro conditions, especially
rising interest rates and some of the market place disruption I just mentioned, which
is creating a downward pressure on the share price. But we believe that keeping our
focus on the fundamentals of our business, growing sales, being productive,
investing back in the organization. And using our capital in a disciplined way, will
continue to drive attractive, sustainable returns for our shareholders, especially those
seeking long-term sustainable value creation.
So I want all of you to feel conﬁdent. We're paying dividends just as we have in the
past. And our goal is to continue to operate this company with a very steady hand.
Now and then we might face a challenge in any one area of the business. But the
management of the company is very strong, perhaps the best in the industry. And
we know how to right the ship.
Moving forward, we'll continue building on our progress with help from the tax
reform that passed last year, reform that has modestly reduced our overall eﬀective
corporate tax rate and allows us to invest more international cash here in the United
States. Look, we are a global company operating across multiple categories and
serving more than 200 countries and territories around the world. That reach, that
diversiﬁcation, is part of who we are and what makes this portfolio work. And we are,
in many ways, a citizen of the world.
But we will never forget that we're also a company born here in the United States
and domiciled here. That's why earlier this year, we used some of the beneﬁts of the
U.S. tax reform to give our U.S. frontline associates a special one-time bonus of
$1,000 each. Our frontline is the backbone of our company. Without them, no
product gets made, distributed or sold. And we wanted to recognize all they do on
our behalf -- on your behalf.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-02
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 10David YawmanAt the same time, we are reinvesting the beneﬁts of tax reform in our company.
We're using these investments to help equip associates around the world with the
skills to succeed in tomorrow's workplace and make sure that we have the kinds of
world-class digital capabilities we need to navigate the changes in our industry.
We're also using the beneﬁts of tax reform to accelerate capital investments that will
add manufacturing capacity and make our operations more eﬃcient. In addition, as
we said in February, we are enhancing cash returns for you, our shareholders,
beginning with the 15% increase to our annualized dividend per share eﬀective with
the June dividend payment.
And as we continue heeding that wise man's words and adapting to all the changes
around us, our north star as a company will remain Performance with Purpose, our
governing philosophy for generating top-tier returns over the short term and the
long term. Our commitment to oﬀer more nutritious products, minimizing our
environmental impact and empowering associates and people in the communities
we serve. Overall, I'm incredibly proud of our progress. And you should be, too.
Because it's progress that can be measured, not only in the amount of added sugar
and sodium we're reducing in our products or the amount of water we're conserving
on farms and in plants. But in the lives of shareholders like you.
I'm reminded of a letter I received many years ago. "Dear Mrs. Nooyi," it read, "I have
wanted to write to you for a long time. My husband and I bought a few shares of
Pepsi for our granddaughter when she was born. And we reinvested dividends. In a
few years, she will be going to college and we hope to be able to help." It was a
warm letter. And we wished her well and we thought that was that. Then in March of
2016, we got another letter from the same person. "Today," she wrote, "I'm writing to
let you know that your team's management of PepsiCo has so increased the value of
my shares that I was able to cover most of my granddaughter's ﬁrst two years of
college." It goes on to add, "I'm 86 now and still enjoy Pepsi. And my son only uses
Pepsi products. Thank you, again for all you do." These stories touch me in the
depths of my heart and make me so proud to lead this extraordinary company.
They're evidence -- tangible proof -- that creating value for our company creates
value for our communities, for our neighbors, our friends, our children and
grandchildren. That's what we've been doing since Caleb Bradham mixed up the
ﬁrst batch of Pepsi-Cola in the New Bern pharmacy 120 years ago. And that's what
we'll continue to do and what we'll strive to do in 2018 and beyond.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave Yawman. Thank you.

{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
Now that we have a quorum, I declare this meeting to be duly convened for

with state laws and our own bylaws. It is now in order to proceed with the meeting.
Will the inspectors of election please open the polls?
I hereby declare the polls to be open.
{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
We have four agenda items this morning: the ﬁrst is the election of directors; the
second is the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the company's
independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for ﬁscal year 2018; the third is the
advisory approval of executive compensation; and one shareholder proposal will
then be voted on if properly presented.
In proceeding with the meeting, we will introduce all agenda items. And then we will
open the ﬂoor to questions relating to the agenda items only. I ask you to hold all
questions on our agenda items until we actually open the ﬂoor and to please direct
your questions only to me.
The proponent of the shareholder proposal or the shareholder's representative will
have 5 minutes to present the shareholder proposal. After 5 minutes, you will hear
this chime as indication that your time is up. Because we did not receive notice in
accordance with our bylaws of any additional matters to be considered, no other
proposals or nominations may be introduced at this meeting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-02
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Lisa HoﬀmanAfter we address any questions regarding the agenda items, we will collect all the
ballots and ask our inspectors of election to tabulate the voting results.
At the end of the meeting, we will open the ﬂoor to general questions. You should
have a copy of the rules of procedure that we will follow in the conduct of the
meeting. And we appreciate your cooperation. I have asked Dave Yawman to
address any issues that arise under those rules.
So let's begin with the ﬁrst agenda item, which is the election of directors. I place
before the meeting to serve as directors for the coming year the 13 individuals
whose names and biographies appear in our proxy statement. Our Board
recommends a vote "for" each of the nominees for director.
Let me now turn to the second agenda item, the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of
KPMG as the company's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2018,
which I place before the meeting. Brian Hegarty is here with us representing KPMG
and will be available to answer questions or make a statement if he would like to do
so later in the meeting. Our Board recommends a vote "for" the ratiﬁcation of the
appointment of KPMG as PepsiCo's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm
for 2018.
The third item is the advisory vote to approve the compensation of the named
executive oﬃcers identiﬁed in our proxy statement, which I place before the
meeting. Our Board recommends a vote "for" the advisory resolution to approve
executive compensation.
We'll now move on to the shareholder proposal submitted by John Chevedden, on
behalf of Kenneth Steiner, requesting that the company reduce the stock ownership
threshold to call a special meeting of shareholders from 20% to 10% of PepsiCo's
outstanding shares. The shareholder proponent's representative will present the
proposal. Would Lisa Hoﬀman please introduce herself and the proposal? Lisa?
{BIO 19967669 <GO>}
Good morning. Special shareholder meeting improvement sponsored by Kenneth
Steiner of Great Neck, New York. Shareowners, I ask the Board of Directors to take
the steps necessary to amend the bylaws and appropriate governing documents to
give holders of a total of 10% of the outstanding common stock the power to call a
special shareholder meeting. In other words, this proposal asks for an adoption of
more shareholder-friendly version of the shareholder right to call a special meeting.
This proposal does not impact the Board's current power to call a special meeting.
This proposal topic won more than 70% of Edwards Lifesciences and SunEdison in
2013, a shareholder right to call a Special Meeting and to act by a written consent of
2 complimentary ways to bring an important matter to the attention of both
management and shareholders outside the annual meeting cycle such as an election
of directors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-02
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 10Indra K. NooyiThis proposal is more important to PepsiCo shareholders since the corporation laws
of North Carolina do not allow a shareholder action by written consent. And
PepsiCo's shareholders do not have the full right to call a special meeting that is
available under state law, hence, the need to have a greater right of shareholders to
call a special meeting of the shareholders.
Plus, the proposal to the topic already won an impressive 49% vote at a previous
PepsiCo Annual Meeting. This 49% vote would have been higher than 51% if small
PepsiCo shareholders had the same access to corporate governance information as
large shareholders. Please vote to improve management accountability to
shareholders. Special shareholding meeting improvement, proposal #4. Thank you.
{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. Hoﬀman. Let me take a minute to share with you the Board's position
on this matter, as described further in the proxy statement.
The Board believes that the action requested by the proposal is neither necessary
nor in the best interests of PepsiCo or our shareholders because We already provide
our shareholders with a meaningful right, permitting holders of 20% of our
outstanding shares to call a special meeting. The vast majority of S&P 500
companies either have a threshold that is equal to or higher than our threshold or do
not provide such rights.
We believe that our threshold strikes an appropriate balance between allowing
shareholders to vote on important matters that arise between annual meetings and
protecting against signiﬁcant cost and unnecessary waste of corporate resources in
calling special meetings on frivolous grounds.
The Board also believes that this proposal should be evaluated in the context of
PepsiCo's strong overall corporate governance policies and practices that are
already in place to protect shareholder rights and enable shareholders to inﬂuence
the governance of this company.
We have long supported means for our shareholders to eﬀectively communicate
with the Board and senior management and provide signiﬁcant opportunities to
engage on important topics throughout the year beyond the limited forum of this
annual meeting or a special meeting.
For these reasons, the Board believes that the action requested by the proposal is
neither necessary nor in the best interest of PepsiCo or our shareholders and
recommends that the shareholders do not support this proposal.
Are there any questions about any of the agenda items we just reviewed?
Remember, we'll open the ﬂoor to general questions at the end of the meeting on
any topic you want. And as a reminder, in order to accommodate all of you who wish
to pose a question, especially on these agenda items, each shareholder will beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-02

Indra K. Nooyilimited to 3 minutes for questions or comments. And after 3 minutes, you will hear
the chime. So Q&A on the agenda items only. Hello, Justin.
Hi Indra. And I want to echo that you guys do participate with stakeholders not just at
this meeting. And I want to thank you for that. My name is Justin Danhof. I'm General
Counsel at National Center for Public Policy Research, a D.C.-based think tank and an
investor. I want to ask today about Darren Walker's position on the Board directly. Mr.
Walker is the President of the Ford Foundation. For those who don't know, it's -- with
its roots in the proﬁts of a great American success story, the Ford Foundation has
become a radicalized tool of the Americanless war on capitalism and prosperity.
Back in 1976, Henry Ford II quit the foundation's board writing this: "The foundation
is a creature of capitalism, a statement that I'm sure would be shocking to many
professional staﬀ. It is hard to discern recognition of this fact in anything that the
foundation does." It continues to fund extremist causes that bothered Henry Ford II
back then. For example, in 2017, the Ford Foundation gave the racial-focused group
Color of Change $8.7 million. Color of Change is one of the very groups that
coordinated the attacks on PepsiCo and other members of the American Legislative
Exchange Council, known as ALEC. If a company refused to leave ALEC, Color of
Change then threatened to air radio ads in the hometowns of their board members,
blaming them for the death of black Florida teen, Trayvon Martin. That's because
ALEC had worked on what's so-called stand-your-ground legislation. While ALEC
had nothing to do with the Florida law in question regarding Martin's death, facts
don't seem to matter to Color of Change. This was racial extortion to score political
gain. Think about if this were happening today. Color of Change may well be
threatening to air ads in Mr. Walker's hometown, all but accusing him of being a
racist. That's purely rich. The Ford Foundation also give millions of dollars to the
National Resources Defense Council, known as NRDC. This group's environmental
agenda, including working to eliminate plastics and calling for extra cost to be
pushed on corporations, would likely see the removal or changing of much of
Pepsi's packaging as successful. This would dramatically increase the price of the
company's goods, thereby diminishing sales and shareholder value. I encourage my
fellow investors to take a full look at the roster of extreme causes sponsored by the
Ford Foundation and ask yourselves this, how do any of these causes improve
society or America's business environment? And Ms. Nooyi, what do Pepsi
shareholders gain from Mr. Walker's expertise in supporting racially motivated
groups that have falsely attacked this company and others with extortion tactics and
the funding of radical environmental special interests?
{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
Justin, thank you for making the trip. And thank you for your comments. Let me just
oﬀer my thoughts here. I think one person's observation that something is radical is
another person's observation that it's right. Again, it depends on who in the
population you talk to. So I would not want to label anything as radical or not radical.
I mean, there's diﬀerent groups of the population. Second, let me speak to Darren
Walker himself. PepsiCo is a company that does business in 200 countries. And in
every country, we have to be in that country, for that country, with the communities
there and really behave as a citizen of that country. It takes very unusual people toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-02

David Yawmanhave such a global perspective and give this company a soul and a humanity in
every country in which we operate. If there's one person who does that brilliantly on
our Board, it's Darren Walker. He has that sensibility. He understands all of the issues,
not all of them maybe popular even for us. But at the end of the day, if Darren
Walker brings awareness of plastics, it's not Darren Walker. It's societies and
communities around the world. So it's coming to us through the voice of Darren
Walker, which is what we need on the Board. We need diﬀerent voices on the Board
to make us a better company. So I'm going to respectfully -- ﬁrst of all, appreciate the
fact that you're here, Justin. You're here every year. And we truly enjoy seeing you
here and the interactions we have. But I have to tell you, spend some time getting to
know Darren Walker. I think you're going to be blown away by what an incredible
addition he is to our Board. And I'm just grateful he's on our Board. Thank you. Any
other questions, comments?
Has everyone voted who wishes to do so? Anybody who hasn't voted yet? And if
there are any outstanding ballots at this time, please raise your hand. And we'll
collect them. And please, I'll remind you again to vote on each item. Do we have all
the ballots? Yes? We now seem to have all of the ballots. And since all those desiring
to vote have done so, I will ask our inspectors of election to close the polls. Ms.
VanDerbeck and Mr. Criscenzo?
I now declare the polls to be closed.

Thank you. The responsibility of the inspectors of election is to tabulate the voting
results. And they will begin to do so now while we take a brief break.
