Today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are any
predictions, projections or other statements about future events based on current
expectations and assumptions. Actual results may diﬀer materially from these
forward-looking statements because of a variety of risks and uncertainties about our
business, which are discussed today or described in our ﬁlings with the Securities

Welcome. I'm John Thompson, Chair of the Board of Microsoft. This is the ﬁrst year
we're holding our annual meeting in an all-virtual format. We strive to make the
meeting as inclusive as possible by oﬀering our shareholders the same opportunities
to participate as provided at the in-person portion of our past meetings.
In addition to the live webcast of the Annual Shareholder Meeting, shareholders
have the option to view the meeting via Microsoft Teams on the Investor Relations
website. The Team's broadcast will use Microsoft Translator and Azure service that
uses cognitive services for real-time translation in several languages. We appreciate
your participation today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Page 2 of 18I'd like to share with you the presenters for today's meeting. First, I will be joined by
Satya Nadella, our Chief Executive Oﬃcer; Amy Hood, our Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Oﬃcer; Brad Smith, our President and Chief Legal Oﬃcer; and
Dev Stallworth -- I'm sorry, Dev Stahlkopf, our Corporate Vice President and General
Manager and Corporate Secretary. Dev will address the business portion of the
meeting. Amy by -- followed by Amy, who will address the ﬁnancial results. And
ﬁnally, Satya will reﬂect on our progress over the past year and our opportunities that
lie ahead. Following his remarks, we'll have an opportunity for Q&A. But ﬁrst, let's
attend to a few formalities.
If you're a shareholder and wish to ask a question, you can submit your question at
any time on the virtual meeting website. We believe and will address any and all
questions that you have during the session. We will post questions and answers, if
applicable, to Microsoft's business page of the Investor Relations website. The polls
are open and will close in a few moments after the presentation of our business
matters.
The Board of Directors has appointed Broadridge Financial Services as -- to serve as
our Inspector of elections. A representative of Broadridge is present and will be
participating as the inspector.
This past year oﬀered another record year for ﬁnancial performance. And Microsoft
delivered strong results for our shareholders, including a return of $30.9 billion in
the form of purchases -- repurchases of shares and dividends. We celebrate these
successes and look forward to more opportunities ahead as we remain committed to
the long-term interest of Microsoft's shareholders.
As part of our ongoing commitment to creating a balanced and eﬀective Board with
diverse viewpoints and deep industry expertise, we regularly add directors to infuse
new ideas and fresh perspective to the boardroom. This year's Board nominees
represent a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. We believe our diversity of
experience, perspectives and skills contribute to the Board's eﬀectiveness in
managing risk and providing guidance to management that positions Microsoft for
long-term success in a dynamically changing business environment.
Of our 13 Board nominees, 11 are independent, which includes our Board chair and
all committee members. We believe in the value of listening to our shareholders.
And over the past several years, feedback from shareholders has helped the Board
evolve Microsoft's executive compensation program and further enhance
shareholder rights. Shareholder feedback also helps us provide our -- prioritize our
eﬀorts to enhance our transparency on workplace issues and other topics.
As we look to the year ahead, we remain excited about the opportunities Microsoft
has in terms of its business, shareholder value creation and positive impact at a
global scale. Thank you for your trust, the trust you place in us. And the opportunity
to serve us and the company. Now I'd like to introduce the nominees for the Board
of Directors who are here with us today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

To better understand our Board's unique skills and perspectives, I encourage our
shareholders to view the latest Director Video Series segment with Hugh Johnson.
The complete series will be available for review on our Investor Relations website.
Also here with us today are Mike Thompson and Chris Weber representing Deloitte
& Touche, our independent auditors.
And now I'd like to call the 2019 Annual Shareholder Meeting to order. I'll be serving
as the Chair of the meeting and Dev will be serving as the Secretary. As Chair of the
meeting, I've adopted an agenda that will govern the order of the business and the
rules of conduct for the meeting. Copies of the agenda and the rules are available
on the virtual meeting site, as well as the annual meeting page in the Investor
Relations website. The rules of conduct also govern the Q&A session. Dev will now
report the notice of the meeting, the proxies received and present the matters to be
voted on. Dev?

Thanks, John. Welcome, everyone. I'll walk us through the short formal meeting.
Then, as John said, you'll hear from Amy and Satya, followed by a Q&A session.
The Notice of the Meeting and Internet availability of the proxy materials were
mailed by Broadridge Corporation beginning October 22, 2019. And it went to all
shareholders of record as of October 8, 2019. As a result, this meeting is being held
pursuant to proper notice. We have received proxies representing more than 86% of
the roughly 7.6 billion shares of the company's stock that are eligible to vote. This
means we have a quorum present. And the meeting is duly constituted and will
proceed.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Mari SchwartzerToday, we have 3 management proposals and 2 shareholder proposals for you to
consider. They were all described in the proxy statement for today's meeting.
The ﬁrst item is the election of directors. The following 13 people have been properly
nominated by the Board: Bill Gates; Reid Hoﬀman; Hugh Johnston, Teri List-Stoll,
Satya Nadella, Sandy Peterson, Penny Pritzker, Charlie Scharf, Arne Sorenson, John
Stanton, John Thompson, Emma Wamsley and Padma Warrior. The Board
recommends a vote for each of them.
The second item is an advisory vote to approve executive compensation, as
disclosed in the company's proxy statement. The Board recommends a vote for this
proposal.
The third item, we ask that you ratify selection of the company's independent
auditor, Deloitte & Touche, for ﬁscal year 2020. The Board recommends a vote for
that proposal.
The fourth item is a shareholder proposal requesting a report on employee
representation on the Board of Directors. The shareholder proposal and its
supporting statement are set forth in the proxy statement. The proposal has been
submitted by NorthStar Asset Management. I recognize Mari Schwartzer, Director of
Shareholder Activism and Engagement with NorthStar Asset Management, for a
period of 3 minutes. Operator, please open Mari's line.
Mari, your line is now open.
{BIO 20356237 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning. My name is Mari Schwartzer of NorthStar Asset
Management, a socially responsible investment ﬁrm based in Boston and the
beneﬁcial owner of 75,575 shares of Microsoft's common stock. Today, I'm
presenting shareholder Proposal #1.
For the past several years, Microsoft has repeatedly come under ﬁre from employees
who have spoken out against projects that they believe go against the values of our
company. Employees have protested the company's work with ICE amid a national
outcry over the separation of immigrant children from families. But our company
declines any connections to ICE. Employees have demanded that Microsoft halt the
military HoloLens project, which an employee letter described as crossing the line
into weapons development. But our CEO conﬁrmed continuation of the project.
A year ago, employees urged Microsoft not to bid on the Department of Defense
JEDI project, a cloud computing contract that is described by many as a war cloud,
yet our company successfully pursued it. Not only that. But employees have also
alleged gender discrimination and sexual harassment within our company, includingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 18Dev Stahlkopf
Natasha L. Lamba pending class-action lawsuit potentially of thousands of female engineering and IT
professionals claiming pervasive practices of discrimination.
As long-time investors in Microsoft, we fear that our company has not responded
suﬃciently to these concerns from employees, crucial stakeholders in our company.
Continually ignoring employee concerns is a long-term risk to our company and
shareholder value. The potential loss of key leaders, engineers and IT professionals
reduces our company's strength in our dynamic and competitive industry.
Our employees are the driving force of our company. But if their trust in
management falters, Microsoft may suﬀer.
To remedy this, we suggest allowing and encouraging representation on the Board
by nonmanagement, nonexecutive employees. We believe that employee
representation on the Board may provide a key tool to ensure that employees, our
most crucial resource, remain fully engaged in the long-term growth of our company
and help to ensure operational excellence. We urge shareholders to vote in favor of
Shareholder Proposal #1. Thank you.
{BIO 20589252 <GO>}
Thank you, Mari. The Board recommends a vote against the proposal for the reasons
stated in the company's proxy statement. We believe that all candidates for the
Board of Directors should be evaluated by the same standards and criteria, whether
or not they're a company employee. And the Board is already deeply engaged on
providing oversight of workplace culture and the employee experience, including
receiving direct feedback from employees through anonymous polls.
The ﬁfth and ﬁnal item is a shareholder proposal requesting a report on gender pay
gap. The shareholder proposal and its supporting statement are set forth in the
proxy statement. The proposal was submitted by Arjuna Capital, which has a video
presentation in support of the proposal. I recognize Natasha Lam, Managing Partner
with Arjuna Capital, for a period of 3 minutes.
{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Natasha Lamb. And I move Proposal #2 on behalf of
Arjuna Capital, asking for a report on gender and racial pay equity.
Arjuna Capital ﬁrst engaged Microsoft on pay equity in 2016. Importantly, I would like
to acknowledge Microsoft's leadership at the time, when our company took a critical
ﬁrst step by publishing statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers,
assessing the pay of men and women performing similar jobs.
Microsoft has since closed the equal pay gap and now reports women earn 100% of
the compensation received by men and minorities earn 100% of the compensation
received by their white counterparts, yet this statistically adjusted number is only halfFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 18Dev Stahlkopfthe story. The other half is median pay disclosure, which is the speciﬁc objective of
this proposal.
Median pay is an unadjusted raw measure used by the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development, the OECD, to assess not only equal pay. But equal
opportunity. Women who work full-time in the U.S. make $0.80 on the dollar versus
men on this basis. African-American women make $0.60 on the dollar. And Latina
women make $0.55. Gaps in median pay is literally the deﬁnition of the gender pay
gap.
So while adjusted equal pay gaps measure whether women and people of color are
being paid commensurate with their peers for the work that they're doing today,
median pay gaps measure whether these groups are holding as many high-paying
jobs within companies, that is whether there is equal opportunity.
Given the importance of this measure, disclosure of median pay is now mandated in
the United Kingdom. For Microsoft's U.K. operations, our company reported a 7.9%
hourly median pay gap and a 13% bonus median pay gap. Yet notably, our company
has not published median information for its global operations.
Transparent disclosures that tell the whole story of gender and racial pay equity are
essential to investors as they create accountability and drive change toward not only
equal pay but equal opportunity. That change is in service to a more diverse
company and leadership. And therefore, better performance.
Thank you. So much for your time and support of Proposal #2 on gender and racial
pay equity.
{BIO 20589252 <GO>}
Thank you, Natasha. We received many questions from shareholders on this
proposal and appreciate the interest. However, the Board recommends a vote
against the proposal for the reasons stated in the company's proxy statement.
At Microsoft, we care deeply about gender pay equity. While we share the
proponent's commitment to the issue, we believe the disclosures and processes they
are suggesting would have the company focus on data that's not a useful measure of
our direction or success. We believe our current disclosures, programs and initiatives
provide signiﬁcant transparency and create speciﬁc internal accountabilities to help
the company address gender pay gap concerns.
The discussions of the matters for shareholder consideration is now closed. And the
polls are now also closed. I'll share with you the preliminary voting tabulation.
First, all 13 nominees on the ballot to become a director are elected with over 98% of
the votes cast. They'll serve until the next Annual Shareholders' Meeting and until
their successors are elected and qualiﬁed.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thank you, Dev. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.
2019 was a record year for Microsoft. Revenue grew 14% to over $125 billion.
Operating income grew 23%. And earnings per share grew 22%. We again saw
strong execution across all geographies and continued customer demand for our
diﬀerentiated products and services.
To further enhance our talent and capabilities in strategic growth areas, we
completed 19 acquisitions in FY '19. We welcome GitHub, the largest platform for the
developer community to Microsoft, enabling us to bring our tools and services to
new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-ﬁrst ethos.
And we purchased Glint, which brings employee insights alongside LinkedIn's
workforce insights to create a powerful solution to help customers attract, retain and
develop the best talent.
In gaming, we completed the acquisitions of 5 new studios to bolster our ﬁrst-party
content and fast-growing subscription services. As we continued to invest in M&A
and organic growth, we also retained our commitment to capital return, which for
ﬁscal 2019, included a total cash return of $30.9 billion.
In September, we announced a new $40 billion buyback authorization as well as an
11% increase in our quarterly dividend. Now let me share a few highlights from the
last ﬁscal year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 18Our commercial cloud business grew 43% to surpass more than $38 billion in
revenue. We saw strong growth across 3 key services. Oﬃce 365 grew 33%, Azure
grew 72%; and Dynamics 365 grew 47%. Importantly, we also delivered on our
commitment to make signiﬁcant improvement in the commercial cloud gross margin
percentage, which expanded to 63%, up 5 points year-over-year.
Through the sustained eﬀorts of our engineering, sales and marketing teams,
material improvement in our Azure IaaS and PaaS gross margins drove the
commercial cloud gross margin expansion.
Our server products and cloud services business reached over $32 billion and grew
25%, driven by continued customer demand for our trusted and diﬀerentiated
hybrid solutions. From both the technology and licensing perspective, we are
enabling our customers to digitally transform at their own pace.
Now let's turn to progress across our Microsoft 365 oﬀering.
Our Oﬃce business again,saw double-digit revenue growth as we reached even
more commercial and consumer users by helping customers around the world,
regardless of how small or large, be more productive and collaborative. We
continued to see healthy commercial and consumer demand for Windows 10,
increasing our base of active Windows 10 devices and contributing to growth in our
Search business. And in Surface, revenue grew 23% as we innovated across our
existing portfolio with our new Surface Pro and Surface laptop devices. And we
further expanded our family of category-creating devices with Surface Go, Surface
Hub 2 and Surface headphones. In gaming, revenue exceeded $11 billion. And we
saw strong momentum in our Game Pass subscription services as well as a record
number of Xbox Live monthly active users, which increased to 65 million with a
record number of mobile and PC users.
Now a few comments on our current ﬁscal year. First, as we do at the start of each
ﬁscal year, we updated our investor metrics based in part on feedback from all of
you. We now disclose the commercial remaining performance obligation, which
better reﬂects commitments our customers are making across all contract types. And
in gaming, we updated our metric to disclose Xbox content and services revenue
growth as the key performance indicator for the long-term health of the gaming
business across content, community and cloud.
And second, we're oﬀ to a strong start in ﬁscal '20 with double-digit top and bottom
line growth in Q1, a result of our consistent execution and ongoing investment in
high-growth areas. For the full year, we expect double-digit revenue and operating
income growth with operating margins up slightly year-over-year.
We could not deliver these results without the incredible contributions of the nearly
150,000 Microsoft employees around the world. While there is always more to do,
we are pleased with the continued progress we are making on diversity inclusion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

on our mission.
Looking forward, we believe the highest shareholder value comes from creating
diﬀerentiated, high-value scenarios for every organization and person to achieve
more. We'll continue to invest in our future against strategic opportunities like cloud
through AI and GitHub, business applications through Dynamics, Power Platform and
LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 through Teams, Security and Surface, as well as gaming.
We focus on the right secular technology trends, invest in structurally growing
markets. And we're conﬁdent that our competitive diﬀerentiation and world-class
talent positions us for continued growth as we remain focused on our customers'
success.

Thank you. So much, Amy. Thank you. And thank you to all our shareholders joining
us today on our ﬁrst-ever virtual shareholder meeting. Thank you for your continued
commitment and investment in Microsoft.
I'm proud of what we have accomplished this past ﬁscal year and energized by our
opportunity ahead. Our mission to empower every person in every organization on
the planet to achieve more has never been more important. Our platform and tools
help make small businesses more productive, multinationals everywhere more
competitive, nonproﬁts more eﬀective. And governments more eﬃcient. They
improve health care and educational outcomes and amplify human ingenuity.
Take Dr. Raymond Campbell, who's bringing health care to rural communities in
South Africa with an Azure-powered backpack. Shinobu-san, who taught herself
machine learning to digitally transform a small restaurant in Ise, Japan, where she
works. And Dr. David Kellerman, a university teacher in Sydney, Australia, who's using
our platforms to connect students in his classroom and online. The world's leading
companies from AT&T to Walgreens Boots Alliance to (Geo) in India are choosing
Microsoft to accelerate their digital transformations. Every day, we work alongside
customers like these to help them build their own digital capability, innovating with
them, creating new businesses with them and earning their trust. And we're
delivering diﬀerentiated value to customers of all sizes in every industry across every
layer of the technology stack.
We are building Azure as the world's computer to address -- compute the
customers' real-world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs with more
compliance certiﬁcations and more data center regions than any other cloud
provider. Azure is the only cloud that extends to the edge, enabling everything, from
smart factories to modern, compliant banking, to precision medicine. Azure has
limitless data and analytics capabilities, enabling our customers to apply the power
of quantum computing today and has the most comprehensive portfolio of AI toolsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

their applications. Those of you who are watching today can use those capabilities
for real-time translation of my remarks in 6 languages. In a world where every
company is a digital company, developers will play an increasingly wider role in
value creation and growth across every industry.
We are building the most complete tool chain for developers, from visual studio to
GitHub, which is used by more than 40 million developers, including the majority of
the Fortune 50.
We are empowering citizen developers with Power Platform. Now anyone can make
better decisions using self-service analytics, build a mobile app, automate a business
process or even create a virtual agent with no coding experience.
Dynamics 365 gives customers a 360-degree view of their business and enables
every function inside of the organization to move from reactive, siloed transactional
processes to proactive, repeatable, predictable business outcomes. We are enabling
our customers to bridge the physical and digital worlds with our mixed reality
applications and HoloLens 2, the most advanced intelligent edge device available.
LinkedIn creates an economic opportunity for every member of the global
workforce. And our comprehensive talent solutions help every organization attract,
retain and develop the best people in a competitive jobs marketplace.
Microsoft 365 brings together Oﬃce 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility and
Security and empowers everyone, enterprises, small businesses, students and ﬁrst-
line workers. We are infusing AI across Microsoft 365. Presentations are more
accessible in PowerPoint. Videos are more searchable in Stream, e-mails more
relevant in Outlook. And meetings are more inclusive in Teams.
Microsoft Teams has had a breakout year. It brings together everything a team
needs: Chat, voice, meetings, collaboration, with the power of Oﬃce apps and
business process workﬂows. And we are bringing it to ﬁrst-line workers in every
industry, from health care to hospitality to retail and manufacturing. Our expanding
family of Surface devices continues to create new categories beneﬁting the entire
OEM ecosystem.
Finally, we're transforming how games are distributed, played and viewed for more
than 2 billion gamers worldwide, from our new game streaming service Project
xCloud to Minecraft Earth, to our fast-growing subscription service, Game Pass --
Xbox Game Pass. None of this progress and impact is possible without trust, both
trust in our technology. And more importantly, trust that our customers have a
partner whose business model is fundamentally aligned with their success.
We believe privacy is a human right. We are investing to protect customers in today's
zero trust cybersecurity environment. We are building AI responsibly, taking aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

In closing, we will continue to innovate boldly, invest in the right secular trends. And
work to earn our customers' trust every day. I've never been more optimistic about
our opportunity to empower the 7 billion people on the planet through the power of
technology. Thank you very much.

Questions And Answers
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Welcome to the Q&A portion of the meeting. I'm Mike Spencer, Head of Investor
Relations at Microsoft.
I'm Joined by Satya, Amy and John, also joining us is Brad Smith, our President and
Chief Legal Oﬃcer. We want to thank you for all the questions you submitted in
advance and during the meeting. We'll try to get to as many as we can.
As we review the submissions, there were several in the same topic. So we've
selected a representative question from those topics to answer today. If we don't get
to your question in the meeting today, we will post a document with responses on
our Investor Relations website after the meeting. So let's go ahead and get started.
We received the most questions asking why the Board recommended a vote against
the shareholder proposal on gender pay quality. Since Dev addressed this matter
during her remarks, we'll start with a question on the composition of the Board.
We had several shareholders ask about the number of directors who are
independent versus insiders, the male-to-female ratio and the number of Board
members with backgrounds in ﬁnance and investment ﬁrms rather than in
technology. John, could you explain the factors considered in electing nominees to
the Board?
{BIO 15832126 <GO>}
Certainly. We've had a wonderful change or transformation of the Board just as the
company has transformed. The company is committed to a substantial majority of
independent directors as well.
We look for a diverse set of skills, experiences and perspectives. And we actively
seek qualiﬁed women and individuals from minority organizations who can truly help
build a stronger Board. The Board has 8 members, of which -- most of which are
backgrounds in technology. And we have a number of other Board members who
are from other very, very important areas of the industry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

A - Amy E. HoodThe slate today has 38% women, more than 54% gender and ethnic diversity. And 2
of our committee chairs are in fact women. So I think we've made great progress in
diversifying. And quite frankly, enhancing the Board overall.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, John. Next question is for Satya. One anonymous shareholder asked
about how we are preparing for quantum and edge computing.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
It's a great question. Maybe I'll take the edge question ﬁrst. From day 1, when we
built out Azure and designed Azure, we had an architectural principle that we will
build out a distributed computing fabric that includes the cloud and the edge. And
that's why we even talk about the paradigm we are going through as intelligent
cloud and intelligent edge.
Today, on the cloud side, we have 54-plus data center regions, more regions than
any other public cloud provider, just to bring all of the compute capacity to where
customers need it. Then we extend it to the Edge. So with Azure Sphere, every
microcontroller can be a compute node of Azure. And with Azure Connect, you can
now have cameras that are smart with compute as well. Then all the way to Azure
Stack. And now, in fact, we have now taken even one more step with Azure Arc,
which brings a control play across all of the clouds and all of the edge infrastructure
that is available. So we're very excited about what we are doing there architecturally
to meet the customer needs.
Around quantum, again, we're taking the same approach, which Microsoft always
brings to any technology layer, which is a platform approach. For example, we just
announced Azure Quantum, where we are now going to have a variety of hardware,
whether it's ion trap or superconducting hardware from us and others. Then on top
of that, we are building the software tool chain. In fact, we're excited about how Q#
is being used already on classical computers to really do quantum-inspired work. In
fact, Cleveland Clinic, I was able to do some of the things that they were never able
to do before, using quantum-inspired algorithms on top of classical computers. So I
think that there's a lot of beneﬁt to the approach we are taking. And we're excited
about the future.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Satya. The next question is for Amy on capital return. Well (Moconnath
P.) asked, are you going to increase dividends in the future?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Mike. As you know, we really do think about capital allocation holistically
with 4 priorities. The ﬁrst and most important for us is continuing to invest in long-
term innovation and product diﬀerentiation. And so our ﬁrst priority is always to
invest in ourselves for long-term growth. The second priority is to think through
inorganic options to help accelerate or expand our TAM and addressable market,
again, for long-term shareholder return. Then we think about the 2 otherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

those, as you know, over the years and remain committed to using all 4 of those
vehicles for long-term shareholder return.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Amy. Now we have a live question. There was one anonymously
submitted about the investment Microsoft made in a company by the name of
AnyVision. Brad, could you help provide some background on that investment.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Sure. AnyVision is an Israeli company that's really at the cutting-edge of some
technologies that involve facial recognition. M12, which is Microsoft's venture capital
arm, made a $10 million investment in AnyVision. And because of the sensitivity of
facial recognition technologies when M12 made that investment, they secured a
commitment from AnyVision that they would adhere to our principles around facial
recognition. One of those principles says that it won't be used for mass surveillance,
especially mass surveillance outside certain safeguards that really involve the
protection of human rights and the application of the rule of law.
NBC has reported from Israel that AnyVision's technology is being used on the West
Bank and on the Gaza Strip in ways that have raised real questions about whether
our principles are being complied with. Now AnyVision has told us privately. And
they've stated publicly, that they, in fact, are complying with our principles. But
because of the seriousness of the issue, I think it's fair to say, we decided to exercise
our audit rights under the investment.
One of the things that M12 did was negotiate to exercise audit rights, if needed, if
any serious issues arose. So at Microsoft, we retained the former Attorney General of
the United States, Eric Holder, as well as a team of former federal prosecutors to, as I
would say, get to the bottom of this. And we'll either satisfy ourselves that, in fact,
AnyVision's technology is being used in conformance with our principles. And if so,
we'll stand publicly and say that, that is in fact what AnyVision is doing. But if our
audit shows something diﬀerent, if we're not able to get to the bottom of this to our
satisfaction, then we've been clear. And we won't continue with the relationship we
have.

Great. Thanks, Brian. Another one for Satya. John D. Asked, how large can the cloud
computing business be for Microsoft?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
That's -- Amy talked about how we're investing across the entire length and breadth
of the tech stack with the opportunity ahead, which is about increasing digitization
everywhere. If you look at it in our own context, whether it's xCloud or Azure
infrastructure, to us, that's a one continuous sort of spectrum of opportunity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

A - Michael SpencerBut perhaps one way for investors to think about what's happening with cloud
computing at large is to think about what the total spend in technology today is. It's
around 5% of GDP. On a secular basis, I think it's going to be 10%, which is it's going
to double in the next 10 years. And that's because every industry, whether it's in
retail, whether it's in health care, whether it's in manufacturing, they're all being
transformed by digital technology. And this technology stack we have and the
platform approach Microsoft has means we will be able to participate in that 10%, on
the doubling of tax spend. But more importantly, really helping the global economy
grow because of digital technology. And that's what I think is the way to think about
our opportunity.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Satya. The next question is for Brad. Diana L. asked, what is Microsoft's
strategy to promote products that help ensure the security of elections in the U.S.A.?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Well we're really doing 3 things to promote the security of elections, not only in the
United States. But really in the 76 democratic nations around the world.
The ﬁrst is to protect candidates and campaigns, political parties and think tanks. We
have a program called Account Guard. It's now being used by 65,000 accounts in 26
countries. We've trained 1,300 campaign professionals so that they can better secure
their e-mail and defend against potential hacking or leaking of e-mails by foreign
adversaries. It's something that's already, I think, making an important diﬀerence for
the people who use Microsoft 365 in the realm of elections.
The second thing we're focused on is protecting voting, protecting elections. So we
have a program, a solution now called ElectionGuard. We've open-sourced it. It
really is next-generation election technology. We're excited because you're going to
see the ﬁrst pilots of it in some U.S. elections early in the new year.
Then the third thing we're focused on is addressing the problems of disinformation.
We've partnered with and supported an initiative called NewsGuard. And I'd
encourage everybody who is watching to give it a try because it's really simple to
use. Just do a search for News Guard, you can download the add-in for your
browser. And the next time you do a search on Bing or another popular search
engine, what you're going to ﬁnd is next to your results, you're going to see a green
icon if it's a reliable news organization, regardless of what political party or aﬃliation
it might be associated with. But if it's an organization that trained journalists have
identiﬁed as a consistent source of fake news, you're going to see a red icon instead.
So think of it as an easy-to-use roadmap for people so you know what kind of
organization is putting out the news you're reading.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Brad. John, this next question is for you. So if you could help address.
Courtney W. asked about the CEO compensation ratio of 249:1 and why there is such
a large wage gap between Satya and the median of employees' compensation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

A - Satya Nadella{BIO 15832126 <GO>}
Well ﬁrst and foremost, the Board believes that Satya, as well as many of our
investors, quite frankly, has done just an amazing job. And so the compensation
strategy is attached to or tied very much to the performance of the company.
If you were to think about Satya and the company and its progress over the last few
years, market capitalization growth has gone from $302 billion when Satya became
CEO to $850 billion today. We're just over $1 billion, I'm sorry, today.
Strategic leadership has been transformed as well. The notion that we're going to
have a cultural expansion or change in this company would not have happened were
it not for Satya, quite frankly. And strong execution of his vision around an intelligent
cloud has clearly been the driver of growth for this company. And while many
people think that we are of signiﬁcant revenue scale and operating margins and
what have you, the reality is we are. And we are, in large part, because Satya and the
team have driven that performance over the last 5 or six years.
One of the things that people don't recognize, however, is the competitive shortfall
that we might have against some other companies in the industry. But while our
comp for many people may be diﬀerent, the reality is we have other beneﬁt
programs that are much, much better. For example, while the average employee has
about $172,000 contract, if you will, the health care beneﬁts are substantial. And
those are important to people in this economy as the world has changed around
health care.
So I think we're in great shape. And I think Satya, quite frankly. And his team have
done an amazing job over the last ﬁve years.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, John. Helpful. For Satya, we had a shareholder ask, with Microsoft as a
leader in the cloud computing business, what plans do you have to expand the
platform to be open source, which would allow more people to contribute more
apps?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes. We are very, very excited about the open-source community. In fact, Microsoft is
the largest contributor to Linux and many other open-source projects. And we are
very committed to it.
So one of the fundamental things that I think about. And in fact, it goes back to the
very origin of the company, is we build tools for developers. We are very passionate
about it, from Visual Studio to GitHub to Azure DevOps to Azure PlayFab, we believe
we have the best tool chain for any developer to be able to build their applications
on any cloud.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

A - Bradford L. SmithSo that's, I think, the fundamental commitment you can expect from Microsoft. In a
world where every company is becoming a software company and a digital
company, the developers are very key. And their productivity is very key. And
building the best tool chain for them is not some side business for us. It's a
mainstream passion for Microsoft.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you, Satya. We have another question here for Satya. An anonymous
shareholder asked, will Microsoft be signiﬁcantly investing in development of AI
tools for the health care industry?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Again, we're very excited about both the opportunity to help all participants in the
health care industry, whether it's from the provider side to the insurance side and the
pharma companies, everyone to be able to use digital tools and digital
technologies, in particular, AI. So some of the things that we are doing, for example,
around bringing the best speech capabilities to do medical transcriptions in
partnership with the company, Nuance. And then to reduce physician burden, is a
great example of the type of innovation. Even the work we're doing with Novartis
around bringing AI tools for their research capabilities around Life Sciences is
another example. So we are, yes, absolutely bringing AI tools. But most importantly,
again, putting AI tools in the hands of people across the industry in health care, who
are going to make a real diﬀerence.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
And I think there's another aspect that's interesting here, because whether it's health
care or really our customer set more broadly, it's both the commitment to provide AI
tools. But also to help provide AI skills. So we're expanding our programs to work
with customers so that they can train their employees to use the tools. And we're
also partnering with customers to really enhance the spread of AI ethics.
One of the things that we're not surprisingly ﬁnding -- and I think the question on
AnyVision reﬂected this -- is people want to have conﬁdence that AI is going to be
used in an ethically responsible manner. And in a world where we're providing tools
to customers, our customers want to at least get the best of what we've learned so
far about how to create ethical principles. And we're doing more of that across
Microsoft. We now have a responsible AI standard. But it really gives us the
opportunity to not just serve customers. But work in partnership with them. We share
what we've learned. We get to then work and share with them what they're learning
as well.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, both. This is our last question for Brad. Claire W. asked, how are we
factoring in the impact of climate change into our business planning?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 17 of 18It's maybe the question of the next 3 decades, if not beyond. And in reality, we've
already taken a number of steps to factor climate issues into our business planning,
whether it's where we locate data centers, how we access renewable energy, access
to water and the like. But that's really just the beginning.
When we look back at the last 10 years, I think there's a number of steps that we feel
are important then that we can build on. Microsoft became really the ﬁrst large
company in the United States to become carbon-neutral. That was in 2012. And that
applies to all of the company and its operations. We became one of the ﬁrst
companies to create an internal carbon tax. And this isn't just a shadow price. It is a
real price that all of our business units pay when they consume carbon.
Last year, Satya made the decision that we would increase that price. We almost
doubled it, it's now $15 a tonne. And Amy and I have worked together. And that
money is being used to take a lot of the steps that we've taken in the recent past,
whether it's now having on this campus, everything here comes from green energy.
We've been increasing the green energy that is being used by our data centers
around the world. We're now constructing data centers that are getting to the point
of recycling almost all of their water. But at the same time, I would say that when we
look at everything we have done, science tells us one thing above all. Everything we
have done is insuﬃcient to meet the needs of the future. And that's not just a
statement about Microsoft. I think that is a statement about every company in every
industry, in every country around the world.
So the real question, as we look to the 2020s, is how do we raise our ambition? That
is what we're committed to doing. And for Microsoft, I think it really means 2 things.
Number one, you'll see us undertake early in the new year, a new initiative, a much
bigger initiative, that is going to be something that we invest in with continuous
improvement over the next several years. And it's going to focus on 4 areas:
Reduction in carbon; better use of water; reduction of waste; and our impact on
biodiversity, the ecosystems of the world. And a big part of what we'll do will be
improved further. We'll move faster to reduce our use of carbon. We'll have a wide
variety of new measures that we'll start talking about in January. That's our ﬁrst
ambition.
But I actually think our second ambition is really the bigger and more important one.
The world will not solve this problem without new technology. It will take a wide
variety of new technology. It will take major investments in research and innovation.
And what we recognize is that digital technology is an enabling technology for
everything that's needed. Digital technology is something that all of our customers
can use to address their own environmental footprint.
It may start with something as straightforward as helping them move to the cloud
and moving to a clean cloud that is using renewable energy with something like
Azure. But fundamentally, it is about unleashing the power of digital technology. It is,
if you will, something that I think builds on our mission statement.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 18 of 18A - Michael SpencerOur goal for the next decade needs to be to create digital technology that will
empower every organization to build a more sustainable planet that humanity needs.
And I think for all of us, frankly, for all of our employees, this is a cause that we
embrace.
