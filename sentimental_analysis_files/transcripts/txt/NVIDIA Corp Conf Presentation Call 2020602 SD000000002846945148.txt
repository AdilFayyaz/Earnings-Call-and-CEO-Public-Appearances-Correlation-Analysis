Hello. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. This is Vivek Arya from the
Bank of America Semiconductor team. Hope everyone is doing well.
We are absolutely honored and delighted to have Colette Kress, Chief Financial
Oﬃcer of NVIDIA join us this morning to discuss recent business trends, just fresh oﬀ
a very strong quarter, where NVIDIA announced a number of new products.
So maybe Colette, as a start -- ﬁrst, welcome. And then maybe as a start, if you could
just give us some quick highlights on the number of new product announcements
that NVIDIA made recently.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Vivek. And thanks so much for having us for your conference. We've
had a busy quarter and deﬁnitely a busy couple of weeks as well.
Let me kind of talk through some of the really high level things that we announced
over the last couple of weeks.
First, we ﬁnished our Q1 of ﬁscal year '21 results. Our results were strong, led by our
growth in terms of data center and gaming. What we're seeing across the board is
cloud computing and AI continue to fuel our growth in terms of the business.
Gaming is continuing to reach a broader and broader audience, which is aiding our
overall revenue growth.
We also saw record levels in terms of our data center revenue, which for the ﬁrst time
passed the $1 billion mark for the quarter, and we also had record gross margins.
Additionally, before we announced earnings a week prior, we announced our new
Ampere architecture. We announced the architecture from our kitchen and talked
about it as the fastest ramp in history of what we produced. It is the largest
performance leap, our Ampere architecture. It is 20x improvement over our priorFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 13A - Vivek Aryageneration of the A100. It is also the biggest chip on 7-nanometer. It is the highest
performance of anything in the world.
Unifying, training and inferencing was our goal with the Ampere architecture, which
allows for multiple inference GPU that allows an elastic overall data center build. We
also produced signiﬁcant software innovations, including our CUDA 11 that launched
as well as software packages for Jarvis, Merlin and Spark, which focus on
conversational AI, recommendators as well as the large industry of data analytics and
data science.
And then lastly, probably noted at the earnings is that we closed our Mellanox
acquisition after 13 months since its announcement. Mellanox and NVIDIA are now
one.
But we have the optionality now to redeﬁne the overall modern data center
architecture with the combination of the two companies.
The modern data center architecture really focuses not only on accelerated
computing, but accelerated networking, which can go hand-in-hand. It also allows us
the ability to accelerate for some of the areas of disaggregated infrastructure as we
move forward.
So the overall Mellanox acquisition is expected to be accretive to both non-GAAP
gross margins, non-GAAP EPS as well as our free cash ﬂow.
So those are some of the big things that we've announced over the next -- over the
last three weeks or so closing out our quarter.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Great. Yes. It was good to see NVIDIA bringing U.S. semiconductor manufacturing
back to Jensen's kitchen. That was very impressive to see.
So Colette, maybe what I'll do is I'll -- let's -- you started talking about diﬀerent
product and growth drivers. Maybe let's stick with that theme, and then we can
come back to some of the more near-term issues.
So starting with gaming, your largest business, what we have seen historically is
whenever there are new game consoles that are launched, they often jump-start a
new gaming cycle, and we had one start seven years ago. And in the second half of
this year, there are expectations for new game console launches.
How should we think about that in terms of driving your GeForce user base to
upgrade to your newer graphics cards?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 13A - Colette Kress
A - Vivek Arya{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure.
So the way we look at the overall gaming market and even what we have seen over
the last couple of quarters is overall gamers in the overall market are excited
because of the games that come to market. Looking for the platform that allows
them that experience and to achieve the performance that they need to play some
of those great high end types of games is really we're focused on.
Over the last ﬁve to ten years, you've really seen a huge shift of overall gaming to
really be an overall entertainment sport. An entertainment sport that brings together
friends in a social setting to play games, watch others play games and really use it as
a full entertainment sport. Now what we've seen even in the last quarter is even more
bringing people online to focus on being together as they've been challenged to
entertain even outside of the home.
But when we look at the next upcoming holiday season and the expected arrival of
the new overall consoles, what we've seen historically during these times is the PC
platform is still a great platform that gives them both the optionality, but also the
ability to do any types of games and enter into that market at any diﬀerent type of
price point.
So over this period of time, you'll see the ecosystem build games for upcoming
overall hardware that will enter that market. That's a great opportunity for us to
continue to attract gamers to the PC gaming platform, and we'll likely see that
continue as we move into this overall holiday season.
What is going to be diﬀerent is we've got two years working, building the overall ray
tracing, which is attracting the ecosystem to right games, to deliver high-end ray
tracing.
So our use of not only great overall hardware but also our work to develop software
that enables the best agreed overall real-time ray tracing will be a great attraction
point for the overall gamers into the market.
So it's an area that we continue to see the importance of building great games,
being innovative in terms of better and better graphics. And I think that will be very
beneﬁcial as we turn the corner to the holiday seasons.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Now I recall that in the last few analyst days, you had given some
quantiﬁcation of unit and ASP trends in your gaming business, a very strong double-
digit kind of growth rates that we saw both in terms of units and ASP or essentially
your content. As we look at the next two to ﬁve years, Colette, what is the right way
that investors should think about both the unit growth and the content growth
aspect in your gaming business?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 13A - Colette Kress
A - Vivek Arya{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So our gaming business, even in the last couple of years versus historical, has
really added quite a few diﬀerent form factors in terms of how people can
experience overall gaming. We have been the kings of the overall desktop add-in
card overall market.
But as you've seen over the last couple of years, we've also introduced the overall
laptop and not just laptops that include a GPU, but include a high-performance
overall GPU. We are now running to incorporate Turing and the high-end parts of
Turing all the way up to 2080 supers in our overall laptop line.
Additionally, we have created a studio line, a studio line that bridges between high-
end overall gamers as well as what we refer to as the creatives and the independent
creatives that may be out there. We have the overall consoles as well in terms of our
work that we do with Nintendo.
So it's really shifted in terms of how people absorb overall gaming, but it also allows
us both the increase in terms of the units and the deployment to the overall gamers
as we've seen otherwise, the increase in overall ASPs that we've received over this
group as well.
What we mean by that is to partake in the higher end of gamings, we provide overall
cards with that great performance and that overall great experience. We continue to
be average overall ASPs that are still within or lower than what you would receive if
you had to purchase a full overall console unit.
So as we work forward, we see there's an opportunity to expand overall gaming to a
larger and larger universe of gamers, increasing our overall units, but also the ability
to upsell to higher and higher GPUs that can accomplish the real-time ray tracing
and can meet the overall experience that some of our best gamers are considering.
So I think this is a trend that we've seen over the last couple of years, but there's
nothing stopping from that to continue as we go forward. Long term, gamers and
the number of gamers that will probably be gaming around the world will still be a
very important part of overall entertainment and their ability to ﬁnd diﬀerent types of
oﬀerings at every diﬀerent price point allow us the overall ASP uplift as we go
forward.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. You mentioned ray tracing, and NVIDIA was very early in the ray tracing
feature.
Sometimes it's good to be early, sometimes it's a little tougher to be early. Give us a
sense of what is the latest in terms of ray tracing adoption by game publishers?
Because as I look at some of the announced features of the new consoles, they
deﬁnitely are talking about ray tracing being one of those features.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 13A - Colette Kress
A - Vivek AryaSo how is it helping NVIDIA to be early in terms of rolling that technology? And what
have you seen so far in terms of game developer and game publisher adoption of
that technology. Just how important is ray tracing to catalyzing faster growth in your
gaming business over the next handful of years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Really good question. As we look at the importance of overall real-time ray
tracing going forward, it has been a feature or an overall experience that probably
wasn't expected for more than ten years out and something that we brought in with
our last architecture. We had signaled in terms of bringing it together with Microsoft
and the development of their API and really worked with the full ecosystem in
developing the capabilities for real-time ray tracing.
That early arrival was super important -- super important for us in terms of bringing
that innovation to the overall world of gaming, and we have now aligned almost with
every single major publisher, major engine that is out there. And you will see now
that ray tracing has become a household world. That people use the word to signal,
this is the next generation of gaming.
We were able to get in with many of the games that were in the initial stages of
being built and being able to think about their strategy of how they used ray tracing
for that. And we're very pleased with the number of overall games that are out there.
But also that the industry is all now moving to overall ray tracing. You see the overall
console signaling that they will have their ﬁrst generation consoles using ray tracing
out by the overall holidays.
But our two years of working is enabling not only the overall hardware, but also
enabling software techniques that inﬂuence the overall ray tracing experience. Ray
tracing requires a lot of high-performance overall compute to make the overall frame
rates special to those that are experiencing ray tracing.
But with our DLSS software, for the ﬁrst time, brings overall AI to gaming and brings
it to ray tracing to improve the overall and enhance the performance using software
and AI. Essentially, what you're doing is ﬁlling in, in between the pixels with AI and
inferring what those pixels will be rather than waiting for the time for real-time ray
tracing to compute.
So we're excited about what we brought to the market and being that ﬁrst-mover
because we knew that the work with the ecosystem would be essential. We've got
two years working on this and so much information and learning through that of
what the overall gamers will need and working with overall game developers to
make their games overall top notch.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Maybe let's move to data center, your fastest growing business. And
interestingly, about to become your largest segment for the ﬁrst time in the comingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02

Give us the puts and takes on the data center and especially the visibility around
growth for the next handful of quarters. Because you mentioned in the introduction
earlier that you have the Ampere product rolling out.
So that's great. But at the same time, we also have a number of the cloud customers
who have been talking about buying a lot in the ﬁrst half, but maybe digesting that
capacity in the second half.
So give us the puts and takes and just your overall visibility in the data center
segment.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So our Q1 results for data center were just great. For the ﬁrst time, we exceeded
$1 billion. As we had articulated at the beginning of the quarter, we had good
visibility into that quarter, and we were able to see that overall demand ﬁnish for the
quarter. We had more than 80% growth year-over-year as well as very strong
sequential growth of more than 18%. Across the board, we saw strength in our
overall hyperscale and overall cloud purchases. We also had great results in terms of
our vertical industries, and therefore, our enterprises adoption as well.
Currently, at this time, we have our hyperscales that are a little less than 50% of our
business, our overall verticals that are more than 50% of our business. Within that,
we also serve not only training, but also in terms of our adoption of overall
inferencing.
Inferencing adoption continues to go quite well. This quarter, we still have reached
where inferencing is in the double-digit percent of our overall data center business.
Importantly, it doubled year-over-year in terms of its revenue and its growth of using
a GPU for many of the overall inferencing workloads that are out there.
But most importantly for the quarter, was the quarter incorporated our overall
Ampere and our A100 shipments.
So even though we found the right opportunity to launch it, even after our overall
quarter, within the quarter, it contributed to a meaningful percentage of our overall
data center revenue for the quarter. A great feat from us in terms of launching just an
outstanding overall architecture and the overall demand for A100 is still quite strong.
We expect as we move from Q1 to Q2 that we will continue to have good visibility
into Q2. We think Q2 from a year-over-year will accelerate growth from what we've
seen in terms of Q1.
As we had highlighted with our overall earnings, it is something that we do of
essentially providing guidance quarter-by-quarter and provided that quarter for Q2.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 13A - Vivek Arya
A - Colette KressAs we look in terms of H2, we'll come back to kind of give some highlights in terms
of what we expect to see in the second half of the year.
As we look into Q2, Q2 will be a quarter of continuing overall Ampere, but we're also
continuing to see strength in our V100 as well as our T4 overall product oﬀerings.
You will likely see us continue to ship all three types of architectures within the data
center for some time.
Our Q2 overall guidance also includes a full quarter of Mellanox. Mellanox, if you've
watched over the last year since the announcement has been doing quite well. Even
in this last quarter, it had overall record growth as it saw more than 40% growth in
that overall March quarter.
We expect Mellanox to represent in our second quarter in the low teens as a
percentage of the overall data center business. We're excited for us to work together
as we work with overall customers. They have a lot of similarities in terms of the
overall customers that they serve. As you know, they are a leader in most of the
overall interconnects that inﬂuences high-performance computing and overall
supercomputing.
So there's a great match as we work together to create the overall modern data
center.
So a very, very important quarter for data center, both in terms of launch of Ampere
as well as bringing on Mellanox, and we're excited in terms of how the quarter
panned out.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Good. When we look at the kind of growth rates, Colette, that NVIDIA is putting up in
the data center, they are very impressive. And certainly, in semiconductor, we are not
used to seeing these kind of growth rates.
So as -- from a CFO perspective, how do you make sure that what you're shipping
that there is adequate level of utilization so you can model growth going forward just
because the level of growth that you're reporting is so strong and so impressive?
How do you make sure that there is an excess capacity being built up at your
customers because we saw there was a year where there was capacity digestion
among your data center customers? What things are you putting in place to make
sure you have a good read on the capacity utilization of your new products?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So our data center business probably wouldn't be referred to as a
semiconductor business. It's deﬁnitely referred to more as systems and an overall
platform put together.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Our overall systems and platforms are here to support overall accelerated
computing and some of the most important breakthroughs in accelerated
computing as it relates to overall artiﬁcial intelligence.
So much of the work that we do in that full stack and software together with the most
high-performance overall processors that are out there are to really support the next
generation of the data center.
The next generation that needs a diﬀerent solution to support the overall compute
that will happen in data centers now that overall Moore's Law is aimed at. And so we
see a surge of people purchasing into overall AI, purchasing into using overall
acceleration. The overall A100 is an important architecture, an important architecture
that now bridges an overall system or solution that allows you the ability to do high-
end overall AI training and use of overall training models, but also taking it to
complete overall inferencing and overall inferencing workloads. Of course, it is also
well engineered for overall high-performance computing, just like our overall V100.
So it serves a lot of diﬀerent markets, which is the overall goal of our overall
architectures.
We continue to look at a universal system and solution that enables software speciﬁc
for those overall ecosystems.
So even more with the overall A100, you have the ability to use it for a lot of diﬀerent
workloads and improve the overall eﬃciency of the overall instances that we create
or just a pure system as a whole.
Our ability to work with overall customers on the solutions and the projects that they
have has continued to advance over the last three years that we have been working
with them since our last architecture. We know that they are interested in purchasing
four projects -- purchasing four workloads. Ampere allows that ﬂexibility for the
workloads that they may do that will ease the overall deployment and the quick
overall utilization, whether they be doing that for internal use or creating overall
cloud instances.
We don't have the perfect insight at all the times in terms of their projects and their
build, but we do know that since three years in the launch of overall V100, more and
more use of the cloud and the cloud as a ﬁrst test to determine if they will stay in the
cloud for those workloads or bring that in-house to their own systems in their data
center. It has also branched a signiﬁcant amount of work in the edge as not all
overall accelerated computing will occur in a centralized data center, and edge
computing and having an edge overall system and architecture is also very clear for
us.
So in these times, we know that we are well aligned to the priorities of hyperscales,
enterprises as well as high-performance computing that is out there. And that is whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 13A - Vivek Arya

A - Colette Kressis key in terms of driving the overall growth that you see in our overall data center
that we expect to continue.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. How important is this 5G and edge computing opportunity? Do you need to
form new kinds of products, new kinds of alliances with telcos, for example? Or do
you think you are adequately positioned for 5G and edge compute?
Because going into the telecom market, at least the perception from the outsiders is
that it's a relatively new opportunity. And here we are at the start of the 5G cycle.
So how important is 5G for NVIDIA? How much focus do you have on that from a
product and go-to-market perspective?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So if you've watched our overall launch of all the speciﬁc verticals that we
continue to enable and enable for overall acceleration, it begins to start to
understand the overall applications and their use and some of the challenges that
they have with their overall computing and the ineﬃciencies.
Often a great time to actually enter those vertical industries as they are moving to
some new transformation. The transformation to 5G allowed us to discuss with a lot
of the telcos and others, the challenges that they see in terms of that adoption of 5G
and what we could do in terms of accelerating that process. And also, decoupling
the overall hardware from the overall software and compute.
If we could enable the acceleration with the overall software that we could stitch
together for 5G realm, we now have the ability to improve their overall deployment
of processes with 5G. Nothing diﬀerent than any other of our overall vertical
integrations that we are trying to do. We're choosing large markets, large markets
that we know that are challenged in the new world of overall compute to be
accelerated. And we are stitching that together, whether it be warehouses, factories,
considering how they do their supply and demand planning or what we see in terms
of storefronts looking for visual computing to determine how those stores run more
eﬃciently as well.
So there's many diﬀerent opportunities for us to assist at the overall edge, 5G was
one of them, but you'll probably see more and more of that develop from us.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Talk to us about Mellanox. It seems like a very important acquisition for
NVIDIA. How is it expanding your growth opportunity? And when do you think we
will start to see some revenue synergies, perhaps from the combination?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 13A - Vivek Arya
A - Colette KressYes. So you've seen our focus in terms of accelerated computing over the last ten to
12 years and focusing on overall GPU acceleration and focusing on the overall
compute.
There's another super important part of acceleration, which is accelerating the whole
data center. And from the time that the overall data is determined to the time that
the data is computed as well as the data in terms of ﬂowing out of that system. The
overall interconnect, the overall networking layer is another area that can be overall
accelerated to improve every stage of acceleration in that data center.
So our work in terms of Mellanox and our partnership over the last several years has
been integral in terms of understanding that space and understanding
interconnects.
We have been working together even from announcements of the overall deal
coming together as one company. We've been focusing on what is that next
generation of data centers and how can we use those interconnects. You've seen us
incorporate Mellanox in our DGX, in our EGX, and you'll probably see more and
more system works together that we can partner together essentially in the same
overall box and system.
But as we move forward, you will likely see us also produce products together that
best serve some of the key vertical industries that we are focused on. High-
performance computing is near and dear to both companies. And now as a whole,
you will likely see us really focus on improving the high-performance computing area
as well.
So the synergy is more about focusing on products together in the future. We
already have very similar customer sets today. We have very similar overall
distribution channels.
So I think from a good standpoint, we believe the overall demand will remain the
same in the short term so that we can focus on meeting the overall needs as
customers in the future with product sets.
{BIO 6781604 <GO>}
Got it. Gross margins, you highlighted earlier, one of the strong points of the quarter
you just reported. Despite some of the cost pressure from rollout of Ampere and 7-
nanometer, how should we think about the longer-term trajectory of gross margins?
I imagine as the systems part of your business grows, that perhaps puts a little bit of
pressure, but the software aspects and just the move into data center helps.
So just give us some puts and takes on gross margins from here.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 13A - Vivek AryaSure. When we look at our overall Q1 gross margins, Q1 gross margins also was a
record quarter for our gross margins. Q2 is what we guided in terms of non-GAAP as
66% would also be our overall record. Inﬂuencing these record levels really is a focus
in terms of on mix across our overall platforms. We sell platforms and our platforms
incorporate a signiﬁcant amount of software. That software work is important in
terms of diﬀerentiating ourselves from a standard overall chip company, but it is also
integral in terms of creating the overall ecosystem alignment that we have, but also
in terms of creating full overall platforms and products that the customers need in
terms of accelerated computing.
Because of that signiﬁcant software, that software build is down in our overall OpEx
with our overall software engineers that are building that, that enables us to have
better overall gross margins when we think about the overall manufacturing process.
As we discussed in terms of our Q1 results, the launch of overall A100 is in the early
stages. It is in full production, but it's in the ﬁrst couple of months of production
versus an overall architecture such as V100 and many of our Turing overall
architectures that have been in market for a couple of years. That will enable us the
time to improve the overall yields as we go forward and also look in terms of areas of
overall value engineering over the life cycle of the overall architecture.
So from time to time, you'll see that slowly, probably shift up. And we'll continue to
look at mix overall in terms of improving our gross margins.
Our gross margins improvement over the last ten years is quite phenomenal in terms
of what we've seen, in terms of that gross margin improvement. Our gross margins
are getting quite solid in terms of in the 60% and higher.
So we think going forward, we'll continue to concentrate on gross margins.
But we're probably not going to have the speed of growth in gross margins that
we've seen in the last 10 years as we look forward.
But the mix is an important piece. Our mix is inﬂuenced by selling boards and selling
overall systems. As you pointed out, we create systems such as full DGXs, and we
have other components in there outside of the overall GPUs that inﬂuence our
overall gross margin of the system. We also sell consoles, we sell overall modules
into automotive as well.
So quite a diﬀerent array of diﬀerent gross margins, but the better and the more
inﬂuence that software has in terms of our platforms, the better our gross margin will
be going forward.
