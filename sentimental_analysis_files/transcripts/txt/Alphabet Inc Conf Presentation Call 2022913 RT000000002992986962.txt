Thank you. Thank you, Eric. Thank you all for giving us this opportunity to share with
you the trends we see in cloud computing. Google's strategy in the cloud market,
why customers are choosing to adopt our cloud, and how we're bringing these
solutions to market? Our mission and strategy of Google has been to accelerate the
ability for every organization to digitally transform their business, by oﬀering them aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

foundation for transformation.
Over the past three years, we've seen four important trends in cloud computing.
First, the market is in its very early stages still, and there's lots of growth, and there's
lots of growth for many vendors. Second, the primary drivers of cloud computing
used to be the migration of workloads onto elastic computed storage. While that
continues to be important, new markets are opening, driven by growth in data,
artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity and others.
Third, some of these drivers measured by independent analysts in many diﬀerent
surveys are buying factors in segments of technology and products, where Google
has real strength. Finally, if you go back to April 2019, when we ﬁrst at our conference
introduced the notion of multi-cloud, very few customers were looking at using
technology from multiple cloud vendors. Today, just three years later, the vast
majority, no matter which survey you look at, look at using technology from multiple
cloud providers and the notion of multi-cloud is quite widely adopted.
Recognizing these trends, we focus our products in four product lines. Our Data
Cloud, which provides organizations a data warehouse, a data lake, machine
learning tools in one integrated data platform to take the data and understand it to
get intelligence. Our infrastructure cloud consisting of public regions are hybrid
cloud or private cloud and our edge cloud, allowing people to modernize their IT
landscape and build cloud native applications. Third, as people have shifted the
nature of work to hybrid work, our communication and collaboration tools, Google
Workspace has seen signiﬁcant growth and adoption.
And lastly, recognizing the growing threats from cybersecurity, we build and oﬀer
customers an integrated set of tools to protect their data, applications and systems
from cyber threats. We oﬀer this through 34 cloud regions that are live, nine
additional that we've announced, a 103 availability zones connected globally by 22
undersea cables, and our large global network serving customers in over 200
countries around the world. Our footprint continues to expand in response to
customer demand for our products and services in many diﬀerent parts of the world.
Now, let's look at our major products and why customers choose us, starting with
where we lead the industry in data. We oﬀer four unique capabilities that attracts
customers to our data cloud. First, for customers like Comcast, who want to combine
voice records from the call center, images of their bills along with analysis of which
customers are satisﬁed and which customers are having issues, we're the only ones
who allow people to mix structured and unstructured data and analysis.
Secondly, customers don't want to have partial data solutions. They want a single
Data Cloud that allows them to run data warehouses, data lakes and machine
learning tools. So all the people in the organization can collaborate together in
understanding data. We do that for Walmart, we do that for Home Depot, we do that
for many other companies. Third, the vast majority of our customers combine data inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 12our data cloud from multiple clouds, from other cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft,
our cloud as well as on-premise data sources. Opening up our addressable market
for our data cloud to all customers. An example being Unilever, which runs their
supply chains sustainability analysis on our cloud.
Lastly, we made a trivial for customers to run large scale systems, exabytes plus of
data every day with no need to manage any infrastructure. They simply load their
data and run their queries and they don't have to administer anything. Second, in
the infrastructure area, we lead the market in four diﬀerent ways. First, if you're
building cloud-native workloads, Flipkart, the leading e-commerce company in India,
Mizuho Bank, one of the largest ﬁnancial services institutions in Japan, they wanted
the best performance, scale and cost, and our innovations in hardware and
microprocessors allow us to oﬀer that.
Second, workloads are shifting in the cloud, not just to run traditional CPUs, but
increasingly new types of algorithms. AI algorithms, simulation, high-performance
compute. And we have unique hardware and microprocessor technology that
provides customers like AMD, Broadcom in the simulation space, and almost all of
the self-driving car companies, for example, that need large-scale AI models, the
ability to run those workloads on our cloud.
Cloud computing continues to move to the Edge. It's driven by demand from
telecommunications companies like British Telecom, Bell Canada, T-Mobile, who
integrate the network with our edge technology and retailers, gaming companies
like Unity that use our Edge, because it can work with any cloud back-end. It can
work with Azure, it can work with Amazon, it can work with Google, it can work with
Ali Baba, so they can deploy a global footprint across the world. We've all
experienced the pandemic. We're all trying to understand what it means in the
nature of work. People in many companies and industries do not want to go back to
the oﬃce. When the oﬃce is no longer the physical space for work, there needs to
be a digital space through which people get their work done. We call that Google
Workspace.
Airbus, a large company over 100,000 employees and over 100 countries around
the world dealing with highly conﬁdential information uses our cloud and Google
Workspace to bring all of these people together, because it makes it easy for them
to deploy across all these countries as a cloud native solution. It allows their users to
use mobile devices to understand information and it keeps their data secure at all
times. Second, digital workers are no longer people in oﬃces. They include retail
store workers at Carrefour. They include nurses at hospitals, like Ascension Health.
They want mobile devices and secure communication from these devices we
provide them that capability.
We provide uniﬁed communications and uniﬁed collaboration. Just two years ago, 6
million customers paid to use Google Workspace, 6 million individual companies. In
two years, that number has grown to 8 million, because of the technology and the
ease with which they can operate. The threats from cyber attacks continues to grow,
they continue to proliferate. We are pleased today that Mandiant, the leading ﬁberFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 12intelligence security company and about 2,500 approximate employees are now
part of Google.
Our vision behind the acquisition of Mandiant was very simple. When we talk to
CIOs and CSOs and CEOs, every cyber attack has been a black swan event. The day
before the attack, the organization thought it was secure, the day after the attack,
they realized they were not. What we are trying to do with cybersecurity is to simplify
and automate the ability to understand the nature of the threat that Mandiant gives
us through their incident response and threat intelligence.
To analyze if you as a company have been compromised by that threat that we get
using our Chronicle platform to automate the remediation of it and then to validate
that you are secure. So the acquisition of Mandiant allows us to oﬀer a companies a
platform for security operations that combine all of these capabilities and automates
the way they get cybersecurity. We also protect millions of websites from fraud every
day. We've introduced new capability and response for the Log4j vulnerability
around signed, secure, open-source libraries, because we have expertise in doing
that for many years.
Lastly, Google has invested for years in artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning.
Not only do these solutions power our consumer properties, these are also helping
enterprises in many diﬀerent places. A hardware and software combination is being
used by organizations, like Ford Motor Company, Johns Hopkins and others to run
complex large-scale algorithms. Our software, our AI software that does advanced
speech, audio-video, image processing is being used by many companies, and
example is Vonage that's using it to improve the way that they understand speech.
Our software platforms allow every organization, XPO Logistics is an example. OGE
in the energy space. We empower their data scientist use the same tools that
Google's engineers use every day to build AI and machine learning models,
improving their productivity. All of these solutions have allowed us to show strong
product momentum. In the Data Cloud, we've seen 3.5x growth in the volume of
data analyzed, and 5x growth in machine learning model development in just the
last 12 months. If you look at our infrastructure cloud, every day, millions of
developers build large-scale clusters. Just to give an example, in a single month, we
typically see on the order of 2 billion clusters based on Kubernetes, the standard that
lots of developers use, which is a growth over 75% year-over-year. It also drives a
2.5x increase in network traﬃc on our network.
Google Workspace is the world's most popular communication collaboration tool,
used by over 3 billion users monthly, 8 million paying companies, and 5,300
partners deliver solutions on top of Google Workspace, that users use every day.
From a cybersecurity point of view, we've identiﬁed vulnerabilities in 40,000 open-
source libraries, protected just recently the largest distributed denial-of-service
attack in the world. And we secure over six million websites from fraud, all of which
represent opportunities for us in growing our business with these customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Page 5 of 12Many of the leading companies around the world in every industry and geography
today are customers of ours. And when you look at the largest companies in the
world, just three years ago, we virtually were in none of these companies. Today,
whether it's in telecommunications, retail, media, technology, almost all the leading
companies in the world run big parts of their business, if not, all of their business on
our cloud. We have dedicated our work to also bring a large partner ecosystem with
us. We look at the partner ecosystem through four lenses, system integrators, who
can expand and accelerate how quickly customers can migrate their workloads to
the cloud. Independent software vendors that broaden our addressable markets,
technology partners that complement and complete our solutions and ﬁnally
distributors who extend our reach.
We're very proud that from virtually zero partners four years ago, we have 92,000
partners for Google Cloud today. It reﬂects not just our momentum, but the fact that
we're also bringing a lot of business to partners. Examples, all 12 of the top 12
leading visionaries in analytics and business intelligence run their business using our
Data Cloud. Enterprise security, 10 of the top 10 publicly traded enterprise security
vendors run on Google Cloud, and we take them to market jointly with us.
Similarly, all ﬁve of the leading global system integrators recognizing the demand
that customers have for products and services that build dedicated cloud practices
for Google. The diﬀerentiation we have in our products, our broad go-to-market
reach is leading to strength in customer adoption. On average, a company uses 13
diﬀerent products from Google Cloud, showing the deep product relationships we
have with these customers. In the ﬁrst half of this year alone, we delivered 1,300 new
products and features, a 22% increase from a year ago.
On the partner side, as I said, 92,000 partners do business with us. It's a three-time --
along with we committed three years ago or four years ago that we would expand
ourselves organization by more than 3x, and we have done that through disciplined,
focused expansion of ourselves and go-to-market organization. Are we winning only
in the largest customers, no, even in the new emerging company. 70% of the top 100
unicorns run on Google Cloud. And our partners are making a lot of business with
us. The number of deals we have sold along with ISVs, independent software
vendors has grown 130% and through our marketplace, many customers use our
technology, and partner solutions together.
Finally, this momentum has led to growth in our ﬁnancial results. You've seen our
growth steadily over many quarters, and not only that, we have strong comparisons
to market growth as a whole. So in closing, the cloud market is in its very early
stages. We have highly diﬀerentiated products in multiple product lines, we're
bringing that to market through a large, focused, scaled go-to-market organization.
We also work with a broad network of partners, who are seeing large expansions of
their business with us and the combination has led us to show not only customer
adoption and traction, but also strong ﬁnancial momentum.
Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

(Question And Answer)
Thank you, Thomas, and thanks for all that in terms of an update on both the scale
and the momentum that's building in Google Cloud. Really appreciate it. We'd love
to start with taking a step back. A lot has evolved over the last few years at both the
industry level and within the -- in the cloud space and within Google Cloud. Can you
give us your world view of where we sit in cloud adoption, usage, and how you see
Google Cloud's position within that framework?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Yes. Great question. Thank you, Eric. If you look at the last three years, cloud
adoption has changed in a variety of ways. People are looking -- three years ago, if
you talk to large customers, they would say, cybersecurity probably not a place I
would use cloud for. Data, I'm not sure, I would use a cloud for it. So we're seeing the
major trends is new segments or product lines, opportunities are opening up for us.
Many customers use us along with other clouds. Multi-cloud is now, almost,
everybody looks at it, opens up a huge market for us.
Third, the speed with which these projects are getting done increasingly many
companies are adopting a cloud-ﬁrst rather than a cloud-also approach. And we've
invested heavily in both our products and the ecosystem to bring these solutions to
customers. So we are seeing signiﬁcant interest from partners, who want to build
solutions on top of our cloud to take it to market. Just this morning as an example,
we announced a variety of diﬀerent partnerships in the data area, and these are all
examples of things that things that we're seeing increasingly getting traction.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Okay. Given the macro environment remains uncertain, and we haven't experienced
a prolonged recession or downturn, since cloud computing is scaled as an industry
aside from what we went through from COVID, how do you think about potential
outcomes for public cloud spend resiliency within broader enterprise AP budgets
against that potential landscape?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
I'm not going to comment on macro. I think here in the audience that people are far
more sophisticated than me on when the macro environment changes. But the long-
term trends that are driving cloud adoption continue to play extraordinary role
during the macro environment, right? So for instance, much of cloud computing is
because it provides a more cost-eﬀective infrastructure rather than traditional
models of operation. We oﬀer for example, managed services, managed databases,
managed data warehouse, managed analytic tools. These give people the ability to
shift their people from managing machines to doing projects. So it also allows ITFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Q - Eric Sheridan
A - Thomas Kurian
Q - Eric Sheridanorganizations that maybe people constrained to actually get projects done because
they're not doing things like managing machines and devices.
Third thing is, there are lots of capabilities that we oﬀer that you couldn't get in any
other form fashion. As an example, as we help a lot of organizations managing
demand forecasting, supply chain visibility and it's because of the predictive
capability of our machine learning tools that let them do that. So it's not that we're
oﬀering a substitute for something that people could get in some other way. It's for
oﬀering them new capability that is really important to them. So all these factors in
the long-term, we're always investing and managing for the long-term. I think they all
play well to what the long-term direction we see with adoption of these
technologies.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
So sticking with that long-term direction for a minute, maybe bring it back to
investments. You laid out a lot of long-term opportunities. How do you as an
organization think about aligning capital and investments against the opportunities
you see? And how does it feedback into thinking about long-term proﬁtability and
earning a return on those investments?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Good question. We make -- we look at investments in primarily three areas, and each
have a diﬀerent time horizon. So capital investments in data centers, global network,
machines, et cetera, were typically looking at a long-term horizon, typically on the
order of 8 to 10 years, because investing in building a large-scale region in a country
is something you're doing in response to large addressable market and typically
you're making that investment over an 8 to 10 year horizon.
Second, a go-to-market organization. Early when we build a go-to-market
organization, we don't have a lot of customers, right, when we started. So we were
funding that go-to-market organization to acquire customers. As we've seen strong
adoption of our technology and customers, the number of sales people who are
working with existing revenue generating clients, as opposed to all working on
greenﬁeld accounts, changes the eﬃciency of our salesforce. So that's the second
piece.
Products, we've matured our products over the last three years, we become a real
player and the investments we make in adding products or adding features to the
product are always in response to either customer segments, opening up a new
addressable market like compliance needs. And so, even there as we've matured the
product portfolio, we're building incremental capability, but the baseline lifts us a lot
from a point of view of investment eﬃciency. So we're very conﬁdent, obviously, we
work very closely with our leadership team. We're very proud of them, and we
wouldn't be investing, if we didn't have absolute clarity with Ruth, Sundar and the
rest of our leadership team on a path to proﬁtability.

Page 8 of 12A - Thomas Kurian
Q - Eric Sheridan
A - Thomas KurianGreat. Understood. You recently announced your ﬁrst region in Mexico. How should
we think about your infrastructure footprint scaling over time? How much of this is
driven by growth you see ahead versus the need to localization? And how much is
localization being driven by regulatory pressure around things like data like data
privacy or performance for end users?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
A lot of our decisions on investments in cloud regions are also based -- when we
invest in a cloud region, we're looking at multiple factors. One is the total
addressable market in the local market. Second is the demand for multinational
companies that want to serve that local market because we have a large number of
global companies in our customer base and many of them when we say, should we
consider this market, tell us here is an example of a market where we would really
like you to be present in that our technology considerations, for example, latency.
And then, there are regulatory considerations where, for example, government may
prefer that or strongly require that data remains within the boundaries of that
country. So, depending on all those parameters, we make decisions, but those
decisions are also guided by investments in our go-to-market and other functions, so
that as we build a cloud region, we also know how to monetize that.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
And sticking with that theme of go-to-market and you talked a little bit earlier about
sales force, productivity and scaling the sales force, Google Cloud has spent a lot of
time optimizing go-to-market strategy and aligning the organization against your
broader vision since you took over leadership. Can you talk about what that looks
like today? And how did you manage or how do you manage or think about sales
force productivity and utilizing partners to go-to-market versus maybe go-to-market
that's owned organically?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
So we've had a very, very disciplined, focused growth strategy for our go-to-market
organization. They're taking a consumer company and building a real enterprise
business, almost no one else has does it. So how did we do that? You start with
focusing on certain countries and markets, and every year, we've added
incrementally, but we wanted to get ﬁrst depth in certain countries and markets
rather than spread wide. That's step one.
The second is we've specialized, we specialized in three diﬀerent ways. We
specialized by product category, because for example, if you look at who's buying
cybersecurity tools, the buyer is typically the Chief Information Security Oﬃcer, not
necessarily the CIO. If you look at people buying our analytics and data platform,
sometimes, it's in the IT department, but in many cases, for example, the case study
that was done in the Wall Street Journal on the work we did with UPS was actually
the Head of Logistics.
So, the second thing we did was specialized our salesforce. We've also specialized
by industry. Recently for example, we announced the creation of a public sector
subsidiary, focused on selling to government agencies. And so, we specialize byFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Q - Eric Sheridan
A - Thomas Kurian
Q - Eric Sheridanindustry because diﬀerent industries have unique needs. And then lastly, we sell to
both traditional technology, traditional IT organizations and enterprises, as well as
companies that are born in the cloud. Some people call them digital natives. And the
way you engage with them are very diﬀerent. So we've done all this work. We've
built a focus team focused on partners, partners complement us, they help us
accelerate growth, they help deploy our solutions. We've been super clear where we
play and where our partners play, and we've had great success growing the
ecosystem of partners around us. And frankly, many partners ﬁnd us one of the most
easy companies to work with and they've grown substantial businesses with us.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Great. Okay. Google has long been seen as having diﬀerentiated products, when
you think about data analytics, or AI, or machine learning. How do you see the
demand for these types of products evolving? What do you see as some of the
primary drivers of growth in that part of the market?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
The important things that we see are when we got into data, we said there's lots of
individual pieces of technology that people talk about, they talk about data lakes,
they talk about data warehouses, they talk about lake houses, they talk about ML
tools. If you look at the average company, they just want a platform with which they
can load the data and they can run all these diﬀerent kinds of analysis. Because
some people who are data scientists say, I want to build a model. Other people who
are Business Analysts don't have the expertise to write a model, they want to query
the data. Other people want to run calculations and diﬀerent kind of programming
languages. So the ﬁrst thing we built was one data cloud supporting all these
diﬀerent ﬂavors.
The second thing we said is, if you really want to do data, you've got to do it across
clouds, because nobody wants to say my data happens to be in this cloud, therefore,
I have to run analysis there. And so, we bridge all the clouds. And the vast, vast
majority of our customers are using from multiple clouds. The third thing we see is
we introduced the capability for organizations to share data with other people. It's
super interesting for retailers and their consumer packaged goods companies for
example, sharing demand forecast with fulﬁllment in supply chain, really
transforming how eﬃciently supply chains can run because now you can collaborate
across the boundaries of an organization. All of these have shifted data from being a
topic that IT organizations focus on. Now, to the Head of Merchandising, the Head of
Supply Chain, the Head of Logistics, and we've trained our people to sell there.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Okay. You talked a little bit in your presentation about the Mandiant acquisition. I
wanted to turn to security for a minute. Can you talk about your own focus within the
organization on security? How you think it diﬀerentiates Google Cloud? Maybe give
us some examples of some of the risks or threats, you think that organizations are
facing, and then bring it back to your explanation for why Mandiant was to write
acquisition for you guys?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

We look at our security portfolio in -- with two simple lenses. The ﬁrst is, if you are
running your workload as a company on our cloud, how do we ensure that you are
safe? We do that by simplifying security for people. Today when people run their
systems and they have all these breaches happening, it's not because they haven't
invested in tools is the fact that they have so many tools, they don't understand how
to administer the environment securely. So what we've done is really provide people
three capabilities.
One is simplifying architecturally how they run the workloads in our cloud. Second,
providing them the ability to measure if they're running in an assured conﬁguration,
we call that in a short workload, where we take responsibility jointly with them to
assure the security of it. And the third is the proof of it is that if you can manage and
measure your security posture, you should be able to ensure yourself with it. And so,
we also oﬀer cyber insurance with insurance companies because now a customer
can customer can say, I'm running on Google, I'm secure. Here's the proof of it and
they can reinsure themselves. So that's one piece.
The second piece, the variety and ﬂavor of cyber threats continues to accelerate. The
most important factor if you're a cyber attacker is how long from the ﬁrst time I'm
detected till the last company that is aﬀected is locking me out. And if that window is
a long time as it is today, they will keep ﬁnding new ways to come in. So the rationale
behind Mandiant was super simple. How do you get the world's best incident
response team? That is at the forefront of almost every attack that can detect what
are the new ﬂavors of vulnerability coming in, and what are the new ﬂavor of attacks
coming in. That gives us the best threat intelligence feed in the world and the
earliest response capability.
That then is fed into our platform where we're combining, obviously, Google
strength in machine learning and AI to detect the needle in the haystack, are you,
have you been compromised to integrate that into a workﬂow that allows you to
remediate. And then most importantly, if you ask the average thistle, can you
guarantee that you've actually ejected the attacker and you know that you're no
longer compromised, almost nobody can tell you that. So the last piece is validating
that you're in fact secure. And through this, we believe fundamentally that you can
take cybersecurity from a lot of little bolt-on products to a more secure platform that
people can use to guarantee their enterprise-wide security posture.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Got it. I want to come back to Workspace, I think that resonates that resonates with
everyone in their personal and professional lives, touch some elements of Google
Workspace and the application suite. What are you hearing from clients about the
future of hybrid work? The role Workspace may play in workﬂows? And how you're
positioning Google Cloud against what you're hearing from customers?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 12Q - Eric Sheridan
A - Thomas KurianWhen hybrid work happened, we had lots of organizations. Media companies that
were moving their recording studios, people who were issuing devices to their
mobile workforce. For example, pilots and airlines, nursing staﬀ, hotel companies
that all of a sudden had guests that needed access, but with diﬀerent permissions,
the biggest thing that we saw was enormously interesting is, if hybrid work means
you can work from anywhere. In hybrid, work means you want to access from
anywhere. And if it means you need to work securely from anywhere, you need a
tool and a platform that's super easy to use. A platform that everybody in the world
is comfortable using, a platform that's super easy to provision, a platform that's super
easy to administer.
And the cost of some of these, you particularly see in Asia, for example, where
there's a large, large professional workforce, almost all of them use mobile as their
primary platform because they don't use laptops and desktops much. And we've got
large, large clients there, hundreds of thousands of employees overnight that
needed to be provisioned given access to these systems, and our platform makes it
trivial to do that.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Okay. I know we're coming up on time and I want to squeeze one more in, because I
want to take the opportunity to ask you about secular growth for the long-term. You
obviously talked to a lot of enterprise and SMB customers. Maybe just leave us with
your perspective of why are people shifting workloads into the public cloud and
bring it back to how you see Google Cloud speciﬁcally positioned against that
landscape?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
In the long-term, any technology shift is always driven by business priority. And that
business priority is digitization. Every company we talked to says, what I learned from
the pandemic that I'm taking forward with me is, can I drive a digital customer
interface, if I'm a bank, and people are not going to come to my branch, how do I
reach my customer online and oﬀer them capability. And so, the long-term trend is
basically driven by that.
Small and medium enterprises fall in two diﬀerent ﬂavors. That are those that don't
have -- they're not a technology company. And so, they want more end-user shrink
wrap product. We oﬀer that. And then, there are digital companies, the startups that
they called, where they're basically a technology company and they want us to give
them the technology that powers Google and all our services, they want to use the
same and we oﬀer that through a cloud.
Large enterprises obviously is an ecosystem play because they need their IT
organization, typically, they have system integrators. Sometimes, they've outsourced
to managed service providers that they work with. So bringing that ecosystem along
helped us also get into the large enterprise base, but we've been very focused these
last three years. Obviously, we're very pleased with the results we've shown and
demonstrated, and we remain very conﬁdent about our future as a real player in
cloud computing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
