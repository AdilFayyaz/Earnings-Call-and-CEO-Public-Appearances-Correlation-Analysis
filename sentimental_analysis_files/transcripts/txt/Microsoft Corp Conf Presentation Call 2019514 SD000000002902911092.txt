Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you. So much for joining us here at the
conference. I am Mark Murphy, software analyst with JPMorgan. And it is a great
pleasure to have with us today, Kirk Koenigsbauer, from Microsoft. Kirk, thank you so
much for being here with us.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Thank you. Excited to be here.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
And we're going to be talking about one of the most exciting, fastest-growing
products for Microsoft, which is called Microsoft 365. Kirk, why don't we start oﬀ with
your background?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Sure. So my name is Kirk Koenigsbauer. I've been with Microsoft since, gosh, 1991. I
spent a little bit of time at amazon.com for about four years in the middle of all that. I
run our Microsoft 365 business, which is inclusive of Oﬃce 365, our Enterprise and
Mobility Suite, a Security suite as well as Windows 10 in the Enterprise and a bunch
of other stuﬀ.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So I think people are familiar with Oﬃce. They're familiar with Windows. They're
probably a little less familiar with the whole suite of products, which you areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14

Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Kirk Koenigsbaueroverseeing now. Can you give us a little bit of an overview of Microsoft 365 and just
how it ﬁts into the overall Microsoft portfolio?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Sure. So Microsoft 365 is a product that we launched just about two years ago. As I
mentioned, it is a product that includes many products that you may have heard of
before. But essentially, the cloud productivity versions of them. We think of Microsoft
365 as sort of the world's productivity cloud. And so again, it includes all of the value
that you would ﬁnd in Oﬃce 365. So for example, all the Oﬃce apps, SharePoint, a
new product that we've launched called Microsoft Teams, Exchange Online and so
forth. It includes this Enterprise Mobility and Security suite, which has a number of
diﬀerent workloads within that around management and security and compliance.
And then of course, it has Windows 10 as a core part of the oﬀering as well. And we
sell this as a part of our -- essentially what we call our modern workplace sort of go-
to-market, which is really centered around productivity and collaboration.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So can you help us frame up the growth opportunities that we may be looking at
here with Microsoft 365? I think we've noted that the Oﬃce 365 commercial revenue
line, which is a very, very large one, has been growing over 30% recently, pretty
incredible given the scale of that. Windows is going well. EMS is going well. How do
we want to think about the broader opportunities here with Microsoft 365?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No. It's a good question. So essentially, the way I would start to frame it is we are
repivoting our whole approach in terms of selling productivity and collaboration
value to customers with Microsoft 365. It has all of these workloads in it. It is the way
that we organize our sales force when we go to market. It's the way that we organize
our partner incentives, our channel incentives. It's the way that we're increasingly
organizing our R&D and our engineering and how we make investments, not in a
sort of siloed way in any individual product in these regards. But literally thinking
about the whole system across Microsoft 365 to deliver that integrated value.
In terms of how we think about growth, this is a product -- you mentioned the 30%
growth on the Oﬃce 365 component, I think we're up to about 800 million active
users on Windows 10. We just crossed 100 million seats sold of EMS. And so the sort
of substats underneath are really quite impressive. We did -- we have about 180
million people monthly active in the commercial space of Oﬃce 365. So there's a ton
of momentum there, which is just, for me, working on the business for so many years,
is just really great to see.
When we think about the growth prospects, in many ways, it's a lot like we think
about the growth of -- or we used to talk about the growth of Oﬃce 365. It's
essentially a play that is a P x Q business. We look at the installed base of sockets.
We constantly want to look at how we can grow that socket pool. Then we look at
how we can increasingly drive the ARPU for all those sockets that we have. On the
socket side, from a growth perspective, certainly, we're well positioned in the
enterprise and in corporate space. But we still see room to expand seats in thoseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerbusinesses primarily as we think about entering markets like regulated industries
that we have historically had challenges selling into. Now with the sort of cloud and
unit economics of Microsoft 365 and so forth, we're able to reach pockets of users
that we hadn't been able to sell to in the past.
SMB is a very, very important socket growth market for us. We see lots of white space
there, wide open space for us to drive more sockets, more cloud sockets overall.
Then the last area on the socket side that I would say is big growth area for us is how
we think about ﬁrst-line workers, a category of workers that historically, again, have
been underserved by technology. They might be in manufacturing. They might be
retail sales professionals. They might be in hospitality. They might be in certain
segments of health care, even ﬁnancial services, where it's -- they're not tethered to a
desktop machine. They don't have their own dedicated laptop. Maybe they're on a
shared device. We have opportunity there to reach those customers as well. Then on
the ARPU side. And we've talked about this before, we have the opportunity to then
move these customers up the stack in terms of value. And so whether it's moving
from on-prem to cloud as sort of that ﬁrst step, that's an ARPU driver for us given the
LTV that we derive from those customers, to then selling increasing tiers of service
within Oﬃce 365 or within Windows and then getting them to Microsoft 365. So we
see quite a bit of growth on both of those dimensions with this new oﬀering.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So you've talked a lot, Kirk, about building modern experiences. You've talked a lot
about security in the past. You've talked a lot about compliance in the past. I think it's
apparent to us that there's a lot going on here in the componentry of this stack.
Where do you see Microsoft's core diﬀerentiation today?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. So putting aside the workloads that you referenced. And we can certainly jump
back to those, I think there's a few things that customers talk to us about in terms of
diﬀerentiation. One is the integration value in the sense of, for sure, customers don't
want to go to just one single vendor. But the opportunity to have all of these
workloads on a common platform from a management perspective, from an
interoperability perspective, from a broader TCO perspective, all this stuﬀ just works
better together. That is increasingly an important diﬀerentiator for us. And by the
way, it's not just at the Microsoft 365 level. When we think about security and how
fragmented that business is, we see CSOs and sec ops really valuing that notion of
integration, which is a key one.
Another value prop that has been resonating for us, particularly on the enterprise
side, is the position that we've taken around data privacy and trust. And increasingly,
with all the sort of things that are happening in the world today, that's a message
that's resonating really quite well. And so we've beneﬁted from our investments in
work around GDPR and other regulations that you see sort of happening all over the
world. Customers trust, whether it's public sector customers or of course, large
organizations, they trust our hyperscale cloud infrastructure and the work that we're
doing there. And that's a big deal.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerAnother big diﬀerentiator that we are seeing increasingly is around data and AI. And
as we -- I'll just pick security as one example. When you think about all the signal
that's out there in the world, all the security signal that we have, whether it's coming
through our e-mail system, whether it's coming from our identity system, whether it's
coming from the variety of diﬀerent end points that we have, being able to look at all
that signal and reason over that with our AI capability and our investment that we
have in security professionals at Microsoft, that is a diﬀerentiator in and of itself. And
so for a number of these reasons, let alone the work we are doing with products like
Teams you referenced on the experience side, the work we're doing in security, the
work we're doing in compliance, those are some of the things that we hear from
customers.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
I want to come back to Teams in just a moment. Before we do that, I wanted to
mention that -- so my team attended your Build conference last week, incredible
amazing event. Satya spent quite a bit of time talking about the Microsoft Graph.
And I think this is something that has really captured our attention. Can you explain
to us what is Microsoft Graph. And then how is it going to be leveraged across
Microsoft 365?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Great. Yes. Maybe I'll start with what it is and then what it does. What it is. So
basically, the Microsoft Graph you should think of as an API into a database that sits
in our cloud service. It's secure. It's tenant-based meeting. The data is only available
to that customer. It's secure. It's their data. They get to do what they want with it. But
essentially, think of it as a collection of all of the activity that people do inside of the
organization, whether it's their collection of emails and the meetings and the tasks
and the people that go to those meetings. We have essentially a graph of all of that
activity. Then on top of that sort of raw information, we also derive insights on top of
it. So for example, if you and I aren't spending as much time as we used to spend
before, that's information that we can derive. Or if one organization within a
company is doing a better job at collaboration than another, those are insights that
we can just derive from that graph.
And so this is a pretty powerful capability that's available to customers, both in the
sense that we can use the graph for our own ﬁrst-party experiences. A good simple
example would be the Microsoft search that we have. Microsoft search is a great
example of an app that uses -- that we built, that uses the graph on the back end,
where I can search for people, content, apps in my infrastructure, whatever I might
need, all of that is really provided to me via the graph. But what's also really
interesting is the ecosystem that's building up around the graph, whether it's ISVs
that build solutions that they want to sell into businesses. And those solutions can be
made better by accessing graph information. One example, I think, that Satya used
to build was SurveyMonkey, where if a company wants to do a bunch of surveys, they
can better target their population of people by integrating their tech with the
Microsoft Graph to have it be more precise. Or for that matter, even just building a
simple line of business applications, integrating them into experiences like Microsoft
365, they can use that graph data to make those experiences better for their people.
Those are some of the ways that we think about the graph.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14

So this is something that's leverageable for both your corporate customers as well as
these third-party app providers, third-party developers?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
That's correct. I want to be really crystal clear that it's the company's data. And I
should say, the customer's data. And only if the customer says yes, this ISV app can
plug in and access the graph, they can use that data. But that is the model. It's
something that's available for ISVs and something that they can use on their own.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. Now I want to come back to Teams now. You mentioned this a moment ago. It
appears to be making great progress, something we've heard when we have gotten
out and done our checks and interviews with your ecosystem, with your partners,
your resellers, the SI ﬁrms, they are telling us that when Teams goes in, they will see a
few months later that the seat count is doubling, tripling, quadrupling. Satya said
something about it's the fastest-growing app that he can ever recall seeing. He said
that last week at Build. How do you see Teams, ﬁrst of all, diﬀerentiating? And
secondly, how do you see Teams competing against companies like Slack and
Zoom?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
For sure. So starting with the diﬀerentiation piece. And maybe I'll also talk just a little
bit about what it is, in case, everyone is not familiar with it. Teams is a product that we
launched, or I guess it just hit its 2-year anniversary as a product that went general
availability in March. It's a product that brings together a number of diﬀerent
workloads to help people in organizations communicate and collaborate. Think of it
as a hub for teamwork essentially. And the teams can be really of any size, you can
be a participant in many diﬀerent teams. A core part of the value proposition of this
oﬀering is that it provides a number of diﬀerent workﬂows integrated into a single
experience.
And so, for example, it's got collaboration capability. It's very conversation-oriented
from that perspective. You've got chats. And you can use bots and you can integrate
content with that. It's got meetings capability. So you can host a meeting like this.
You can do ad hoc one-to-one meetings. You can do things like record meetings.
You can do audio conference meetings. There's a lot of meetings capability that's
built into the product. It has capabilities to communicate as well, not just using chat
and so forth. But through phone system technology. So if I wanted to call a customer
or call my wife, call a cellphone number, it has PSTN services integrated, there's a
dial pad and so forth. There's a bunch of work we're doing with third parties to
create Teams-oriented hardware devices, whether they're for meetings, for
conference calls, whatever, what have you.
Then also, we've integrated the Oﬃce applications into Teams. And when I say the
Oﬃce apps, I don't just mean Word, Excel or PowerPoint, those are, of course,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14Q - Mark Ronald Murphy

Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerintegrated into the experience. But also things like OneDrive for storage or
SharePoint. You can literally take a portal page, an Internet page. And you can
include it, you can integrate it right within Teams. It's super, super easy to do those
sorts of things. Power BI dashboards, analytics, all that can be wired into Teams.
And so this sort of 4-in-1 combination is a pretty powerful diﬀerentiator for us
because customers will tell us, yes, I might have some legacy meeting solution or I
might be using Slack or some other solution. But the idea of being able to come in
and oﬀer a single tool for end users that's integrated, where all of these diﬀerent
workloads are coherent across them, is really quite a diﬀerentiator for us.
Another diﬀerentiator that we've really seen, again, the product is only just a couple
of years old. But in the last, I would say, 6 to 12 months, we've been super
enthusiastic about how customers are responding to the scaﬀolding that Teams
provides to integrate line of business processes and workﬂows into that experience. I
referenced, for example, ﬁrst-line workers earlier. That's one use case. But we're
seeing companies, again going back to the graph that we talked about a few
moments ago, using graph data, integrating their line of business applications.
Sometimes, those business applications can be, say, built on Azure. But they front-
end them inside of Teams. Those experiences can also be front-ended with things
like Power Apps as well. And this is a really great experience for customers because
you could have this notion of these horizontal workloads, the ability to be able to just
do a meeting. But then simultaneously have that line of business application or that
business process integrated right into that experience. And so it's super, super sticky.
It's a much cleaner environment because everything is integrated into one space.
And customers are really resonating with that.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So it sounds like this is the core diﬀerentiation, is the comprehensiveness, the
integration points. Oﬃce is woven in with this. Graph is woven in with this. I presume
Cortana is woven in with all of this.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, I would say one other piece that I didn't mention that's important is the
enterprise-grade capability around it, whether that's again the fact that we operate in
data centers worldwide, the fact that we've added DLP types of capability, things like
ethical walls, the sort of security and compliance around the Teams infrastructure is
one, where companies love it because it's got this great sort of new experience for
end users that they love. But then also, it's something that can be controlled and
managed in a way that works for that business.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Now is this going to be one of the hooks for pulling enterprises into your premium
SKUs like the E5 SKU? Maybe you could talk to us about how the customer
conversations are shaping up around E5 or even E3?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Kirk Koenigsbauer
Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerSure. Well to the ﬁrst part of your question, we do see Teams as something that will
help us drive that sort of ARPU growth over time, in the sense that, as you mentioned
earlier in our conversation, once people start -- organizations start using Teams, we
do see usage rates increase dramatically across the board, not just Teams. But Teams
pulls through all this other Microsoft 365 value. And that's a good thing for a couple
of diﬀerent dimensions. One, of course, is that the more people that are using the
products, the more satisﬁed people typically are. Retention and rates are -- renewal
rates are higher and so forth. But the really great thing about it is as it helps us with
that up-sell approach as we look to sell higher tiers of service, which then would
transition me, I guess, to the conversation around E5.
E5, for folks that don't know much about it, is essentially -- well, I've chased the fact.
When we sell Microsoft 365 or Oﬃce 365 or EMS components, even Windows, we
have diﬀerent tiers of service, E1, E3, E5. On Microsoft 365, we have these 2 tiers. The
E5 set is the premium set of value that we oﬀer for customers. There are essentially 4
core workloads that are there. There's a workload around security. There's a
workload around compliance. There's a set of workloads around communications.
And there's a set of workloads around analytics. And the value proposition around
all of these is interesting to diﬀerent customers at diﬀerent times depending on
where they are in their life cycle. I would say, right now, in terms of driving growth of
E5, security and compliance are the top conversations that customers want to have.
Security's just so top-of-mind for every customer that we go and talk to. They want to
hear about Teams and they want to hear about security. And that's got a lot of pull
for us in the enterprise.
You referenced E3. We still have a lot of room to go in moving customers, whether
it's in on-prem to cloud, to that E3 tier, or from Oﬃce 365 E3 to Microsoft 365 E3.
And so that's another ARPU driver for us essentially. And we still see that as having
legs. So again, going back a little bit to the ﬁrst part of your question, whether it's a
socket play or the ARPU play, we feel like there is good growth opportunity here.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So you would put Teams and security in the kind of 1 and 2 position, or maybe you
can interchange them. Those are both critically important in terms of driving the
gravitation upward toward E3 and E5?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
For sure. Absolutely, yes.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. It's just interesting that Teams would be in that context already at this early
point.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. It might not be -- it may be not intuitive initially. But again, if you think about it as
something that is driving just incredibly rapid usage inside of accounts, that in and ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14

A - Kirk Koenigsbaueritself lays the foundation upon which you can go and drive that up-sell to higher tiers
of value.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. So switching gears a little bit, there was a very interesting announcement in
the past week or 2. It was a partnership between VMware and Microsoft. Clearly,
something signiﬁcant happening there. And it did have some very speciﬁc
references both to Microsoft 365 and Oﬃce 365. So I want to make sure that we're
kind of thinking through what that's going to mean speciﬁcally for Microsoft 365 and
the portfolio of products that you oversee.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
You bet. So for -- ﬁrst, I guess, I would say. And you referenced Build earlier, one of
the key messages that we wanted to lay into Build. And we've been really, since with
Satya's leadership, I think, in particular, doubling down on the notion of
interoperability and the notion of openness, we want to do super well in the industry.
But we also want to create a platform that other companies can integrate with. And I
think Scott had mentioned at Build, just over half of the VMs on Azure, as an
example, are running Linux these days. So the shape of the company has really
changed from that perspective.
The relationship that we've just announced with VMware, we're excited about.
There's sort of 2 components to it. One is around Azure, which is essentially helping
customers move from their on-prem environment, if they're using VMware tech, in
hybrid ways to Azure, which is fantastic.
On the Microsoft 365 point to your question, there's sort of 2 related things that are
happening there. One is with the workspace one product, that product can now
manage the Oﬃce applications on mobile devices, devices like these, Android, iOS
and so forth. And also integrate in with Azure Active Directory for things like
conditional access, conditional access being a really foundational sort of security
capability. In other words, if I've never been to Boston before and I'm logging in with
my device, we can sort of detect, oh, that's a diﬀerent place that Kirk has been to,
let's actually throw up a multifactor auth or something along those lines. That's some
of the kinds of scenarios that VMware will now be able to participate in with
Microsoft 365.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. Again, going back to some of our survey work, we have been seeing in recent
months that there's a lot of feedback about EMS, growth and adoption of EMS, very
strong momentum for EMS. Can you maybe talk about how the mobility and security
are ﬁtting in as part of this broader Microsoft 365 conversation?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Sure. Sure. So it's a -- so EMS, the Enterprise Mobility and Security suite is a core
component of Microsoft 365. Think of it as the -- one of the 3 legs of the stool
essentially. And for folks that aren't aware, EMS essentially has 4 core workloads as aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerpart of that suite. There is a workload around identity. And identity is just so core
today, particularly from the security perspective, although there are also other
important ways that identity is used in organizations. But with sort of perimeter-
based security sort of a thing of the past and identity and sort of 0 trust identity with
Azure Active Directory, our service, is very, very core to the EMS value proposition.
There's also a value proposition around management. There's a management plane
that EMS provides. It uses technology that we have called, Intune, for managing a
wide range of devices on iOS and on Android. There's also a part of EMS that I
referenced around security.
So in addition to identity, there's a bunch of security value that's a part of EMS,
whether that's protecting those Azure Active Directories, the people within those
directories, threat protection capability, cloud apps security capabilities. So for
example, an organization can understand all the SaaS usage that's happening inside
of its perimeter or inside of its boundaries and can put policy against those and so
forth. Then on the compliance side, EMS also is a very, very important element of
how we protect customers' information with something called Azure Information
Protection as a part of that solution.
So there's a number of diﬀerent workloads there. The growth -- the business model
is such that it's obviously high-attached to Oﬃce 365 and then of course, Microsoft
365 all up. But increasingly too, we see EMS sold stand-alone as well, which is good
to see again for its identity and security value proposition. I referenced earlier we just
crossed 100 million licensed users for EMS. So it really -- that's doubling year-over-
year, more than doubling year-over-year. So really, really strong growth rates with
EMS, a very important battle for us.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. Impressive, 100 million. So let's continue down that path a bit. You're getting
into the domain now of security. And this is a topic we've heard Satya and others at
Microsoft spending a lot more time on. I think there is a notion out there in the
marketplace that this whole world of security spend for the typical company is
maybe an area of ineﬃcient spend. Perhaps, there are too many point solutions, too
many companies charging a little too much money in the security arena. So how is
Microsoft -- if we kind of zoom back and take a 30,000-foot view, how is Microsoft
thinking about security? And maybe how is that going to ﬁt into this, again, Microsoft
365 conversation?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Sure. Well taking a step back, it is an area, we think, that has a lot of opportunity for
some of the reasons that you referenced, which I'll get to. From the customer lens,
what we hear over and over again is it is just the #1 risk or blocker that they have to
achieving this notion of digitally transforming their business. They want to move to
cloud. They want to move to these SaaS apps. They want a variety of diﬀerent
devices that their employees can use for whatever task that they're working on. But
at the end of the day, they really are quite concerned about the risk on the security
front. So that's why this is such a hot topic is that it is that thing that's getting in the
way to their digital transformation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 14Q - Mark Ronald Murphy
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerAnd so the other piece as you referenced in the space is that this is a hard category
in the sense that there are just simply not enough security professionals in the world
to keep up with the sorts of cyber threats that are out there. We -- as you referenced,
it is highly, highly fragmented. There are hundreds, thousands of apps that are out
there. They're all -- many of them are very, very narrow in terms of what they do.
Many of them are also on-premises-based. They're not native cloud-based solutions.
And so this is a space that we see as really ripe for us to tackle. And we're making
major investments in this space across the board.
I referenced EMS and how important that is. When we think about security, we really
think across the board in terms of, again, identity. We think of end point, end point
security meaning across all these diﬀerent devices, whether it's Defender on, let's
say, on the Windows platform, which we're taking, by the way, across platform to
Mac and others over the course of the next year.
We think about information protection again as another important part of the story.
Compliance always comes into these conversations as well. And so it's not that we're
just talking. When we think about security, super broadly, it's not that we're not just
talking to CSOs and sec ops. But we're literally starting to have more and more
conversations with Chief Risk Oﬃcers, Chief Compliance Oﬃcers, Chief Legal
Oﬃcers, CFOs and so forth, that are super, super invested in the information
protection of their content within their organization.
And so we're investing big time in these spaces. Again, it's tough to say what's 1 and
2. Typically, whenever it's about the end-user conversation around Microsoft 365,
that's all about Teams. Then when it comes to infrastructure, customers care about
management, they care about interop, they care about a lot of things, they really,
really care about security. And that's, ﬁrst and foremost, what they will want to talk to
us about.
I would just mention brieﬂy. And we announced this recently, there's a lot of work
we're doing on the sort of end-user compute side with Microsoft 365. But Azure's
also investing deeply in this space as well. And so, for example, the Azure Sentinel
product that we announced at the RSA Conference a few months back, that's a great
example too of a space that is largely on-prem, fragmented, really ripe for

Yes. It's -- you should almost think of it -- most simply, think of it as, again, cloud-
based, think of it as a tool that allows a CSO, sec ops people generally to be able to
look across their infrastructure, all the signals that they have, to be able to identify
threats across, again, literally all of their diﬀerent security systems. So it's something

because it's early. But also really enthusiastic about what the opportunity is.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
So Microsoft is going to tackle security across all levels of the stack. And from the
core of the data center out to the endpoint. And it's going to be something that is
extremely overarching. It sounds like pretty well thought out.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. We hope so.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. Let's move on. I want to touch on Windows 10. I know this is an important topic
for people. In our work, I think we have been trying to assess when would be the
peak of the actual activity for the typical enterprise that's going to be in this motion
of upgrading and moving their environment to Windows 10. Their feeling is that, that
the peak of this kind of migration activity is coming up sometime soon. It's coming
up in the next kind of few months, a handful of months. How do you view this
opportunity to kind of drive additional customers to adopt Windows 10 if they
haven't already done that?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No, you're right in terms of the context. We're within a year of Windows 7
reaching its end of support. Then within really 12 to 18 months -- by the way, Oﬃce
2010 reaching end of support. And so that's creating a real nice tailwind for us and a
really important need for customers to get current, to get modern on the desktop,
with both Windows and with Oﬃce. And so on the Windows side, speciﬁcally to your
question, I'd say we're probably roughly halfway through the sort of upgrade cycle
that's there. There's quite a bit of room and work left to go do. But this is really
important to customers. It's really important to us from the perspective of not just
having the latest and greatest value that is in Windows. But also to our conversation
that we were just having, it's lower TCO, it is a more secure operating environment.
We can do more with customers if they're on Windows 10 in terms of adding
additional security value on top of that.
So this notion of getting current has both these end-user beneﬁts. But is also really
important in terms of the infrastructure itself. And the way customers are
approaching this is that some customers, of course, will upgrade existing machines.
Many will buy new Windows 10 machines on the refresh cycle. But the next 12
months will really be quite a bit of activity in the space.

Kirk, if you were me, how much would you be thinking about growth versus the PC
market in this point in the cycle?

A - Kirk KoenigsbauerYes. We don't share too much on this. I would say folks should expect our growth
rate to be in line with the market essentially. Performance over the last couple of
quarters is sort of consistent with that.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
We have about 5.5 minutes left. Let's check with the audience now for questions, if
you would raise your hand. And we're going to get you a microphone from the back
of the room.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Is it lunchtime?
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Okay. A pretty packed room, in fact, we needed a room twice as big. But not a lot of
hands going up quite yet. Well we can come back to that, we can come back to that
in a moment. Let me try to ask you a ﬁnal one on a broad topic, innovation, future
investment. We've heard Satya now talking he's been using this term "tech intensity."
I feel like he might have coined that one.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
I think he did.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
The notion that companies are just going to -- increasingly, they're going to have to
adopt software technology to kind of maintain a competitive edge, if you will. He has
spoken about how that's going to be -- this is kind of what's driving Microsoft today
and into the future. If we go back to the last earnings call, Amy was talking about
investing pretty aggressively in this upcoming ﬁscal year, ﬁscal '20, to try to capture
the opportunity. How do we want to think about Microsoft 365, right. And how it
plays into this notion of innovation and future investment?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No. It's a good one. I would go back to what we chatted about a little bit. When I
think about the top 2 things we're hearing from customers that they're interested in,
it really gets around how can they create these sort of modern experiences for their
end users. And Teams is at the forefront of that. And we are shifting more R&D
resource to Teams. We are increasing the number of sellers that we have on Teams
and folks that do customer success around it. We're working in the channel to make
sure we have these incentives aligned properly and are recruiting partners to build
the kinds of ISV solutions and so forth. So there's a huge investment around Teams
across the board on so many diﬀerent dimensions. It will be a really big 12 to 18
months for Teams, I think.
Security, we talked a little bit about sort of a similar proﬁle. We're investing quite a
bit in the security space from R&D through sales and channel and partner andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14

A - Kirk Koenigsbauerinvesting quite a bit there. There are other investments that we're making as well.
Those are the top 2. But I would highlight things like we were just talking about. It is
an important year for modernizing the desktop. And the Windows 7, end of support,
the Oﬃce 2010, end of support, that is all within the sort of next ﬁscal year, next 12 to
18 months of growth for the company. Again, that's important for customers. It's also
important for us to get customers modern. It allows us to do a better job of up-
selling to higher tiers of service and so forth.
There's a lot that we're doing in the AI space underneath all of the investment that
we talked about. Every single one of these products is beneﬁting from AI. And the
opportunity to use AI to make these products better, to make them more relevant, to
help people with automation, everything from automation to decision-making to
insights, to identifying threats on the security side, to helping lawyers with
eDiscovery processes, reducing the cost of those, all using AI is sort of really front
and center to what we're doing.
I referenced a couple of examples of things that we're quite bullish on. The idea of
delivering within Teams or using Power Apps or the Power Platform, these industry-
speciﬁc line of business solutions. I really think there's something that's going to be
quite important here that happens over the next 12 to 18 months. As companies lay
down this infrastructure for Microsoft 365 by wiring in their business process, their
workﬂows into that, that's going to be something that's going to deliver more
business value than we've ever been able to really do before in terms of just sort of
laying down vanilla infrastructure for collaboration. And I think that's going to be a
big deal. So there's a ton of stuﬀ.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
I'm going to check one last time for -- okay. Now we have a lot of questions. We got
one of them from far back.
How much functional overlap do you see between Teams and e-mail? Said another
way, to the extent people use Teams, how much less do they use e-mail?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. It's a question that comes up a bunch. So far, they are diﬀerent products in terms
of the problems that they're trying to go and solve. E-mail, Outlook, in combination
with Outlook and Exchange Online and so forth, that's going to be around for a long
time. People use it as sort of a ubiquitous way to reach sort of -- whether it's anyone
inside an organization or anyone outside of an organization. Our growth rates, in
terms of usage for e-mail, they continue to go up. They continue to increase year-
over-year, not at the rates that we're seeing the growth of something like Teams. But
we expect e-mail to be around for a long, long time.
With Teams, the use case is a little bit diﬀerent. Teams is really designed around how
you work, how an individual works with the broad set or collection of Teams that they
are a part of. And so in my work environment, I have -- I'm probably a member of, IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-14

A - Kirk Koenigsbauerdon't know, 40 diﬀerent Teams that I participate on. And there's a conversation sort
of ongoing all the time about any of those. And I can sort of use Teams to sort of tick
through those and stay current and share content and information. Teams is, in many
ways, more of a hub. It's much more of a hub, I should say, for teamwork, whereas
Outlook is much more of a sort of pure communications-oriented tool,
communications and calendaring and so forth. But then we're doing more and more
of it, where you can get notiﬁcations through e-mail of Teams activity. We show you
your calendar information inside of Teams for meetings and scheduling. There's
quite a bit of integration.
We talked a little bit earlier about bots as an example. We have sort of a write one-
spot approach, where you can write a bot that shows up in Teams, it can show up
inside of Outlook. So there's going to be increasing integration. But we do think of
them essentially as 2 diﬀerent use cases.
{BIO 17750249 <GO>}
Very well said. Apologies. We have multiple questions now. But we have just run out
of time. Kirk, I want to thank you very kindly for sharing the vision and these insights
and spending this time with us.
