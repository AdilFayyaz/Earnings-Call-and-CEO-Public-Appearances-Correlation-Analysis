Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla' 2020 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. Really excited that you could be here with us today. My name is Al
Prescott, I'm Tesla's Vice President of Legal.
There'll be two parts of today's meeting. First, the formal part of the meeting we'll
get out of the way, which will cover the seven items that stockholders have been
asked to vote on. After the voting, I'll introduce Tesla's Co-Founder and CEO, Elon
Musk, who'll give a presentation about the company update and year-end review.
And then following the conclusion of the stockholder meeting, we'll start our
separate Battery Day event.
At this time, I'd like to thank the members of the Tesla team and our Board,
especially those who are able to make it out here in-person today as well as through
our representative from PricewaterhouseCoopers, Tesla's Independent Auditor, who
is also here. But before we begin, I'd like to introduce you to Robyn Denholm, the
Chairwoman of Tesla, who would like to say a few words remotely.

Page 2 of 54Thank you, Al. Hello everyone, and welcome to the 2020 Tesla' Shareholder
Meeting. A special welcome to the many Tesla shareholders that have joined us
today in-person as well as online from across the country and around the globe. I
wanted to start today's proceedings by thanking you, our shareholders for your
tremendous support over the last year, and especially to those of you who have
been with us through our journey over the past 10 years since the company's IPO in
2010.
While we stayed true to our mission of accelerating the world's transition to
sustainable energy.In many ways, our company has evolved beyond recognition
over the past decade, and that is a great thing. In fact, the pace of developments and
the evolution of Tesla has further accelerated over the past 15 months since I last
addressed you in June of 2019. You'll hear more about many of the speciﬁc
achievements from Elon later in the agenda.
But I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Tesla employees across
the globe, who have done a tremendous job of executing and staying focused on
delivering for our customers and shareholders as world has gone through one of the
most challenging periods in our lifetimes. As a Board, we have always taken a long-
term view. We have made decisions and supported decisions made by the
management team that may not have seemed obvious at the time, but are delivering
and will continue to deliver breakthrough results.
But it's also important to remember why we do this. As a company, we are focused
on addressing one of the biggest environmental challenges of our generation, how
to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy? The last year in particular
has seen a tremendous increase in momentum in the movement to sustainable
energy from both shareholders and the general public. So in addition to developing
amazing clean transportation and energy products, we are doing our part by
contributing the right facts and information to this important issue. And we released
an extended version of our Impact Report in April of 2020.
In this year's version, we have covered in great detail many areas that are important
to our shareholders and our customers alike, such as our environmental impact,
greenhouse and other noxious gas elimination, our supply chain eﬀorts, especially in
cobalt, and our culture and people focus. We hope that by continuing to put this
data out there, we will underscore to the world the importance and impact that we
are having as a company.
Lastly, continuous feedback and input from our shareholders is essential for us to do
our jobs. And I would like to thank you for your support in this regard. Many of you
have provided me and the team with ideas and insights that we as a Board take into
consideration as we evolve our governance and company practices. It's especially
crucial to the Board members as we pride ourselves in adaptability and the diversity
of thought and experience that we collectively represent on the Board.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Alan PrescottThis brings me to my ﬁnal two things today. As today is his last Shareholder Meeting,
on behalf of the Board, I would like to sincerely thank Steve Jurvetson for over a
decade of service to Tesla, the Board, and our shareholders. You will be missed.
Finally, I would like to introduce to you our newest member of the Board, Hiro
Mizuno, who until recently led the largest pension fund in the world. He brings a
wealth of experience to the Board, but let me hand over to Hiro to say a few words.

Thank you, Robyn. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Tesla Annual Shareholders
Meeting. It is my real pleasure to virtually meet you, Tesla's shareholders, people
who believe in Tesla's mission, and its growth opportunities. I spent all my career in
ﬁnance and asset management in Tokyo, New York, London and Silicon Valley.
Until recently, I was a Chief Investment Oﬃcer of GPIF, a $1.5 trillion Japanese public
pension fund. And one of my priorities as an Investment Chief was to promote
responsible investments, which aimed to make ﬁnancial returns while pursuing ESG
agenda such as environment and social issues. I believe in the market where ESG is
becoming mainstream, purpose for a mission-driven businesses will gain long-term
investor support. This is why I was interested in Tesla, where mission is to accelerate
the world's transition to a sustainable energy.
I'm very exited to join the Tesla team on the journey, and hope to assist Tesla deliver
what investor expect, while further enhancingit's environmental and social impact.
Once again, Tesla shareholders, thanks for your support. I'm looking forward to
seeing you in-person next year. Thank you.
{BIO 22242369 <GO>}
Thanks, Robyn and Hiro. I will now call the meeting to order. Please refer to the
meeting agenda that has been provided to you, and posted also to our virtual
meeting site. The time is now 1:49 p.m. Paciﬁc time, and I declare that the polls are
now open.
We've already received voting proxies from stockholders over the past few weeks,
meaning that, almost all of the votes that will be counted were already submitted
before the meeting. However, if you wish to vote now or to change your prior vote,
you may do so through the virtual meeting site. For those that are here in-person
today, ballots and ballot boxes were available to you at check-in.
Tesla's Board of Directors has appointed Computershare Trust Company to serve as
Inspector of Elections for the meeting. Computershare has taken and signed an oath
as Inspector of Election and has certiﬁed that starting on August 13, 2020, the proxy
material or a notice of Internet availability of the proxy material were mail or
provided to all Tesla's stockholders of record as of July 31, 2020. We have a majorityFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 4 of 54Unidentiﬁed Speakerof the outstanding shares represented at the meeting. So I declare that there is there
is now a quorum present and that we may proceed with the meeting.
The items on the agenda are as follows. The election of three Class 1 Directors, Elon
Musk, Robyn Denholm, and Hiromichi Mizuno to each serve for a term of three years.
Two, to approve Tesla's executive compensation on an advisory basis. And three, to
ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla's independent
registered public accounting ﬁrm for the ﬁscal year 2020.
Tesla's Board has recommended that our stockholders vote for each of the Director
nominees and for each of those proposals. In addition, we have also received four
stockholder proposals as described in the proxy statement. I would like to remind
our stockholders that Tesla's Board has prepared a statement in opposition to each
of these proposals which appear in the proxy.
The ﬁrst stockholder proposal is an advisory vote regarding paid advertising. Our
Board has recommended that our stockholders' vote against this stockholder
proposal. This stockholder proposal comes to us from James Danforth. However,
Mr.Danforth has notiﬁed us that neither he nor his representative will be presenting
the proposal at the meeting today. So we will continue.
The second stockholder proposal is an advisory vote regarding simple majority
voting in our governing documents. Our Board has recommended that our
stockholders' vote against this stockholder proposal. The proposal comes from
James McRitchie who is on the line to present the proposal today.
Mr.McRichie, I would like to invite you now to present. You will have three minutes.
I'd like to thank the Board for holding such an innovative hybrid meeting during
these diﬃcult times. Proposal number 5 basically asks for a majority voting standard
to amend by law. I ﬁrst introduced a proposal on this subject at the 2014 Tesla
Meeting. Supermajority provisions are generally used to entrench incumbent
Directors and Managers. Academic research ﬁnds that reducing such devices is
associated with higher returns.
The Board's opposition statement argues they tried to adopt a majority standard last
year, but shareholders rejected. However, 99.6% of shares voted for the proposal,
only 0.4% voted against it. The problem was that a little more than 35% of shares
went unvoted. The vast majority of retail shareholders often don't bother to vote.
Since only 65% of shares were voted, we didn't achieve the 66.67% necessary to
overturn the current supermajority by law.
It appears, the proposal failed primarily for three reasons, one, the Board put forth
less than robust arguments in favor. Two, they added confusion with another
proposal to reclassify the Board not into a single class, that's the norm, but into twoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 5 of 54Alan Prescott
Kristin Hullclasses, elected in alternate years. Third, the Board also failed to make a substantial
eﬀort to solicit votes in favor.
Also, please consider this proposal in context with other poor corporate governance
provisions at Tesla. First, shareholders can only remove directors for cause. What that
basically means is the Director has to be caught in criminal activities for shareholders
to remove. Second, because the Board is divided into three classes of shares,
shareholders can only hold individual directors accountable every three years. And
third, shareholders cannot call a special meeting nor can act by written consent. I
hope you will agree, Corporation should not be democratic-free zone. Vote for
proposal number ﬁve, so that 33% of shares cannot overrule the wishes of 67%.
Thank you.
{BIO 22242369 <GO>}
Thank you. Mr.McRitchie. We'll now move on to our third stockholder proposal,
which is an advisory vote regarding reporting on employee arbitrations. Our Board
has recommended that our stockholders vote against this stockholder proposal. This
proposal comes from Nia Impact Capital, who's representative, Kelly Hull, is online to
present the proposal today.
Ms.Hull, I'd like to invite you to go ahead and present. You have three minutes.
{BIO 17968835 <GO>}
Hello, my name is Dr.Kristen Hull and I'm the Founder and CEO of Nia Impact
Capital. As formerly noted, this resolution requests that Tesla's Board of Directors
overseen the preparation of a report on the impact of the use of mandatory
arbitration on Tesla's employees, and on a work side culture. A report will evaluate
the association of Tesla's current use of arbitration with a prevalence of both
harassment and discrimination at workplace, and on employees' ability to seek
justice, should harassment or discrimination occur.
This proposal speaks to the widespread experience of discrimination in the
workplace by Black, Latinx and female employees. Despite this discrimination being
unlawful under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Tesla has faced a number of serious
allegations of racism and sexism at its Buﬀalo and Fremont plant. Companies that
allow biased discrimination and harassment in the workplaces are at risk for
unnecessary, legal, brand, ﬁnancial and human capital issues.
Support for this resolution is warranted for the following ﬁve reasons. One, research
shows that companies beneﬁt from diverse and inclusive workplaces. Two, corporate
policies that allow harassment and discrimination risk investors capital. Three, the
use of arbitration exposes investors to an unknown level of risk. Four, broad
concerns exist with respect to fair treatment in Tesla workplace and Tesla's
employees have alleged harassment and discrimination on the basis of both face
and gender.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 6 of 54Alan Prescott
Terry CollingsworthTesla, a company investors love for its innovation, leadership and wide love is
increasingly lagging behind its peers in its disclosures of latest workplace diversity,
equity and inclusion. Unlike the forward thinking and innovation in its extraordinary
product volumes, Tesla has not shown proactive leadership and building a positive
company culture or in addressing concerns about its workplace practices.
And these material issues crossed a line behind its technology and automotive
competitors. The use of arbitration limits employees remedy for wrongdoing,
precludes employees from suing in court, and often keep underlying facts,
misconduct or case outcome secret, therefore preventing employees from learning
about and acting on shared concerns.
Simply stated, arbitration allows bad corporate behavior by biased harassment and
discrimination to continue hidden from employees and investors. To maintain Tesla's
wide mode, it is essential that the Board seriously assess the implications of the use
of arbitration, and that Tesla begins to take seriously the need to ensure a fair,
equitable, positive and inclusive workplace. Thank you.
{BIO 22242369 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms.Hull. Our fourth and ﬁnal proposal is an advisory vote regarding
reporting on human rights. Our Board has recommended that stockholders vote
against this proposal. This proposal comes to us from the Sisters of Good Shepherd,
New York province, whose representative Terrence Collingsworth is on the line to
present today.
Mr.Collingsworth, I would like to invite you to speak now. You have three minutes for
your proposal.
Thank you. I'm Terry Collingsworth, Executive Director of the international rights
advocate. I'm here representing the Sisters of Good Shepherd, New York province to
present Item7 on human rights disclosure, which calls upon Tesla to issue a report to
describe Board oversight of human rights and its human rights due diligence
process, including systems to provide meaningful remedies when human rights
impacts occur. Tesla faces serious human rights issues and failure to establish a
culture of respect for human rights. We'll expose Tesla to new liability issues and
signiﬁcant reputational injury, all of which will have a material impact on the
company and its shareholders.
The need to set a new course for human rights compliance at Tesla is glaring. Here
are ﬁve examples of human rights violations occurring now in Tesla's operations.
Racism, sexual harassment, and disregard for human safety and dignity harm
workers at the Gigafactory-2 in Buﬀalo, New York every single day, and those
workers urge you to remember their experiences in your vote.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 7 of 54Alan PrescottTesla has experienced serious labor relations issues at his production facilities and is
actively discouraging union organizing. Workers are being exposed to COVID-19 and
then are facing retaliation when they ask for greater protections. There are numerous
worker health and safety violations, as well as wage in our issues. And ﬁnally, there
are serious, even deadly human rights violations occurring in Tesla's global supply
chains.
On this last issue, my organization brought the pending suite against Tesla for using
Cobalt, mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo by young children. I personally
met young boys who lost limbs or were paralyzed in Cobalt tunnel collapses. Tesla
sources Cobalt from these very mines and it's claimed to have quote zero tolerance
for child labor in its supplier code of conduct is simply not true. Tesla is not only
tolerating child labor in its Cobalt supply chain, it is tolerating the death and
maiming of young child miners. This demonstrates why the company must circle-
back and begin a process to report on his treatment of human rights issues as
requested in this proposal. I think consumers will have zero tolerance for a company
that is exposed as being indiﬀerent to killing and maiming child miners.
We are hopeful, the Tesla's innovative spirit can be brought to bear on making
human rights a priority at the company. For example, if Elon Musk cared about
implementing a zero-tolerance child labor policy, instead of having a useless paper
policy, Tesla could employ satellites or drones at every mine it sources from to
actually monitor child labor. I encourage all Tesla shareholders to vote for Item7
human rights disclosure. Thank you for your attention.
{BIO 22242369 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr.Collinsworth. At this time, I'd like to thank our stockholders for all of
their active participation in today's meeting and for those who just presented on the
line. I'd also like to read some of the comments that have been submitted by you
over the course of the meeting.
First comment comes from Michael Overbaugh. I take great pride in the fact that we
haven't had to stoop to the level of what advertising represents to get where we are
today. I'd hate to get into that kind of temptation now. When we're so close to
becoming a household name that's based solely on our merit alone. But if assets do
end up having to be set aside for marketing, I'd like to suggest that rather than
shoving ads down the customers throats, we establish some sort of hardcore
nationwide campaign and event with the goal of getting as many people as possible
behind the wheel of a Tesla for an introduction drive. It's well-known how far just
doing that alone goes to converting people into fans. Aline, I recently ran across
says, you can talk all the specs as much as you want, but when it comes to buying a
car, what ultimately puts butts in seats is the feeling of the vehicle gives you. By
demonstrating, the Tesla clearly has both the specs and the feeling, what more
needs saying.
Our second comment comes from the United Steelworkers on behalf of the Clean
Air Now, Coalition of Western New York by Sabrina Lu. Proposal -- and it reads asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 8 of 54Elon Muskfollows. Proposals 6 and 7 up for vote this year are the results of widespread concern
about mistreatment of Tesla workers at U.S. factories and across the supply chain. It is
clear that Tesla is not interested in addressing the harm they have caused to their
workers as their board is advising shareholders to vote against the proposal.
We're urging all shareholders to vote in favor of proposals 6 and 7 and on behalf of
our workers at the United Steelworkers here in Western New York and for Tesla
employees across the country and across the global supply chain. While this doesn't
repair the harm that's already been caused to countless employees, no repair. Harm
to children and communities forced into slave labor in the DRC. They represent steps
towards a more just workplace in Tesla.
This concludes all the comments. Thank you all for your participation in the
comments. We'll now have a ﬁnal opportunity for any of you to submit proxies in
order for them to be counted. So I'll pause and wait for a moment for you to do that.
Okay. I declare that the polls are now closed. So based on the proxies that we have
previously received, I'd like to announce on a preliminary basis that our stockholders
have approved the recommendations of Tesla's Board on all agenda items other
than the stockholder proposal for an advisory vote regarding simple majority voting
in our governing documents. After the ﬁnal tabulation is completed, we will formally
announce the results of the voting by forming -- ﬁling a Form 8-K with the SEC within
four business days of today. This now concludes the oﬃcial business of Tesla's 2020
Annual Stockholders Meeting, which is now adjourned.
Next, we will have a company update and a year-end review presented by Elon. And
then, we will start our Battery Day event. During the course of those following
sessions, we may discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking
statements. Such statements are predictions based on our current expectations.
Actual events or results could materially diﬀer due to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including those disclosed in our most recent 10-Q ﬁle with the SEC.
These forward-looking statements represent our views as of today. They shouldn't be
relied on after today and we disclaim any obligation to update them after today as
well. We will now continue with the company update and year-end review. And it's
my pleasure to introduce Tesla, Co-Founder and CEO, Mr.Elon Musk.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Hi, everyone. Well, I mean, this is deﬁnitely a new approach. We have the Tesla drive-
in movie theater basically. It's good to see everyone. It's a little hard to read the room
with their own being in cars, but it's the only way we could do it. So hopefully it's
cool and hopefully, you can hear me. Can you guys hear me? Okay. All right. Great.
Well, thanks for coming.
I think it's been an incredible year and I'd like to thank you for your support through
tough times, good times, it's been great. Really appreciate everyone who's put their
hard earned money into Tesla. And I think it's worked out pretty well as this has been
a good year and I think, there's many good years to come. So I'll go through the sortFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 9 of 54of -- the shareholder presentation fairly quickly because the sort of real main event
here is Battery Day. So, and then really I'm just going through a recap of what's
happened over the past year or so.
Starting from yeah in terms of our ability to create a factory, just the huge kudos to
Tesla Shanghai team for being able to go from literally a direct pile to volume
production in 15 months. It's like -- So and I think something that's really quite
noteworthy here is, Tesla is the only foreign manufacturer to have 100% owned
factory in China. So this is often not well understood or not appreciated. But to have
the only 100% owned foreign factory in China is a really big deal and it's paying
huge dividends here. So we really wouldn't have the results that we have had this
year without the great eﬀorts of the Tesla China team. So I'm super appreciative of
that. And we'll see the Shanghai factory continue to scale quite a bit from where it is
right now. I think we really could expect that to be overtime a factory that produces
over a million vehicles a year.
Yes, it's cool. So, let's see. So probably we also reached in the past year of volume
production of the Model Y and this was the smoothest launch that we've ever had.
So I think we're deﬁnitely getting better at new vehicle launches and building
factories and scaling production. As you've heard me say before it's -- the hardest
thing is scaling production especially of a new technology, it's insanely diﬃcult;
making a prototype is relatively easy. And if I think of like, what is the real
achievement of Tesla in sort of car company terms? It's like it wasn't making sort of
exciting prototypes, it was that Tesla was really the ﬁrst company in about a century
in the U.S. -- the ﬁrst U.S. company in the U.S. to reach volume production and be
sustainably proﬁtable like those -- the crazy thing is, this is really not happened in
100 years, that's the actual super hard part. And we now have four vehicles in volume
production S3XY. So also the toughest joke, I think maybe ever. It was a very diﬃcult
joke to make.
So we also introduced the lowest cost solar in the U.S. it's only $1.49 a Watt. And we
really just simpliﬁed the whole chain of -- the whole value chain. So reduced sales
and advertising. We got rid of a bunch of unnecessary costs and really are just
relying upon the fact that it's just the lowest cost most eﬃcient solar in the U.S.,
providing both retroﬁt and the solarglass roof, which I think is a really great product.
A hard product to make work that will be a major product line in the future.
And we also got four consecutive quarters of GAAP proﬁtability, which is -- was very
diﬃcult, yeah. So it's certainly a testament to the hard work of people at Tesla. I mean
to do this in extremely diﬃcult times against a wide range of adverse circumstances
was insanely hard, but we got it done. So and I think we've -- the future is looking like
I think very promising from a sort of an annual proﬁtability standpoint. So in order to
achieve -- in order to sort of do well ﬁnancially, you really need economies of scale,
and you need ideally the best technology and I think we have the best technology
for a while, but now we are also achieving economies of scale. So and also rapidly
improving autonomy, which is a massive value add to each car.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 10 of 54So, I think the value of Tesla is going to be like total just on the vehicle side, total
vehicles produced, times the value of autonomy. That's a way to think about the
future value of Tesla. We also have consistent free cash ﬂow generation. This is really
important for growth and a key element here is tightening up the time from when a
car is ordered to when it is built and delivered. So, for a company that's growing
rapidly, it's extremely important to tighten the supply chain and to have from when --
from when parts arrive, put it into a car very quickly and deliver the car very quickly
to the customer, and if you can do that inside the sort of your kind of a payables
timeline. Then, the faster you grow, the more cash you have or conversely, if you're
unable to do it within your payables timeline, the faster you grow, the less money
you will have which is obviously bad as for capital-intensive situation.
So, just tightening up and having the parts moved very quickly to the factory, put it in
a car, get it to a customer, makes a massive diﬀerence to cash ﬂow generation. And, I
mean, that's why it's extremely important to have a factory in each continent,
because you don't -- at least have a factory in the continent. It is impossible to
achieve this. So, having a factory in China, that's able to serve China and then soon
many other countries in the region will be a key to us tightening that total sort of
chain or cash ﬂow and getting essentially the faster we grow, we'll have more cash.
This is really important. That's also why it's important to have Giga Berlin complete
because then we'll have a factory in China, a factory -- factory in the U.S., and soon, a
second factory in the U.S. in Austin and a factory in Europe.
And I mean, even if for the -- for Giga, Texas in Austin, even if we had exactly the
same classes in California, it would still be advantageous to do it there because it's
roughly two-thirds of the way across the U.S.
So, we can -- in terms of delivering cars to the Central U.S. and to the East Coast is far
-- it's just faster, it cost less and it fundamentally improves our economics. So, I think
this is also maybe something that's not fully appreciated. Just how important it is to
have a factory at least on the continent or reasonably close to where the end
customers is, so you can tighten that whole chain.
Industry performance -- while the rest of industry has gone down, Tesla has gone up.
I think this speaks to -- thanks.
And so, I'd like to thank all the customers for taking a chance on Tesla and buying
our product and really hope you're enjoying it. This is really -- our sales as I was
saying really grow by word of mouth. So, this is really I think a very pure -- it's very
pure in the sense that it's like it's growing on the basis of existing owners
recommending it to other -- to new customers. This is really I think a good way to
grow.
So in 2019, we had 50% growth and I think, we'll do really pretty well in 2020,
probably somewhere between 30% to 40% growth despite a lot of very diﬃcult
circumstances. I mean, there's so many pandemic wildﬁres, it is like a whole bunch of
diﬃcult production issues, but thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team and a lot ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 11 of 54innovative approaches to overcoming issues. We are able to still see some good
growth in one of the most diﬃcult -- in fact, I'd say probably the most diﬃcult year of
Tesla's existence.
So, and we also published our extended impact report. At Tesla, we try very hard to
do the right thing. If I think does not happen it's just because we may be made a
mistake or we're not aware of it, but we always try to do the right thing as to the best
of our ability and then we publish the extended impact report to show just to sort of
a self-examination of okay what are we doing right? What are we doing wrong? What
can we do better in the future? We're deﬁnitely trying to accomplish the most good.
And so, if we occasionally make mistake, we work quickly to ﬁx it and do the right
thing.
So, it's worth looking at like the average like stuﬀ -- average life cycle emissions in
the U.S. and just how much better a Tesla is than -- or electric car than any other -- of
any kind of gasoline car? And what we'll talk about in the Battery Day is also just how
much the grids around the world and actually especially in the U.S. are greening. It's
actually much faster than I think people realize. The U.S. is moving towards
sustainable energy. And so, as we move more and more to sustainable energy, then
eﬀectively you end up building the solar factories and the car factories themselves
with solar. Over time you do or sustainable energy, over time you even mine with
sustainable energy and eventually it will get to an eﬀective emissions of zero. So
that's where things will end up.
So, we also have safety at the core of our design. The Tesla cars are the safest cars
ever designed. We have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by
the U.S. Government and that's just passive safety when you add active safety into
that. It's even better. So, it's really -- if safety is important to you, which obviously it is,
the safest car you could drive is a Tesla. So, I think people sometimes -- some people
aren't aware of this but it's really -- safety is paramount. It is actually the number one
design objective when we built is Tesla safety.
Our factories are also becoming safer. And if you look at the sort of accidents per
vehicle -- total vehicle made, its dramatically better than in the past and it's already
better than industry average and we're conﬁdent we can get it to the best in the auto
industry.
Autopilots functionality continues to improve and you can see it in the safety report
that we publish every quarter. It's just getting better and better. The U.S. average for
collisions is roughly 2.1 per million miles and with autopilot engaged, it's 0.3. I mean,
this is a profound diﬀerence. It really massive and this will get even better. So, we're
conﬁdent that over time, we can get the probability of an accident, especially
probability of injury to 10 times better than the than the industry average like an
order of magnitude better. So, that's just a lot of lives saved and a lot of injuries
avoided. So that's a huge priority for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Page 12 of 54And yes on the autopilot front, I think it's kind of hard for people to judge the
progress of autopilot like I'm driving -- as a matter of course, I've always done this. I
drive the bleeding edge alpha build of autopilot. And so I sort of have insight into
what is going on and previously about a couple years ago, we're kind of stuck in a
local maximum. So, we're improving but like the improvements kind of started tailing
oﬀ and not and just not getting where they need to be. We're quite close to getting
trapped in a local maximum and so we had to do a fundamental rewrite of the entire
autopilot software stack and all of the labeling software as well.
So, we're now labeling in 3D video, so this is hugely diﬀerent from the previously
where we were labeling essentially a bunch of single images from the eight cameras
and they would be labeled at diﬀerent times by diﬀerent people and some of the
labels you literally can't tell what it is you're labeling. So, it basically made it sort of in
some cases impossible to label and the labels had a lot of errors.
Now with our new labeling tools, we label it in video. So we actually label entire
video segments and the system -- so you get that basically a surround video thing to
label and with the surround video and with time -- so it's now taking all cameras
simultaneously and looking at how the images change over time and labeling that.
And then, the sophistication of the neural nets in the car and the overall logic in the
car has improved dramatically.
I think, we will hopefully release a private beta of autopilot of the full self-driving
version of autopilot in I think a month or so. And then people will really understand
just the magnitude of the change, its profound. So, yes, anyway, so there's you'll see
it's just like a hell of a step change, but because we had to rewrite everything
labeling software, but just entire code base.it took us quite a while.
The sort of new sort of I call it like 4D in the sense that it's three dimensions plus
time. It's just taken us a while to rewrite everything, and so you'll see what it's like. It's
going to be -- it's amazing. Yeah. It's just clearly going to work.
At Tesla, the core competencies, we've got engineering, obviously, but also
manufacturing. I think manufacturing is underappreciated in general, and the
diﬃculty of designing the machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the
machine itself. So the designing, like making a Model 3 or Model Y or Cybertruck
prototype is really quite trivial compared to designing the factory that makes it,
especially if it's new technology, and you want to use new manufacturing methods.
It's just at least 10 to 100 times harder to do the factory than the prototype. And
that's why you see a lot of companies out there or startups they'll bring out a
prototype, but they just can't get it over the hump for who manufacturing, because
manufacturing of new technology especially is the hardest thing by far. Basically, the
prototype is at best 10% of the diﬃculty and probably closer to 1%.
And then software. Tesla is both a hardware and a software company, so a huge
percentage of our engineers are actually software engineers, and you can think of
our car as kind of like a laptop on wheels and so software is incredibly important.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Elon MuskActually, not just in the car, but also in the factory. So the factory software is
extremely important. Just software in general. I mean, these are fundamental. These
are the three critical areas that are needed to make for an awesome company. So,
yeah.
So we have --now, we'll soon have three new factories incremental on --well, we have
one already on three diﬀerent continents. Shanghai, we're expanding the Shanghai
with the second phase. Berlin is making rapid progress, and Texas is making even
faster progress. So, yeah. With each factory, what we're trying to do is also improve
the manufacturing technology, so in some cases like the Model Y made in Berlin
might look the same, but it actually is made in a much more eﬃcient way. Yeah, we'll
talk about that later in the battery presentation.
Yeah, we launched Megapack. It's three megawatt hours all-in one energy storage
solution, so it's been great overall. Yeah. All right. And I think that's basically it, right?
All right, thank you. All right.
Well, thanks, everyone, for coming, and we'll be back in a little bit to go through the
battery stuﬀ, and there's a little bit more. In addition to the battery stuﬀ, we've got a
few extras as well. So I think you'll really like what we have to say on batteries.
The battery stuﬀ we're going to talk about is truly revolutionary and essential to
Tesla's goal. The fundamental good of Tesla, it's like, if you look back in history and
say, what good did Tesla do? The good will by how many years did we accelerate
sustainable energy? That's the true metric of success. It matters if sustainable energy
happens faster or slower, and so that's really how I think about Tesla and how we
should assess our progress. By how many years did we accelerate sustainable
energy? And what we're going to talk about with batteries and a few other things will
really explain how we're going to make a step change improvement in the
acceleration of sustainable energy. Thank you.

So obviously, the issues we are facing are very serious. With the climate change and
we're experiencing these issues on a day-to-day basis. It's incredibly important we
accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. Time really matters. This presentation is
about accelerating the time to sustainable energy.
So, the past ﬁve years were the hottest on record. We have what looks like a wall for
CO2 PPM. It's obviously, this time is not like the past. It's really important that we take
action. Running this climate experiment is insane. So --

Andrew D. BaglinoOkay. So there is a lot of good news though. A lot of people may not be aware that
that wind and solar comprise 75% of new electricity capacity in the U.S. this year. So
this is really major. So the grid is going sustainable very quickly. Now, it's also worth
noting that the length of time that power plants lasts is on the order of 25 years. So
even if a hundred percent of energy generation was sustainable, it will still take 25
years to convert the grid. And it's also worth noting that in the past 10 years, power
production from coal has dropped in half. So it went from 46% of electricity in 2010
to 23% in 2020. So this is a massive improvement. So good things are happening on
a lot of levels. We just need to go faster.
So Tesla's contribution, we've delivered over a million electric vehicles, 26 billion
electric miles driven, and many gigawatt hours of stationary batteries, 17 terawatt
hours of solar generated. So I think solar is sometimes underweighted at Tesla, but it
is a massive part of our future. The three parts of sustainable energy future are
sustainable energy generation, storage, and electric vehicles. So we intend to play a
signiﬁcant role in all three.
So to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, we must produce more EVs that
need to be aﬀordable and a lot more energy storage, while building factories faster
and with far less investment. So goal number one is a terawatt hour scale battery
production. So tera is the new giga. And a terawatt is a thousand times more than a
gigawatt. So we used to talk in terms of gigawatts, in the future, we'll be talking in
terms of terawatt hours. So this is what's needed in order to transition the world to
sustainability.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes, and you can see it's a -- we're talking about 100x growth in batteries for electric
vehicles to achieve this mission and we are going to get there. Just a matter of how
fast and our intention is to accelerate it.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, basically on the order of roughly 10 terawatt-hours a year of battery production
to transition the global ﬂeet of vehicles to electric.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And the average vehicle last 15 years. So, we're talking about a 150 terawatt hours
give or take to transition the whole electric -- all vehicles of all types to electric.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, so it's a lot of batteries basically. And yes, so --

Elon MuskAnd then on the grid side, we have a similar mountain to climb. 1,600 times growth
from today's grid batteries to go 100% renewable on the grid and to take all the
existing heating fossil fuel uses in homes and businesses, a 100% electric.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, and this number I think, I might grow even more dependent -- as the world
economy matures and as countries with high populations industrialize, we could see
this number be even more. But let's say it's like roughly 20 to 25 a terawatt hours per
year, sustained for 15 to 25 years to transition the world to renewable. This is a lot.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So today's batteries can't scale fast enough, they're just too small. For Giga Nevada,
150 gigawatt hours per year is like what we probably expect to make out of there.
But this is really pretty small in the grand scheme of things, that's only 0.15 terawatt
hours. And it cost too much, so --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
We would need 135 fully built out in Nevada Giga factories to achieve 20 terawatt-
hours a year. It's not scalable enough of a solution, we need a dramatic rethink of the
cell manufacturing system to scale as fast as we can and should.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes and I think we should view this as more than just a question of money. Money is
sort of like an ethereal thing, but it's really the amount of eﬀort. You have a certain
amount of eﬀort in terms of people and machines and depending on how eﬃcient
that eﬀort is, for a given amount of eﬀort you want the most amount of batteries. So
it's not just a question of like, well, if we had $2 trillion, you -- tomorrow you could
make this, it's not that easy, you actually need to organize the massive number of
people, build a lot of machines, build the machines that make the machines and so
it's incredibly important to have that eﬀort, yield the most number of batteries.
So and then go to obviously we need to make more aﬀordable cars. I think one of
the things that troubles me most is that we don't yet have a truly aﬀordable car and
that is something that we will make in the future. But in order to do that, we've got to
get the cost of batteries down. We've got to make -- and we've got to be better at
manufacturing and we need to do something about this curve, this curve -- the curve
of the cost per kilowatt hour of batteries is not improving fast enough. So we have
given this a lot of thought over many years to say -- how can we radically improve
the cost per kilowatt hour curve. It's been somewhat ﬂattening out actually in recent
years. So --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

I mean, early growth was promising but you can we are kind of plateauing. So that's
what's motivating us to rethink how cells are produced and designed.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, exactly. So EV market share is growing but EVs are still aren't accessible to all.
It's -- and you can see it -- as Drew were saying it's like starting to ﬂatten out a little
bit because, the rate of improvement of the aﬀordability of cars is just not fast
enough. So that's why, we got Battery Day.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
To make the best cars in the world, we designed vehicles and factories from the
ground up. Next and now we do this for batteries as well.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. It's where the slides don't show up quite right -- look like what shows up there
(inaudible)
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
So let's get started. We have a plan to have the cost per kilowatt hour. And it's not a
plan that rests on a single innovation, some research project that will never see the
light of day, it's a plan that has taken creative engineering and industrialization
across every facet of what makes a cell into a battery pack from raw material to the
ﬁnish thing. And we're going to go through that plan with you today step by step
and build up how we get to these goals and how we accelerate this transition and
make our vehicles and our grid batteries more aﬀordable.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We're basically -- thought through every element of the battery -- almost every
element, there are a few more elements that we won't get to today, but we will get to
in the future.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. So ﬁrst before we get too far into it, let's talk about what is in a battery cell?
We've got the cap and the can, negative and positive terminals of the cell, when you
open that cell, you've got a tab connected to those terminals. What we call the jelly
roll, which is the wound electrodes on the inside. You can actually see what this looks
like as you unwind it, this is over a meter long in a typical 2170 cell, so it's quite a
long while winding process and you can see the tab is still there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Elon MuskAnd then to explain what's actually going on here, we've identiﬁed we've got anode,
cathode separator, positive and negative terminal, what should happens as we --
here we go. Discharge the cell, got lithium moving from anode to cathode and then
the reverse when we charge the cell, anode moving from -- lithium moving from
cathode to anode across the separator.
This is the basic of what makes all Lithium-ion batteries, whether they are -- no matter
what the form factor is. And when we look at what's happened today, at least in our
products, we've moved from 18650 form factor to the 2170 form factor through a
great collaboration with our partners Panasonic, new partners like LG and CATL and
probably others in the future.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Actually, a slight note on why is the one called 18650, although not on the slide, this
is the 2170 is that, the ﬁrst two digits refer to the diameter and the second two digits
refer to the length. So that helps explain why these -- what's up with these weird
numbers, but like nobody could explain to me while why there was an extra zero. So
I said, okay, well, we're deleting the zero, that nobody can explain in future form
factors. That's why it's technically it's like the 18650 bizarrely but going forward is the
2170, because we just got rid of the extra zero because it's pointless.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And this was evolutionary step going from 1865 to 2170, bringing 50% more energy
into the cell. But when we look to the ideal cell design if we were to do it ourselves,
we need to go beyond just what we're looking at us in front of us and study the full
spectrum of options. So as you can see, we kind of swept the key ﬁgures of merit.
How much we can reduce the cost and how much vehicle range increases, as we
change the outer diameter of the cell. We found a sweet spot somewhere around 46
meters -- it's in millimeters. But it's not just about a bigger form factor, like anybody
could make a bigger form factor.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Any fool, could make a bigger form factor, and we are not any fool.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes exactly. There are problems as you make cells larger, in fact supercharging and
thermals in general become really challenging as you make bigger cells and this is
the challenge that our team set our sights on to overcome. And we did. We came up
with this tabless architecture that maybe you've heard about. That basically removes
the thermal problem from the equation, allows us to go to the absolute lowest cost
form factor and the simplest manufacturing process. And this is what we mean when
we talk about tabless. It's kind of a beautiful thing.

Andrew D. BaglinoThat's what these t-shirts mean, but it's very esoteric as nobody could ﬁgure it out,
but --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes, we basically took the existing foils, laser pattered them and enabled dozens of
connections into the active material through this shingled spiral you can see with
simpler manufacturing, fewer parts, 50 millimeter versus 250 millimeter electrical
path length, which is how we get all the thermal beneﬁts.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, this is important to appreciate, like basically the distance that electron has to
travel and it's just much less. So you actually have a shorter path length in a large
tabless cell than you have in the smaller cell with tabs, so this is a big deal. So even
though the cell is bigger, it actually has more power, the power to weight ratio is
actually better than the smallest cell with tabs. This is -- again like this is quite hard to
do, so it's -- nobody's done it before. So -- and it really took a tremendous amount of
eﬀort within Tesla engineering to ﬁgure out how do we make a freaking tabless cell
and have it actually work and then connect that to the top cap and it's -- there's a
whole bunch of things that we're keeping a little secret sauce here that we're not
telling everything, but --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Sometimes, what's elegant and simple is still hard and we -- it took us a lot of trials,
but we're happy where we ended up.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I mean everything's simple in recollection, after you see -- everything -- it's hard
until it's discovered and then it's simple. So anyways, there's a lot of really cool
things going on that enable tabless and that's really -- due to really great
engineering team, Drew and the rest the of team done amazing work in achieving
this tabless construction. And it sounds -- I think it may sort of sound a bit silly to
some people, but this is like if -- people who really know cells, this is a massive
breakthrough.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}

{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Just to -- so elaborate on that a bit, it's like when the cell is going through the
system, it has to keep stopping where all the tabs are.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So you can't do a continuous motion production if you have tabs, you have to keep
stopping and then there's a rate at which you can start and stop and accelerate
again, and it really slows down the rate of production and then sometimes you get
the tabs wrong and you also get -- lose a little bit of active area. It's really huge pain-
in-the-ass type tabs from a production standpoint.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And so when we put it all together and go to our new 80 millimeter length,
4680 we call this new cell design. We get 5x the energy with 6x the power and
enable 16% range increase just form factor alone.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, it's pretty great. And just to clarify that when we see these plus 16% or whatever
the percentage range increases, these are the amounts due just to that particular
innovation.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So we'll list a whole bunch of innovations. And then when you add them up, you get
a total of improvement in energy density and cost, but these numbers are what refer
to just this thing.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And I want to stress. This is not just a concept or a rendering. We are starting to
ramp-up manufacturing of these cells at our pilot 10 gigawatt/hour production

Andrew D. Baglino{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. It's a video of some of what's going on in the plant. Now, I mean, it's very clear, it
will take about a year to reach the 10 gigawatt/hour capacity. So this is important to
appreciate, like when you build a factory, there's a certain capacity that you design to
and then it takes some period of time to actually achieve that capacity. So I would
say it's probably about a year before we get to the 10 gigawatt/hour annualized rate
with a pilot plant, and this is just a pilot plant. The actual production plants will be
more on the order of maybe 200 gigawatt/hours maybe more overtime.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And -- thank you. But let's stack up everything we just saw at the cell level. So just the
cell form factor change enables a 14% -- dollar per kilowatt hour reduction, just that
cell form factor change. And now that you've been teased on this factory, we're
going to go on and walk step by step through that factory and discuss a series of
innovations there.
When thinking about the ideal cell factory, we have inspirations behind us in the
paper and bottling industry, where from humble beginnings, over a century of
innovation has enabled mass scale continuous motion, unbelievably low
manufacturing cost. And when we think about the lithium-ion industry which is really
only in its third decade of high-volume production, it has so far to go to achieve
similar scale and simplicity, and that was the inspiration that we set out to the team
as we thought about how to marry cell design and manufacturing in the best
possible factory.
And let's talk a little bit about what's in a cell factory. First, there's an electrode
process where the active materials are coded into ﬁlms on to foils. Then those foil --
coated foils are wound in the winding process. We just talked about where if you do
have tabs, you have to start and stop a lot. Then the jelly roll is assembled into the
can, sealed, ﬁlled with electrolyte, and then sent to formation where the cell is
charged for the ﬁrst time and where the sort of the electrochemistry is set and the
quality of the cell is veriﬁed.
And we set out, at every step of this process, to try to take that inspiration we just
showed and think about how we make those processes fundamentally better and
more scalable. And one of the most important processes is where it all begins, the
wet process of the of the electrode coating. And just to give you all sense of scale,
I'm going to walk through what's in that wet process. You've got mixing where the
powders are mixed with either a water or a solvent, solvents for the cathode. That
mix then goes into a large coat and dry oven, where the slurry is coated onto the foil.
Huge ovens, tens of meters long, dried, and that solvent then has to be recovered.
You can see the solvent recovery system. And then ﬁnally, the coded foil is
compressed to the ﬁnal density.
And when you're looking at this, you're like wow, that's a lot of equipment for one
step, especially when you consider that little speck next to the coating oven is aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Andrew D. Baglinoperson. This is serious iron involved in making batteries. Wouldn't it be great if we
could skip that solvent step, which is one of those dig a ditch and then ﬁll the kind of
things where you put the solvent in and then take it out and recycle it, and just go
straight to dry mix to coat. And that's what the dry process really is about.
And in the most basic form, you can see it here on a bench top, literally powder into
ﬁlm as simple as that.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I mean it's hard actually. Just to be clear. So if this was easy, everyone would do it. So
the -- it's not like dry coating electrode is actually easy, it's actually very hard to do
what appears to be a simple thing, and it's worth noting. I -- we did acquire Maxwell
as like a little over a year ago I guess. And certainly a good company and everything,
but the dry coating that it had was like -- is like sort of I'd call it proof-of-concept.
Since the acquisition, we've actually ramped the machine that does dry coating 4x.
So when we revision full post acquisition of the machine and there's still a lot of work
to do. So I would not say this is like completely in the bag. There is still a lot of work
to do. And as you scale -- go from like benchtop to lab to pilot to volume production,
there are actually major issues that you encounter at every level. It's Not like you

{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean to be clear, I would like not to say that right now, it's just totally working.
It's close to working, but it's not -- even now, at the pilot plant level, it is close to
working. Well, okay, I think it's fair to say probably it does work, but with not a good -
- with not a high-yield.

Yes, so -- we're still ironing out the kinks, but we've made tens of thousands cells,
thousands of kilometers or electrode. I mean we are on the fourth generation of the

And together with our internal design team that makes this equipment and designs
this equipment, we coupled thinking about how to make the best cell, we're thinking
about how to make the best equipment so that we could accomplish the fastest
parts per minute rates on all of these tools. And through all of that development, we
were able to get to the point where we can implement assembly lines, one line 20
gigawatt hours, 7x increase in output per line. And when you're thinking about
scalability and pure eﬀort having one line be 7x the capability is just eﬀort
multiplying.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. You can sort of think about like the sort of the fundamental physics of a factory
or something like -- I think it's actually quite a lot like the rocket equation where
you've got basically -- there are equations you've got your exhaust velocity and then
the log of a start in masses. So it's basically saying -- how fast are things going and
what percentage of your -- the factory volume is doing useful work and conveyance
does not count as useful work. So --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Only the value added steps.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. If you could break the factory down into cubic meter sections and say -- or
smaller, it could be like one litter sections and say, is a majority of this volume doing
useful work? You would be astounded at how bad most factories are. They are like
maybe 2% or 3% including a factory in Fremont. So I think it is possible to get to at
least 10x that volumetric eﬃciency. So well like 30%-ish maybe more and be 10x
better, which means the factory can be 10x smaller. And then the other thing is how
fast are things going through the factory, it's like speed and density.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Elon MuskThe faster you go -- a factory that's moving, let's say twice the speed of another
factory is equivalent to two factories basically. And the company that will be
successful is because company that with one factory can accomplish what other
companies take two or three or four factories to do. So this is what we're trying to do
here is, say, okay, how do we with one factory achieve what maybe 5 or even 10
factories would normally be required to achieve.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And the vertical integration with the machine design teams at Grohmann and HIBAR
and others allows us to really accomplish that, because we don't have these edge
conditions between one piece of equipment and another, we can design the entire
machine to be one machine and remove all these unnecessary steps.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean basically Tesla is aiming to be the best at manufacturing of any company
on Earth. This is the thing that's actually most important in the long run. I think just
from a company standpoint and from basically achieving sustainability as fast as
possible, but I think also for long-term competitiveness, eventually every car
company will have long-range electric cars, eventually every company will have
autonomy, I think -- but not every company will be a great at manufacturing. Tesla
will be absolutely head and shoulders above anyone else in manufacturing, that is
our goal.

Manufacturing is hard and hard problems are fun.

Okay, now let's talk about formation. In a typical cell factory, formation represents
25% of the investment and what is formation. It's charging and discharging cells and
verifying the quality of the cell. Turns out we've charged and discharged billions and
billions of cells in our vehicles, so we know a thing or two about that. The typical
formation setup is you charge and discharge each cell individually in our car, we
charge thousands of cells at once. And we took our principal and our power
electronics leveraging powerwall vehicle battery management systems and others to
dramatically improve the formation equipment cost eﬀectiveness and density. 86%
reduction in formation investment, 75% reduction in footprint.

Elon MuskSure. So essentially what this translates to based on what we know today is about a
75% reduction in the investment per kilowatt hour or gigawatt/hour. It's just a
basically 4x better than the current state-of-the-art to the best of our knowledge. And
I think there's probably room to improve even beyond that.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Deﬁnitely.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Deﬁnitely, yes. So we're able to, from a volume standpoint, actually get what in a
smaller form factor than Giga Nevada, we were able to get many times the cell
output. So you can see like basically we can get a terawatt hour in less space than it
took to make a gigawatt hour, 150 gigawatt hours. So this is pretty profound, it's like -
- I would actually not have thought this was possible several years ago that we could
actually get to terawatt hours scale in less space than what we currently envisioned
for doing a 150 gigawatt hours.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes, simpler accelerates terawatt hours scale and that's what we need to do to
accelerate our mission. And as Elon said, we're going to try to even improve on this
as we push towards our goals which are --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. So this is just for -- this just talking about Tesla internal cell production. As I
tweeted out earlier, we will continue to use our cell suppliers, the Panasonic and LG
and CATL. And so this is a 100 gigawatt hours supplemental to what we buy from
suppliers. And yes, essentially this is like reduce our weighted average cost of a cell,
because -- but it does allows us to make a lot more cars and a lot more stationary
storage. And then long-term, we're expecting to make on the order of 3,000
gigawatt hours or 3 terawatt hours per year. I think we can -- I think we've got a good
chance of achieving this actually before 2030, but I'm highly conﬁdent that we could
do it by 2030.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
When you look at the size of that factory on the previous page, it really shows how
enabling all these advancements are and achieving a 3 terawatt hour goal by 2030.
And not only is all of that manufacturing innovation, fantastic for enabling scale, it's
also an additional 18% reduction in dollar per kilowatt hour at the battery pack level.

{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
So we have a manufacturing system. We've got a cell design. What are the active
materials we're going to put in that cell design. Let's talk about the anode ﬁrst. Let's
talk about silicon. Why is silicon awesome? It's awesome because it's the most
abundant element in the Earth's crust after oxygen, which means it's everywhere, it's
sand.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, sand is silicon dioxide.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And it happens to store 9x more lithium than graphite, which is the typical
anode material in lithium-ion batteries today. So why isn't everybody using it? The
main reason is because the challenge with silicon is that it expands 4x when fully
charged with lithium, and basically all of that expansion stress on the particle, the
particle start cracking, they start electrically isolating, you lose capacity, the energy
retention of the battery starts to fade and it also gums up with a passivation layer that
has to keep reforming as the particles expand.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}

happens.

Elon Muskscheme of things. Now, they're still great and they enable some of the beneﬁts of
silicon, they just don't enable all of it, and they're not scalable enough. And you can
see some of the things that maybe you've heard of SiO, silicon with carbon or silicon
nanowires, that's kind of the space right now. What we're proposing is a step change
in capability and a step change in cost, and what that really is, is you just go to the
raw metallurgical silicon itself. Don't engineer the base metal, just start with that and
design for it to expand , and how you think of the particle in the electrode des ign
and how you code it?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I'm not sure if you saw this is -- basically a dollar because ours -- basically if you
use simple silicon, it's dramatically less than even the silicon that is currently used in
the batteries that are made today and you can use a lot more of it.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
The anode would cost -- yes, with this silicon in the anode cost $1.20 a kilowatt hour.
And how does it work? Start with raw metallurgical silicon, stabilize the surface with
an elastic ion conducting polymer coating that is applied through a very scalable
approach. No like chemical vapor deposition, no highly engineered, high CapEx
solutions and then integrated in the electrode through a robust network formed out
of a highly elastic binder. And in the end, by leveraging this, the silicon to its
potential, we can increase the range of our vehicles by an additional 20% just this
improvement.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, it gets cheaper and longer range.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And when we take that anode cost reduction, we're looking at another 5% dollar
per kilowatt-hour reduction at the battery pack level and there's more. Let's talk
about cathodes. What is a battery cathode? Cathodes are like bookshelves where
the metal, the nickel, the cobalt, the manganese or aluminum is like the shelf and the
lithium is the book. And really what sets apart these diﬀerent metals is how many
books of lithium they can ﬁt on the shelves and how sturdy the shelves are. Cobalt is
a --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, sorry. I would just say like, it's such a exactly ﬁgure out what the right analogy is
to explain cathode and anode, but a bookshelf is probably a pretty good one in the
sense that you need a stable structure to contain the ions. So you want to structure
that does not crumble or get gooey or basically that holds its shape in both the
cathode and the anode. As you're moving these ions back and forth, it needs to
retain its structure. So if it doesn't retain a structure, then you lose cycle life and your
battery capacity drops very quickly.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Elon Musk{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Absolutely, yes, I totally agree. And I think people are always talking about like, oh,
what's the cathode going to be, is it NC or whatever, the thing to consider is just
fundamentally what the nickel -- the metals are capable of and that's what we have
on the chart here, $1 per kilowatt-hour cathode of just the metal, using just LME,
London Metal Exchange prices versus the energy density of just the cathode. And
you can see, nickel is the cheapest and the highest energy density and that's why
increasing nickel is a goal of ours and really everybody's in the energy -- in the
battery industry. But one of the reasons why cobalt is even used at all is because, it is
a very stable bookshelf, and the challenge was going to pure nickel is stabilizing that
bookshelf with only nickel, and that's what we've been working on with our high
nickel cathode development, which has zero cobalt in it, leveraging novel coatings,
and -- novel coatings and opens [ph]. We can get a 15% reduction in cathode $1 per
kilowatt hour.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, they do.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
But it's not just about nickel. You want to?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So in order to scale, we really need to make sure that we're not constrained
by total nickel availability. I actually spoke with the CEOs of the biggest mining
companies in the world and said, please make more nickel, it is very important. And
so I think they are going to make more nickel, but there's also I think we need to
have a kind of a three-tiered approach to batteries. So starting with iron, that's kind
of like a medium range and then nickel manganese as sort of a medium plus
intermediate and then a high nickel for long-range applications, like cyber truck and
the semi. Yes, something like a semi truck, it's extremely important to have high
energy density in order to get long-range. So -- and just to give sort of iron a bit
more time like the -- below the -- if you look at the watt hours per kilogram at the
cathode level of iron, it looks like nickel's twice as good. But when you fully
considered at the pack level, everything else taken into account, nickel is about
maybe 50% or 60% better than then iron. So iron is not is little better than it would
seem, where you -- when you look at it at the pack level fully considered.
It's not as good as nickel, nickel is like 50% to 60% better, but it's still -- it's actually
pretty good. And so, good for stationary storage and for medium-range applications
where energy density is not paramount, and then like I said for intermediate, it's kind
of a nickel manganese and it's relatively straightforward to do a cathode that's two-
thirds nickel, one-third manganese which would then allow us to make 50% more
cell volume with the same amount of nickel.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

And beyond the metals, because a lot of people spent time talking about the metals,
actually the cathode process itself is a big target, 35% of the cathode dollar per
kilowatt-hour is just in -- transferring it into its ﬁnal form. And so we see that as a big
target and we decided to take that on. Here's a view of the traditional cathode
process. Eﬀectively if you start if you start at the left and you have the metal from the
mine, the ﬁrst thing that happens is the metal from the mind is changed into an
intermediate thing called a metal sulfate, because that's just happened to be what
chemists wanted a long time ago. And then when you're making the cathode, you
have to take this intermediate thing called metal sulfate add chemicals, add a whole
bunch of water, a whole bunch of stuﬀ happens in the middle, and at the end, you
get that little bit of cathode and a whole bunch of wastewater and byproducts.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, it's -- insanely complicated. If you look at the total -- like, if you're just like, it's a
small will journey of I am a nickel, and so what happens to me and it's like -- it is
crazy. Like you're going around the world three times, there's like the moral
equivalent of like digging the ditch, ﬁll in the ditch, and dig in the ditch. It's total
madness basically. And these things just grew up as just that they're just kind of like
legacy things that -- it's like how it was done before and then they connected the
dots, but really didn't think of the whole thing from like a ﬁrst principle standpoint
saying how do we get from the nickel ore in the ground to the ﬁnished nickel
product for a battery. And so we've looked at the entire value chain and said, how
can we make this as simple as possible.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And that's what we're proposing here with our process. As you can see, a whole less
-- a whole lot less is going on here. We get rid of the intermediate, metal water, ﬁnalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Elon Muskproduct cathode, recirculate the water, no waste water at all. And when you summer
it -- summarize all of that, it's the 66% reduction in CapEx investment, a 76%
reduction in process cost and zero waste water; much more scalable solution. And
then when you think about the fact the now we're actually just directly consuming
the raw metal nickel powder, it dramatically simpliﬁes the metal reﬁning part of the
whole process. So we can eliminate billions in battery grade nickel intermediate
production, it's not needed at all.
And we can also use that same process in the previous page to directly consume the
metal powder coming out of recycled electric vehicle and good storage batteries. So
this process enables but simpler mining and simple recycling. And now that we have
this process, obviously we're going to go and start building our own cathode facility
in North America and leveraging all of the North American resources that exist for
nickel and lithium and just doing that, just localizing our cathode supply chain and
production, we can reduce miles traveled by all the materials that end up in the
cathode by 80%, which is huge for cost.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, to be clear cathode production would be part of our -- the Tesla cell production
plant. So just be -- basically raw materials coming from the mine and from raw
materials in mine, out comes a battery.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And on that note, the way the lithium ends up in the cell is through the cathode. So
then we should obviously on site lithium conversion as well, which is what we will do
using a new process that we're going to pioneer, that's a sulfate free process again,
skip the intermediate, 33% reduction in lithium cost, a 100% electric facility co-
located with the cathode plant.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. So it's important to note that there is a massive amount of lithium on Earth. So
lithium is not like oil, there's a massive amount of it pretty much everywhere. So in
fact there's enough lithium in the United States to convert the entire United States
ﬂeet to electric. It's like the all the cars in the United States, all -- like 300 million or
something like that, every vehicle in the United States can be converted to electric
using only lithium that is available in United States.

Yes, people have been trying, because this is like widely available. So -- but it is
important to say like okay, what is the smartest way to take the ore and extract a
lithium and do so in an environmentally friendly way? And we actually discovered a --
again looking at a sort of ﬁrst principles of physics standpoint, instead of just the way
it's always been done, is -- we've found that, we can actually use table salt, sodium
chloride to basically extract the lithium from the ore. And this is -- nobody has done
this before to the best of my knowledge; nobody's done this and it's a -- sort of all
the elements of reusable, it's a very sustainable way of obtaining lithium. And we
actually got rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Over 10,000 acres.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Over 10,000 acres. And then the nature of the mining is actually I think also very
environmentally sensitive, and that we sort of take a chunk of dirt out of the ground
or remove the lithium and then put the chunk of dirt back where it was. So it will look
pretty much the same as before, and it will not look like terrible, and yes, it'll be nice.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
So simply mix clay with salt, put it in water; salt comes out with the lithium, done.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, it's pretty crazy.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes, so we're really excited about this and there really is enough lithium in Nevada
alone to electrify the entire U.S. ﬂeet.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I guess that's true. Actually just what's in Nevada, that's basically so much damn
lithium on earth, it's crazy. It is one of the most common elements on the planet.

Elon MuskAnd eventually, as we said at the beginning, when we get to this steady state 20
terawatt hours per year of production, we will transfer the entire non-renewable ﬂeet
of both power plants, home heating and battery -- and an industry heating and
vehicles to electric. And at that point, we have an awesome resource in those
batteries to recycle to make new batteries. So we don't need to do any more mining
at that point and you can see why. The diﬀerence in the value of the material coming
back from the vehicle versus the ground, you'd always go to the vehicle.
And we recycle 100% of our vehicle batteries today, and actually we are starting our
pilot full scale recycling production at Gigafactory Reno next quarter to continue to
develop this process as our recycling returns.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I mean to date, it's been done by third-parties, but we think we can recycle the
batteries more eﬀectively, especially since we -- our batteries, we are making the
same battery as the thing we're recycling. So whereas like third party recyclers have
to consider batteries of all kinds?
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And just to think about what this actually means, the recycling resource is always
10 or greater years delayed, because batteries last a really long time. But eventually it
is the way that all resources will be made available, and that's why we're investing in
this recycling facility in Nevada.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Long-term, new batteries will come from old batteries, once the ﬂeet reaches
steady state, right?
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Okay. So we just talked about scaling cathode and recycling. All of the beneﬁts that
you just saw are added to this beneﬁt of 12% reduction in dollars per kilowatt hour at
the battery pack level, almost at our half the cost goal, but there's one more section.
Take it away, Elon.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So I mean there's an architecture that we've been wanting to your Tesla for a long
time and we're ﬁnally -- we ﬁnally ﬁgured it out. And I think it's the way that all
electric cars in the future will ultimately be made. It's the right way to do things. So it
starts with having a single piece casting or single piece casting for the front body
and the rear body. And in order to do this, we commissioned the largest casting
machine that has ever been made, and it's currently working just over the road at our
Fremont plant. We have the -- it's pretty sweet, making the entire -- currently making
the entire rear section of the car, as a single piece high pressure die cast aluminum.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 34 of 54And in order to do this, we actually had to develop our own alloy, because we
wanted a high-strength for casting alloy that not did not require coatings or heat
treatment. This is a big deal for castings.
Especially with a large casting, if you heat treated afterwards, it tends to deform. It
kind of like does this like potato chip thing? So it's very hard to keep a large casting
to have its shape. So in order to achieve this, there was no alloy that existed that
could do this. So we developed our own alloy, a special alloy of aluminum that has
high strength without heat treat and is very castable. So that's a -- it's a great
achievement of our materials team.
In fact in general, we've got a lot of advanced materials coming for Tesla that new
alloys and materials that have never existed before. So you are basically making the
front and rear of the car as a single piece and then -- that then -- interfaces to or call
it the structural battery where the battery for the ﬁrst time will have dual use -- or the
battery will -- both have the use as an energy device and as structure. This is
absolutely the way things are done.
In the early days of aircraft, they would carry the fuel tanks as cargo. So the fuel tanks
actually had -- were quite diﬃcult to carry. They are like basically worse than cargo.
You had to kind of bolt them down. It was very diﬃcult. And then somebody said,
hey, what if we just make the wing tanks? What if we just make the fuel tank in wing
shape? So all airplanes, the fuel tank -- your wing is just a fuel tank in wing shape.
This is absolutely the way to do it. And then the fuel tank serves as dual structure and
it's not -- it's no longer cargo, it's fundamental to the structure of the aircraft. This was
a major breakthrough. We're doing the same for cars.
So this is really quite profound. The -- eﬀectively the non-cell portion of the battery
has negative mass. So we save so much mass in the rest of the vehicle. We save more
mass in the rest the vehicle than the non-cell portion of the battery. So it's like, well,
how do you really minimize the mass of the battery? Make it negative, make the
battery -- non-cell portion of battery pack negative? So it also allows us to pack the
cells more densely, because we do not have intermediate structure in the battery
pack. So instead of having these like supports and stabilizers and stringers and
structural elements in the battery, we now have a lot more space in the battery
because the pack itself is structural.
The -- and what we'd do essentially, like what we -- like instead of having just a ﬁller
that is a ﬂame retardant, which is currently what is in the 3 and Y battery packs, we
have a ﬁller that is structural adhesive as well as ﬂame retardant. So it eﬀectively
glues the cells to the top and bottom sheet. And this allows you to do shear transfer
between the upper and lower sheet. Just like if you have like a Formula 1 craft or like
a racing boat and you have a carbon ﬁber face sheets and say aluminum honeycomb
between them, this gives you incredible stiﬀness. And that's really the way that any
super fast thing works is you create a -- basically a honeycomb sandwich with two
pace sheets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Page 35 of 54Andrew D. Baglino
Elon Musk
Andrew D. BaglinoThis is actually even better than what aircraft do, because aircraft do not do this. They
can't do this because fuel is liquid. So in our case, the batteries are solid. So we can
actually use the steel shell case of the battery to transfer shear from the upper and
lower face sheet, which makes for an incredibly stiﬀ structure even stiﬀer than a
regular car.
In fact if this was in a -- like a convertible that had no upper structure, it would be
stiﬀer, then that convertible would be stiﬀer than a regular car. So this is -- it just
really -- it's really major. So improves the mass eﬃciency of the battery and then
those castings are also quite important, because you want to transfer load into the
structural battery pack in a very smooth continuous way, so you don't put arbitrary
point loads into the battery.
So you have kind of that -- you want to sort of feather the load out from the front and
rear into the structural battery. It also allows us to use -- to move the cells closer to
the center of the car, because we don't have the -- in the top one, we got that sort of
all the supports and stuﬀ. So the volumetric eﬃciency of the structural pack is much
better than a non-structural pack and we actually bring these cells closer to the
center, and because they're closer to the center it reduces the probability of a side
impact potentially contacting the cells, because they have it has to go   in any kind
of side impact, it has to go further in order to reach the cells.
It also proves what's called the polar moment of inertia, which is that -- you can take
like when there's a like ice skater arms out or arms in, arms in, you rotate faster. So if
you can bring things closer things closer to the center, you reduce the polar moment
of inertia, and that means you can -- the car maneuvers better, it just feels better. You
-- don't know why, but it just feels more agile. So it's really cool. This is a really major,
I'd say, sort 10% mass production in the body of the car, 14% range increase, 370
fewer parts. So I mean, I really think that long-term, and any cars that do not take this
architecture, will not be competitive.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And it's not just at the product level a better product, but in the factory, it's a massive
simpliﬁcation. You saw the part removal, it's casting machine, it's the structural
battery pack. So we are looking at over 50% reduction in investment per gigawatt
hour, 35% reduction in ﬂoor space and we'll continue to improve that as we make
the vehicle factory of the future.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, so a major improvements on all fronts from the cell all the way to the vehicle.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}

improving the structural performance of the vehicle, it is worth another 7% dollar perFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

56% dollars per kilowatt hour.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
All right. So stacking it up, we're not just talking about cost or range, we've got to
look at all the facets. So range increase, we're unlocking up to 54% increase in range
for our vehicles and energy density for our energy products; 56% reduction in
dollars per kilowatt hour at the battery pack level and 69% reduction in investment
per gigawatt hour, which is the true enabler when we talk back about how do we
achieve this scale here.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. And yes -- so I think it's pretty nice that investment per kilowatt -- per gigawatt
hour reduction is 69%, I mean who would have thought?
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes, just happened to happen out that way.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I mean 0.420% of course. Yes. So what this enables us to do is achieve a new
trajectory in the reduction of cell cost. To be clear, it will take us probably a year to 18
months to start realizing these advantages and probably -- to fully realize the
advantages, probably it's about three years or thereabouts. So it's not like if we go to
these instantly we would, but it's really -- I think what this bodes? It just really bodes
well for the future and means that the long-term scaling of Tesla and the sustainable
energy products that we make will be massively increased. So what tends to happen
as companies get bigger, as things tend to slow down? Well, actually they're going
to speed up.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And they have to speed up if we're going to accelerate the transition to sustainable
energy.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean long-term, we want to try to replace about at least 1% of the total vehicle
ﬂeet on Earth, which is about 2 billion vehicles. So long-term, we want to try to make
about 20 million vehicles a year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

But I think it's important to point out that when we talked about 3 terawatt hours by
2030, the problem is a 20 terawatt hour problem. So everybody needs to be

What does it mean -- what does this mean for our future products? So we're
conﬁdent that long-term, we can design and manufacture a compelling $25,000
electric vehicle. So this has always been our dream from the beginning of the
company. I even like wrote a blog piece about it. Because our ﬁrst car was an
expensive sports car and it was like slightly less expensive sedan, and then ﬁnally
sort of a -- I don't know mass market premium, but -- like the Model 3 or Model Y, but
it really -- it is always our goal to try to make an aﬀordable electric car. And I think
probably like sort of about three years from now, we're conﬁdent we can make a very
compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that's also fully autonomous.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And when you think about the $25,000 price point, you have to consider how much
less expensive it is to own an electric vehicle. So actually it becomes even more

better ﬁlter for particles. And, yes, just -- and it works very reliably. And we've already
developed that for the car, like so the heat pump in the Model Y is really pretty
spectacular. I mean, it's tiny, it's eﬃcient, it has to last for 15 years, it's got to work in
all kinds of conditions from the coldest winter to the hottest summer.
So we've actually already done a massive amount of the work necessary for really
kick out some home HVAC. And they could also like stack them. So if you want to,

Who's next?
Hello? Hey, guys. Eli here from Tesla Owners Club, My Tesla Adventure. Just a quick
question. So I'm a huge fan of car camping in my Tesla with my dream case, like my
all-time favorite activity. Is it going to be possible to get climate control to the back
of the Cybertruck, because that will be the ultimate camping machine if we can get
all-night climate control?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We'll try to do that. Yes. I agree. That would be really cool. Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
All right, who's next?
Hello. Long-time fan, Elon, great guy. Just a question, how does the ICE industry look
like for -- in the future?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I don't think there will be an ICE industry long term. Yes. I mean, well, I guess
there might be like a few things that are like -- it's like curious thing. I mean, there's
still like some steam engines made somewhere, but like they're just basically sort of
quirky collectors' items. And I mean that will be the future of the internal combustion
engine car.
Hi, Elon. To your left here in the white Model Y. Ryan McCaﬀrey from the Ride the
Lightning Tesla podcast. Curious about Cybertruck. It was interesting to see where
you had it in on the battery technology front, I'm sort of curious what you see for it in
the production front. Is it volume? Trucks are so popular in America. Do you see itsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

able to get -- Tesla is able to legally be sold in Texas as part of the Giga Texas deal?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, it's hard to say what the volume exactly would be for the Cybertruck. The
orders are gigantic. So we have like, I don't know, well over 0.5 million orders, I think,
maybe 600,000 -- it's a lot basically, we stopped counting. So I think there's
probably room for, I don't know, at least like a unit volume of like 250,000 to
300,000 a year, maybe more. So now we are designing the Cybertruck to meet the
American spec, because if you try to design a car to meet the global -- the superset
of all global requirements, it basically -- you can't make the Cybertruck. It's
impossible.
So it really is designed for the American market, but this is the biggest market. Our
North American market is the biggest market for pickup trucks by far or large pickup
trucks. And then I think for -- we'll probably make an international version of
Cybertruck that will be kind of smaller, kind of like a tight wolverine package. It's a
little bit cooler, but it will be smaller because you just can't make a drive truck like
that for most markets. So yes, but it's going to be great.
And I don't know. I think probably we'll be able to sell directly in Texas. We do pretty
well right now, but it is a bit -- we're not being able to actually conclude a transaction
in Texas, but it's got to be like a click on a server-based in California. So -- but really,
we can do leasing in Texas, we're not selling, but hopefully, that will get cleared up in
the future.
{BIO 6277666 <GO>}
Elon, great job with everything that you're doing. It's Ross Gerber from Gerber
Kawasaki. Your team is amazing. What I'm most curious about, these innovations are
incredible, but on my drive up here fully on Autopilot for 400 miles, the entire state
is brown. And this is ultimately about climate. Has there been some analysis done if
all these things are achieved, what will its direct impact be on climate?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I mean, I think we'll have a very signiﬁcant impact, because it will stop the CO2
PPM from growing as it is every year. And I mean, I should say like, I try to view the
whole climate thing for -- as a science question as much as possible, science you
always question your hypothesis. Is it true? Is it not true? Or assign a probability to a
given hypothesis. And I should say that my original interest in electric vehicles
predates the climate issue. I just wonder as in high schools like I thought, man, if we
don't ﬁgure out electric cars, the whole economy is going to collapse when you run
out of oil. So it's like we better ﬁgure out electric cars and sustainable energy or
civilization is going to crumble.
And then it's only kind of later that the signiﬁcance of the climate risk became
apparent, and we're also able using tracking and other types of technology to access
a lot more fossil fuels than previously thought, which is helpful for lowering the costFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Q - Analystof gasoline, but it's pretty bad for the total tonnage of CO2 that you can put in the
atmosphere, it's now greatly beyond what people previously thought. So but this is --
as we were just going through this presentation, it's like an absolutely monumental
task to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. I mean, the entire global
economy is still more than 99% dependent on -- or call it, roughly 99% dependent
on fossil fuels. So although electric cars kind of get a lot of press right now, they're
still -- and there's still very few -- as a percentage of the total global ﬂeet, it's
practically nothing. I would say, yes, less than 1% of the global ﬂeet is electric right
now, yes, because 2 billion cars and trucks and whatnot in use.
So there's a massive amount of work ahead, just in saying, like hard to comprehend,
how much work is ahead to get the new vehicle production to be sustainable, to
massively increase the amount of stationary storage, which is critical, because
renewable energy is intermittent, wind and solar is intermittent, sometimes wind
doesn't blow and obviously sun doesn't shine at night. So you've got to have
batteries, a massive, massive number of batteries, so --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes, it's hard to measure in direct impact, but it's an experiment that we shouldn't be
performing. And the sooner we can sort of end the experiment, the sooner we can
kind of move on in a fully sustainable way that is actually lower cost. I mean, I think
the thing that people haven't fully internalized is once we do get to the $25,000 car,
the ownership cost of that car is incredibly lower than the prior car. And then on the
solar side and wind, with the cost of solar and wind coming down and with batteries
coming down with them, the actual cost of energy on the grid is going down. So
we're sort of moving towards a sustainable lower cost future. So there's not like a
sacriﬁce.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, that's true. It is a false dichotomy to say that it's like -- it's either prosperity or
sustainability. This is often used by oil and gas to say like, oh, well, do you want
people to lose their jobs? Do you want to have lower people -- standard of living?
Do you want to make all these economic sacriﬁces really in order to have
sustainability? And the reality, as Drew was saying, is that a sustainable energy is
going to be lower cost, not higher cost, than fossil fuels.
Hey, Elon, a quick question for you, right here in front. First, thanks for having
everyone. And I was telling a friend, the one company to go work for that's going to
have the biggest structural impact over the next 10 years at scale, it's probably Tesla.
So kudos to everyone at Tesla for what they've done to this point and going forward.
The two questions for you. As you've looked at the auto and the storage markets, I
know you've talked about it kind of 50-50 long term. But it seems like a lot of the
battery cost curve achievements that you are -- that you presented today really make
some of these storage opportunities much more feasible over the next ﬁve years.

becomes bigger?
And then the second part of the question, with all these huge grand visions, who's
going to be with Tesla from a corporate perspective accomplishing these things?
Obviously, Tesla can't do it alone. But when you look at some of the traditional auto
industry or power, et cetera, I don't see a lot of other Teslas.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, actually -- so there's a lot of companies in China that I think are doing great
work with electric vehicles and also with stationary storage. Although we don't see
that much in the U.S. yet, but I think probably we will in the future.
I don't know. I mean, obviously, we're doing everything we can to encourage other
companies to move to sustainable transport and also make stationary storage
batteries. We opened up -- made our patents freely available. We really try to tell
these companies, hey, you really need to do this or you won't exist in the future. But
they don't believe it. So I mean we've talked until we're blue in the face. What are we
supposed to do? But we really are hopeful that other companies will also are doing
and that will make a sustainable future comes sooner.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
From a fundamental market size perspective, like we did the ﬁrst, like ground up
work to show the size of the market in terawatt hours and they are roughly 50/50, 10
terawatt hours for transportation, 10 terawatt hours for the grid. And part of that is
because the grid batteries -- because when you're making a power plant, you're
making a large investment, our 25-year assets are greater. If they were -- if the grid
batteries were 10-year kind of things, the grid -- that market would be bigger. But
because it's a longer duration asset, they're roughly the same size.
Thinking long term, is there any other segment that this new battery be able to
disrupt or electrify beyond just the initial Model 2 or cheaper sedan like a Bow,
Boring Company, Loop, Plane?

bus? Boring, Loop, Bow, Plane?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I mean, there's -- there are batteries in limited production right now that do
exceed 400 watts hours per kilogram, which I think is about the number you need
for a decent range, medium-range aircraft. And I think our batteries will, over time,
start to approach the 400 watt hours per kilogram range as well. So yes, I mean, I
think over time, we'll see all modes of transport with the ironic exception of rockets
transition to sustainability, or to electric, basically.
On the rocket front, what we're planning to do is about 80% of Starship is liquid
oxygen, and we're actually already running a power line to be able to use wind
power to create the liquid oxygen. So we're making some decent progress on
sustainability on the rocket front, but there's just no way to have an electric rocket.
And it's important for the future of life and consciousness that we become a multi

Hello.
Josh Phillips here, retail investor. I have a question in regards to the lithium and
nickel industries and the likely price spikes and shortages of high-grade materials.
The EV industry is likely to see if they don't act fast to address future supply. Tesla
have clearly made the right moves that are necessary. But there's a real worry that
the potential supply issues and price spikes will create a drag on the rest of the EV
industry, and therefore, a drag on global EV adoption. What advice would you give
to the EV and mining industries to quickly solve these looming hurdles? Because for
a sustainable energy future, the spice must ﬂow. Thank you.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, indeed. The spice must ﬂow. The new spice. I don't know. I think the -- I'm not
sure. I guess we can try to like basically overdo it in cell production and perhaps
supply sales to others. But we do see the fundamental constraint as total cell
production. That's why we are putting so much eﬀort into making cells and kind of
reinventing -- trying to reinvent every aspect of cell production from mining the ore
to a complete battery pack, because it's the fundamental constraint. We're notFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

A - Andrew D. Baglinogetting into the cell business because we -- just for the hell of it, it's -- because it's
the fundamental constraint. It's a thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth.
But we could certainly try to overdo it on cell production and perhaps sell cells to
others. Although we are going at absolute top speed, so it's like -- it's not like we're
holding it back. But I think like just making really eﬃcient cars and that are -- must
have lower drag coeﬃcient, low rolling resistance, eﬃcient powertrains. I mean that's
kind of what we've done in order to make iron phosphate still have a good range. So
iron phosphates is lower energy density solution, but there's -- while there are some
limitations on the total amount of nickel produced every year, there's really no limit
on the iron. There's so much iron. It's ridiculous. So you can really scale up iron
phosphate at a raw materials basis, plus more than you can nickel. But yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And just to point out, when we were walking through this presentation, we
intentionally separated all the diﬀerent aspects. The beneﬁts of structural battery
apply to iron-based cathode in the same way they apply to a nickel-based cathode.
So you get longer-range iron-based vehicles. And also the silicon beneﬁt can apply
to the iron-based vehicles as well. So there's -- we can do a lot to extend the range of
an iron-based vehicle, which is why it's a key part of the road map going forward.
And then I invite Turner up here to talk about what the mining industry can do.
Yes. Diversiﬁcation on the cathode side is obviously massive and EVs are all about
eﬃciency. And so for the EV industry, for the vehicle industry, we need to see
powertrain eﬃciency really increase at all other companies matching Tesla
powertrain eﬃciency, so that everyone can have that diversiﬁed cathode approach
where LFP is used in medium-range and even really make a 300-mile vehicle with
LFP. And really the goal that we are trying to present here was a model for vertical
integration -- strategic vertical integration that a lot of diﬀerent people can do. What
we need to see is vertical integration that shortens the process path from mine to
cathode. And what we're doing here is novel and we're trying to push the industry in
that direction. So we're presenting a model here that anyone can follow.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. In fact, if there's anything that you guys want to comment on, feel free to step
forward and say something.
I think the key is to be smart about your chemistry choices, your materials choices.
Yes. If you're smart about your materials choices, the spice will continue to ﬂow. You
don't need to use the same kind everywhere. And if you -- it's about strategically
planning it out. And for miners, I think we are incentivizing them quite a bit to ramp
up their production.

Hello, Elon. This is Ben Limpic. I'm a musician. I was wondering, does Tesla have any
future plans to make partnerships with music companies, like it has done with
Tencent Games or things like that, for you guys to actually kind of expand your
services for artists and other types of creative people to get involved in producing
content that can be part of the Tesla ecosystem or so other people that do creative
things can get involved with you guys?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, we don't -- we haven't really thought about that much. But I suppose it's
probably something we should think about. We will be providing a title on Teslas. So
we're providing music to more music sources that people can choose from and just
generally trying to improve the entertainment experience in the cars.
And I think actually, as we go to a more autonomous future, the importance of
entertainment and productivity will become greater and greater. I mean, to the
degree that -- if you're just basically sitting in your car, the car is fully autonomous
and driving somewhere, it's kind of like being in a -- the car is essentially your
chauﬀeur. And then the things that become important are, okay, well, let's have good
entertainment, and if you want to do some productivity stuﬀ, then that actually starts
to become much more important, because you're no longer spending your attention
driving the car. So it will be extremely important in the future.

enough sales, which we'll try to do or we will supply other companies, it's deﬁnitely
not an intentional eﬀort to keep the sales to ourselves. If we can make enough for
other companies, we will supply them. And we're trying to do the right thing for
advancing the sustainable energy, whatever that is.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

Q - Analyst
A - Andrew D. BaglinoSo vehicle to grid. We get asked that a lot. I think one thing that's important to note
is the vehicle to grid, it doesn't -- unless you have a power cut oﬀ -- like you need to
cut oﬀ your main supply to the grid. Otherwise, if you lose the power in your house,
you'll basically just backﬂow energy to the grid. So just having a reversal in the
power ﬂow does not actually keep the lights on. You need a whole separate system
to cut oﬀ power to the grid. And I think there's also the case that people really want
the freedom to be able to drive and to charge at their house. And it's obviously really
problematic if you get to morning and your car, instead of being charged, it
discharged into the house.
And then you're sort of, okay, now I can either drive or use the battery to power my
house. I think it's actually going to be better for people's freedom of action to have a
powerwall and a car separate. And then it's -- everything works. And you have that --
you basically combine that with solar, either solar retroﬁt or a solar glass roof and a
local battery storage. So you basically become your own utility. And then the car is --
can be charged also with solar. I think that's like the stuﬀ that works. That said, like we
can certainly do vehicle to grid, and I think we could -- like we can basically enable
that with software in Europe or something, right?
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. We are -- future generations of power electronics, we will be able to do this
more or less everywhere from a like energy market participation perspective, but
yes, from a backing up the house, and it just so happens that the way the North
American connectors are on all the cars in North America, it doesn't matter whether
it's the Tesla Connector or the connector that the other vehicles have. It doesn't
actually support powering your home, it's unfortunate. So you'd need an additional
hardware to do that. But yes, in the future, all versions of our vehicles will be able to
at least do bidirectional power ﬂow for the purposes of energy market participation.
But even for that, it's important to remember that your car isn't plugged in 24/7. So
it's kind of an unpredictable resource for the grid. It will have a value, but it's not the
same as a stationary battery pack.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Honestly, a vehicle to grid sounds good, but I think it actually has a much lower
utility than people think. I think very few people would actually use vehicle to grid.
And we actually had -- with the original Roadster, we had vehicle-to-grid capabilities.
Nobody used it.

{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
How do we ﬁnd the engineers to do all these things?
Yes.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I guess we recruit a lot of engineers from all parts of the world. I think Tesla has
a good reputation for doing exciting engineering and that tends to attract the -- a lot
of the top engineers in the world, because they know that their eﬀorts at Tesla will
really serve the greater good and we're super hardcore about engineering.
Tesla is like, ﬁrst and foremost, an engineering company. It's like hardcore
engineering is what we do. Like the sheer amount of hardcore engineering done at
Tesla is insane. And if you look at, say, there's various surveys done of engineering
schools, where do you want to go? Like what's your top choices? And actually, the
top two choices in the last few years have been Tesla and SpaceX. So sometimes it's
Tesla ﬁrst and sometimes it's SpaceX ﬁrst, but those are the 2 top ones.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, if you are motivated to solve some of these problems, which are the
hardest problems in the world to solve, that really fundamentally enable the future
we all need, please reach out. Help us work on these problems.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Absolutely. And like you said, the battle is far from over. Less than 1% of the global
automotive ﬂeet has been converted to electric and even maybe 0.1 -- less than 0.1%
of stationary storage has been done. So stationary storage has barely begun,
converting the global vehicle ﬂeet to electric has barely begun. So there's still a
massive amount of engineering work to be done at Tesla and other companies to
accelerate this transition to sustainability.

meaningful all of those improvements will be? And then given what you're trying to
accomplish as a company, is it fair to assume that the vast majority of improvement
will be given back to the customer in the form of lower prices?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, it's -- I think certainly, we will try to get back as much as possible to the
customers. It's not like -- it's like Tesla's proﬁtability is crazy high. Our average
proﬁtability for the last four quarters is like maybe 1%. So just to be clear, it's not like
we're minting money. Our valuation makes it seem like we are, but we're not. So we
do want to try to make the price as competitive as we can without like losing money.
And if you lose money, then you keep doing -- if you keep losing money, you'll just
die. So we have to -- this thing called proﬁt is just like we need to bring in more
money than we spend. Otherwise, we're dead. So --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
But aﬀordability is key to how we scale, right?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Like the demand goes non-linear as you reduce the price of the car.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, it's important to sort of separate the diﬀerence between aﬀordability
and value for money or desirability of the product. So for a lot of people, they want
to buy a Tesla, they simply don't have enough money. We could make the car
inﬁnitely desirable. But if somebody does not have enough money, they can't buy it.
Sometimes, people kind of forget this, it's like -- it's not -- it's like somebody -- you'll
have enough money to buy the car, and just making a car super desirable, but
expensive does not mean they can aﬀord it. So it's absolutely important that -- critical
that we make cars that people can actually aﬀord. Yes. So I wish (Multiple Speakers)

we're already doing that.

sort of monthly payments and then your cost for either gasoline or electricity and
your cost of servicing. And -- but the fully considered cost of an electric car is much
less than a gasoline car of the same nominal purchase price.
I mean, that said and like maybe on the order of three years, when we can do a lower
cost, like a $25,000 car, I think that will be basically on par, maybe slightly better than
a comparable gasoline car. So I think maybe it's on the order of three years-ish.

you're going to leave the -- upstream and supply chain to sell?
No. I think we tried to answer that directly. I mean, we really are looking at not just
what happens in the cathode facility, but like currently outside the cathode facility,
that should really be inside and removing processes that shouldn't have been there
in the ﬁrst place and the use of reagents that add -- are just costly and not necessary

Rodney Westmoreland, managing the construction here at Tesla. What I would like to
say is, one, shout out to the team. The team has been working eﬀortlessly, a very,
very tough project here for 24 hours a day, it seems like, round the clock to have this
complete.
The thing that sets us apart from a lot of other construction -- yes, we have a
construction company here. The thing that sets us apart is that we're integrated in
the manufacturing process. So every detail that comes from Drew's mouth is directly
implicated into the system that we're building. That way, what would typically take
three or four months to create a speciﬁcation, our design team is working right with
the manufacturing team to allow us to speed that process up tremendously. So --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. It's deﬁnitely a important part of the vertically integrated approach. It's to be
able to design the factory around the equipment, in fact, together with the
equipment so that you can build the factory at lower cost and more quickly.
Yes. I'm Scott. I focus on cell design. I think it's hard to put into words how inspiring
this is. I've been at this a long time with Tesla. And I really hope others do join us.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah. Since when Scott?
Since 2005, with many of you, but thank you. A year before, Drew, but who's keeping
track? But I'm really stoked to what the team has been able to accomplish over the
last short period of time, about a year. It's been really an incredible transformation. I
mean, hopefully, what we've shown you inspires you to join us or join somebody else
in the eﬀort. And I couldn't think of a greater, more intelligent, more hard-working
team to be working on with this problem.
Hi, Peter, I lead the manufacturing improvement team. And I guess the point that I
would like to make is manufacturing improvements is like the accelerator. So like you
think about the execution that Rodney talked about in terms of how fast we've been
able to put together this factory, which is amazing and something that's been really
incredible to be a part of, that's not enough. What we need to do is improve the
manufacturing technology. That's the real accelerator, and that's what we're really
focused on. Elon talks about it all the time that really, going and improving that
system is what will enable us to get to the scale and the cost that we need.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-22

I'm Tony. I've been working in lithium and cathode materials for almost 23 years now
and this is the most growth I've seen in a company. I've been here a little over a year
and half. We're hiring amazing people that are allowing us to leverage technology
that most of the industry is struggling to achieve.
So to answer the question, how are we going to do this? We are really advancing the
materials manufacturing for cathodes and for lithium beyond what has been
accomplished in the previous 20 years.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
It's exciting.
Yes. My name is Turner, I work closely with the team, have worked a lot with everyone

everyone understand that this growth is coming. This growth is real. We are going to
