Okay. I think we're live. Welcome back, everybody. I'm Brad Zelnick with the
Deutsche Bank software team. Really delighted to be here for hosting this session
with Microsoft, where we have the company's Executive Vice President, Chief
Financial Oﬃcer of its Commercial Business, Dave O'Hara. Dave, welcome.
Thank you, Brad.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Thanks for being here. Format of this will be a 35-minute-or-so ﬁreside chat or as
long as we last. I've got a bunch of prepared questions to ask Dave and if there's
time, maybe we'll -- I'll keep my eyes on my phone, on my inbox. If you have any
questions, I'll try to weave them into the conversation, again, if we have time. But
with that, Dave, let's jump right into it.
If you don't mind, maybe for those that are less familiar with you, your title, can you
explain your role and what it is that you do at Microsoft?
Sure. I'm the Commercial CFO for Microsoft, which is just what it means, which is
CFO for all of our commercial business. People ask me, what is -- tell me what's in
the commercial business and I say, anything that's not in consumer, which is true and
it's a fairly accurate framing. So it's all of -- it's Azure, it's Oﬃce, it's Windows
Commercial, it's SQL, it's all of the commercial stuﬀ and then I also have Corp Dev.

(Question And Answer)
Excellent. Thank you for that. Maybe if we could talk -- macro environment is on
everybody's mind. Maybe if we could just reﬂect on last quarter, the company
sounded very conﬁdent in the strong momentum in the commercial business, but
did call out some softening, speciﬁcally in the small to medium business segment
and we're now two months into Q1. Has anything changed in terms of the trends that
you're seeing there? And also several other software companies have come out and
spoken about larger sale cycle delays in large enterprise type deals. Is this
something that Microsoft is beginning to see as well?
Well, I would say at a macro level, I think everybody is still trying to ﬁgure it out and
understand where the world is going. But for us, we were -- as you noted, we had a
good Q4, we had a really good bookings number. Our -- record bookings number
for us and we've had a few quarters of that in a row. And so we like to see that -- we
see that as a sign of future strength. And so we feel good about where we're at and
we feel like long term, the cloud is just going to continue to expand.
On the SMB side, we saw a little bit of a pullback, but even with that, we still saw a
good growth. It was just probably a tick less than we might have otherwise expected.
We still have the same outlook. I think -- like I said, I think everybody is still trying to
ﬁgure it out, but I also think that people are looking at this as an opportunity to really
transform and they're investing accordingly.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
That makes sense. And to your point, on commercial bookings, you've now had
three quarters in a row with greater than -- or 35% or greater commercial bookings
growth at constant currency and led by large long-term Azure commitments. And I
can imagine this does give you some degree of visibility and conﬁdence in the
business trajectory for the year. But what do you think is driving customer's
conﬁdence in making these large type of commitments, especially in these times?
Well, I think one, ﬁrst and foremost is, we can show them how they can save money
by investing in cloud technology and investing in the future. And so they look at it as
an opportunity to take your OpEx down. When we look at a company, we really think
the opportunity for us is basically anything they spend on OpEx, like everything
ultimately can be automated and everything ultimately can run better in the cloud.
And so we just make that pitch to him.
I think the other thing is we just have a good lineup of products. Cloud started out as
infra, but it's much more than that now and we have solutions that all up and down
the stack. And so I think the reason that they're willing to make commitments is one
is, if they make a long-term commitment and a big commitment, they're going to getFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31

Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Dave O'Haraa better deal from us, and they know that; and two is, they're just kind of at the point
where I think they just feel like it's ask the question of, does this make sense? They
know it makes sense. The question is, how fast can they move and how eﬃciently can
they move? And so we're seeing lots of people make big investments and lots of
people come in with big ideas.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Yes. I'm always, I guess, surprised, not surprised when I hear of these massive nine-
ﬁgure multi-year strategic commitments with the world's most known brands. But
when we think about Azure, obviously there's demand that falls into that category all
the way down to smaller innovative type companies looking to do more with less
and some of what you talked about. But how reliant is Azure growth on larger long-
term deals? And is it fair to think about Azure is driving customer's spend on other
Microsoft products as well, like Power Platform, Dynamics, Oﬃce, like how have
these customer conversations evolved in terms of pulling through more and more of
the portfolio?
Yes. We start out talking about the Microsoft Cloud. So when we go in and make a
pitch to a customer, we talk about all the oﬀerings that we have. In Azure, as you
noted is a good entree, because it's infrastructure and at some level, the companies
are better oﬀ starting there. But there are so many oﬀerings beyond that Power
Apps, Dynamics, any of the database oﬀerings. And so we really look at it -- I think
that's the reason they wanted to sign a long-term relationship; one is, not only do
they get a better deal; two is, they get more of a roadmap and they can understand
where they're going long term as opposed to just doing a transaction.
So it's really about a deep partnership. We have that conversation with lots and lots
of customers and I get involved in lots of deals as well. And so many of the CEOs
start out by saying, I don't want a transaction, I want a partnership and that's what
we're looking for too is a long-term partnership. And throughout that partnership,
they end up using a lot of our technology, not just Azure. Azure is often just a starting
point.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Got it. Makes perfect sense. And overall Azure growth rates remain very impressive,
but there's still healthy debate around the trajectory from here over the next couple
of years as just the revenue base just gets larger and larger and I appreciate you're
not going to give us long-term guidance. But can you walk us through the inputs and
process of how Microsoft itself thinks about capacity planning and the visibility you
feel you have to overall commercial demand?
Yes. I mean, it's a very diﬀerent world obviously than we had even ﬁve years ago
because our CapEx number is much more meaningful, much larger. But we also feel
like we have way better signal into how much we should be spending on CapEx,
because we have these long-term contracts, we have deep conversations withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31

Page 4 of 14Q - Brad Zelnick

Q - Brad Zelnickcustomers, we have the biggest global footprint from a cloud perspective, that's all
signal, that all tells us where we think the world is going. And so to build a data
center, it takes a long time and so you have to be fairly accurate. And -- but not only
that, you have to continue to drive eﬃciency.
So how we think about the long-term growth of Azure, it's a unique market in the
sense that you have three super deep-pocketed players who are willing to do what it
takes to win a customer. And so I feel like from a pricing perspective, it's always very
competitive and we'll do whatever it takes to be competitive and continue to grow
share. So pricing is always, for lack of a better description, under pressure, but we
feel like we're charging a fair price and customers believe we're charging a fair price.
So pricing -- there's probably pressure on that side.
On the hardware and software side, there are deﬁnitely eﬃciencies of scale. And so
we've seen some of that through some of the margin expansion that we've been
able to achieve over the years, it's just the eﬃciency. So you might have price
pressure on the top 10, you might have bigger contracts which result in more
predictable revenue, you have all the eﬃciencies on the hardware and software side
and then you get the beneﬁts of scale across all the OpEx that we're spending. And
so all of that, we sort of -- every quarter, we pull all of that together and say, here's
where we're at in our cloud business, but it really starts at the Microsoft Cloud. So
not just any one product, it's the Microsoft Cloud and making that work across all of
those inputs and intakes.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
You mentioned the CapEx cycle. The capital that you're deploying in Microsoft Cloud
today, how do we think about that like just in terms of -- I'm not -- I don't want to get
into the accounting and the changes in depreciation, things like that, but just more
from a capacity planning standpoint, like how far ahead are you thinking and is the
company looking at?
Well, we have a rolling three-year plan in how we think about CapEx. But really, it's
about the next 18 months in terms of what you can control. So it's best to have a
directional thinking on how we think about three years out, 18 months out. We do a
lot of planning and then we adjust as we go and what we've seen over the last ﬁve
years is each year, we have to adjust up a little bit. On the other hand, you get way
more VMs out of a machine these days, you get -- you can store way more servers in
a data center, the chips are much better. And so you can process -- there's a lot more
consumption that can be run through a data center today than two, three, four, ﬁve
years ago and so we get all those eﬃciencies as well. So you have to factor all of that
into the planning process and to say where do we think we're going to be. And then,
you have to get smarter about how you provision land and there's -- it's -- I feel like
we're so much more sophisticated in that process than we were when we started --
it's been really fun to see.

Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Dave O'Hara
Q - Brad ZelnickAwesome. Maybe to pivot the industry cloud, I feel like the message we've heard
coming out of Microsoft, it has signaled really strong adoption around what you're
doing in vertical market speciﬁc oﬀerings. How important is that to the longer-term
Azure strategy? And is this an area where we should expect to see more investment
maybe similar to what we've seen in healthcare with Nuance?
Yes, sure. So on the industry clouds, really for those that are familiar, the industry
clouds are really onboarding to Azure is how we should think about it because
they're industry-speciﬁc but it's not super deep functionality. It's not like we're
creating a vertical product that goes and competes with the ecosystem. It's really just
industry -- some industry functionality that runs on Azure and gets people
onboarded under our cloud. So those are all being well received, but even, as an
example, when we announced our sustainability cloud, Judson and I jumped on with
some CEOs from Europe. And then we jumped on a call with some CEOs from the
U.S. and just said, hey, here's what we're doing, all good news. And they're like, hey,
where's the reporting for X, Y and Z? And so people just want the stuﬀ that's very
speciﬁc to their company into their industry and we'll continue to work with the
ecosystem to deliver that.
At Nuance, I spent a ton of time at Nuance both pre and post acquisition and still
spend a ton of time there. Nuance was unique to us in the sense that we do have a
very strong ecosystem play, always have, always will. And Nuance was both an app
and a platform. It's a platform in the sense that Epic embeds it and Cerner embeds it
and other healthcare providers embed it. And so it provides very speciﬁc
functionality that the ISVs can use to make their solution better. And so the thing we
liked about that is, it's not a vertical app, it's really a platform app, but it's very
industry-speciﬁc. And I think we will take the opportunity to build all of those that we
can. Because I think as long as we're enabling the ecosystem and are providing
speciﬁc functionality, maybe they can't -- don't choose not to build on their own then
that's all good news and I think, we're seeing that show up.
So would we do more stuﬀ like Nuance? I think to the degree that we can have
something platformy that works with the ISV community and provides diﬀerentiation
that they want, yes, absolutely.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Any industries that stand out as rich opportunities?
Well, I think the six that we have for industry clouds are all seen as an area of focus
for us. And so think about any of them retail, ﬁnancial services, manufacturing
whatever, healthcare sustainability. I think the other one is nonproﬁt, as they look at
our friends. And so I think all of those are big and broad opportunities for us to
partner closely with the ecosystem.

Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Dave O'HaraCool. Dave, maybe to pivot to a diﬀerent topic, today's Microsoft really embraces
interoperability and open standards and ultimately, to drive customer beneﬁt. And
unsurprisingly, I think Microsoft's multi-cloud value prop is very clear with capabilities
such as Azure Arc, as an example. Can you talk philosophically about the balance
between interoperability versus proactively partnering with great companies, like a
Databricks, for example, that ultimately drive customer success?
Sure. When you look back on it, it's been a bit of an evolution. I think when we ﬁrst
got into the cloud game and it was us and AWS and some other vendors that have
been around a while too. It was seen as, you go win a customer and then the
customer runs in your cloud and it quickly became apparent that, that probably
wasn't going to be the way that it all played out that customers wanted choice, they
wanted the opportunity to run the business, they wanted on whichever clouds they
wanted.
And candidly, if you start six years behind your competitor, then it beneﬁts us to have
a multi-cloud environment because that way if people are running some workloads
on AWS and some on us and some on GCP, then our job is to make that run as
eﬃciently as possible. And Azure Arc really does that. What it allows people to do is
run Azure services across a variety of clouds, including all the public clouds. And so I
think multi-cloud is deﬁnitely here to stay. I think the onus is on the public cloud
providers to make that work as seamlessly as they can and we'll continue to invest in
that. And so in the early days, it was like, hey here's our cloud, here's their cloud,
which one you want? And now it's like, hey, here's how to best run your business and
I think it's much better story for customers.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
No doubt, it's playing out to customer's beneﬁt and we pick that up all the time.
Maybe along similar lines, it was surprised to see or at least for me to see, for sure,
your announcement of an Oracle cloud managed database service for Azure. Can
you talk about the size and scope of this speciﬁc opportunity and just more generally
how Microsoft thinks about co-opetition?
Yes, I think Satya in particular is very, very committed to unique assistant play and we
should be able to partner with almost any company and almost any instance if it's in
the best interest of the customer. And we've been -- we've done business with
Oracle for decades actually, and Judson who runs our -- who runs sales for us, he
came from Oracle and so he's got long-standing relationships there. I think Oracle
has a great oﬀering and a great database oﬀering. So I think having those database
oﬀerings run on Azure cloud is the good thing.
And we just got together and we said, hey we have a common set of customers that
would like to see this happen, let's make it happen. And it really wasn't a diﬃcult
conversation to have. We just felt like if you do this and we do that and it all works
out for the customer, then that's the good thing. The Databricks partnership is a
pretty deep partnership for us. Our partnerships can run from sort of marketingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31

A - Dave O'Harapartnerships to sort of API partnerships. It's something that's more deeply integrated
or even to something like Databricks that actually sells on our paper. And so we just -
- depending on the company and depending on the opportunity, I think we're open
to having partnership conversations with basically anybody.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
No doubt. Maybe while we're on the data topic, Cosmos DB data volumes have
been growing at over 100% for four quarters now, and that state of volume is
growing very nicely as well. How does Microsoft think about data services creating
aﬃnity and stickiness in the cloud and as well how should we think about the cost of
delivering data in terms of services over time?
Sure. Well, data is a big play for us, always has been. I mean, way back in the day
when Microsoft got into the business with SQL, that was sort of our -- that was the
big leap into data. And I think everything that we do now, sort of builds on that
history. And for a cloud oﬀering, infra is great, storage is great, but if you can't do
something with the data, it's not really going to make a diﬀerence. And so we spend
a bunch of time and money on making our data products and oﬀerings better and
more targeted toward customers. And I think we see that in the growth.
I think for us, the stickiness comes from the collection of services, not any one
service. And so I don't -- data is probably more sticky than average, but in the end,
what they really want is all of their products to work together across the whole cloud.
And so from a consumption perspective, there -- some companies use data a lot
more than others and so it just depends. In terms of cost, I think we have a fair value
prop for our data services. But again, we look -- when somebody signs a multi-billion
dollar contract with us and a multi-year multi-billion dollar contract, there's a piece of
that, that's data. And so, as I noted earlier, we look at it across the whole Microsoft
Cloud. And we just need to make sure that we are competitive in the market, and I
think we are, and I think we'll continue to drive costs down. I think the most
surprising thing to me in the last few years has been how quickly with the
combination of software and hardware we've been able to take cost out of the
model and which allows us to pass better pricing on to customers, and I think they're
all seeing that and beneﬁting from that.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
No doubt. Can we pivot to talk about Oﬃce? So yes, switching to Oﬃce 365
commercial, in speciﬁc, the company's noted moderation in SMB new deal volume
recently. How much of recent seat growth is being driven by SMBs versus larger
enterprise customers and how much runway is left for each of these customer
segments to maintain seat growth over the medium term?
Sure. Well, there's a few things that work with Oﬃce. Oﬃce, obviously, has deep
penetration into the enterprise. On the other hand, we're continuing to addFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Dave O'Hara
Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Dave O'Harafunctionality to Oﬃce that beneﬁts customers. And so even though it might be
deeply penetrated, we have other oﬀerings, whether it's Teams or Security or any
other, the new oﬀerings that we've come out with lately. And so I think from an
enterprise perspective, we have room to grow. Our E5 penetration still has room to
grow.
From an SMB perspective, it's that accounts for a large chunk of our new users, but I
think it'll continue to account for a large chunk of our new users. And so it's the -- as
we look at building the Oﬃce business, it's a combination of both, new oﬀerings and
new suites for the enterprises, but also sort of simpler more straightforward oﬀerings
for SMBs and frontline workers. And I think both of them are growth opportunities.
So our job is to just add as many customers as we can and get them the most value
that we can and some combination of that P times Q is the Oﬃce business.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
So we've talked a little about the Q, maybe a little more on the P. There's healthy
debate around ARPU as the driver of Oﬃce 365 growth. E5 seats were up I think
60% year-over-year this past quarter, now account for 12% of the installed base. How
should we think about penetration from here? To what extent will SMB and frontline
SKUs oﬀset this uplift? And is ARPU likely to be a meaningful growth driver going
forward?
I think the combination of ARPU and seat growth will be our growth driver. And so
you might say, ARPU might be up a tick, down a tick, seat growth might be up a tick,
down a tick, but when you ﬁgure the two out, then that's where we're going to be.
And then you throw in the new oﬀerings that we have, some of which just come with
the Oﬃce product like Teams and others, which we might charge for separately. I
think that adds to the growth as well.
Even with Teams, as you think about Phone and as you think about Room and Events,
there's lots of opportunity for even growing within Teams. And so it's a combination
of all those things that I think ultimately results in the revenue number. It's not like
we're sort of pulling switches to hit a speciﬁc target. We're just trying to add the
most value that we can and as many seats as we can and like I said, some
combination of that along with the new oﬀerings is our number.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Maybe on that basis, like if we look out way on the horizon in terms of the things that
you could sell into that base and the problems you can solve, what might you be
able to point to that perhaps suggest that investors are just completely
underestimating how much Microsoft can deliver into that oﬃce space and to new
customers and solve more and more beyond Teams and some of the things that we
already know that --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31

Page 9 of 14Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Dave O'Hara
Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Dave O'HaraYes. I think if you just look at Teams and Security as two examples of markets that
were either nascent or basically didn't exist 5, 10 years ago. Both of those are really
good example. There is an exec once who told me the story a long time ago about
how that exec was running Oﬃce and how he felt like, it had kind of been tapped
out and that was when I think it was like $5 billion business and Jack Welch of all
people said, you're just thinking about it wrong. Like, you just need to redeﬁne your
market.
And so I think with Oﬃce and Windows in modern work, we're constantly redeﬁning
our market and redeﬁning what we can deliver to customers. But I think we have a
good signal and I think we have a good idea what customers want and I think we can
meet that and I think we've seen that over the last few years.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Makes sense. Can we maybe double click on Teams? I mean, it's just become so
prevalent in just the way the world has evolved over the last few years, hybrid work
becoming the standard. I can tell you from my own team, our regular updates from
around the world, I've got folks in London, on the West Coast, in New York and we
used to gather remote by the way, which is pretty cool. If you haven't seen it, you
probably should check it out. It gives a nice feel to it. But just double-clicking a little
bit more into Teams, as we've settled into this new normal, how do you think about
Teams from here and where the greatest opportunities lie ahead?
Yes. I think it's -- so right now, we're just having a quick conversation before this and
he said, hey one thing I don't like about Teams. And so that is the most common
thing that any of us do, hey, let me give you one piece of advice on Teams. And so
it's ubiquitous, lots of people use it, lots of people love it, but everybody's always
got that one little thing and why do you do this. And so I think there's always
opportunity to improve the product and Jeﬀ Teper runs Teams and I had dinner with
Jeﬀ, I think Saturday night and talked about real-time feedback for any of us who do
our jobs.
Like every time we have an SLT meeting with Satya, we're on Teams and the minute
there's a glitch like boom. And so if any of us think that we're on all day every day,
you're not compared to Jeﬀ. But Jeﬀ just takes it all with a smile and says, that's great
feedback, we'll go work on it. And so I think we get lots of feedback on Teams and
lots of feedback on how to improve it both at a macro level and at a micro level and I
noted your feedback, Brad. Thanks.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
I think when I told that to you, I said it was more of a limitation of how we've at
Deutsche Bank implemented Teams.
It was you -- I think your exact words were, it's more about how bankers think than
how Teams work.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31

Yes.
So the -- but I do think, Phone is a great opportunity. I mean, people have PBX that
are 30 years old. I think we can go in and oﬀer a much more aﬀordable and eﬀective
solution. As an example, in the hybrid world, events are much more online than they
are in person. And so I think all of those are opportunities for us to continue to build
out Teams.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
It seems like it's deﬁnitely the future. Want to turn to Security, which you mentioned
has a tremendous opportunity. I think Microsoft today is technically the largest
security company out there in the industry by the measures and growth and scale
that you've shared with us. But the integrated nature of security and what you oﬀer is
I think a key diﬀerentiator. How do you leverage this during the sales process? And
what are Microsoft and Charlie Bell's aspirations in Security? Like what's at stake here
and how big of a monetizable opportunity do you see in Security?
Sure. Well, there's a few things about the Security market. And we came out with the
-- I think we announced that we had $15 billion in revenue. And I think we also
announced that we're investing $20 billion in Security the next ﬁve years, which
actually that might be low. But we're going to spend a lot. We think it's a great
opportunity. The thing about security market is it's just constantly evolving, like when
you think you've solved one thing, there's ﬁve more right behind it. And so it's not
static in any way, shape or form. And I don't think you're ever done building security
oﬀerings. And so I think that opportunity will literally just continue to evolve through
many, many years. The thing with us is that we have, I think the best signal of any
company on the planet just by virtue of all the products.
And so we can see some of this coming before other people see it coming, and I
think that puts us in a great position. I mean even if you look at some of the stuﬀ with
the war in Ukraine and some of the stuﬀ that Brad, Smith and his team have talked
about. I mean, we have signal on virtually any security threat around the globe. And
so I think that's a good opportunity. I also think that we're just -- because of our
history in the enterprise and because of our global reach, we're very trusted by
customers. And so when we talk to them about Security and we talk to them about
Security as part of our integrated oﬀering, they listen and they want to learn more
about it. And I just think that it's literally an untapped market because it's always
changing and there's always new threats and we have great signal.
So I think we'll just continue to build out big, very helpful oﬀering for our customers
in the Security space. It's going to be -- I wouldn't even try to estimate what the TAM
will be ﬁve years from now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31

Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Dave O'Hara{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Is M&A a priority in Security?
I think we're always looking at M&A. And I've told people like, I'm not really a CFO,
which is true. It's factually correct. I'm more of a deal person, but I do think that M&A
is hard. Everybody loves the deal and loves getting a deal done, but then comes the
hard work of integrating it and how do you think about integrating the technology
and how you think about integrating the Teams. And so I think we've gotten really
selective, appropriately selective on the deals that we do.
If you look at Nuance, we spent a lot of time on that as we took a very thoughtful
approach in terms of how do we think about platform versus apps, how do we think
about industry, how do we think about Teams. If you look at Activision, that's another
big deal. So I think what you see with us is as being more thoughtful and more
selective in doing deals that are more strategic, because we just know there's such
an investment to get them -- to make them work. All that said, we'll build security
oﬀerings, we might buy some, we might partner with some companies. I think the
market is -- I think there's lots of room to ﬂoat a lot of boats in Security.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Helpful. And by the way, when I prepared for today, I didn't fully appreciate the
extent to which you spent time on deals and how much of a responsibility that is.
Just maybe a general question, I know you're not going to give us your shopping list
and I know that you've got your hands full right now with Activision pending. But is
there anything else that you can share maybe even in terms of the things that we
shouldn't expect Microsoft to do? Areas that -- where they're characteristically or
functionally that are philosophically antithetical to Microsoft's future is?
Sure. I would describe it this way. So Satya always starts out, whenever we're talking
about whether it's building a product or acquiring a company or whatever, he's like,
tell me what the TAM is. Is it growing? Is it growing faster than our TAM? Because we
have fought hard to get the growth rates with Microsoft to where they are today. And
you don't want to buy a bunch of deals that are going to slow you down. And so
that's a key question, like what's the TAM? Is it growing or not growing? Is this
acquisition going to accelerate us or is it going to slow us down? How do we think
about the culture of the team? Is the team going to be a cultural ﬁt? Do we have
permission to play there? Like, is somebody going to look at it and say, hey, all of
that makes sense?
And so I think we just got more thoughtful about what ﬁlters through. And I think
before -- historically, we might have done a lot of product acquisitions, a lot of tuck-
ins and we still do some of those, but now I think we're probably just looking for stuﬀ
that diﬀerentiated, strategic and impactful. And so we're buying fewer companies,
maybe slightly larger, but they need to ﬁt culturally and they need to ﬁt strategicallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31

because I just don't think we're going to run that far aﬁeld.

It sounds sensible and it's helpful to hear you articulate that. Maybe just as I kind of
step through some of the parts of the portfolio, as we think about Power platform,
Dave, you now have over 25 million monthly active users, which is obviously very
impressive. How does Microsoft make Power platform as relevant to customers as
Oﬃce is?
I think by making it easier to use and making it as helpful as we can. And so in the
end, everybody who wants to be a coder, should be a coder and the simpler we can
make it to go build your own apps, however app -- however big that app or however
small that app might be, then we'll get more users. And so, for us, it's about
continuing to make it easy to use, eﬀective for them to use. But also to sort of do it in
a standardized way that you're not going to end up with a bunch of one-oﬀ apps.
And so I think that's our challenge is continue to give people the tools they need to
go, build out the apps that they need, but do it in a way that all hangs together. And
so that's the job of Power platform and we'll continue to work on that. I think that's in
a baseball parlance, that's early innings, in terms of where that's going to go.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
It's a massive opportunity for sure and can't see why it's not Microsoft's right to really
continue.
I think that's one where we have permission to play.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
For sure, for sure. Play on the ﬁeld, to the baseball analogy. I wouldn't be doing my
job as a CFO of the business if I didn't ask you about margins. With all this growth
ambition and innovation comes the need for investment. So within the commercial
business, how do you prioritize spend as you manage down to operating margins?
Are there still Microsoft Cloud gross margin improvements that we will see and
adjusting through accounting changes and things like that? And how do you think
about commercial margins longer term?
Yes. So when people think about margins, a lot of times they're thinking about cost,
but really the biggest impact on margins is pricing and the biggest impact on
pricing is being able to provide diﬀerentiated value. So to the degree that we can
continue to build up stack and provide diﬀerentiated value, I think customers will be
willing to pay for that, and I think that will help us with margins. I think margin also
depends on mix, like as we've seen with some of our SaaS apps that have better
margins, as Azure grows in proportion to that, maybe the margins get squeezed aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31

A - Dave O'Haralittle bit but on the other hand, maybe we get better pricing out of some of the other
apps or maybe we just drive costs out of the model through eﬃciencies on software
or hardware. All of those things come into the mix, but we're focused on, not margin
itself, but all of the components of margin that drive margin and we just work those
as much as we possibly can to make them as good as we can and then the margin is
really an outcome. So the short version is, we feel good about where we're at on
margin. We think there's still opportunities to improve that and we'll keep working
on that.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
And because you've brought up pricing, can you just remind us philosophically, if
anything has changed, especially as you think about the other main cloud
competitors out there from a platform perspective, what the philosophy is? And if at
any point in time, like what would trigger any change in that strategy or philosophy
as it relates to the pricing for cloud infrastructure?
Well, we're -- our pricing strategy is that we're going to provide value and we're
going to take share. And so we're going to continue to be competitive in the market
from a price perspective and we're going to continue to take share. And so I think
because I've been asked by analysts before, like, jeez, it feels like you have room on
price. And we're like we feel good about where we're at on price and customers feel
good about where we're at on pricing. And as long as we're growing share and as
long as we're continuing to expand revenue and margins, I think we're doing the
job.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Makes perfect sense. We're almost out of time. I'm going to ask you one last
question, which is the sort of magic open-ended question of what haven't we talked
about? What do you feel is misunderstood? What would you like to tell us about
Microsoft's commercial business that maybe we haven't touched on?
Well, I think our commercial business is pretty well understood. I think what's maybe
-- maybe it's harder for folks who have thought about it as a variety of oﬀerings and
less about Microsoft Cloud. And for us, it really is about the Microsoft Cloud and
when we talk to customers about it, they get that story, especially the C-suite they
get that story that it all needs to be integrated, but I still think that there's a little bit
of legacy out there where people think about Microsoft as products as opposed to
cloud oﬀering. And so we're getting that story told. We also get customers that come
in. I mean, where they just say, hey, my business needs to be completely
transformed, let's start over. And so in that case, we'll start with ideation about what
do you really need to rebuild your business and what do you mean to be ready for
the next 20 years. And so I don't know that, that is appreciated maybe as it could be,
but that's ﬁne too because I think it shows up when customers succeed and do well.
So we'll get there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-08-31
