business.
With our First Quarter results covered last Thursday, this call will be focused on these
2 items. Prepared remarks today will be led by Belinda Wong, EVP and CEO,
Starbucks China, who just celebrated her 18th year as a Starbucks partner -- and
Scott Maw, CFO. Joining us for Q&A, we'll also have John Culver, Group President,
International and Channels. To help facilitate the conversation, we have posted a
document on our website at investor.starbucks.com that summarizes the accounting
treatment of transitioning from the East China joint venture structure to one that is
company owned in ﬁscal 2018.
Before handing the call to Belinda, I would remind you that this conference call
includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and
uncertainties that could cause our actual results to diﬀer materially from these
statements. Any such statement should be considered in conjunction with cautionary
statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our ﬁlings with the
SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation
to updating these forward-looking statements or information.
Please refer to our website to ﬁnd the reconciliation of non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures
referenced in today's call with their most directly comparable GAAP measures. This
conference call is being webcast. And an archive of the webcast will be available on
our website until Friday, March 2, 2018.
I will now turn the call over to Belinda.
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very excited to be here today to talk
about the company's fastest growing and most strategic market in the world: China.
Starbucks pioneered China's specialty coﬀee market 19 years ago by introducing a
unique experience and serving the highest quality coﬀee to our Chinese customers.
Fast forward to today. And Starbucks is one of the most recognized and respected
brands across the country.
Throughout our 19-year history in China, Starbucks has been building a diﬀerent kind
of company, one that has earned the love and respect of our Chinese customers and
one that has earned the love and respect of our Chinese partners through our
culture and the values we have built. Our success in China has been the direct result
of our focus on our disciplined growth and the deep respect we have for the
Chinese heritage and values. It is with these same principles that we'll continue to
grow in China for many years to come.
Let me put into context the China market and the tremendous opportunities we have
in front of us. China is projected to take over -- to overtake the U.S. to become the
world's largest economy by 2030. In 2016, China actually already surpassed the U.S.
in consumer spending. At the core of this economic change and socialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Page 3 of 19transformation has been China's middle class, the largest middle class population in
the world. Over the next ﬁve years, another 300 million Chinese people will reach
middle class status, doubling its size to a total of 600 million, almost 2x the entire
population of the U.S. The rising middle class will for sure drive coﬀee consumption
growth and further demand for Starbucks.
Now let me speak to our performance over the last several years. Just ﬁve years ago,
there were only 700 stores across 53 cities. And fast forward to today, our store
count has grown more than 4x. There are more than 3,100 stores across 139 cities.
Our 45,000 partners proudly serve more than 6 million customers every week.
In the most recent quarter, we delivered a solid 6% comp growth, driven all by
transactions. And as a matter of fact, we have achieved positive comps for 33
consecutive quarters. And all but 1 quarter achieved 5% or above. We also hit a new
record of opening 188 new stores in Q1. We are ready to achieve our goal in opening
more than 500 stores this ﬁscal year. All of these factors give me great conﬁdence
for the future of our business in China and is one of the key reasons we are now
consolidating our ownership position to be a full company-operated market.
We are now at a point where we're moving forward with the integration of our East
China business. Our East China region is comprised of 2 provinces: Jiangsu and
Zhejiang as well as the City of Shanghai. This region represents 11% of China's total
population and generates 22% of the entire country's GDP.
To put this into perspective, the 150 million people living in East China is equivalent
to almost half of the U.S. population. Its GDP at $2.5 trillion is as large as the State of
California or the entire country of India. Four of the top 10 most aﬄuent cities in
China are also from this region: Shanghai, of course, with the highest per capita
income in the country as well as Hangzhou, Nanjing and Suzhou. Today, we have at
least a 4 to 1 store advantage over our nearest competitor in this region.
In Shanghai, we operate more than 600 stores, the largest number of stores in any
city around the world, yet there still is an opportunity to double down to reach more
new customers and expand our market share. We're not even close. And I'm
incredibly excited about the tremendous runway in front of us.
The size and scale of East China and having it integrated into a fully owned
company-operated business will help us scale for the future, gain synergies and gain
operational eﬃciencies in the business. Going forward, we will now have one local
management team who will have the ability to strategically prioritize our
investments, streamline decision-making and provide a full focus on delivering the
growth aspirations we have across the entire country. We will also have the
opportunity to fully integrate and up level our back-end infrastructure, which
includes supply chain, IT, store development and design. And R&D. We see
incredible opportunities to drive meaningful food and beverage innovation and to
expand our digital footprint to improve the overall customer experience in our
stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Page 4 of 19Scott Harlan MawShanghai is at the forefront of consumer trends that the rest of China is biased to
emulate. This was behind the strategic decision to open the ﬁrst international
Roastery in Shanghai. Not only are we introducing new concepts such as Teavana
stand-alone tea bar and Princi food, we are using the Roastery as an innovation lab
for future beverages and new concepts across the country.
The young Chinese generation today seeks innovative digital and retail experiences.
We now have a total of 6.2 million active My Starbucks Rewards members, almost
half of the U.S. active members and with 1/5 of the store count. By end of Q1, we
added almost 1 million active members, an impressive 17% year-on-year growth.
Through our strategic relationships with Alibaba and Tencent, we have been able to
attract and bring in new customers to the Starbucks Experience. Alipay and WeChat
Pay, the most convenient and popular payment platforms in China, now account for
over 60% of our total tender. These platforms combined with other cashless
payment options in our stores account for 80% in cashless transactions.
Now that we have direct access in connection with these customers through our
digital relationships, we can drive higher return on our digital investments, including
existing programs like (inaudible) and future opportunities such as delivery. What I'm
most excited about is the opportunity I see for our people, speciﬁcally around talent
management and career development at a national level.
We have immediate access to the experienced partners in East China and can
deploy the best partners in key markets to help drive our key priorities. We also see
this as an opportunity to extend our innovative world-class beneﬁts such as Bean
Stock, the housing allowance subsidy for store partners and the critical illness
insurance program for the parents of our partners. We will go into further detail on
all of this as well as the progress we're making to achieve our China growth agenda.
I'd like to invite you all to join us this May in Shanghai at our ﬁrst ever China Investor
Day. As part of your visits, you will experience ﬁrsthand what has been at the center
of our success: our people. What you'll see is not only the incredible passion and
pride they have for working at Starbucks but also the way in which they bring the
Starbucks Experience to life for our customers and each other every day. This truly is
what is unique and diﬀerent about Starbucks in China. And of course, you will also
be able to experience our newest coﬀee wonderland, the Shanghai Roastery.
Let me close by saying I could not be more proud of what the China leadership team
and our partners have accomplished over the past few years. With our customers
and partners at the heart of everything we do, we'll continue to strengthen our lead
in the market and along the way, share our success.
Thank you. And now I would like to hand it over to Scott.

Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 19repeating a lot of information shared on last week's Q1 earnings call and instead
proceed directly to highlighting certain existing ﬁnancial metrics and introducing a
few new metrics.
The East China business will be fully consolidated and reﬂected in our ﬁnancial
statements beginning in Q2 of ﬁscal '18. East China store comp sales will be reﬂected
in our global comp store base beginning in Q2 of ﬁscal '19. From a modeling
perspective, I'll note that under the joint venture structure existing prior to the
acquisition, all royalties from and product sales to the East China JV were included in
Starbucks net revenues with associated costs reﬂecting in COGS.
50% of the JV's proﬁt was reﬂected on our income from equity investment line,
accounting treatment that resulted in triple-digit operating margin from the East
China JV as we reported approximately 50% of the proﬁt but only a small portion of
the revenue. As discussed last week, consolidating East China will result in a
4percentage point lift in our net revenues in ﬁscal 2018, adding over $1 billion on a
pro forma run rate or an annualized basis.
Looking ahead and normalizing for the timing of the transaction, we expect CAP
revenue growth in the mid-teens and China revenue growth north of 20% on a run
rate basis in each of 2018 and 2019. This will translate into reported CAP revenues
that will approach $5.5 billion ﬁscal 2019. In the aggregate, our Mainland China
business is expected to drive a signiﬁcant majority of CAP's revenue growth and
approximately 1/4 of Starbucks' total revenue growth in each of 2018 and 2019,
again, normalizing for the timing of the transaction and will comprise over 50% of
total CAP reported revenue in 2019.
Comps from former East China JV stores have generally been very consistent with
the numbers that Belinda shared earlier. East China comps came in somewhat below
the company-operated store ﬁgure over the past two years as a result of the JV's
more aggressive store growth strategy during that time. East China store growth has
averaged nearly 40% over the last three years compared to under 25% in the rest of
Mainland China. The success of this strategy is clear as we have taken signiﬁcant
coﬀee share in key markets such as Shanghai. Given the opportunities Belinda
covered earlier regarding marketing, product development and other operational
areas, we believe we can close some of this recent gap as we move into 2019 and
beyond.
Let's move on to the proﬁt impact of China on Starbucks and our CAP segment. As I
stated on the earnings call, CAP comprised nearly 50% of non-GAAP operating
income growth in 2017 and should comprise over 40% in 2018 and 2019 with
Mainland China comprising a signiﬁcant portion of this growth. Turning to margin,
the impact of the acquisition is expected to be slightly negative to reported
consolidated operating margin in 2018. At the segment level, the acquisition is
expected to lower CAP operating margin moderately in 2018 on a non-GAAP basis.
However, given the proﬁt growth in Mainland China, we expect moderate margin
expansion to resume once we fully lap the acquisition impact after Q1 2019.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Q - Matthew James DiFriscoUpdating what I said on last week's call, we now project that CAP will have the
highest retail segment operating margin within Starbucks by the end of 2019, if not
earlier. We continue to expect the East China acquisition in conjunction with our
other streamlining activities to be ﬂat to slightly accretive to overall non-GAAP EPS in
2018 as I've shared on previous calls.
Speciﬁcally, East China will add 1 to 2 points of non-GAAP EPS growth in 2018 and
the impact of the other activities, including the absence of our Tazo business. And
the conversions of Taiwan and Singapore to licensed operations will largely oﬀset
this impact. I'll remind you that we expect a cumulative impact of these moves to
become more meaningfully accretive to returns and EPS growth as we move into the
back half of 2018 and into 2019.
Finally, besides being complementary pillars of future growth, our U.S. and China
businesses are increasingly beneﬁting Starbucks and each other today. As Belinda
mentioned, a good deal of the inspiration from our Reserve bars in the U.S. came
from store and design innovation that has its roots with China. And China continues
to meaningfully beneﬁt from our U.S. R&D engine, including innovation around our
Cold Brew platform and supply chain initiatives. We fully expect this collaboration to
both continue and become increasingly valuable and accretive over time.
On a personal note, I'd like to share that in the process of immersing in the due
diligence on the East China JV and considering the impact of the integration of East
China into our own company-owned portfolio, I've come to realize that the
opportunity for Starbucks in China is even greater than I had originally appreciated.
And I've been bullish from the start. We have the strongest brand and the best
leadership team in the industry, signiﬁcant momentum in the business that is being
further accelerated by increasing digital engagement with our customers and a
strong tailwind being provided by the fastest growing economy in the world. Our
conﬁdence around China is rooted in a continuation and an expansion of the
strategies that have driven our operating and ﬁnancial success since we ﬁrst entered
China almost 20 years ago. From an investment thesis perspective, there is no other
Western consumer brand that comes close to approaching Starbucks' position in
China. And we are truly just getting started.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco
from Guggenheim.

Q - Jason Taylor West
A - Scott Harlan Maw
A - Belinda WongScott, can you just walk us through a little bit, I think you said $5.5 billion for 2019.
That's for the year? Or is that a run rate leaving 2019 for CAP? And if you could just
break that down as far as how you report it. Or how -- what rough ballpark estimate
of what we should think about coming from the company-owned stores versus the
CPG and the licensed stores, those 3 other divisions that you break out?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. So the $5.5 billion is for the full year, Matt, that we anticipate reporting. And
obviously, if you think about the makeup of that, the vast majority is China and Japan
company-owned stores with some licensed store revenue coming through that. And
there's really not much CPG revenue that's reported in that second -- that segment.
So it's fundamentally 0. That's over in CPG.
Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from CrÃ©dit Suisse.
{BIO 4139501 <GO>}
Just want to clarify, Scott, you said that the comps in East China have been running
below. It wasn't clear if you meant the rest of China or below the CAP segment and
whether it's positive comps. And you mentioned something about closing the gap
there, if you'd just talk about that.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. So they're below the rest of China. So Belinda threw out a ﬁgure of 6% in the
most recent quarter. East China's somewhat below that positive. But I would just
point out we're talking 40% portfolio growth over the last few years in a relatively
small geographic region. And that's been highly successful from securing real estate,
taking share and growing overall revenue and proﬁtability.
And one of the things we'll talk about as we get into next year into a full run rate
basis is because of the growth rate of stores in China, you have to look at not only
comps, which are super important. But overall revenue growth because so much is
fueled by the new store growth rate. And given the returns that we shared on
Investor Day, we continue to drive not just top line but signiﬁcant proﬁt and margin
expansion as a result. Just a little diﬀerence between the 2. Belinda's getting her
arms around the operation now and we talked about some of the things we can do
to improve that. And I think we'll close some of the gap as we move towards next
year. And I don't know. Belinda, do you want to add anything to that?
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Because of the expansion in, like what Scott said, the smaller geographical area, the -
- Shanghai, ﬁrst of all, I just want to say that Shanghai is a very important city that we
need to lead and own. And in that, I'm very pleased to say that we have a 4 to 1
competitive advantage. And to do that, we will -- in the past few years, there was
intentional strategy that we accelerate the growth in that particular city. So and I'mFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 19Operator
Q - Jeﬀrey Andrew Bernstein
A - Belinda Wongglad we did that because we -- actually, is the #1 brand in specialty coﬀee market in
that very important city in China.
And when you do that, you are -- you need a little bit more time to build the
customer base. And when I say that, our stores and new stores that are coming from
Shanghai and the East China region are still the best new store age class for this
year. And I think the strategy we took in the past was fantastic. Now the comp gap,
there is a gap but because it's also the timing of the acceleration of the stores as
well. But the gap is not that signiﬁcant. And what Scott was trying to say is that, as I'm
now integrating the business, when we see how we're integrating the back-end
system and also, in the future, more similar marketing activities and all that, the gap
and the diﬀerences of the activities we do, it will -- the gap will be smaller. That's
what we mean.
Your next question comes from the line of Jeﬀrey Bernstein from Barclays.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Just 2 questions. One maybe on the operating margin progression. I know you said
that you expect a modest decline in ﬁscal '18 but then modest operating margin
expansion starting in ﬁscal '19. Just wondering if you can walk us through maybe --
walk us qualitatively through what you think over the next number of years, whether
that modest is the run rate we should be thinking about or whether there's some
stair-step function.
Trying to get a feel for the pace and where you maybe think the margin could go
longer term. My other question was just, Belinda, as you operate that region, I mean,
the My Starbucks Rewards numbers you gave are quite impressive. I think you said
you have, you say, close to half of the number of My Starbucks Rewards numbers
that the U.S. has but only 20% of the units. So I'm just wondering what initiatives
have you used over there to drive that membership growth in China that maybe the
U.S. could -- can learn from.
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Thank you. I'll start ﬁrst. And I'll turn it over to Scott. When -- I can't wait for you guys
to come in May to see the market. And if you -- I mean, our MSR program, ﬁrst of all,
is very diﬀerent from the U.S. The customers actually have to pay to be a member. So
to be able to share with you that kind of number, it is a very, very good result. And
that says a lot about the brand and the brand aﬃnity of our customers. The -- our gig
in China has always been introducing the Starbucks Experience to new customers.
And the other part of our job is to make sure they return and the existing customers
return more frequently. We have been practicing that for 18 years and the next
decade to go. So this -- like I said, the success is really about everything. It's our
people. It's the relationship that we have built with our customers. And they really do
treat our stores as a third place where they go at their free time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)

A - Scott Harlan Maw
OperatorAnd we really have built a very, very close relationship. And our success rate of
reaching a new customer and yet they become a member, very high, that conversion
rate is extremely high even in new cities. So at day 1 of new cities, you'll be surprised
how many people actually sign up to become a member. So as we grow in China
and the way that we have done it in spreading out and really the strategy that we
have done in store development going after the key cities really provided us with a
halo eﬀect of that brand love as well.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
And Jeﬀrey, this is John. Just real quick. I would just add to what Belinda's saying.
Also, we've been able to build strong digital partnerships with key players, Alipay
being one of them and Alibaba and then WeChat and the WeChat Pay platform.
We've got 60% of the tender coming through that and then 80% of the tender is
cashless.
So China overall is a very digitally savvy customer. And what we're seeing is that
beyond these platforms, we're able to expand through social gifting, through e-
commerce. Belinda spoke about the opportunity that we see on delivery. Mobile
Order and Pay will also be an opportunity for us in the future. So the digital footprint
is just being built. And we see a long runway for growth of being able to better
connect into our customers in a digital way.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
And I want to add one thing to that. And I'll get to your margin question, Jeﬀ. China
is the leader within Starbucks for digital consumer engagement. And the
relationships that we have with Alibaba and with Tencent and the one-to-one
marketing that Belinda is able to do in partnership with them, those are the types of
non-Starbucks Rewards digital relationships that we're in the process of building in
the U.S. She's ahead of us. We're playing catch-up. But I think the important part
there is she's get a strong Starbucks Rewards member base just like we do in the
U.S. That's driving incrementality.
She's got third-party relationships that there's a partnership with. That's driving
incrementality. We're building that in the U.S.. And we're going to get there. But
they're some examples of what we've talked about. As far as margin, I think the most
important thing is I think on the call last week, I said that CAP will, over the next
several years, become the most proﬁtable retail business for Starbucks. And it'll
happen sooner than that. And what I would say, Jeﬀ, is we'll see moderate margin
expansion as we get into 2019.
I think I'd like to come back when we provide guidance and be a little bit more
speciﬁc then. It's obviously early in the acquisition. But given -- it's not very often you
can say an acquisition is accretive to earnings immediately. That's the case with East
China. It's not very often you can say it's accretive to margin immediately. That's the
case with East China as we get into '19. So I think that's very powerful.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Operator
Q - John Stephenson Glass
A - Scott Harlan MawYour next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
I have a quick follow-up question on that. But I guess, ﬁrst, I'll ask about -- just about
the equity income line in China/Asia Pac. I think we've estimated that China was
maybe, I don't know, somewhere around 40% or something like that. And I guess, I
was just curious, are we in like the right rough ballpark in terms of equity income?
And where should that go now that it's fully consolidated? Then if I may, just a follow-
up on the comment about the retail margins being the highest in the system by the
end of 2019.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Sure. I think you're in the ballpark, Sara. The impact from South Korea would be easy
to underestimate. South Korea is quite proﬁtable. So if anything, I see people maybe
over revving on the size of the East China proﬁtability thinking that Korea is smaller.
But obviously, there's a big chunk of that line that's going to go into operating
income -- the pieces of operating income as we consolidate East China.
Obviously, the scale and the growth rate of both China and East China are greater
than the other markets that are in that line. But Korea is a meaningful piece. And I
think that's the genesis of your question. And you wanted to talk little bit more about
the margin in CAP? Or did you -- can we -- maybe Sara had a follow-up question. Did
she have -- okay.
Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.
{BIO 2450459 <GO>}
Actually, that was one of my questions. So maybe you could just talk about an
update. What are the unit economics in China? What is -- say, what is the average
unit volume today when you combine the -- both the entity that you own before and
then the joint venture? And can you talk about the retail margin if you will, either
relative to other regions or an absolute? And as a follow-up, I think you do have to
put some capital into some of the stores as well as some dollars into like the
compensation system. Can you frame both CapEx and also just the operating
expense that you need to put into the business over the next couple of quarters?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. We'll -- I'll go through all that, John. And Sara, if you had a follow-up question,
just jump back in the queue. So John, just on the proﬁtability of China and East
China, you'll remember the numbers we shared at Investor Day. Those numbers hold
across Mainland China. As I said on the most recent call, they're actually a little bit
better. I'll update all 3 of the signiﬁcant company-owned markets around cash proﬁts
and ROI between now and earnings. I just want to have a fulsome discussion about
all 3 markets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Q - David E. Tarantino
A - Scott Harlan Maw
A - Belinda WongBut China is the highest and most proﬁtable market from a return standpoint. Retail
margins are quite strong. And China is getting more proﬁtable. Those numbers are
actually getting bigger if you can believe it. And so the momentum there is strong.
East China has very strong store-level proﬁtability. So the fact that the last couple of
years we had a little bit lower comps should not be taken as lower proﬁtability
because the new stores are really doing quite well.
I would say, as far as investment in CapEx, most of the -- well, it's all in the guidance
that we gave on the proﬁt increment. Most of that investment is in salaries, wages
and beneﬁts that Belinda talked about. I'll just say it's relatively nominal. It's really
important. It does put a little bit of headwind in year 1 because we want to make sure
we bring everyone up to the right level. But it's relatively nominal. We'll lap it as we
get into next year and start to accelerate.
Then as far as CapEx, there is obviously CapEx increment because that wasn't
reported when East China was a JV and it will be now. We're still very close to that $2
billion guidance number that I gave despite nine months of East China store
openings. There's been some puts and takes and all that. So I think I'll just make a
Starbucks comment that there's no change in my CapEx guidance taking over East
China. There's a little bit coming from China oﬀset by some savings elsewhere in the
business. And we still feel really good with that guidance level.
Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird.
{BIO 15144105 <GO>}
Scott, just a modeling question about the revenue outlook you gave for the
segment. Can you maybe split the unit growth between company and licensed
locations that you expect for 2018 and '19, maybe the total and then split between
company and licensed?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. I'll start and then I'll have Belinda. I think over the next couple of years, the unit
growth that you've seen, if you look at our disclosure that we put out on the website,
we split by country the growth between company owned and licensed. The licensed
is East China. And the company owned is the rest of Mainland China. I would expect
something similar for '18 and '19. Beyond that, I'll maybe just have Belinda jump in
and add anything that you see there.
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Yes. So far, I -- we are not planning to change our store development strategy in the
entire China. So it â€“ w will continue to -- I mean, the split has always been 55%
CCO and 45% in East China. And given how important East China is and all the
aﬄuent cities, we see continued opportunities to continue to speed up the growth in
that region. So that has -- that is not going to change in the next couple of years or
beyond.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Q - Gregory Ryan FrancfortYour next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Just a follow-up on the margin question. Obviously, the Americas in 2016 was doing
a margin -- operating margin over 25%. '17 was a down year. First quarter of '18 was
down versus First Quarter of '17. So what kind of margins when you think about what
CAP can become over time? Again, this isn't really a '19 or '20 question but maybe
longer term. Do you think you can set margins that maybe eclipses what the
Americas did in 2016? Is there anything structurally that would hold that division
back that maybe we're not thinking about?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
No. I think that is entirely doable, John, over, say, even the next 2 or three years
because, as you know, China has been driving so much of the proﬁt and revenue
growth of the CAP segment. And there's margin expansion in the China business
and in the JV business. And so we would expect that to continue. So not only will it
probably pass the U.S. by the end of next year but even that, the high watermark that
the U.S. business set, I think that's entirely doable. So we'll get a little bit more
speciﬁc as we get into guidance. But John, if you want to add to that.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yes. I will just add that when you look broadly outside of China, the margin and the
strength of the markets is very strong and whether it's a joint venture, licensed or
company owned. And so we're very bullish on the growth opportunity in China,
broadly across Asia and continuing to expand our margin. And Scott spoke earlier
about Korea for instance. Korea is a market that we have 1,300 stores in. Last year, it
delivered double-digit comps. And it's a market that is doing very, very well for us.
But we've got 15 other markets similar that are doing equally as well. So very excited
about the opportunity in the future.
Your next question comes from the line from Greg Francfort from Bank of America.
{BIO 22252878 <GO>}
I had 2 questions, just 1 going back to the margins. I think the last number you
disclosed was in china you were getting 34% cash margins before non-cash rents
and D&A. So does that shake out to maybe 24%, 25% margins already kind of in
China? And I think were you saying that the East China JV stores had similar margins
to the existing China stores already?
Or is there a meaningful diﬀerence between them? Then, I guess, my second topic is
in terms of the unit growth rate. I think you've been adding about 600 stores in
China a year. Should we expect that to pick up now that you've got it consolidated?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Q - Karen HolthouseIs the overall number going to accelerate? Or should we expect kind of 600 to 700
going forward?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I'll answer the ﬁrst part. And I'll ask Belinda to answer the second part. The numbers
that you quoted that we talked about in Investor Day, those are for company-owned
stores. And that level of proﬁt continues to increase a bit on new stores. I would say
East China has very strong proﬁtability. For Investor Day, we'll come and talk
speciﬁcally about the East China pieces of that. We have not calculated that because
we didn't own the market. We didn't have all of the inputs.
And so Belinda and her team are getting their arms around that. We know the proﬁts
are quite high. We know a lot about those stores. But obviously, I want to calculate
those returns exactly the same way we calculate the China company-owned returns.
And we want to get those exactly right. And we just need a little bit more time. So as
we get to May, we'll talk a bit about that. And Belinda, if you want to talk about new
store opportunity.
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Well I guess, you -- on our track record, right, we have been trying to be -- growing in
a very disciplined way. And every year, we accelerate a little bit to try and make sure
our people are ready and that we learn from our new stores that we opened earlier.
And so far and as we speak now we are now at a pace of 500-plus stores every year.
And I just talked about the Quarter One where we have achieved a new record. So
you can see that we're practicing again how to really accelerate growth.
Now I talked a lot about the opportunities that we see. We deﬁnitely see, now that
we own East China and the rest of the China that I've been running for the past
seven years, there are opportunities. Now -- but what it is important is that we need
to make sure we continue to ﬁnd the right real estate. We got to make sure we have
the right people to run those stores and to build that experience and relationship.
And while we grow -- and I don't think I'm going to chase like the number of new
stores.
I want to make sure my new stores are open in a quality way in both numbers and
also experience. So opportunities are there. There are a lot of development in China
that we're looking at in terms of real estate and stuﬀ like that. So but we got to be --
we got to pick the right ones and making sure that every store is a proﬁtable one.
And it gives us the return that we all like. So the short answer, we want to accelerate.
But we got to accelerate it in a disciplined way.

Q - Andrew Marc Barish
A - Scott Harlan Maw
A - Belinda WongA pretty quick modeling question just to make sure we're netting out sort of what
we're adding back versus what we're taking out. Can you give us a sense of why the
tax rate you were using on the joint venture income was and then conﬁrm the tax
rate guidance we got last week does reﬂect the sort of P&L tax rate post the
acquisition of China?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. I think the best way to talk about the tax rate for me, Karen, just so I can keep it
straight for you guys is to talk about both the reported GAAP eﬀective tax rate but
probably more importantly, given the acquisition. And you'll remember that the
acquisition had the 5 point impact on our reported GAAP tax rate this year because
the gain is largely tax free.
So that won't impact going forward. And so the key rate for Starbucks on our overall
ﬁnancials is that 27% non-GAAP eﬀective rate. And I wouldn't expect, based upon
the modeling we've done, a big impact in that tax rate based upon the run rate of
China. So said diﬀerently, if I think I understand your question, where that moves
within the P&L, whether it's JV pickup or full consolidation, that's not going to have a
material impact on that overall tax rate for your modeling.
Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jeﬀeries.
{BIO 1512077 <GO>}
Yes. I guess, on the segment data right now when you look at the margins, which
we've seen with other China businesses. And I know CAP is obviously more than just
China. But the cost of sales and occupancy is running signiﬁcantly higher than the
Americas. And store operating expense is lower. Is that a product mix issue at this
point or supply chain? And if so, on the product mix side, can you give us a little
sense of what that -- what the current China product mix is around your beverages,
food, et cetera?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. There's not a big diﬀerence between Americas -- or the U.S. and the China cost
of goods sold. Japan runs a little bit higher cost of goods sold than both of those
markets. And obviously, today, Japan is weighted in much heavier than it will be a
year from now. So you're getting a little bit of what I would call country mix in that.
Andy. And you know that the proﬁtability in Japan is quite high. But the COGS rate is
deﬁnitely higher in Japan. And maybe, Belinda, do you want to just spend a few
minutes talking about sales mix in China just to let these guys know what's driving
comps?
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
So I guess, I'll focus on the diﬀerences in -- with the U.S. I -- ﬁrst of all, the obvious
diﬀerence will be the food mix. Currently, we're running at an average of 11% food
mix. And it's half of what U.S. is doing. And that would obviously impact the COGS,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Q - William Everett Slabaugh
A - Scott Harlan Maw
A - Belinda Wongright, just by a mix shift perspective. So that's -- we -- by the way, we see food as a
very important opportunity that we have as well as we integrate East China. And then
we'll be able to streamline suppliers and then -- and increase the attachment there.
So and the other mix, it's pretty normal in terms of our beverage is the most
important one. And one thing that is worth saying is that tea is picking up a lot and
food is also growing and -- but at 11% right now. And I think the mix is just it hasn't --
well, I'm very happy to see because of the fact that we're comping every quarter very
helpfully with transactions, every category is also comping as well. So I'm very happy
to see what I have now so.
And your next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc.
I had a question on China comps and CAP margins. Just given how fast you're
growing comps and margins, I'm assuming there's some level of cannibalization
taking place and some level of ineﬃciency in cost of sales and labor. So along the
same lines of trying to understand what this business could be over time, is there any
way to quantify either one of those?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
What I would say is if you look at East China, we've deﬁnitely seen, given a 40%
portfolio grade over the last three years, a lower level of comps. And that's because
of exactly what you're talking about, that sales transfer. It's sort of 10x the portfolio
growth rate in the U.S. Now the market is growing so quickly. Belinda and her team
have done an amazing job to grow stores at 40% and have positive comps. But there
is a little bit of sales transfer there in some of those cities.
And so that is something that we'll continue to watch while we make sure that we're
growing with the opportunity that exists from a market share standpoint. I'll start but
I'd like Belinda to comment. When we look at cost of goods sold and labor as a
percentage of retail sales. So at a store level in China, it actually stacks up very well
with the U.S. market. So they're, particularly in company-owned markets, highly
eﬃcient, at least from my perspective, in driving those lines.
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
I think one thing that I would add is that because we're a high-growth market, right,
when you're opening 500-plus stores every year, you have to train a lot of people.
And at a store count, six years ago -- or ﬁve years ago, I mentioned 700 stores. And
every year, your percentage of new store is so high that when you're pacing your
growth over the year, you got to get the people ready. And they're in the store
training as well. Now our base is higher every year now and so the labor, it's -- you
have to take into account where we have existing stores that's running, that existing
store plus the labor we need to get ready for -- to fuel the growth every month that
we have to open.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Q - Ronald John Hottovy
A - Scott Harlan Maw{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
And Will, I would just add to that, right. So we built -- Belinda and her team have
built this engine around new store development and design. And that engine is
working very well for us. It includes not only being able to get the stores open but
having the people in place in the right way to operate those stores. We see that
engine continuing to be leveraged now across East China as well as the company-
owned markets. So that's number one. Number two, I would just add that when you
look at our growth in China on the same store sales on comparable sales, over the
last several years, it has been driven majority by transaction growth, right.
So what that tells us is that although we are opening stores at a record pace, we are
attracting more and more new customers into Starbucks every day. And we're
increasing the level of frequency of our existing customers. So for us, that's all the
more reason that we are very optimistic about the growth opportunity that a
consolidated China brings us, whether it's in East China or whether it's in the rest of
China where we operate our stores. So we don't see slowing that down. We see
continuing to enhance it. And as we've said on our past calls, this is going to go on
for decades for the company. And one day, we do believe that China will be the
largest market that Starbucks operates anywhere in the world.
And your next question comes from the line of RJ Hottovy from Morningstar
Research.
I have 2 questions, 1 regarding CapEx and expenditures beyond 2018 and again with
respect to rewards. Scott, you talked about the incremental CapEx for 2018 and
ﬁtting within that $2 billion guidance. But wanted to get a sense or get your thoughts
what kind of incremental CapEx we might be looking at beyond 2018 as you look to
things like CPG build-out, new retail formats or -- and even infrastructure
improvements. Then on the rewards, given that you already have a strong digital
relationship and that there is widespread acceptance of things like Alipay and
WePay, what types of My Starbucks Rewards partnerships or Stars as Currency
partnerships might you be looking at down the road? Just anything you have there
would be helpful.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Great. I'll take the CapEx question. Then, I'll give the digital question to Belinda.
What we talked about is the increase this year to the $2 billion really ran across our
new stores globally and renovations to those stores, some things we were doing in
the corporate support centers and supply chain, including some additional
manufacturing plants. I'm talking globally now, not China. Then the third thing was
Reserve Roastery and Princi. And so I believe what I said in the last call.
And I think it still holds with East China coming in, is 2 out of those 3 things are likely
to continue, obviously, new stores and Reserve Roastery and Princi. I think some ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

Q - Brett Saul Levy
A - John Culverthat corporate CapEx is onetime and will likely come down. And so as I think about
2019, I mean, it's really early. But that's kind of how I think about rolling forward the
CapEx. And we've been able to -- with East China and the number of stores we'll
build using our own capital, we've been able to sort of put that into that capital
budget as it ﬁts. So you want to talk digital, Belinda?
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Yes. So in terms of My Starbucks Rewards program, we're just barely getting started.
And what I mean by that is that there -- right now the majority of the -- we just
opened up another on-ramp, a new way to become members. With all the digital
relationships on other platforms that we get, we are now able to connect with our
customers. We want to turn the higher conversion rate for them to become
members. And as we grow stores, there will be new customers wanting to be
members, right? We can do so much more on the personalization of marketing. And
we just started building out Stars. And then we wanted to leverage the learning in
the U.S. to have Stars as Currency and to create more programs and value behind
that for our members. So there are lots of things we could do.
Now I want to talk a little bit more about other digital experiences that we could do -
- we can expand as well. For example, I can't wait to launch delivery in China. And
that was going to create a whole new other business revenue stream for us and also
MOP because I have such a great even daypart. In all 4 dayparts that I have, I don't
have an urgency to do MOP to have -- to take care of any throughput issue. However,
because of the digital savviness of our customers, I can't wait to oﬀer the mobile
order experience for our customers as well to have a more robust Starbucks
Experience in and out of our stores.
Your last question comes from the line of Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank.
{BIO 18965727 <GO>}
This is more of a strategic kind of question. If you could share a little bit about what
kind of learnings or possible missteps, if there were any, with the Japanese
acquisition, if there's anything you think that you did with the Japanese transaction
that might make the transition and the integration of the East China and your
traditional China business into something that's potentially more seamless or
proﬁtable or speed up the process, anything you can share?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yes. Brett, this is John. I think what we've learned from Japan, we're even more
focused and sharpened our intentions in the work going into the East China
integration. Let me give you a couple of examples. First from an IT infrastructure
perspective. We learned in Japan that there was a bigger opportunity there for us
than we actually realized. And we've gone into China eyes wide open and really
gone after and looked at the infrastructure that exists in East China today and the
ways in which we can invest now that's going to help catapult our IT capabilities
much faster. That's one area.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-01-31

OperatorThe second area has to do with supply chain and making sure that our supply chain
is set up in the right way. And it's not so much we didn't do it right in the Japan
acquisition because that was already operating as one total market. It was just joint
venture structure. But in China, we've got a great opportunity to leverage what we
know from our company-owned business on our frozen food platform. And we have
a great opportunity to learn from our East China joint venture on a fresh food
platform and take the best of both worlds and bring that forward.
Then the last piece is around talent and the opportunity to make sure that we're
leveraging the talent now across the entire mainland to put people in the right
places, to drive the work that needs to be done and to make sure that we are
growing our talent and giving them opportunity to become the future leaders of the
business. So we're much more savvy about that, I would say, given the acquisition
that we went through in Japan and now moving into East China. And that's really
what excites us. So very excited about that opportunity.
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
If I may add, don't forget we have been operating as a company-operated market in
China for many years. We've got the relationship. We have the experience in -- not in
East China but the rest of the China -- but the rest of China. So we have spent
signiﬁcant amount of time building the infrastructure for our growth in the company-
operated markets with in mind how would that turn out if we owned the entire
country, right?
So and the second point that I want to make is that we have been working with East
China team for the past decade. Together, we grow China market and accelerate the
growth there. So it would make it much easier for us now that we went -- we're going
in and started the integration to understand and just go right into what we need to
integrate, what we need to up level to enable us to come up with the right
infrastructure to scale to 5,000 stores and beyond by 2021.
That was our last question at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Maw for his
closing remarks.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I want to thank John and Belinda for
their time. We'll have a chance to talk about China again in April. And I encourage
you all to come to China in May. I just want to reiterate that, personally, the more
time I spend on China and preparing for the call doing the acquisition, the more
excited I get about the opportunity. And I highly encourage you to come and see
what Belinda and her team are doing in the market. Thank you.
