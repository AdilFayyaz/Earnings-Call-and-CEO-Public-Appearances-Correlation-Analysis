Presentation
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
All right. Welcome back, everybody. Colette, pleasure to have you join us. As always,
thank you for making time for us.
Just a quick housekeeping note. My moderator Q&A thing is ﬁnally working. So
please feel free to pop in and as always, you could just keep shooting emails as well.
So a great pleasure to have NVIDIA join us, and Colette Kress needs no introduction,
CFO of the company. So before we get started, Colette, you reported earnings last
week. Maybe just would be helpful to get a quick recap of how you highlighted the
business conditions near term and then we'll take it from there into Q&A.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Great. Thanks so much for hosting us here at your conference.
I'm going to have to start with just a reminder that our discussion and presentation
contains forward-looking statements, and investors are advised to read our reports
ﬁled with the SEC for information related to risks and uncertainties facing our
business.
So let me ﬁrst start with some of the key highlights and takeaways from our earnings
that we just had in terms of last week and our thoughts in terms of where we think
moving into Q3 will go. First, our data center demand for NVIDIA compute continues
to accelerate. We saw exceptional growth in this last quarter, particularly in AI
inferencing more than doubled year-over-year. This is an area where customers are
taking deep learning AI workloads to production, they're shifting away from CPUs to
GPU for inferencing and our A30 ramping quite well and it includes about 4x the
performance improvement T4 our prior inferencing speciﬁc card.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24

A - Colette KressAdditionally, we're seeing a leadership in our AI training to continue. We have both
swept the ML performance benchmarks that were out there, but also strong growth
with natural language processing, deep recommendators, which are very important
new workloads that are occurring. This is likely going to be a phase of industrial AI
high performance computing revolution. It is underway as we see more and more
large supercomputers supercomputing out there taking advantage of this
opportunity to introduce acceleration to a good part of the industry, and we'll talk
about that more.
Moving to our overall NVIDIA RTX. NVIDIA RTX is available as a great opportunity to
advance overall graphics for both our consumer gaming, but also for our enterprise
graphics. Entering into the holiday season in the next couple of months, we are
entering with the strongest ever product cycle expanding both the start of RTX titles,
RTX titles for gaming and also lean channel inventories. We also have the biggest
wave of NVIDIA laptops for both back to school, studio, as well as that holiday
season as well.
Now when we move to further talk about the opportunities of high end graphics, we
can't start that without talking about Omniverse, the power and the future of an
immersive overall entertainment and industrial collaboration approach as we move
forward, and we'll talk about that in addition. We have been highlighting our NVIDIA
AI software and subscriptions as a key opportunity for us as we move forward,
probably a multi-billion dollar opportunity as we go forward.
But though we talk about our guidance, some what we provided at our guidance, we
expect another strong quarter. We expect sequential growth, driven largely by the
accelerating demand in data center. In addition, we also expect sequential growth in
each of our other three market platforms that means our gaming business, that
means pro visualization, as well as our automotive. We expect that the contribution
for CMP, our Crypto Mining Processors, to be minimal as we think about the outlook
going forward. So our revenue guidance for next quarter is $6.8 billion and a large
portion of that growth is related to our data center business.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Great. Just in terms of visibility and especially given how tight things are, it is actually
quite remarkable given lead times stretched out, you guys have delivered the kind of
growth you have. But in terms of visibility, can you please comment on your visibility,
given the stressed lead times? I think earlier in the year, you have characterized that
your visibility to the data center business is very strong because a lot of the more
project-based projects that you're working on. So how does the visibility looks like
versus what it would look like normally at this time of the year?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So when we think about our data center business, understand we have a wide set of
diﬀerent types of customers. Yes, we have conversations, both with our hyperscales,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)

Q - Ambrish Srivastavahyperscales for internal use of our infrastructure, while also providing it for cloud
instances. We also have a very meaningful amount of vertical industries that make up
a portion of probably close to 50% of our data center business that can be achieved
from purchasing from our certiﬁed OEMs, as they create many diﬀerent server
oﬀerings for this industry, but they can also be very speciﬁc sales such as SuperPODs
and/or our DGXs.
Our work in terms of visibility stems all the way from helping many of the companies'
hyperscales and vertical industries look for infrastructure solutions to solidify what
they're trying to do for AI, what they're trying to do for high performance computing,
inferencing and lots of that is in engineering engagement from the overall
architectural level. Our overall visibility as we move into Q3 is quite solid. This has
been an area of continued growth on our part of helping companies end to end on
their platform and system choices as they built up.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Okay. I have a few more questions on the what seems to be an endless supply-
demand imbalance. I certainly haven't seen anything extend out over such long time.
In that context, could you talk about lead times and especially in the gaming
business, it sounds like we should just throw our seasonality out the window, A,
because the business is diﬀerent because of how big laptops are, but then also how
constrained supply has been?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Let's talk about our overall gaming business and what may be referred to as
lead times. There's multiple parts of our overall gaming business. Our gaming
business is structured to support desktops, to support notebooks, to support overall
cloud gaming. So each of those require a diﬀerent level of supply and overall
working towards that. We have articulated now for a couple of quarters that we are
supply constrained on our gaming business. But the way to think about that is,
demand is quite high. Demand is very strong, and we continue to produce strong
results in terms of revenue growth year-over-year, but we continue to work with all of
our diﬀerent partners on supply. So it's not just looking at the supply that we have,
but it's also understanding our OEMs, our AICs and helping them create the
systems, the boards that need to go to market.
So our lead times as we think about this have already been determined because
that's something that you are usually procuring for the long term when you think
about your long-term growth. Those procurement of things have been made. But
now it is for us to work with our partners to make sure that they can get the boards
and systems to market, but they also how all of the systems, parts and components
that are necessary to put these into market. We feel very good about our guidance
that we provided for Q3. We believe that we have enough supply to serve what we
refer to as the company's growth aspirations for both the second half, as well as
moving into next year.

Q - Ambrish Srivastava
A - Colette KressOkay. And many of the chip companies larger run especially have -- I don't want to
use the word resorted to, but they have resorted to non-cancellable orders, signing
up many diﬀerent ways to really to ensure their own planning and help them
planned capacity. So Colette, what is NVIDIA done to ensure that your planning, your
capacity better in order to meet the demand given all the challenges on the supply
side?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We can break down your question regarding planning into diﬀerent types of areas.
What we're doing for overall consumer planning, consumer gaming planning and
then what we are doing for the overall enterprises, particularly as we deal with data
center and data center compute. From a planning perspective of gaming, we do
take the role of making sure we have a good understanding of the growth that could
happen in terms of consumer gaming and we will plan from a both a consolidated
level how to think about that levels of supply that would need to be available in the
channel at any point in time.
As we leave the end of Q2 and go into Q3, our overall supply levels at the channel
are still quite lean. So we have a goal to continue to improve those levels to allow
GeForce cards to be available to our gamers as we move forward. Now that is
working with each of our channel partners to understand what is available in the
channel, how we can continue to serve those diﬀerent markets, those diﬀerent
regions in terms of the types of parts that they want. That is where our long-term
planning comes into mind. It shows how do we restore those channel levels.
Now when we look at overall data center, purchasing overall data center compute is
a long process, both planning in terms of what the customer would like also
planning on our side, because many of our products that we ship for the data center
take quite a bit of time to produce from end to end. So you could think that most of
our supply planning has been over a long period of time for us to serve this market.
And now, we are trying to ﬁnd those solutions for our customers. There will continue
to be areas where we have to focus with our OEMs, with our partners to assure that
everything that is needed for the data center is available both of the OEMs, as well
as through NVIDIA just several overall customers.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Okay, that's very helpful. Let me switch gears to a longer term and this was a
question that Jensen did address to a certain extent during the earnings call, your
software strategy. It seems, as he mentioned, it's a multi-billion opportunity and the
way I think about it obviously has very positive implications for the operating on. So
the question here is just recap for us please what are the three pillars for the software
strategy as you have laid out? And then I had a couple of follow-ups on that.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Absolutely, great question. We're not new to software. We're not new to software, a
very large portion of our systems that we provide throughout all of our market
platforms incorporate software, and we have three diﬀerent ways to deliver software
value to our customers. First, software and hardware could be oﬀered separately.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24

Q - Ambrish Srivastava
A - Colette Kress
Q - Ambrish SrivastavaThis is a case where we're talking now that we may enable a software oﬀering to the
enterprise channel that they purchase through our OEM partners. Number two,
software and hardware could be delivered together as a platform. This is very
common, what we do with our CSPs and/or hyperscales.
And number three, for the community as a whole, whether you think of research,
education, start-ups, our software is free. This is the underpinnings for example of
Kuder over the last decade in terms of how we provided, providing them the
capability to learn the overall development platform and think of new opportunities
and how to use it. The functionality and support level with each of these three is
diﬀerent for each of that. Enterprises, for example, may prefer to pay for what they
have in mission-critical software and related support.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
And then what are the milestones that we should be -- Investors should be looking at
to see the if they purchased is being adopted and recognized revenues are not that
immediate, but how will you inform the community to be aware of the practices on
this front?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. We're happy to share in the next couple of years in terms of how we're doing
in our speciﬁc software approach, if it is a separate purchase from the overall
hardware. We're just entering in the space of an important era of industrial growth.
Industrial growth that will use AI and use our software, so you will likely see ﬁrst
something in terms of the overall bookings of what we're seeing in software and
then in the future what we'll see in terms of on the income statement in terms of
revenue. As we go from time to time, we'll be happy to share what we're seeing in
that area.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Can you share with us some examples of some early wins that you've had since you
oﬃcially rolled it out, the texture was before you told us about it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So we have been working on many diﬀerent types of subscriptions with key
providers out there. Many of our OEMs are now fully trained to sell our overall
software applications, whether that be base command, ﬂeet command, enterprise AI
software. So we'll in the future talk about those key lighthouse wins and maybe the
size of what we're seeing in terms of the number of pickup from that.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Got it, got it. Okay. Let's switch to the demand drivers for each of the segments, and
we will start with gaming ﬁrst. And you're four quarters into the Ampere launch. And
I think you mentioned about 20% of the installed basis upgraded. So just help us
understand typically how long does it take and to what extent does the asset
brought out in terms of the upgrade cycle?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24

It's an important area of focus on regarding our Ampere architecture and the
performance that has been delivered with our Ampere architecture for gaming, but
also on the surge of gaming and the use of overall real time ray tracing. When we
think about the Ampere architecture, it's in its fairly early part of the architecture as a
whole. We've probably been in market for about a year, and we are continuing to
provide new cards into the market at this time.
Now, when we talk about that 20%. The 20% relates to the percentage of folks that
have upgraded in our installed base to either Ampere or are able to take part in
terms of ray tracing. So that will incorporate some of our prior architecture then
incorporated ray tracing. This is now looking at 80% of our installed base that's still
has the opportunity to upgrade with the Ampere architecture.
Now, just looking at our prior architecture, which you can even look at our Pascal
architecture and understand the great performance enhancement, now that you
have available to you with Ampere going forward. We still have lean supply out in
the market, and we do believe we'll continue to serve the gaming market with more
cards in the quarters to come. So as we move into this back-to-school season, as well
as the holiday, we will look to upgrade the installed base, but also add new gamers
who are interested in the Ampere architecture and the availability of our supply.
When we move from architecture to architecture. It's not uncommon that we will
reach a portion of our installed based on the most current architecture, but it may
not be the majority of the installed base on that speciﬁc architecture, we may take
that opportunity to move to a new architecture to entice even more excitement of
the performance and the games that were coming out. But right now, getting ready
for the overall holiday season, will be ready with Ampere architecture in the market.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
And Colette, what is the right way to think about the installed base? A few years ago,
it was relatively simple. I say relatively simple, you could look at desktop sold now it's
laptops, it's cloud gaming, it's e-gaming, how do you, when you think about the
installed base, what's the right way investors should be thinking about it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The way to think about the installed base is there are hundreds of millions of overall
gamers that are out there. And you're correct, there's many diﬀerent ways that you
can now achieve overall gaming. You can have multiple devices. You can be
leveraging the cloud for your experience because now we're enabling not just on a
standard desktop or notebook, but supporting many diﬀerent Ethernet structures to
support the overall cloud as well. So this is a ability for us to look at many of the on
mine gaming sites to really see how well NVIDIA GPUs are serving in there. We
continue to be one of the fastest growing GPUs on the list of many of these sites,
such as staying in. So this is an area where we focus on, but we have continued to
provide more and more opportunities and options for our gamers to take advantage
of high end gaming.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24

On the mix of laptop industrial, could you remind us what have you said publicly
about how big is the laptop business now as a percent of overall or as a percent
versus desktops?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So far year-to-date, we've talked quite a bit about new laptops, high-end laptops that
leverage our Max-Q technology available for overall gaming, both the thin and light
has been an important area where gamers would like to see, and there has been
very, very successful. Our notebooks are growing quite well over the last couple of
years, not just this year to date and now represents probably 30% of our overall
gaming business with our notebooks.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Okay, thank you. Question on crypto, I'd say you guys did a great job, not only in
addressing it with the CMP product line, but also in communicating with us much
earlier than the prior time. So just remind us regarding your conﬁdence on the
comments you made, which I thought was pretty meaningful that you said that you
expect CMP to be pretty almost I think that may not have been the word you used
immaterial to the business going forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So let me remind everybody in terms of how we addressed the two important
areas of both gaming, but as well as our overall crypto mining. We are focused, ﬁrst,
on getting our GeForce gaming cards into the hands of gamers. And this last
quarter, the Ampere GPU cards have been one of our fastest ramping. We believe
we've been successful with our strategy. I just want to remind everybody, though,
that it is diﬃcult for us to estimate the impact of crypto currency mining on our sales
as we just don't have visibility into the end use of our GPUs.
However, our strategy involves providing CMP, Crypto Mining Processor, cards to
professional miners and low hash rate cards GeForce cards for our gamers. This
allows us to steer about supply to our gamers, low hash rate cards shipped in Q2
were over 80% of our Q2 Ampere desktop GPU shipments, and we are early in the
process for both the Ampere architecture and RTX. Now we're starting to see those
GeForce retail prices directionally starting to move lower, but we'll have to see some
additional work on getting to retail prices down.
When you think about what we provided in terms of crypto currencies moving into
Q3, our choice was we expect CMPs, CMP that we will ship to be minimal going
forward. We look at this as an area, a lot of diﬀerent drivers out there, inﬂuencing that
even in this last quarter, we saw proﬁtability from mining quite volatile and changing
in terms of lower, as well as the overall regulatory areas in certain regions to be
diﬃcult for the overall crypto. So right now, our outlook for Q3 is minimal CMP for
the quarter and we'll focus again on low hash rate cards for our gamers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24

Q - Ambrish Srivastava{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Great. Let me switch over to the data center side. You provided a very robust
guidance for the data center business and sounds like it's a combination of both the
verticals and the hyperscaler driving that growth. And I was a little bit surprised that
HPC and I should have been, but it's become such a smaller piece of the business
that move verticals and hyperscalers are roughly half and half. Can you just, I think,
with the exception of the one year, two, three years ago when we have the deep pull
down and data center spend which did impact your business. It seems to you're
relatively immune from the server cycle. But on the ﬂip side, with the new server
refreshes coming both from Intel and from AMT, does that add a booster to the
business? Or we should still think that on the enterprise side it's still or all of the
hyperscale side is really immune to that refresh?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So when we look at our outlook for data center going into Q3 and the accelerated
growth that we're seeing, we've also accelerated growth in Q2 and Q3, in line with
what our commentary have been that the second half of the ﬁscal year was a great
opportunity, as the economy improved, as we started to see enterprises start to
open up that they would focus in terms of AI, high performance computing types of
solutions at this time. That's what we're seeing both with the hyperscales as they
build both for internal, you've seen some very important drivers of that, whether that
be conversational AI, whether that be recommendators which are very important, as
well as infrastructure needed for the metaverse as we move forward.
Those cloud instances are also an area of growth. And those are, where our
industries have focused as well as in terms of crack cloud instances for their
compute. But moving to our vertical industries, our vertical industries, this is a time
for them to focus on acceleration, focus in terms of inferencing in all of the work that
they do. And as you discussed, we see about an equal break out between what we
sell to the hyperscales as well as we sell individually to the vertical industries. Our
supercomputing is a relatively small portion. But our high performance computing
parts of that along with AI are included in our vertical industries pieces of that.
Now when we think about those demand drivers for the enterprise inference,
inferencing doubled in Q2. We expect that growth of inferencing and more to
growth to occur in the second half of the year. So we're aligned with whatever
choice a customer may need. As you know, we're agnostic to the overall CPU that
they would like to provide, whether that comes from some of our peers or whether
nothing even want an ARM overall servers going forward as well. So we'll continue to
support them in each of those markets.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Great. And thanks for the correction I misspoke. I should have said supercomputing
in my head I always still think of HPC is supercomputing interchangeably. Can we
talk about inferencing? You had an interesting comment during the earnings call and
you highlighted that as well in the growth that you're seeing versus T4. What is the
landscape looking like? Are you -- is that similar to a big chunk of it should be similarFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24

A - Colette Kressto a greenﬁeld opportunity opening up? But it sounds like you should be also taking
share in this side. So just help us understand how much of this is brand new
opportunities opening up as a result of training on NVIDIA systems that there is now
translating into inferencing versus share shifts?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
When we entered into inferencing or when we communicated that our strategy of
moving into the inferencing market several years ago, we entered into the market
understanding that our market share was going to start with zero that this was an
area that historically had been HCP market. However, the overall inferencing
demand and the type of inferencing that customers are doing is quite diﬀerent than
the past. The inferencing of today is strong (Technical Diﬃculty) high and
performance necessary for very (Technical Diﬃculty) inferencing speciﬁc
performance cards. This has been our prior architecture T4, but as we discussed,
we've also come out with A30. A30 is based on the Ampere architecture and
delivers a signiﬁcant performance improvement to what we had T4. We saw that in
this last quarter more than double, but our A100 as well serves both as a training
overall system solution and an overall inferencing solution is not required (Technical
Diﬃculty)
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
(Technical Diﬃculty) driven by the verticals or by the hyperscale companies?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It is both. Your hyperscales will provide in terms of cloud instances that many of your
vertical industries will use those cloud instances. This is a case where end customers
made by an EGX server and OEM certiﬁed server as well (Technical Diﬃculty) to do
their inferencing. This can be inferencing on the edge inferencing of consolidate
(Technical Diﬃculty)
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
(Technical Diﬃculty) power through (Technical Diﬃculty) it had a very, very
meaningful step up. Is that something you typically see with a new architecture is
adopted and then and seems like this is a very diﬀerent architecture that the
community is not getting the hands on. So how should we expect the trajectory of
this business from here on?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Professional visualization did have a very strong quarter in Q2, growing more than
150% year-over-year. Thinking about the year ago quarter, the year-ago quarter was
one of the very ﬁrst quarters during the initial (Technical Diﬃculty) of getting
infrastructure to their employees as they work from home. So a lot of that
purchasing, that refreshing probably stalled in the year ago quarter. But looking at
the current quarter, we are seeing both refreshing, we are seeing enterprises reopen
and serve their customers. But I think what is also important is the Ampere
architecture four, ﬁve and enterprise solutions as well. This has been a great quarter,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 13Q - Ambrish Srivastava
A - Colette Kresswhere Ampere is a meaningful part of our sales within progress. The ﬁrst quarter that
we're seeing a full quarter of serving ambition for this market.
Not only is ray tracing important for gaming, it provides a lot of solutions for
independent creators, those focused on product design and those working in many
of our enterprises now solely as a whole a part of overall companies and working on
product designs. So we're very pleased with this overall growth that we saw, a little
bit of a lot of diﬀerent things, but deﬁnitely, what you're seeing is the demand for
high end graphics and enterprise as well.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Okay. I wanted to switch to automotive, and I couldn't help stop thinking last week
when all the information came out of Tesla is pretty impressive. D1 chip and talking
about the application or if at all. There is very few companies that have that kind of
internal capability. And you have built a pretty big pipeline, which comprises of more
than just hardware. So just help us understand how should we think about the timing
when this business switches from the legacy infotainment to sell these new initiatives
that you have been getting traction with and especially as it relates to autonomous
driving, because then the leader in that company showcases AI, we know that the
rest of them can be developing or they might be developing their own solutions, but
just help us understand the dispositioning and what you're seeing in the pipeline?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So when you think about our automotive business, right now, there's two
pieces of focus. One, the legacy infotainment business. We've been a part of that
business for more than a decade. And this is an area that we'll probably see a
decline over the next year or so, as we move to focus on non-commodity and
focused on autonomous driving. We've talked about in the last couple of quarters,
our pipeline. Our pipeline to revenue is more than $8 billion going out to 2027. A
good part of that is our focus in terms of our agreement that we have with Daimler
for all of their ﬂeet of cars to hit over the next several years. You will see an inﬂection
point, probably in the next year and a half or so as our autonomous driving solutions
hit in terms of the market from both passenger cars, but also robotaxis and our
overall trucking.
We focus on an end-to-end platform. We focus on end-to-end platform that starts
even today as the automotive companies have infrastructure inside of their data
centers to build out and develop for what they will have in terms of autonomous
vehicles in the decade going forward. And we provide probably the strongest
performance, but also complete solution from the overall hardware inside of the car
and software as we move forward.
In the case of Tesla, they had really demonstrated or validated our full stack
approach and the importance of our innovation through systems, networking and
software in terms of what we've put together. It's interesting to see Tesla in terms of
their overall performance. Always keep in mind, NVIDIA is still working every single
day on our roadmap. And I'm sure there will be more that we'll be able to show both
our customers as well as our investors in terms of what we deliver.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24

Great. I think we are close to running out of time, but I wanted to touch on the CPU
strategy kind of related to that is a question on ARM. I think you addressed it,
particularly during the earnings call, but for those who might have missed it, can you
give us a quick update on ARM? And then more importantly, on your CPUs strategy,
which is with or without ARM as part of NVIDIA you are continuing to execute on?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So let me ﬁrst start with our overall CPU strategy, Grace. Grace is designed for our
giant scale high performance computing and AIs use cases, where memory capacity,
bandwidth, energy eﬃciencies are always considerations and constraining factors.
So this is a case where Grace is not designed to be a commodity CPU. It is going to
be the largest CPU ever made, but what is important is Grace is designed to be
tightly coupled with our GPUs. It's about full stack innovation and thinking about the
CPU, the GPU, the DPU, compute, storage and networking in the data center as a
whole. We'll hopefully see 10x higher performance, 10x the energy eﬃciency as well
as 30x higher GPU to CPU bandwidth with Grace. We're expecting Grace to start
shipping in calendar 2023.
Now when you think about our ARM. ARM is a great overall acquisition. We have
been working with regulators throughout this last year, and we do believe they
should understand the beneﬁts of the ARM acquisition, both to customers, to the
industry and to ARM. However, it is taking a little bit longer than we expected to both
answer questions and move through the regulatory process in many of these
jurisdictions. So we will come back later with in terms of the timing of when do we
think this will close. But right now, we are focusing on all of the jurisdictions across
the world.

Great. I have a question from an investor. And the question is on the gaming
inventory, while we understand that gaming inventory is lean, but is it up? Do you
expect it to increase quarter-over-quarter? And then what do you expect -- what is
the normal level of inventory? I know many years ago, you used to give that number
of it since that you have refrained from actually giving the quarterly the actual
numbers. So if you could please highlight your expectations. And then, what's the
normal level?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Let me break down the question a bit here. So there is channel inventory. There
is channel inventory that says after we provide to the AICs, they provide to the
market for retail and e-tail purchases of our overall gaming cards, as well as number
with our OEMs, as they build out overall notebooks. So that channel inventory is at
lean levels and probably not aligned to where we've normally seen our targeted
levels. We can see this as both levels of weeks of inventory are quite low, but also we
see higher pressures in the market as there is an imbalance in terms of demand and
supply.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-08-24

inventory that we will have in order to produce new products to now send to our
overall AICs and our OEMs. We discussed on the call for Q3, we do expect a
sequential increase in our revenue between Q2 and Q3 or our revenue is expected
to be higher, as we provide more than we did last quarter to our AICs and our OEM
channel partnership this time. But we will at the end of Q3 be continuing to look at
the balance between supply and demand. But in Q3, we are still supply constrained
in terms of what we could provide.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Got it. And not too unrelated, just a question, when do you expect supply to reach a
point where you feel like you're being able to match the demand?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So it's always diﬃcult to determine when and what demand will be over the long
term. However, what we do have in supply is supply to meet our internal projections
for growth, both for the second half of this year, but also what we have planned for
the next year of growth. So we are focused on growth, both in H2, but also growth as
we turn the corner into our new ﬁscal year.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Okay. I think that covers it, Colette. Would you like to leave us some ﬁnal thoughts?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, thank you so much for hosting us here. I think we have some great overall
opportunities with our architecture, Ampere, both for the data center, data center
solutions, our focus on AI, high performance computing and the importance of the
industry moving towards high performance computing and AI or software solutions.
Let's not also forget the importance of high end graphics is not only just a gaming
piece, but is an important part of our enterprise focus as well. We are now in the
second architecture focused on ray tracing and our solutions on our performance
are really in the hearts and minds of these customers. I thank you so much for
hosting us here, and look forward to the next event as well.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you so much, Colette. Always a pleasure. Thank you. Take care,
folks.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Take care. Bye-bye.
