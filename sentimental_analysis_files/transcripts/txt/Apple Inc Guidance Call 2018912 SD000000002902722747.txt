Good morning. Thank you. Welcome to the Steve Jobs Theater. Wasn't that a fun
video? Things certainly do get hectic around here leading up to days like this. But
they're also magical days because we get to share our latest innovations with you.
As you know, Apple was founded to make the computer more personal, of course,
ﬁrst with the Apple II and then later with the Mac. Over the years, we've taken this
mission further than anyone could have imagined. We've created several categories
of technology that have had a profound impact on people's lives, from the iPod to
the iPhone, to the iPad, to the Apple Watch.
And we've completely reinvented the retail experience, making it more personal and
engaging. Our stores have become part of the community. They are open, beautiful
and inspiring places to learn and gather, like this gorgeous store, the Apple Piazza
Liberty, that's revitalizing a plaza in the heart of Milan. The store opened to
thousands of customers who came to experience a weekend full of events. And we
know it's going to be popular for years to come. In fact, our Apple stores are now
welcoming over 500 million visitors per year. Thank you. We love that so many
customers have the chance to experience our products ﬁrsthand and get the
personal help that they need to get the most out of them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12

Page 2 of 26Jeﬀrey E. W illiamsOf course, we aim to put the customer at the center of everything that we do. That's
why iOS is not just the world's most advanced mobile operating system, it's the most
personal. We're about to hit a major milestone. We are about to ship our 2 billionth
iOS device. This is astonishing. iOS has changed the way we live, from the way we
learn, to the way we work, to how we're entertained, to how we shop, order our food,
get our transportation and stay in touch with one another and of course, how we
capture the moments of our lives and share them with those we love.
It's amazing how our mission started with personalizing technology for the desktop,
to now seeing the many ways that we've made it more personal in so many aspects
of our lives. So it's only ﬁtting that today, we're going to tell you about 2 of our most
personal products, the ones that are with you everywhere that you go and how we're
going to take them even further.
So let's get started with the Apple Watch. Yes. We're thrilled by how much the Apple
Watch has grown in such a short period of time. I mean, to think this category didn't
even exist just a few years ago. And now Apple Watch is being embraced by so
many people around the world. Apple Watch is not only the #1 smartwatch in the
world, it's the #1 watch, period.
Apple Watch has redeﬁned what a watch can do for you. It's the integration of
breakthrough technology and powerful software and world-class services that bring
it to life. For millions of people around the world, Apple Watch has become an
indispensable part of their daily lives by helping them stay connected, to be more
active and to live a healthier day.
To tell you how we're going to take Apple Watch to the next level, I'd like to invite
Jeﬀ up. Jeﬀ?
{BIO 16886071 <GO>}
Wow. Thank you. Thank you. We're humbled and inspired by how Apple Watch has
become such an important and even essential part of people's lives. And it's
becoming more indispensable in 3 areas in particular. It keeps you connected to the
people and information you care about with phone calls and messages and
notiﬁcations right on your wrist. And cellular lets you stay connected with just your
Apple Watch even if you leave your phone behind.
Fitness is at the core of Apple Watch, encouraging you to be more active by closing
your rings and tracking your workouts. And now you have built-in GPS. It's swim-
proof. And it even automatically detects when you're working out.
And health. Health has been at the core of Apple Watch as well. Apple Watch put
heart rate monitoring right on the wrist. And while you could always check your heart
rate, Apple Watch now looks in the background and notiﬁes you if it detects an
elevated heart rate. This may seem like a simple change. But we see this in our
customer letters. It's a profound change. Apple Watch has become an intelligent
guardian for your health.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 26Today, in each of these areas, staying connected, living an active life and managing
your health, we're taking Apple Watch to the next level.
And now I'd like to introduce the next generation of Apple Watch.
(video presentation)
Apple Watch Series 4. Everything about it has been redesigned and reengineered.
Every detail has been thoughtfully considered. And it's just beautiful. It all starts with
a stunning new display. We pushed the screens right to the edges and we curved
the corners to perfectly match the shape of the watch. And the screens are
signiﬁcantly larger. In fact, they're over 30% larger. Thank you. And we've done this
with minimal changes to the case size. Series 4 is thinner so there's actually less total
volume than in Series 3. And to take advantage of the new display, every part of the
UI has been redesigned.
You'll see more in Maps and photo and calendar. And we've created new
complications. They look beautiful and they show even more information and detail.
And we've also designed a brand-new watch face with up to 8 complications that
really brings them to life. And you can customize it with the things you care about.
Now you can add loved ones to your watch face and simply tap to connect with
them. Or if you're traveling, you can customize a watch face to track the diﬀerent
time zones. Or maybe you want to create the ultimate health and ﬁtness watch.
We also redesigned the modular face, with more detailed and graphical information
from apps like Stocks and heart rate and activity and even apps from our developers.
So now you can track the live score of your favorite team with MLB At Bat. Your
boarding information will appear right on your watch face with the Qantas app. Or
you can glance at nutritional intake with the LifeSum app.
Next, the Breathe app has been a popular way for people to take a moment to be
more mindful. And now the app is available as a watch face. So with a simple raise of
the wrist, the watch face will guide you through a deep breath. And there are 3
beautiful variations to choose from. It's a little hypnotic. It's kind of wonderful.
In addition, we've created some dynamic new watch faces that uniquely interact with
the shape of the display. With a ﬁre face, see how the ﬂames subtly illuminate the
ticks of the dial? And the new water face, notice how the bubbles splash oﬀ the
edges? And the vapor face looks amazing with the rich, vibrant colors. We think
you're going to love everything about the new displays on Series 4.
Next, let's turn to the Digital Crown. Digital Crown's been completely reengineered.
And it now includes haptic feedback, giving you a more responsive and mechanical
feel. It's especially great in apps like podcasts and calendar, where you precisely ﬂip
through each item.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 4 of 26The speaker has also been completely redesigned. It's 50% louder, which is great for
phone calls and Walkie-Talkie or Siri requests. Yes. Ask Siri something on Series 4
and she comes back with volume. You just won't believe the sound you get out of
such a small device. We moved the microphone on Series 4 to the opposite side as
far away from the speaker as possible to reduce echo, making phone calls even
clearer. And the back of Series 4 is absolutely beautiful. It's made entirely of black
ceramic and sapphire crystal. And it's not only beautiful, it's highly functional. Radio
waves can now pass through both the front and the back, resulting in improved
cellular reception. So this, along with the new speaker and microphone, makes
Series 4 even better for staying connected.
Series 4 is just as impressive on the inside. The brain of Series 4 is our fourth-
generation silicon-in-package, or SiP. And we call it S4. And it allows us to build in so
many capabilities in such a small device. S4 contains a powerful new dual-core 64-bit
processor and a new GPU, both custom-designed by our Apple silicon team to
deliver up to 2x faster performance.
On Apple Watch, the accelerometer and gyroscope, they power important
experiences like all-day activity tracking or even identifying your swim stroke. Well
Series 4 has a next-generation accelerometer and gyroscope with twice the dynamic
range, measuring up to 32 g-forces and can sample motion data 8x faster. You
probably have no idea what any of that means. But that's okay because we do and
it's allowed us to do something new.
One of the leading causes of injuries worldwide is falls. So whether you slip oﬀ a
step ladder or you trip on a curb, a hard fall can be serious and it can be diﬃcult to
get immediate help. Well now Apple Watch Series 4 can detect a fall. It's interesting,
identifying a fall may sound like a straightforward problem. But it requires a
tremendous amount of data and analysis. We conducted studies with thousands of
people over a long period of time. And we captured data on real-world falls. And we
learned something. We learned that with falls, there's this repeatable motion pattern
that happens. For example, when you trip, your body will naturally pitch forward and
your arms will go out involuntarily to brace yourself. However, if you slip, there's a
natural upward motion of the arms.
Well these are motions Series 4 is ideally suited to recognize. With a new
accelerometer and gyroscope, the watch analyzes wrist trajectory and impact
acceleration to determine when a fall occurs. And after detecting a fall, Series 4
delivers an alert. And from that alert, you can initiate an emergency call. However, if
the watch senses you are immobile for 1 minute, it will start the call automatically.
And it also sends a message with your location to your emergency contacts, using
the SOS feature that is already built into Apple Watch. Fall detection is a feature that
we hope you never need. But it's really nice to know it's there.
The optical heart sensor has been essential to Apple Watch from the beginning. And
it allows us to calculate the calorie burn during your workouts. It allows us to
determine your resting heart rate. And it's -- it also powers the high heart rate
notiﬁcation that's helped Apple Watch become an intelligent guardian for yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 5 of 26Dr. Ivor J. Benjaminhealth. We wanted to do even more in this space. And so we're announcing 3 new
heart features.
First, a notiﬁcation if your heart rate appears to be too low. Now generally, a low
heart rate is thought to be a good thing. But if it's too low, it might mean that your
heart is not pumping enough blood to the body. And that could be a sign of
something serious. And now Apple Watch can detect it.
The second feature is related to heart rhythm. And this is a big deal. Apple Watch
can now screen your heart rhythm in the background. And it sends you a notiﬁcation
if it detects an irregular rhythm that appears to be atrial ﬁbrillation. Now, it won't
catch every instance of AFib. But we believe this is going to help a lot of people who
didn't otherwise know they had an issue.
The ﬁrst 2 features, they're powered by the optical sensor. The third feature is made
possible by a new electrical heart sensor on Series 4. We've added electrodes into
the back sapphire crystal and the Digital Crown, allowing you to take an
electrocardiogram. It's otherwise known as an ECG. And this is the ﬁrst ECG product
oﬀered over the counter, directly to consumers. An ECG measures the electrical
activity of the heartbeat. And it's used by physicians to help diagnose certain heart
diseases and other conditions. And so now you can take an ECG anytime, anywhere
right from your wrist. You just open the app and you put your ﬁnger on the Digital
Crown.
To show you how this works, let's take a closer look. The built-in electrodes in the
back crystal and the Digital Crown, they detect electrical impulses from the
heartbeat. They route them to the S4 chip, which converts them to signal for our
algorithms. The entire process takes just 30 seconds. And at the completion of the
ECG recording, you will receive a heart rhythm classiﬁcation. If your heart is beating
in a normal rhythm, the app will classify the measurement as sinus rhythm. And the
app will also classify atrial ﬁbrillation. All ECG recordings, their classiﬁcations, the
noted symptoms, they're all stored right in the health app in a PDF you can share
with your doctor. So now your doctor has a detailed picture of your heart rhythm
similar to a Lead I ECG that is usually only obtained in the clinic.
And to give you his thoughts on this, I'd like to invite to the stage the President of the
American Heart Association and also a practicing cardiologist, Dr. Ivor Benjamin.
Thank you, Jeﬀ. I'm inspired by the lifesaving potential of technology and applaud
Apple's innovation and commitment to health. Capturing meaningful data about a
person's heart in real time is changing the way we practice medicine. In my
experience, people often report symptoms that are absent during their medical
visits. That is why information is vital, information about a person's daily lifestyle
choices and their speciﬁc health data. The ability to access health data on an on-
demand electrocardiogram, or ECG, is game-changing, especially when evaluatingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 26Jeﬀrey E. W illiamsatrial ﬁbrillation, an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase a person's
risk of stroke, heart failure and other health-related complications.
At the American Heart Association, we are committed to educate and empower
people to be proactive in all areas of their health and general well-being. The
American Heart Association is a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives.
Products that seek to provide deeper health insights, like the Apple Watch Series 4,
oﬀer great potential in getting us there. Thank you. Back to you, Jeﬀ.
{BIO 16886071 <GO>}
Thank you. Thanks, Dr. Benjamin. It's great to have the support of the American Heart
Association. And I'm also pleased to say we've received clearance from the FDA.
And this is a de novo clearance, which means it's the ﬁrst of its kind. Also, the
irregular heart rhythm alert has also received FDA clearance. Both of these features
will be available to U.S. customers later this year. And we're working hard to bring
them to customers around the world.
I just have to show you, when you open the app, this is what you see on the watch
face. It's really beautiful. People, in general, don't like things that are medical. This
kind of makes you want to take an ECG. It's amazing to think that the same watch
you wear every day to make phone calls and respond to messages, track your
activity, like even run a marathon, can now take an ECG.
Apple Watch Series 4 is the ultimate guardian for your health, the best ﬁtness
companion and the most convenient way to stay connected. And with all these
amazing features, of course, your data is still protected. At Apple, we believe your
personal information belongs to you. You should decide who you share it with and
who gets to see it, period. All your health and ﬁtness data there, it's encrypted on the
device and in the cloud.
So Apple Watch Series 4, larger display, brand-new UI, Digital Crown with haptics, up
to 2x faster performance, a louder speaker, fall detection and an industry ﬁrst, built-in
electrical heart sensor capable of taking an ECG and of course, cellular, GPS,
altimeters, swim-proof. And I've probably missed some things. We also have the
most advanced wearable operating system, watchOS 5.
So with all of these features in a slimmer design, you're probably wondering about
battery life. Well I'm pleased to tell you that Series 4 has the same 18-hour, all-day
battery life that our customers enjoy on Apple Watch. And we've increased the
outdoor workout time to 6 hours so you can have full GPS tracking which is perfect
for those marathons or long bike rides. And of course, Apple Watch has been
designed and manufactured in an environmentally friendly way.
We've created a video about Series 4. And I'd like to show that to you now.

{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you. I could not be more excited about the Apple Watch Series 4.
Apple Watch is really redeﬁning what a watch can do for you. Now we made a video
about how the Apple Watch is inspiring people all around the world to be more
active. And I'd love to run it for you now. I think you're going to get a kick out of it.
(video presentation)
We really love what the Apple Watch is doing to get the world moving. So that is
Apple Watch. Now let's talk about iPhone.
iPhone X deﬁned the future of the smartphone. It introduced new technologies that
is at the cutting edge of what's possible, with a stunning all-screen design and
intuitive gestures, with technologies like the TrueDepth camera system in Face ID,
where your phone knows what you look like and your face becomes your password.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 26Philip W. SchilleriPhone X has an incredible camera system that uses intelligent software to make the
most stunning portraits. This was only previously possible with pro-level equipment.
And there are so many other innovative technologies that are built right in. And of
course, all of them are powered by the world's most advanced mobile operating
system, iOS. iPhone X has changed the industry. And along the way, it became the #1
smartphone in the world. But what's most important to us is that it's the most loved
smartphone with an amazing 98% customer satisfaction.
Now today, we're going to take iPhone X to the next level. I'm excited to show you
what is by far the most advanced iPhone we have ever created.
(video presentation)
This is iPhone Xs. It is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created. And I'd like to
invite Phil up to tell you all about it. Phil?
{BIO 1921735 <GO>}
Thank you, Tim. Well. Good morning, everyone. I am so excited to tell you all about
iPhone Xs. It is made of a surgical-grade stainless steel. It has a gorgeous new gold
ﬁnish on the front and on the glass. It is the most beautiful iPhone we have ever
made. The screen goes top to bottom, edge to edge, rounded into the corners. And
it's covered on the front and the back with a new formulation of glass that is the most
durable glass ever in a smartphone.
iPhone Xs comes in 3 ﬁnishes: gold; silver; and space gray. They are beautiful. And
they're protected from dust and liquids to an even higher level now, IP68. That
means it's protected to 2 meters for up to 30 minutes. So if you happen to be
hanging by the pool, drop your phone in the water, don't worry. Dive down, grab it,
rinse it, let it dry, you'll be ﬁne. And the team tested it in many diﬀerent liquids, in
chlorinated water, salt water, orange juice, tea, lime, even beer. And this is some of
the most fun, intense testing we get to do at Apple.
Now the screen on iPhone Xs is a Super Retina display, the best we've made yet. It's
an OLED display, 5.8 inches on the diagonal. It has 2.7 million pixels, 458 pixels per
inch, the highest-quality display on an iOS device.
Now let's put it side by side with our plus-size phone, an iPhone 8 Plus. And as you
can see, it's as big a display as the plus-size phone. But in a smaller design. And so
many customers love that about that, big display, easy, comfortable to hold in your
hand. And it looks incredible. Watching movies on it, the latest HDR movies like Lego
Batman, using the latest formats, Dolby Vision, HDR10. Your photos look stunning on
iPhone Xs. You shoot them with beautiful wide color. And they display better than
ever on the new Super Retina display because it has a 60% greater dynamic range
for colors in your photos than the iPhone X's display. It is gorgeous.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 26Well the iPhone Xs has not just one. But 2 sizes of display, the 5.8-inch and a new
6.5-inch Super Retina display. This is the biggest display ever on an iPhone. It is an
OLED display as well, 3.3 million pixels, 458 pixels per inch again.
Now a lot of our customers have loved the plus-size iPhones. So let's put that side by
side. You can see, it's about the same-sized phone with a much larger display. We
think there are a lot of customers who are going to love this larger display.
Now the 5.8-inch, we already said, was as big as a plus-size display. So what do you
call a phone that's bigger than plus-size? Well we call it the iPhone Xs Max.
And the Max is an incredible experience. Watching videos on it is cinematic. Looking
at your photos bigger than ever is incredible. Surﬁng the web, looking at ﬂyovers
and map, even when you're using some of the built-in apps, the team's taken
advantage of the wider display when it's in horizontal mode to give you a split view
like here in contacts. It's awesome for editing videos in iMovie, for creating songs
with GarageBand. And even playing immersive killer games is so much fun on the
iPhone Xs Max.
So there are 2 Super Retina displays now, 5.8-inch, 6.5-inch, both OLED displays,
both 1 million:1 contrast ratio. They're HDR displays. They're fast, 120 hertz, touch-
sensitive layer. That's how it gets its smooth scrolling, really fast typing and gaming
response. They both have 3D touch for pressure sensitivity. They have tap to wake,
they have incredible color management. They're a true-tone display. So the paper
white looks just right in all the diﬀerent lighting that you use it. And they have wide
color. These are amazing displays.
And we've matched them to incredible sound systems as well, stereo sounds better
than in any iPhone to date. Now with the Xs, you get a wider stereo ﬁeld. The team
has matched powerful speakers with great software to deliver an even richer sound
experience. So watching movies sounds incredible. And playing games, like Alto
Odyssey, which, previously, you tried to put on headphones, now you just want to
listen through the speakers because of that beautiful wide stereo sound. Of course,
listening to music and watching music videos like the Foo Fighters sounds better
than ever.
All right. Let's talk about Face ID. Face ID is a huge step forward in biometric
protection for all of our personal data on our devices. And customers love it. It is
powered by our TrueDepth camera system. And there's so much technology in that
little space right there: an infrared camera; ﬂood illuminator; proximity sensor;
ambient light sensor; dot projector; front camera; speaker; and microphone, all
working together to give protection to the data on our devices. And they're
designed with multiple neural networks. So it's secure and seamless in the iPhone
experience.
With iPhone Xs, you just pick up your iPhone, look at it, it recognizes your face and
unlocks your notiﬁcations and information. And it does it faster than ever beforeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 10 of 26because the Xs now has faster algorithms and runs on a faster version of the Secure
Enclave. So it's gotten even better.
Face ID works remarkably well, in fact, we're proud to say it is the most secure facial
authentication ever in a smartphone. And powering Face ID in everything we do on
the iPhone is our A-series chip. And the team has worked so hard to make every
generation of the A-series chip better than any in ever -- ever in a smartphone. And
this year is no exception. What the team has done is truly, truly breakthrough. It's
called the A12 Bionic.
And the A12 Bionic is the industry's ﬁrst 7-nanometer chip. And that's a huge
breakthrough, yes. Now the A12 Bionic is packed with 6.9 billion transistors. And
what the team has done with all that is remarkable. So let's go through some of the
things in this chip. We're talking about the CPU, the GPU and the Neural Engine.
Let's start with the CPU. It is an Apple-designed 6-core CPU, this is a fusion system, it
has 2 high-performance cores, 4 high-eﬃciency cores. The 2 high-performance cores
run up to 15% faster than the cores in the A11 Bionic, while also being 40% more
energy-eﬃcient. In the high eﬃciency cores, up to 50% more energy-eﬃcient. And
all 6 cores can run at once.
The GPU, well, this is an Apple-designed GPU. It is so powerful. Now the A11 GPU
was already ahead of anything else in the industry. The A12 GPU is now up to 50%
faster than the A11. So a huge jump in graphics performance.
But the real advancement, the real blow-away thing is this Neural Engine. And you
know we introduced the ﬁrst Neural Engine last year with the A11 Bionic. With the A12
Bionic, we take it much further. The A11 was a 2-core design. This is an 8-core
dedicated machine learning engine to power all that great machine learning
software on our systems. And it has a smart compute system. What that means, it's
able to analyze the neural network data and ﬁgure out on the ﬂy whether to run it on
the CPU, the GPU or the Neural Engine. I mean, this is breakthrough. And the
performance is unmatched. We told you, last year, the A11 Bionic could process an
insane 600 billion operations per second. Well the A12 Bionic is able to process 5
trillion operations per second. Unbelievable.
Now the A12 Bionic is a complete system-on-a-chip. So there's so much more. And
the team works very hard to be just as innovative at every one of these things in the
A12 Bionic. It has a next-generation Image Signal Processor, incredible video coders
and decoders. There's our display engine, our audio system. Of course, it has the
secure enclave. It has memory controllers, storage controllers. The Apple-designed
storage controller in the A12 Bionic can now address twice as much internal storage
as previously. So now you can have up to 512 gigabytes of internal storage if you
want. So that's 0.5 terabyte on your iPhone in your pocket. That's enough for over
200,000 photos stored on your iPhone. It is incredible.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 11 of 26Kaiann DranceThis A12 Bionic is, without question, the smartest and most powerful chip ever in a
smartphone. Because so much of the experience we have with iPhone is driven by
this chip. And it is going to enable us to have so many great new experiences not
possible before. So I'm very excited to bring out Kaiann Drance to show you just
what we can do with iPhone. And Kaiann is our Senior Director of iPhone Product
Marketing. Kaiann?
Thank you, Phil. Thank you. A12 Bionic was designed for iPhone, not any other
smartphone. This is one of the reasons why our team can deliver a chip designed for
incredible performance, great battery life for everything iPhone needs, from our
everyday tasks, to our most advanced technologies. Such as every time you look at
your phone and unlock it with Face ID or play an immersive game on our edge-to-
edge Super Retina display and each time you take a remarkable photo. Every single
thing you do touches the chip, the CPU, the GPU or any other powerful component
all throughout, best-in-class and designed for iPhone for the very best performance.
So next time you unlock your phone, perhaps launch Photo, searching through the
thousands of photos you have, ﬁnd just the one you're looking for, deciding how to
share it amongst diﬀerent apps, such as Messages. And then moving on to the next
thing with multitasking, perhaps landing in Maps to ﬁnd directions. A12 Bionic makes
these everyday tasks feel fast and eﬀortless. And A12 Bionic, with the performance
updates in iOS 12, helps apps launch up to 30% faster.
So we're focused on these everyday experiences. But even beyond that, such as
those that make use of machine learning. Now we've used machine learning for a
number of years now to make our features even better: such as QuickType
suggestions in Messages; in Memories, how we curate your photos and videos;
getting real time suggestions in Maps when you need them; our true-tone adaptive
display; of course, ﬁnding the very best photo of your cat or other pets.
But what's really remarkable this year is that our next-generation Neural Engine
unlocks the power of real time machine learning. This is incredibly important for
apps like camera. And we use that depth information for portrait mode and portrait
lighting, in Animojis, mapping those 50 diﬀerent facial muscles over your face in a
live FaceTime call. That is computationally really intense. And of course, our
immersive AR experiences, our fun new Memoji. And the new Clips app launching
this fall will make use of portrait segmentation on the Neural Engine for even better
selﬁe scenes like the one you see here in Incredibles 2.
In iOS 12, we're also announcing and launching Siri Shortcuts. So you can get even
more done with just a tap or by asking Siri to help. You can easily create a shortcut
with multiple steps like the one I used this morning. Let's take a look.
I just press and hold or ask Siri to run my Keynote Day shortcut. Now the ﬁrst thing it
will do, it will kick oﬀ my HomeKit-enabled accessories and then will order my
morning coﬀee. It will tell me how long it takes for me to go pick it up. Then it willFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12

do with Siri Shortcuts.
We're really excited this year to be opening up our Neural Engine to Core ML. And
Core ML is going to get a lot faster. It's going to get up to 9x faster. But it's going to
run with as little as 1/10 the energy. This is tremendous. It means developers can run
their most complex, most advanced neural networks in their apps and do so even
more often, then freeing up the power of the GPU for more immersive graphics like
never before, which, by the way, is really useful for augmented reality. And this is
another area that we're focused on. That camera viewﬁnder has turned into a
wonderful window to these new AR experiences, such as this app here called
FishingGO, that lets you turn your surroundings into this immersive marine aquarium
where you can discover more than 200 species of sea life.
iPhone Xs is the best platform for AR. We custom calibrate our cameras and sensors
for the best AR experience. And A12 Bionic, the GPU, helps us render realistic
graphics, the ISP for real-world lighting and the Neural Engine for object deﬂection
and more. And it joins the best AR software with ARKit 2, where apps can access
enhanced surface and object detection, persistent experiences, multiple users. And
we've even included a new measure app built-in.
And with AR Quick Look, you can look at a 3D object like this one here in Safari. And
with just a tap, bring it out into the real world. Isn't that amazing?
So you've heard some examples today of how A12 Bionic is accelerating real-world
everyday scenarios. But also enabling new experiences. But it doesn't end with us. It
also extends out to our talented pool of developers in that wonderful ecosystem,
where they have access to the best software with iOS 12 and the A12 Bionic. This
takes us to the next generation of apps. And we're thrilled to have 3 developers here
today to show you what's possible in just a short amount of time.
Now our ﬁrst developer is making use of the CPU and GPU to take their game to the
next level of impact. Please welcome Todd Howard, Game Director of Bethesda
Game Studios.

Thanks, Kaiann. Thank you. I wrote my ﬁrst game when I was 12 on an Apple II. And I
got to tell you, I took full advantage of every single one of those low-res 40-by-40
pixels. And it's amazing how far we've come. With the technology that is packed into
our phones, we can now start reaching for games that are more than simple
diversions. But experiences that can truly transport you. And in the new iPhone,
we've been able to do just that. Let's take a look at our new Elder Scrolls game,
Blades. Like this series is known for, it is a massive ﬁrst-person role-playing game full
of stories, quests and an incredible world to explore. You play one of the Blades, the
empire's elite warriors. And you will deﬁne your own character and how you want to
engage in combat. You can use defense, melee or magic.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12

usually miss in the bright and the dark areas. You can see the lighting from these
crystals bloom, reﬂect oﬀ of the water. We can have that lighting bounce oﬀ of the
walls. And we can even have it reﬂect oﬀ of your sword.
Additionally, we can use the new stereo-widening on the iPhone so you can hear the
forest around you, all without headphones. And scenes like this used to only be
possible in your living room on a high-end gaming console. We can do them now on
your phone while doing full-screen post-processing, all while rendering 40% faster
than before.
You'll see the sword follows Craig's speciﬁc movements and timing. It feels
incredible. And that new depth-of-ﬁeld camera eﬀect really lets you focus your
actions during combat. And the spiders are just terrifying.
We've been able to pull oﬀ some incredible environments that just weren't possible
before. 12-year old me would not be able to comprehend all of these pixels, all 2.7
million of them. As we battle this witch, we can use the power of the phone to bring
all those parts together, the visuals, the sound and even haptic feedback on your
attacks. It's not just immersive, it transports you. You may have fought dragons in
Skyrim. But you've never experienced the Elder Scrolls like this and on your phone.
Blades is coming to iOS this fall. It's available for preorder right now. We'll see you
out there.
Thank you, Todd. Now our next developer is going to enable an entirely new use
case for the iPhone camera using Core ML. Here's David Lee, CEO of NEX Team; and
Steve Nash, 2x NBA MVP and a new member of the Basketball Hall of Fame.
{BIO 17122194 <GO>}
Thanks, Kaiann. HomeCourt is an app that uses Core ML to take basketball shots by
simply pointing your iPhone at a court.
{BIO 1745155 <GO>}
When I was young and learning the game, I never really knew if I was doing the right
things to improve my game. I would spend hours and hours shooting by myself, just
hoping I was reﬁning the techniques that would take me to the next level. I've been
working closely with the HomeCourt team on a tool that will revolutionize basketball
training. And I can't wait to show you what we can do with the new iPhone.

With the new iPhone and Core ML 2, we see a massive performance gain that allow
us to do a lot more. The powerful A12 Bionic in our Core ML models run up to 9x
faster. And then unlocks new feature that were not possible before.
Let's take a look at what's going on under the hood. Only on the new iPhone, we can
run real-time player tracking, real-time post estimation, real-time ball detection and
trajectory estimation all at the same time. We call this real-time shot science that
tracks 6 metrics for every single shot the player takes. These insights are not visible
to the naked eye.
{BIO 1745155 <GO>}
To become a great shooter, you need to practice every day. You need to shoot at
game speed and with the right posture. I focus my students on staying low and
stable when they shoot.
HomeCourt is giving players immediate feedback to help them understand if they
are practicing with the right form. Release time is also a great indicator of whether
the player is shooting at game speed while staying low. These meaningful insights
and feedback just weren't possible before.
{BIO 17122194 <GO>}
When you see that release time from the set, it will be displayed on screen. And the
app can also give audio feedback for the built-in stereo speaker or your AirPods.
{BIO 1745155 <GO>}
As players train with real-time feedback, they build muscle memory. I really wish that
when I was younger, we had these tools. HomeCourt is great for every basketball
player who wants to get better, whether you're a beginner or a pro.
{BIO 17122194 <GO>}
The most amazing part is this is all done with just your new iPhone. There are no
sensor on the player, no sensor on the ball and no sensor on the court. And that's
HomeCourt, real-time shot science, shipping, as an update, this fall. Thank you.

Philip W. SchillerOkay. So our third app makes use of AR to do even more in a game. Here's Atli Mar,
CEO of Directive Games.
Thanks, Kaiann. Playing with friends at the arcades has always been a lot of fun.
Generations of gamers have enjoyed countless hours playing some of the world's
best titles. And now in AR, we are able to have our own arcade cabinet wherever and
whenever we want. And with ARKit 2, multiple players are able to share the same AR
experience. Joining me here are my friends. And they are eager to climb the leader
boards. (Andrea), (July), (Alexandra), are you guys ready?
We're ready to battle, Atli.
This is Gallica AR. Just like the classic, you eliminate your enemies. You avoid being
attacked. And you've got (power ups).
With the additional GPU core, we are able to render scenes like the (stun eﬀect). This
is something that we could not do before. And the new iPhone stereo widening
makes things sound really immersive. Just listen to this epic (fought) battle.
Last year, we shipped our ﬁrst AR game. And now, with new features of ARKit 2 and
the power of the new iPhone, we are able to craft experiences at a much higher
ﬁdelity as well as connect players, both digitally and in the physical world. Look for
the ﬁrst game in our AR arcade series on the App Store later this year. Thank you.
Wow. Well we can't wait for you guys to experience those apps and games. This is
really just the beginning. We're scratching the surface of what's going to be possible
on the iPhone Xs and the A12 Bionic. No other chip in the world would allow us to do
this. Thank you. And now back to Phil.
{BIO 1921735 <GO>}
Thank you, Kaiann. The A12 Bionic just powers so many incredible new experiences
and that includes the camera. We all love the cameras in our iPhone. No doubt, you
all know it is the world's most popular camera. And for great reason. Over 10 years,
customers have been taking incredible photographs with their iPhone cameras like
this. And sharing them with us around the world and telling us stories with them. And
we're so proud of all the people who use the iPhone camera, from consumers to
even, increasingly, professionals are using them for photos like this.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 16 of 26This is a beautiful portrait photo. But what makes us so proud of it is that it appeared
on the cover of Time Magazine. Now this is their issue for women who are changing
the world. And we couldn't be prouder to be part of that story.
Well you are going to be blown away with the pictures you can take with the iPhone
Xs's camera. It is a remarkable new dual-camera system. It has a 12-megapixel wide
camera, a 12-megapixel telephoto camera and an even more improved true tone
ﬂash. The 12-megapixel wide camera has a new sensor, a larger sensor with bigger,
deeper pixels that has optical image stabilization in our fast 1.8 aperture lens, Apple's
6-element lens. The wide -- the telephoto camera is also a 12-megapixel camera, also
optical image stabilization f/2.4 Apple-designed lens.
On the front side, you have the TrueDepth camera system. And that's a new sensor
as well, a 7-megapixel sensor that's twice as fast. And it works together with the AR
camera and the dot projector so it can create depth in your portrait mode photos.
And as we talk about cameras, of course, everyone talks about the sensors and the
lens. And rightly so, they're an important part of the camera system. But increasingly,
what makes incredible photos possible aren't just the sensor and the lens. But it's the
chip and the software that runs on it. And this is so true with iPhone photography.
So for example, in the A12 Bionic is the image single processor working together
with the CPU. And it does so many things every time we take a picture. It
automatically sets exposure, white balance, sets the focus. There's noise reduction
and low-light photography that brings out highlights and details. And it can fuse
multiple images together like when you do an HDR photo or create a beautiful
panorama.
And the ISP and the A12 Bionic does all of these better than ever before. But what it
does that is entirely new is connect together the ISP with that neural engine to use
them together to make our photos incredible. So for example, the CPU and the
Neural Engine can work together to do detection of people's faces and bodies to
understand the scene that you're shooting. And it can do facial landmarking. So it
recognizes exactly where the eyes are and does instant red eye reduction that looks
perfect. And it creates better segmentation masks. So even in portrait mode, the hair
and the glasses are better than ever before. This is an amazing amount of power for
our camera team. In fact, when you take a photo, it's capable of doing 1 trillion
operations on every photo you take.
And what the team is doing with that power is truly remarkable. We have a brand-
new feature we call Smart HDR. And we all know what HDR is, right? You can take a
couple of photos and merge them together to bring out highlights and shadows.
And keep your subject looking great. Well Smart HDR takes this idea so much
further. So let's say, you're taking a picture and the camera recognizes you're
shooting a subject. And the subject's moving. You go to press down on the shutter
and you get a picture instantly. It's called zero shutter lag. What the A12 Bionic is
actually doing is shooting a 4-frame buﬀer so it can capture that critical moment. TheFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 17 of 26A12 Bionic is doing even more than that. It's also capturing secondary inter frames at
the same time. And those inter frames are shot at a diﬀerent exposure, able to bring
out highlight details. And it's doing more than that. It's shooting a long exposure so
it can get better shadow detail as well. And when you're taking that picture, it's
analyzing all of those, ﬁnding out how to match up the best parts of each and merge
them into one perfect photo. That's Smart HDR. It is a breakthrough. And it makes
taking photos easier than ever and to get beautiful results.
So let me show you a few photos shot with iPhone Xs, not retouched in any way, no
exterior lighting used, anything else, it's just straight from the camera. So here is one.
This is stunning. Your subject, beautifully lit with natural light, beautiful skin tones,
great detail and a nice beautiful soft background. What's remarkable about this
photo is that it was a windy day by the water and her hair was blowing, yet you still
get that incredible detail in her hair in a Smart HDR photo.
Here's another example. As you can see, this is what you're not supposed to do,
right, shooting a photo into the sun, because that's going to blow out the exposure.
But Smart HDR makes sure we've got a great sky, you have detail on the shadows on
the water. But most of all, look at the water drops coming oﬀ of his hair and how
crisp and detailed they are. And that's incredible. All your photos come out so much
better now with iPhone Xs, no matter what your subject matter, people, pets. Look at
the skin detail and the hair and the beautiful sky.
As we said, it shoots wide color photos as well. Look at the color range in this photo,
shot straight oﬀ iPhone Xs. And it looks even better with the higher dynamic range
display on the iPhone Xs when you look at it there.
We introduced portrait mode and portrait lighting photos. Those are better than
ever before. Here's an example. It's incredible, the level of detail. This is the stage
light feature in the portrait lighting. It looks so beautiful. Here's another portrait
lighting photo -- excuse me, portrait mode photo, beautiful, soft background. These
are better than ever before. And there's a huge advancement here.
Remember the area on the background of the photo, the quality of that blur is what
the industry calls bokeh. And the team wanted to make a big advancement in what
can be done with bokeh. And they've done some amazing work here. They studied
some of the highest-end full frame cameras and expensive fast lenses to characterize
the quality of professional bokeh and then bring that capability to more and more of
us through the portrait mode photos we can take with iPhone. And what they've
achieved is really breakthrough.
So I'm going to show you a photo now. I'll just tell you right up front, this was not
shot with a high-end expensive camera. This is shot with an iPhone Xs. And it is
breakthrough. It is absolutely beautiful. The detail on her face, the great skin tones,
obviously reﬂecting from the surface of the car to light it up. But that background
and the quality of that bokeh is remarkable. This is a breakthrough in photography
for a smartphone.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 18 of 26But further than that, the team discovered something remarkable. This is so. So
exciting. I can't tell if you can tell I'm excited about this. But this is -- so when you
take the picture with portrait mode and then you go into the photos app and you tap
edit, you're going to see a new slider on the bottom that says depth. Yes, someone
said no. Get ready for this because -- and let me pull it up, you have to watch 2
things at once. You're going to watch the depth and you're going to watch the
background. You can, after taking a picture, adjust the depth of ﬁeld, from f/1.4 to
f/16. And the background is changing with it. Let me -- let's do that again. We're
going to slide the depth of ﬁeld and watch the background as it changes the depth
of ﬁeld of your photo. This is done after you've taken it. This had not been possible in
photography with any kind of camera. This is something that iPhone can now do with
the power of the A12 Bionic chip.
Let me show you one more example. Here's another photo shot with iPhone Xs. And
that's a beautiful background, an incredible higher quality bokeh. And as we looked
at it, we slide and we selected f/2.0 because we thought it had just the right depth of
ﬁeld we want in the photo. And this is a new era of photography. Some people call it
computational photography, with the power of not only the sensor and the lens. But
the A12 Bionic and incredible software and the care the camera team has put into
creating high-quality photography is making images possible now that weren't
before. And the beneﬁts of this are not only for photography but for video as well,
it's a new era of videography as well with this new sensor and the power of that A12
Bionic chip. And it can do many things. It has a twice-as-fast sensor. We can take
advantage of a lot of this technology to give better image quality in our videos.
And there's something else the team has done, too, taking advantage of the 4
microphones built into iPhone Xs, we can record stereo sound with your videos as
well. And it replays back to that beautiful wide stereos ﬁeld and it sounds amazing.
So let me show you a quick video that we shot with iPhone Xs, just natively shot on it,
nothing done to it other than we edit it for length. And it's shot in little light and it's --
creates images that weren't possible before. Here we go.
(Presentation)
And that's a beautiful video. You just shoot it 4K. But there's a lot going on that the
system's doing for us: auto focus, auto exposure, bringing up the highlight details,
the shadow details, with wider dynamic range, amazing color rendering and tone
mapping and stereo sound being recorded automatically. So that's photography.
That's video, that's our camera.
Now I'll talk about battery life. Increasingly all smart phone users want more
performance, bigger screens. But longer battery life, too. The teams really worked
hard on this. iPhone Xs is able to, compared to iPhone X, get you up to 30 minutes
longer in your day than iPhone X did. And that's really great.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 19 of 26iPhone Xs Max has the biggest battery we've ever put into an iPhone. And it can get
you up to 1.5 hour longer in your day.
And there's a lot more new with iPhone Xs and Xs Max; a faster networking, gigabit-
class LTE. They have more bands than any other smartphone. So they have the best
worldwide roaming.
And speaking of worldwide capabilities, one thing we've had requests for is dual
SIM capability. Well some of you know what this is for. For the rest, here are some
reasons people want dual SIM. Some people want 2 phone numbers on their phone.
It may be a home number and a work number. Some want 2 diﬀerent plans
depending on the region of the world they're in and what they need. And many of
us like to travel and want to keep our local phone number. But may need to get a
data plan in the region we're in. So we can have access to fast data there.
To do this into iPhone Xs and Xs Max, we built a technology called DSDS or Dual SIM
Dual Standby. This means that you have both phone numbers there in your phone,
waiting to get the call. Whichever one gets it becomes the active line.
And to enable that, we've added our eSIM technology, eSIM. eSIM is a standard that
we've been working with carriers to promote around the world. We've actually
already been shipping it in cellular iPads, in cellular watches. And now we're
bringing it to iPhone. So with eSIM, it's built in, easy to set up a second line. You can
point your camera at a QR code from a carrier and set it up. And the team has
worked to make sure in the software, that the fact that you have 2 diﬀerent phone
numbers is understood. And you can name them home and work, primary and
secondary, whatever. Then throughout the user experience, you'll see that a phone
call is coming in on a certain line. And you'll know how to deal with that.
Now support for eSIM requires support from carriers. And we've been working with
many great carrier partners. And they're going to be rolling out eSIM support
throughout the fall and many more into next year. We're really, really happy to be
working with them on this.
So that's how we're going to provide Dual SIM support around the world. We will
have a single physical SIM and an eSIM in both iPhone Xs and Xs Max.
In China, where we can't bring eSIM into iPhone yet, we're making a special model
of the iPhone Xs Max that has 2 physical SIMs, actually one on each side of the SIM
tray. It's a really smart implementation. And we think they're going to love that.
So this is iPhone Xs and Xs Max. They are packed with so many new advancements:
better Super Retina displays, 5.8 inch and the new 6.5-inch OLED displays; our next-
generation 7-nanometer, A12 Bionic chip with faster CPU, GPU, Neural Engine and
helping us to deliver even longer battery life; our new generation dual camera

{BIO 7568663 <GO>}
Thanks, Phil. We never stop thinking about what's best for the planet. This starts with
our products but it extends to everything we do at Apple.
So for instance, earlier this year, we announced something pretty amazing. You may
have heard about it already. But we can't help repeating ourselves, because we now
run Apple on 100% renewable energy in all of our facilities worldwide. Now of
course that includes the gorgeous campus that we're on right now. It's powered by
our own solar panels and directed biogas fuel cells. But it's also about the facilities
that you don't often see, like our data centers, which use lots of clean energy to
support services like iMessage. And that means every time you send an iMessage or
make a FaceTime video call, we're using lots of clean energy to make that happen.
Now when we set out to do this, people said it couldn't be done. And if you know
Apple, those are exactly the kinds of challenges that we love. So we've done it and
we're really, really proud of it. And now we're on to the next challenge.
We hope to, one day, eliminate our need to mine new materials from the Earth. Now
as you can imagine, this is a massive eﬀort. So to reach that goal, we'll have to do 3
things.
First we'll have to ﬁnd new ways to make our products with recycled or renewable
materials that are sourced responsibly. Then we'll have to ensure that our products
last as long as possible. Then ﬁnally after a long life of use, we have to ensure that
they're recycled properly.
So let's take a look at some of the material innovations within the new iPhones that
we've just announced. We've transitioned to using recycled tin in the main logic
board of iPhone, including the new iPhone Xs. And of course, this is with no
reduction in quality or performance. This one change will prevent the mining of over
10,000 tons of tin ore in a single year. And we're doing this with other materials as
well. We have a better plastics program. And through that, we're reducing our use of
traditional plastics and transitioning to recycled and bio-based materials. For
example, the speaker enclosure for iPhone Xs is now made with 35% post-consumer
recycled plastics. And the cover -- yes, good. And the cover glass frame is made with
32% bio-based plastic. It's better for the planet. But it's also tougher and it performs
better.
Second, we also make sure to design and build durable products that last as long as
possible. That means long-lasting hardware coupled with our amazing software. All
of these devices, including the iPhone 5s, run iOS 12. And iOS 12 is designed toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 21 of 26Philip W. Schillermake your iPhone and iPad experience even better, even more responsive, faster,
just better. And because they last longer, you can keep using them. And keeping
using them is the best thing for the planet.
And ﬁnally, when it comes time to reuse and recycle, we have Apple GiveBack. This is
something I'm really proud of. With Apple GiveBack, it doesn't matter what device
you have or what condition it's in. Bring it in or mail it in to us. We'll assess it. And if it
can be used by someone else, we'll give you the value. If not, we'll recycle it properly
for free.
Maybe we'll even use a robot. Who remembers Liam? Well meet his sister, Daisy,
who can disassemble 9 diﬀerent models of iPhone. Using Daisy, we can reuse those
recycled materials in future products. And the more we do this, the less we'll have to
mine from the Earth.
So that iPhone 5s, with Apple GiveBack, it can go on to another user when you're
ready to switch to a new iPhone. And when it comes to the new iPhone Xs, you can
feel conﬁdent that it, too, was designed for another long life of use. Either way, it's
good for you. But it is a huge win for the planet. Thank you.
{BIO 1921735 <GO>}
Thank you, Lisa. This work is really important to all the teams at Apple. And it's a
great example of a collaboration between all the teams, who do everything from
reducing the amount of tin in products to the GiveBack program. Just great work.
And we're really proud of everything they do.
So iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max, they are stunning, the best iPhones we've ever made
by a long shot. We are so excited about the technologies in here, the experiences
they're going to bring to people. And we hope customers love them just as much as
we do. And we want to reach as many customers as we can with this incredible
technology. So that's why we are very excited to show you one more iPhone.

It is incredible. And we are so excited to introduce you to the iPhone XR. And we
hope it reaches even more customers with this amazing, incredible technology. It's
made from 7000 series aerospace-grade aluminum and has more durable glass. It is
absolutely stunning. And it comes in incredible new ﬁnishes: white, black, blue, coral,

Page 22 of 26This display is really what strikes you, though. It's an LCD display that, for the ﬁrst
time, goes edge-to-edge. It took advanced new engineering and technology to do
pixel masking and pixel anti-aliasing and to have LEDs that ﬁt into a smaller space
than ever before. This is the most advanced LCD ever in a smartphone. And it's so
cool, we had to give it its own cool new name. It's called the Liquid Retina display.
The Liquid Retina display is 6.1 inches on the diagonal. Now let's bring -- well, ﬁrst,
it's 1.4 million pixels and it's 326 pixels per inch. So true retina image quality.
Now let's bring that iPhone 8 Plus next to it, because it's really interesting. It is a
bigger display than the iPhone 8 Plus, in a smaller design. The design actually ﬁts
perfectly between the size of an 8 and an 8 Plus. So we think it's going to make a lot
of customers really happy.
So a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display, an LCD display, 1.4 million pixels, it supports tap
to wake. It has that 120-hertz touch-sensitive layer. So it scrolls superfast. It has great
color management, color accuracy. It is a wide-color display. And it has true tone
support. So the whites, the paper white, in all the lights you use them.
And it is an iPhone X experience on an LCD display. So that means you tap it to wake
it up. There's no home button. You swipe up to go to the home screen, ﬁrst for an
LCD display. Swipe down to get your notiﬁcations. Swipe down to get to control
center from the right corner.
Now it doesn't have 3D touch. But here again, the team came up with something
really smart. It has a new feature we call Haptic touch. So to get to the camera from
the home screen, you just press on it. You feel a Haptic tap. And you're taken right to
the camera. This is a similar technology to what we do with the Trackpad in the
MacBook Pro that we all love so much. It is a great experience.
And like every iPhone X new experience, it has Face ID. And there's a TrueDepth
camera system, the same TrueDepth camera system in iPhone Xs and Xs Max. So it's
an infrared camera, ﬂood illuminator, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, dot
projector, front camera, speaker, microphone, all the technology to have an
incredible Face ID experience. So you look at iPhone XR to unlock it. You look at it to
pay with Apple Pay. And like iPhone Xs and Xs Max, it's faster with its faster
algorithms running on a faster Secure Enclave.
And inside the iPhone XR is nothing but the best chip we make, our brand-new 7-
nanometer A12 Bionic chip. So this is a powerhouse, faster CPU, faster GPU, faster
Neural Engine. And it can do all those experiences that Kaiann showed you earlier,
including real time machine learning. It is an incredible new phone.
And it has a great new camera system as well. It's a single-camera system, our best
single-camera system that we've ever made. It's a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera,
the exact same wide-angle camera in the Xs and Xs Max. So it's our new generation
sensor that's larger with bigger pixels, optical image stabilization, twice as many
focus pixels, fast f/1.8 aperture, Apple-designed lens. And a new improved true toneFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12

iPhone XR. It is stunning, incredible detail, beautiful tone mapping. There's probably
something you've noticed about this photo, though. It's a portrait mode photo with
that beautiful background blur, taken from a single camera system. This is
remarkable. What the team is able to do is combine hardware and software to create
a depth segmentation map using the focus pixels and Neuro Net software so that we
can create portrait mode photos on the brand-new iPhone XR.
Here's another example. Just incredible, beautiful, beautiful focus on the subject,
great lighting, beautiful background bokeh. Yes. It gets the same advanced bokeh
technology we talked about with iPhone Xs and Xs Max. And it gets depth control
dynamically after taking the picture. So all the breakthrough features and capabilities
that you want are right here.
Here's some other photo examples taken from iPhone XR. They are absolutely
beautiful. It has Smart HDR as well, helps to bring out highlights and shadows even
in low-light photos. It has wide color as well. So you get stunning, beautiful, rich
color photographs.
On the front side is the same TrueDepth camera system as iPhone Xs and Xs Max.
But it's the latest technology. So you get full support for portrait mode and portrait
lighting. It can take some of the best selﬁes you've ever seen. These are shot oﬀ the
TrueDepth camera on iPhone XR.
But what about battery life? Well here, the story continues to be just great. With this
performance and this big screen, the teams worked hard to give great battery life. So
let's compare it to the iPhone 8 Plus. So many customers love the long battery life of
that. Well iPhone XR gives you up to 1.5 hours more in your day than the iPhone 8
Plus.
So this is the brand-new iPhone XR. It's a 6.1-inch liquid retina display, an LCD
display, the most advanced ever in the industry. It is our latest 7-nanometer A12
Bionic chip with its faster CPU and GPU. And that breakthrough Neural Engine and
helping deliver even longer battery life. It's the best single-camera system we've
ever made with our new generation 12-megapixel sensor, with support for Smart
HDR, portrait mode, beautiful bokeh, dynamic depth control, incredible video. It has
the same TrueDepth camera system as iPhone Xs and Xs Max with faster Face ID and
on and on. These 6 beautiful new ﬁnishes, that incredible 7000 series aerospace-
grade aluminum. And IP67 protection from liquids and dust.
iPhone Xs, Xs Max and iPhone XR have arsenic-free display glass, mercury-free
display, BFR-free, PVC-free, beryllium-free. They're designed and manufactured in a
low-carbon process and they're highly recyclable. We're so proud of all that work the
team does.
And this is a huge day for iPhone. We now have iPhone Xs, Xs Max and XR, 3 new
models of iPhone. We have a product video about it to tell you a little bit more. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12

Thank you, Phil. What a fantastic new line-up of iPhones. It's clearly the best line-up
we've had by far. Taking the breakthroughs of iPhone X even further than before and
making them available to even more people.
Now before we close this morning, I've got a few more updates to give you. We've
got an update to the HomePod, our breakthrough home speaker. We recently added
stereo pairs in AirPlay 2. So now when you add a second HomePod, you create a
stereo pair. It creates this incredible wide immersive soundstage. You really have to
hear this to believe it. It's really awesome.
And with Airplay 2, HomePod becomes the best multiroom audio experience. We've
got some other great features that we're bringing to HomePod. You'll be able to
search for your favorite songs by lyrics, create multiple timers, make and receiveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12

your iPhone or any of your Apple devices to help ﬁnd them around your house. It's
incredibly useful at my house. And we couldn't be more excited about how Siri
Shortcuts will open up a world of apps for the HomePod.
Also, we'll be shipping a new update to tvOS with support for Dolby Atmos for
Apple TV 4K. It has stunning new 4K aerials and with access to a wide range of live
sports and news programs, there are now well over 100 video partners available

Monday, September 17.
Then the following week, we've got a great new update for the Mac with macOS
Mojave; all-new dark mode and updates to desktop and Finder; enhanced privacy
and security; and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. macOS Mojave will be
available on September 24.
We're excited about this huge month and all of these big releases that we've got. So
what a great morning.
We introduced the Apple Watch Series 4, newly designed and reengineered to help
you stay even more active, healthy and connected. It is the most capable Apple
Watch yet.
We showed you the new iPhone Xs, the most advanced smartphone in the world
with the Super Retina display; advanced Face ID; a breakthrough dual camera
system; and the smartest, most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. And iPhone Xs is
not just 1 phone, it's 2. With the iPhone Xs Max, the biggest screen ever in an iPhone;
the biggest battery ever in an iPhone; and of course, the biggest experience ever in
an iPhone.
And the iPhone XR with the new Liquid Retina display, it shares so many of the
advanced features of iPhone Xs. And it is just stunning, with 6 beautiful new ﬁnishes
to choose from. iPhone XR will allow us to deliver the future of the smartphone to
even more people.
At Apple, we are always pushing our products forward and making technology more
personal. We hope that you love these new products as much as we do.
We've got a hands-on area just upstairs. It's going to open in a moment. And we
hope that you'll take time to get your hands on them and experience them for
yourselves.
I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning, including those watching us
online. And I'd especially like to thank all the people at Apple who made this
magical day possible. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-09-12
