All right. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our next session here at the Baird
Global Consumer Technology and Services Conference. I am Peter Benedict, Senior
Retail and Consumer Products and Services Analyst here at Baird. I'm very pleased to
welcome Walmart back to the conference. The Company obviously needs no
introduction, but I think it's safe to say that the last ﬁve or six years have been truly
transformational under the leadership of CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, Brett
Biggs.
This morning, we're fortunate to have Brett with us to just spend some time. So, Brett,
welcome, thank you for participating this morning. There is no slides --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Thanks, Peter.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah, no, thank you. There is no slides. We're going to really jump into Q&A. If
anybody watching has any questions, just enter them into the portal. I will do my
best to weave it into the conversation.
So with that, let's get started. As I mentioned, Walmart has changed a lot under your
and Doug's leadership and it actually feels like the pace of change is actually
accelerating here, which is a little bit hard to fathom. But as we try to frame it for
investors, Phase 1 of the transformation that's going on here was really about
investing in associates, re-establishing Walmart's relevance with consumers, building
competitive omnichannel platform and really optimizing your international portfolio.
And I think as I recall, the stock didn't respond too well initially back in 2015 when
this was laid out. If you guys executed, the stock actually has outperformed in marketFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

Brett Biggssince then and clearly it was the right strategy for the business as well as for
shareholders. Earlier this year, Brett you articulated what -- we're kind of calling
Phase 2 of this transformation with the focus on those prior factors still in play, but
really extending your leadership in omnichannel, but also creating a more durable,
faster growing business with a diversiﬁed mix of proﬁt pool. So interestingly the
market didn't seem to like that either, but it's coming back a little bit here.
So the question I guess I would lead oﬀ with here is are we thinking about the
transformation correctly? And if so, why is Phase 2 the right strategy for Walmart and
for investors?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, thanks, Peter. Thanks for having me and thanks for everybody's interest today.
It does feel like the acceleration is faster, I'm with you. It feels that way from here as
well. I think it just needs to be. Competition is changing. The customer continues to
change. And going into -- go back to March of last year, which seems like forever
ago in some ways, we were -- we felt good about our strategy, the omni strategy and
the ability to serve customers with stores, online delivery, basically how and where
they want to shop.
And if anything going through the pandemic makes us feel stronger that that
strategy is the right strategy. As we saw customers pivot very quickly to online and
pickup and not as many people in stores, now we're seeing customers come back
into stores. So we've seen not only the ability to serve customers in all of those ways
is important, but also our ability to execute against that very quickly. We feel more
conﬁdent even coming out of this about strategy be right and our ability to execute
against it, but I think the way you describe the strategy is right. And as you would
have seen early in the year, as you mentioned, the way we're thinking about capital
and putting capital towards omni fulﬁllment, omni technology, that's where we're
going as a company and I feel really good about it.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah, they're going to make sense. And you guys currently has largest e-commerce
businesses in the world, you just alluded to the investments there, may be you can
dig little deeper, build out on what you're thinking in terms of your omnichannel
fulﬁllment capacity, what's the roadmap here, you're automating your DCs, let's
maybe dive into that a little bit, what would you share with us on that front?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, again it's about making the customers lives easier, making it more eﬃcient for
us and less costly for us as a company, which then make -- helps our customers as
well. So when you get products closer to customers, get delivery times down, get
customer service aspect up, that's something we'll always continue to try to improve,
but it more eﬃciently and it more cost eﬀectively. So we're adding a lot of capacity
on fulﬁllment center side. We mentioned that. And the additions to CapEx that we're
making over the next few years, a lot of that is around fulﬁllment center capacity thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Peter Benedict
Brett Biggs
Peter Benedicttakes a little while to build that. We've been building that over time. But to scale, it
takes a little while to build it, but that's fully underway.
And then on the technology side, you've heard -- Peter, you've seen it, you've heard
us talk in the past two years about technology we're developing on the supply chain
side, particularly in distribution centers and fulﬁllment centers. And there's -- I
believe there's going to be deﬁnitely some second move or advantages on
technology that the technology we're developing in our distribution centers to make
palleting easier, getting it to stores in a way it's more eﬃcient for them to unload and
get out to the shelves, all of that is going to be cutting-edge technology and we've
been talking about that for a while.
You're going to see us start rolling that out, being able to pick more eﬃciently. We've
talked about these local fulﬁllment centers, market fulﬁllment centers like you call
them, all of that's going to help us from an eﬃciency standpoint. And just freeing up
--adding capacity to the system for us to be able to ﬂex in the way that customer
wants to shop.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah. No, that makes sense. And is there a thought on kind of the home delivery
front? So there is the back end of this, picking eﬃciencies and that and talked about
the market fulﬁllment centers and how you're working on those, so I think that all
makes sense, but I think I'm not kind of that (inaudible) last mile in terms of the
actual delivery and kind of winning the ports, right, making sure customer want it
delivered, how you do that? What's required on that front?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, we spend a lot of time on last mile as you would anticipate. As you know,
we've used any number of third-party carriers to help us with delivery, but we will
also develop our own Spark, we call our Spark platform and having our own proud
source platform internally that we're really excited about and the ability to have a lot
more control over that delivery. We've also been a leader in what we call in-home. So
we had three markets, which we were trying in Ken City, Pittsburgh, and Vero Beach
Florida where we're delivering straight into the home, that got delayed a little bit
because of COVID, of course. We've added the local market here in Northwest
Arkansas to that list and we're really excited about, not just winning the ports, but
winning the inside of that kitchen and being able to deliver straight into the
refrigerator. And eventually you think about the things you can do once you're in
their on returns and other things like that that could be really beneﬁcial for the
Company and that can just keep us on the leading edge of everything that's going
on around the customers lives, that's what we're looking to do.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
That's great. Is there one of the beneﬁts of being a global business? You know
you've international markets where you can learn and leverage. Is there anything
from an omnichannel standpoint that you would call out speciﬁcally right now that isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Brett Biggs
Peter Benedict
Brett Biggsreally you're leveraging from international business is that how maybe you're
operating here in the U.S.?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, we learn a lot from each other. We think about markets like China where you
have high density and we were delivering pretty early in China because the density
there and what customers wanted. And so we've learned from market like that. We
are delivering pretty early in Mexico from our Superama format. So all of these
learnings we take and as there was one of the ﬁrst ones on online grocery and
delivery, so lot of our learnings on online grocery came from Asda.
With Flipkart, one of the great things about Flipkart and it was exciting the ﬁrst time
we met them was the way they were attacking the market in India, huge market, 1.3
billion people. But they were really attacking it from an ecosystem perspective and
that's how you could see the winners in the world, that's how they were working with
the customers is -- from is getting them into that ecosystem and Flipkart and
PhonePe were already there and how they were thinking about that market. So
there's deﬁnitely learnings that we get from groups like that.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
So let's just focus back now just U.S. business. Let's talk about grocery trends. A lot
has gone over the last 12 months, you guys restricted some hours and there may be
some share loss initially, it seems to be coming back. Give us a sense and update on
how you feel about your grocery share and grocery trends.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, feel great about grocery. Again as you know we -- over the last four or ﬁve
years, we put so much eﬀort and resources into everything around grocery and
particularly on the fresh side whether it's supply chain, to reduce the number of days
in the system, to get the product to the customer in a fresher condition, we've spent
a ton of time on that. So I feel really good about grocery as you said. Going back to
the pandemic, we were hit pretty hard by customers earlier than some competitors,
which cause us some challenges within stock, I think earlier than it did with our
competitors. We took store hours down a little more quickly and kept them down
longer than some of our competitors. We are starting to bring some of that back.
So we were never horribly concerned about market share because of what we knew
was going on in the market and customers are shopping closer to home. They are
shopping in smaller stores and we feel like all that would come back. And we're
seeing that come back and we saw it in the market share numbers. So still feel great
about what's going in grocery. It's a leading part of our businesses, how we're going
to lead with the customer and that then gives us the ability to sell general
merchandise and sell other services that I know we'll talk about here in a minute. So I
feel great about it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

Peter Benedict
Brett Biggs{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah. How is the inﬂation backdrop impacting kind of grocery? I just think more
broadly and then we'll get into general merchandise, but with prices going up
everywhere in the supply chain, for labor, obviously on commodity prices, so
product prices start to move and we're hearing a lot of our companies speak to that
here at the conference. Just maybe help us understand Walmart's positioning when
it comes to digesting inﬂation, being able to hold prices for customers when you
have to push it through what are you seeing in terms of elasticity?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, most of us, who were at my age 52 or 53 or under, haven't experienced
inﬂation much. It's not something that's been very prominent in the market. We are --
because of our scale and the way we work with our supplier partners, we're able to
work with them, have a pretty good sense of input costs. And where we can help
them keep their costs in line, we will do that. We're able to move products a little
diﬀerently maybe than some of our competitors which helps from an overall cost
standpoint.
As input costs go up and suppliers need to take prices up, we'll work with that. We're
going to look at price gaps which are good for us and decide how much of that do
we want to pass on, how much of that do we want to -- to not pass on and will help
make those choices that will help customers. And then we'll just see how much of
this inﬂation is little more semi permanent versus transient. I think we should take few
months for that to work itself out. You're seeing some input costs come down versus
where they were a month or two ago. You're not seeing interest rates go up. So there
are some signs that maybe there is some of this that's transitory, but we'll just -- we'll
monitor it over the next several months just like other business as well.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. Fair enough. So how about general merchandise? Pandemic has created
a lot of volatility around those categories, how do you feel about your performance
right there in your position?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, feel good, really good about some market share that we took during the
pandemic. Some of that, of course, was other retailers not being open, some of them
are back open now. So we did beneﬁt from that over the last year, but I feel good
about our business overall. Again if you can put grocery and general merchandise
together, it's a big beneﬁt and customers -- you can make it really convenient for
them to shop and certainly getting the general merchandise -- more general
merchandise into the basket helps with margins and you're certainly seeing that over
the last several quarters with our gross margin rates. So I feel good about general
merchandise. It's important for us going forward whether that's ﬁrst party or thirdFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

Brett Biggsparty. It's really important part of our strategy and we're going to continue to focus
on it.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
All right. I'm trying to get some questions coming in from the crowd. First one is
really around your alternative revenue streams that have become such a focus,
maybe -- there's a few here, but maybe let's start out with Walmart Connect and
maybe update the audience here on what you're doing, what the approach is
Walmart Connect and then we can get to some of the others?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I'm really excited about Walmart Connect. We're perfect, not with [ph] the
name, we're perfect connection point between customers and suppliers where we
sit right in the middle of that relationship and have over 100 million transactions a
week in our ecosystem. So we're perfectly setup for that. We've been a little cautious
on advertising because we want to make sure that the customer experience is good,
that the products we're recommending what are good for them online, that we're
not cluttering the experience for customers. But we feel better that we can do that
and that there is still a lot of room for us to generate more advertising income that
we have.
So it's something that -- we've said we think we can be a multibillion dollar business
over the next few years. I feel really good about that. I feel great about the progress
we're making this year. So it's an exciting proposition for us and one that we just --
we hadn't taken advantage of probably like we could have in the past.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Now that makes sense. How about Walmart Plus? That's getting a lot of press, lot of
people focus on that. And just recently there is some news around prescriptions
being added to that that's kind of part of the strategy here, but what can you share
with us about -- about Walmart Plus?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, you're going to continue to see us add services where Walmart Plus long-term
is a key part of what we want to do. We want to get members, customers into that
ecosystem. And so we think having a membership of this is important. But it's a
piece of the puzzle. We're going to continue to roll it out in a way that balances
speed which is important from a competitive standpoint, but also making sure we
get the customer -- the member experience right. And so you're going to see us
continue to rollout services, you're going to continue to see us to improve the
customer experience and hopefully we're going to do in a way that's smart and
beneﬁcial for our customers and our shareholders at the same time. But I'm excited
about it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

Peter Benedict
Brett Biggs{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah, no, for sure. I had a question that came in was kind of around the IT
requirements for some of the infrastructure you're doing, the omnichannel fulﬁllment
that you're working on, maybe a quick comment on that? And also your thoughts on
Walmart Fulﬁllment Services marketplace as kind of the alternative revenue streams
for here?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
No, we brought in Suresh Kumar, our Chief Technology Oﬃcer. I think it's been three
years ago now, I lose track of time. I think it's three years. But his background with
Google, with Amazon, with Microsoft is really a perfect background for what we need
to solve these customer problems and making sure we generate customer solutions.
So we're going to invest everything that we need to in tech to make that work. And
the great thing about the tech, when you generate something for our supply chain,
for our ﬁrst party business supply chain or Walmart Plus or delivery, it has beneﬁts for
everything we want to do from a third-party perspective, so it's alternative revenue
streams. So whether that's -- as we do something for our own fulﬁllment centers, it
helps with Walmart Fulﬁllment Services and with third-party sellers. So all of is there
is a great synergy around the tech that we're building for both our ﬁrst party and
third party businesses.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Excellent. I guess the next question would be around Financial and Health Care
services and that kind of area that probably put a lot -- there always a lot going on,
but maybe bring us up the speed on what's happening on that front.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, with this new DeFi, decentralized ﬁnance, that a lot of companies are trying to
get into that business, the reason they are is because customers are interacting with
ﬁnancial services really diﬀerently than they have in the past and certainly the
younger generation will. It's going to be less about banks and more about this
decentralized ﬁnance. So with that speciﬁcally we have -- already have a big ﬁnancial
services business. We have a relationship with customers. What we have -- the joint
venture that we formed with Micky and Ribbit Capital is going to be really exciting
among the board of that company and I am excited about what we can do with a
separate joint venture, but also what we can do speciﬁcally inside the company.
And then in health care, we had health care business for a long time. We've got a
relationship with the customer particularly on the pharmacy side, but we've been
developing clinics and other things that the customers are trying. You saw that we
just did and announced an acquisition of a telehealth company. Telehealth is
something that's going to be really big going forward. It became a lifesaver in the
pandemic, but that -- those are the kinds of habits that are just going to continue out
into the future. People using services diﬀerently. So in both of these places, weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 12Peter Benedict

Brett Biggsalready have well established businesses. We have well established relationship with
customers. And from that perspective, it's really just about widening and broadening
what we do in those areas, but very high margin services as well. So it's another thing
that can help us from an overall proﬁtability standpoint.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Sure. I want to spend a minute -- a few minutes here, maybe on your international
business, portfolio looks a lot diﬀerent today than it did even just a few years ago.
Maybe talk about like how you feel about the current portfolio that you have? And
then somewhat related to that, you're doubling credit rating. How do you -- I mean,
you seem to be a more of a contraction mode or rationalization mode than you are
in expansion mode, but just talk about the importance of the credit rating and if
there were any kind of opportunities to do something more, I mean your willingness
to take that down? I don't think you are, but I'm just getting a question on that so
wanted to weave that into the conversation.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I assume when you're talking about a contraction mode, you're talking
more about international versus total company because we're clearly in expansion
mode total company. On the international side, I feel really good about our markets
and you will see in the ﬁrst quarter our growth rates going up. So we're in markets
now with higher growth rates. You look at China, India, Canada has been little more
challenged on the COVID front recently, Mexico, Central America and most markets
are high growth. So I feel really good about our major markets and the leadership in
those markets and what we can do longer-term.
We're going to continue to be aggressive as a company. We've made some big
acquisitions, obviously Flipkart was a big acquisition and I think we're happy with it. I
think we will continue to be really -- feel really good about that from a valuation
standpoint.
So how that relates to our credit rating? We've been a AA credit I think forever as
long as I can remember. I have been here 21 years. So as long as I can remember
that's AA credit. And it's really important to us and it's beneﬁted us and it really
beneﬁts you when you get in challenging times like we did last March and back
again in 2008. We're going to continue to be really aggressive as a company and
making sure that we grow the business both top line and bottom line, the way that
we want to.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah, I ﬁgured that's how you're going to respond. So, let maybe quickly on Flipkart -

Brett Biggs(Multiple Speakers) a while Peter.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
So the -- just focusing on India for a little bit here, Flipkart and PhonePe, maybe talk a
little bit more about what has transpired there during the pandemic and there has
been lot going on, but how you feel about those businesses now that they are
hopefully starting to come out, but I know that's not full by any stretch. And just how
do you think about the ownership structure of those assets speciﬁcally, but then also
more broadly your ownership structure on a lot of these international markets think
now I use the working contraction or probably does not really what I mean, I kind of
more (Multiple Speakers) distribution of -- right, of what's going on in your portfolio.
So maybe help us through that little bit.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, the ﬁrst time I went to -- I mean I've been going to India for at least 15 years.
For the ﬁrst time I went to visit Flipkart, it's really exciting. And on PhonePe, I
remember coming back to (inaudible) team here and saying some of the things that
we're trying to do from where this ﬁnancial services standpoint, but this ecosystem
concept, I mean PhonePe was there. They were already ahead of some of the things
that we wanted to do in the U.S. and so that's what made it so exciting. And I just see
that continuing. I mean it's been -- the last 16 months in India have been challenging.
We had shutdowns last year for over 50 days. Flipkart, we've had some more this
year and the human toll in India is really challenging right now. And with -- it feels
like maybe where things are starting to get little better at least in some of the cities in
India and we certainly hope so. But longer term, the ecosystem play there is really
encouraging, really exciting and I think it mimics some of the things, if not lead some
of the things that we want to do in U.S. and things we want to do in Mexico. So, I feel
good about that.
From an ownership standpoint, it can work any way that -- and I can come up with all
diﬀerent types of scenarios in which it will beneﬁt us, it will beneﬁt Flipkart, beneﬁt
the customer. We've talked about potential of an IPO. I think that's something that's
still certainly on our minds and I think it could make sense to be a public company
and have your associates have that -- the ability to own shares in a company and do
things like that like we have in Mexico. So I'm -- I think we're open to all kinds of
diﬀerent structures in India. But IPO is something that we certainly have been
considering.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Sure. That's great. Let's spend some time on Sam's Club which doesn't get a lot of air
time, massive --

Big business -- inside of a bigger business. But just trying to get an update on your
kind of vision for Sam's club. I mean, a couple of years back, you guys rationalized
that footprint in the U.S., got out some markets, have repurposed that real estate for
other reasons. So again part of the portfolio, the broader portfolio of Walmart. But
the business is doing fantastic now, membership and whatnot. So maybe talk about
the longer-term strategic value of Sam's Club and how do you see that working as
part of the Walmart ecosystem?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, Sam's is -- I mean just looking at the business performance, it's been stellar the
last few years. We're seeing membership renewal rates and membership rates at
record highs. The value proposition is there. The business -- the comp sales are
great, proﬁtability has been great. So just on its own, if Sam's were separate
business, you'd be saying I'm feeling really, really good about what's going on at
Sam's Club. But it also has beneﬁts to the total company. It's been a leader in
technology for us. So scan and go was really developed at Sam's and makes sense
for that limited SKU environment, it's per values at all the time when I am in Sam's
Club.
They've done things from an associate standpoint, things like Ask Sam which -- that's
been rolled out into the U.S. to help associates with what's going on the stores, help
them serve customers and members. So they've been leading edge on all of that.
Most of us have spent time at Sam's. Doug was CEO at Sam's. I was CFO at Sam's.
Furner has spent time at Sam's. Kath is now at Sam's obviously and it's a great way to
learn retail. So I beneﬁted a lot personally from that in my career and lot of people at
Walmart has. So there's just a lot of things that brings the table for us.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah, that's for sure. It's been a breeding ground for sure, but also nice to see you're
performing so well.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, it's performing really well.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah. Just on to -- back to the P&L, maybe on gross margin, maybe two questions.
One, how are you thinking about inventory management maybe any diﬀerently
coming out of COVID versus before beginning the access to new vendors? Are you
dealing with vendors diﬀerently? That's kind of -- and to weave that into the gross
margin question, do you think these alternative proﬁt pools allow you to maybe have
gross margin migrate higher over time? Or do you reinvest those either back in the
gross margin or somewhere else in the P&L? How are you thinking about that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-09

Peter Benedict{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I think, going back to several years ago, Peter, you'd have heard me talk about
SG&A from the standpoint of we get SG&A in the right place. It just allows us to have
more ﬂexibility with what we want to do and what we need to do from a gross
margin perspective and still keep operating margins where we want them. I would
say the same thing about the alternative proﬁt pools. It's another lever again that just
-- it gives us more options. And there are certain categories where maybe you want
margins to be a little bit higher. There's some categories where you maybe want
margins be a little bit lower, but you can make it all work and keep operating
margins where we want them and keep growing proﬁt over time.
So I view those as a piece to the puzzle. And I think -- I still think gross margin rates
will settle where the market allows it to settle to some degree and where customers
will allow it to settle. But having said that, we can manage the mix in diﬀerent way.
So, if general merchandise penetration for instance is 1% or 2% higher in total, so big
diﬀerence from a margin mix perspective. If you get these alternative revenue
streams growing, it's a big diﬀerence from a margin perspective. So it just widens the
gap I think of where you can manage margins and still have your operating margins
you really want them to be from a shareholder perspective.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah it sounds like the optionality and the ﬂexibility kind of moving up the P&L. Yeah,
I mean, where you have to make focus a couple of years ago and now it's moving up.
So that's great to hear. I guess in the two minutes we have remaining just we'll tie it
all together with ROIC have been declining for 10 years and you guys did a nice job
of getting that kind of stabilized, obviously there is some transactions that will
happen that can do that, but how do you think about kind of ROI -- ROIC in the
longer term kind of part of the transformation of Walmart?

Yeah, it's important. I mean we had a number of years where -- we went back to 2015
where we basically said ROIC is going to come down for a little bit because we need
to get our margins in the right place and that wasn't very popular. Over the next
several years, we've said we're going take CapEx up a bit and that will -- that part will
pressure ROIC a bit because you just -- the denominator gets bigger a little more
quickly. But I feel good about our ability to continue to grow operating proﬁt and so
the numerator growing as well. So I do -- over the mid term, I feel good about our
ability to continue to improve returns. We feel it as a management team. We know
it's really important to our shareholders. And so I think we can do everything our
customers need and if we do in the right way, we should build to grow ROI and we
feel accountable to do that.
