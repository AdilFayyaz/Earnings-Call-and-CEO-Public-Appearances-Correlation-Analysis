{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Thanks, Deborah. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today on such short notice.
I'm excited to announce that this afternoon we entered into an agreement to acquire
WhatsApp. The combination of WhatsApp and Facebook will allow us to deliver new
and engaging mobile experiences, connect many more people around the world.
And achieve our mission of giving people the power to share and making the world
more open and connected.
Over the last couple of years, Facebook has been on a journey towards becoming a
mobile company. Our goal is to connect everyone in the world and to do this we've
invested in delivering great mobile experiences like Instagram, Messenger and, of
course, our core Facebook apps on iOS and Android. We've made great progress
here and 945 million people now use our mobile products every month and 556
million of those people use them each day.
As I said in our last earnings call, our goal for Facebook over the next few years is to
deliver a set of new mobile products that allow people to share any type of content
with any set of people they want. We want to provide the best tools to share with
diﬀerent-sized groups in a diﬀerent context and to develop more mobile
experiences beyond just the main Facebook app, like Instagram and Messenger. This
is where we see a lot of new growth as well as a great opportunity to better serve our
whole community.
WhatsApp ﬁts this vision perfectly. Then the combination with Facebook will help
strengthen both services. WhatsApp is an extremely high-quality product with
incredibly strong engagement and rapid growth. It doesn't get as much attention in
the U.S. as it deserves because its community started oﬀ growing in Europe, India.
And Latin America but WhatsApp is a very important and valuable worldwide-
communication network.
In fact, WhatsApp is the only widely-used app we've ever seen that has more
engagement and a higher % of people using it daily than Facebook itself. After
doubling in size in the last year, more than 450 million people now use WhatsApp
monthly and more than 1 million new people are signing up every day.
Based on our experience of building global services with strong growth and
engagement, we believe WhatsApp is on a path to reach over 1 billion people
worldwide in the next few years. Internet services that reach 1 billion people are all
incredibly valuable and we believe WhatsApp will be as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19

Page 3 of 13Jan KoumOur focus will remain on connecting more people and increasing engagement but,
over the long term, we look forward to seeing what the team can do to build a really
great business. We expect them to bring the same quality and innovation they bring
to the rest of the product and the successful subscription model they already have in
place is a promising start.
As Facebook works to connect the entire world and to build the infrastructure for a
global community, WhatsApp will clearly help accelerate our progress. Jan and the
team have built a product that is simple, fast, reliable. And a really great experience
for people. It's a great model for our own mobile development process.
WhatsApp also complements our services and will add a lot of new value to our
community. People use WhatsApp as a replacement for SMS to communicate with
their contacts as well as small groups of people. Our communication products like
Facebook Messenger and Chat are used mostly for chatting with your Facebook
friends and often sending messages that aren't necessarily real-time. These are both
diﬀerent and important use cases and we're going to invest in both to serve both
use cases better.
We're committed to building and operating WhatsApp independently. Their product
roadmap is very exciting and it's not going to change. We will work hard together
over the coming years to help WhatsApp grow even faster and reach many more
people. As part of this, we expect that, over time, WhatsApp will help us make
progress in our mission to connect the entire world through things like Internet.org,
by supporting our goal of delivering basic internet services to everyone in the world
at aﬀordable prices.
Overall, I'm very excited about this deal and I think it will be great for the Facebook
and WhatsApp communities as well as for both companies. WhatsApp had every
option in the world so I'm thrilled that they chose to work with us. I'm looking
forward to what we can achieve together and for the opportunity to develop great
new mobile products that serve even more people around the world.
On a personal note, I've known Jan for a long time and I know that we both share the
vision of making the world more open and connected through the services we build.
Jan's team has done amazing work over the last ﬁve years and they should be really
proud of everything they've accomplished. I can't wait for them to join the Facebook
team and I look forward to partnering with them to continue achieving amazing
things. I'm particularly happy that, as part of this deal, Jan has agreed to join the
Facebook board and partner with me to shape the future of Facebook as well as
WhatsApp.
Thanks again for taking the time to join us today and now I'd like to hand it over to
Jan.

Page 4 of 13Thanks, Mark. I'm delighted that WhatsApp is joining Facebook and I'm really
looking forward to working together. This is an incredible moment for me and the
entire team and I want to start by just thanking them.
Over the last ﬁve years, our team has grown WhatsApp into a product used by
hundreds of millions of people, achieved many new innovations in mobile. And
created a world-class product development organization. This moment would not
have been possible without the hard work and the dedication of a lot of amazing
people and I look forward to sharing the next chapter of WhatsApp history with you.
When Brian and I started WhatsApp, our mission was to build a product that could
solve something fundamental; to make real-time mobile communication an
experience that was simple, powerful, instantaneous and commonplace. Our goal
was to build a service that could be used by everyone across every platform and
every phone and that would be a better alternative to SMS as well. We wanted a
product that people could use easily and quickly to communicate with all the
contacts in their phone and also with groups of people.
As a result, what we've achieved speak for themselves. Every day over 19 billion
messages are sent on WhatsApp. Over 600 million photos are shared. Our
community is growing rapidly with over 1 million new users joining every day and in
key growth regions, WhatsApp has become an important communication tool and
part of daily life with incredible growth and penetration.
WhatsApp has achieved much of what we set out to do but we still have a lot more
work to do. That's why I'm very excited for us to be combined with Facebook.
Facebook gives us a chance to turn WhatsApp into a service that reaches even more
people and creates even greater value for our users. Facebook is a social network
and oﬀers many diﬀerent and important functionalities than WhatsApp oﬀers as a
communication service and we're excited to beneﬁt from the unique expertise,
knowledge. And infrastructure that Mark and the team have built out over the last
decade.
We think this will open up many new possibilities for our product and community.
I'm pleased that's WhatsApp will continue to operate independently and
autonomously. It's important for all of us that the team keep working with the pace
and energy of a startup. But we're also extremely conﬁdent that Facebook culture
and approach to innovation will be a great ﬁt for us.
I've known Mark for a number of years and I've admired the way he's kept Facebook
moving fast and innovating, even as the Company had scale. And I think this will be a
model for the way we think about our future as a company too.
I'm excited for our future and I'm conﬁdent that the combination of WhatsApp and
Facebook will allow us to do amazing new things together. I'm very gratiﬁed for this
chance to keep our team together to continue building and scaling the product.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19

Q - Eric SheridanAnd now I'd like to hand it over to David.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Thank you, Jan and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by brieﬂy reviewing the
details of the transaction.
Facebook will acquire WhatsApp for approximately $16 billion, consisting of $4
billion in cash plus 184 million shares or approximately $12 billion worth of our stock.
In addition, we will grant $46 million RSUs worth approximately $3 billion to the
WhatsApp employees including their founders that will vest over four years
subsequent to closing. The stock and RSUs we will issue to WhatsApp will represent
7.9% of Facebook's shares based on current shares and RSUs outstanding.
The deal was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies
and has already been approved by the WhatsApp shareholders. The transaction is
subject to regulatory approvals and we currently expect it to close later in 2014.
As Mark said, we're really excited to be announcing this acquisition. WhatsApp is an
extraordinary asset, a clear technology and market leader in a very important space.
They have a network of over 450 million people using the service each month and
70% of them are active on a given day.
And just as important, is how rapidly the network continues to grow. We believe
WhatsApp is on a path to grow to over 1 billion people using the service and that
networks of this scale and engagement are incredibly valuable. Given the size of
their network and the value they provide to people who use their service, we're
conﬁdent that, over the long run, WhatsApp will deliver signiﬁcant returns for our
shareholders.
Now, let's open for questions.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Eric Sheridan, UBS.
{BIO 22465717 <GO>}
Thanks for taking the question, guys. Two quick ones. One, is there any way you can
give us some color around the transaction itself? Was this a competitive process or
was this purely a discussion between Facebook and WhatsApp over the last couple
of weeks and months?
And second, longer term, Mark, maybe you can help us understand how the
companies will work together under the Facebook umbrella and how might theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19

Q - Doug Anmuthgoals at WhatsApp be achieved both independently and working more closely with
Facebook. Thanks.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Sure. So I can take the ﬁrst one. Jan and I have known each other for a couple of
years and we've been talking about all the diﬀerent things that we could do together
and how the world will evolve in terms of communication and in social networks and
he's been a valuable thought partner the whole time.
Last Sunday evening. So about 11 days ago, I proposed that if we joined together that
that would help us really connect the rest of the world and could help out with things
like Internet.org by bringing these two communication tools that are very diﬀerent
together. And he thought about it and then, over the course of the week, came back
and said that you were interested and -- feel free to add any color here that I'm
missing from you. Then we discussed the price later in the week and we came to
terms that were agreeable to us and I think we just decided to go forward from
there.
From my perspective, both David and I have said this. But we think that WhatsApp is
on a clear path to have 1 billion people using their product. And services in the world
that have 1 billion people using them are all incredibly valuable. And from that
perspective, we just think that -- and the growth rate that they have today and the
monetization model that's early but is promising and in place that they have, we see
a pretty clear trajectory ahead and we were just very excited to work together on
this.
What was the second question? Oh, on how to integrate. I mean WhatsApp is going
to operate independently. That's a really important thing here. We want to do this
the same way that we did Instagram. We feel like we've learned from the Instagram
experience. This is obviously a bigger scale, much bigger scale. But a lot of the
lessons there -- we weren't sure at the time how well it would work or if, in practice, a
company really could join and be as independent as what Kevin and I were
discussing. And what we found is that it really can work and I think Kevin would say
that he's gotten a huge amount of value out of being able to use Facebook
infrastructure and recruit and have Facebook employees join and that's just been
very valuable to him in scaling.
And that's going to be the model that we use here too. So whatever services and
employees that Jan would like to join WhatsApp, we will be able to do and we're not
going to push very much. And Jan and I are going to continue to be in dialogue
about the strategies of the overall company and what we want to do.

Page 7 of 13A - Mark Zuckerberg
A - Jan Koum
A - Deborah CrawfordGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Jan and Mark, I'm hoping you can talk a little
bit more about monetization. You mentioned in the early stages here at WhatsApp.
But also, Jan, just curious on your thoughts going forward about ads on WhatsApp. I
think you've been a little bit more averse to advertising in the early days of the
service. Hopefully, you can talk about that going forward. Thanks.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
So let me start oﬀ and then I guess Jan is going to jump in. Our explosive strategy is
for the next several years to focus on growing and connecting everyone in the world.
Then we believe that once we get to being a service that has 1 billion, 2 billion,
maybe even 3 billion people one day, that there are many clear ways that we can
monetize. But the right strategy, we believe, is to continue focusing on growth in the
product and succeeding in building the best communication tools in the world.
So that's actually one of the big reasons why it makes sense for WhatsApp to join us
is that, as an independent company, they wouldn't have been able to as purely focus
on growth, whereas now we can really help them out a lot with that.
But I'll hand it over to Jan to talk about monetization. I don't personally think that ads
are the right way to monetize messaging services and I know Jan shares this
philosophy. So why don't you go into that?
{BIO 17854849 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. I think I've talked to Mark about it a number of times and I have
talked about it in our blog. We think that for our product for messaging, advertising
is not necessarily the right thing to go. We feel that we actually have a very solid
monetization system in place that helps us create a direct relationship with our user
and our customer.
And as WhatsApp really focuses on growth, monetization is not going to be a priority
for us. And this is why actually we respect Mark and his vision, is that he thinks very
long term on everything thing they do at Facebook. They focus on something that is
not just tomorrow but something that is ﬁve or ten years from now.
And that's the same with our company. We always talk about where mobile is going
to be, not today, not next year. But in 2020 or in 2025. And as we look forward to the
next ﬁve, ten years, 5 billion people will have a smartphone and we have a potential
to have 5 billion users potentially giving us money through the subscription model.
So we really, really are excited about the growth today and the potential of where it's
going to be ﬁve, ten years from now and we're not really concerned about
monetization today. We're focused on the growth.

{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
On the monetization side and the subscription model, can you give us a sense of -- I
know that you're less than a year into introducing the subscription plan but what has
been your experience in terms of conversion rate from free to pay, given that it
sounds like that, for the foreseeable future, that's how you'll fund the investments in
the business at least partly and what your expectations are for conversion going
forward?
Then a question for Mark. Can you give us a sense of what portion of WhatsApp's
active users overlap with Facebook users and what portion of them are using
Facebook to connect their proﬁles and their social graph on WhatsApp? Thanks.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Hi, Mark. This is David. I can take both of these, actually. In terms of monetization, as
Jan said, their priority at WhatsApp has been and will continue to be building out
and growing the network and getting people engaged with the service and bringing
as much utility as they can. So as you know, they've rolled out subscription to some
users in some countries and it hasn't been and won't be the top priority to optimize
revenue in the short term.
In terms of overlap, we really don't know. I mean we would imagine, based on the
penetration rates of the two products that, obviously, in places there must be a level
of overlap but we don't have the analytics or the knowledge to quantify that at this
point.

{BIO 3469195 <GO>}
Thank you. Mark, maybe you could talk about why you're going to keep the
businesses separate. And is there any way to leverage the WhatsApp usage to
increase usage of Facebook or do you even see that as a need? Thanks.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
So this is our operational strategy in the Company, not just the acquisitions that we
do. But we want to keep all of the diﬀerent apps and experiences, we want the
people who are running them to have autonomy. We have many diﬀerent productsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19

Q - Ross Sandler
A - Jan Koumat this point and we have a lot of really talented people running them. And that's just
the kind of standard operating structure that we have at our company. So from that
perspective, I feel quite comfortable that this is the right way to go.
And the big question when we did the Instagram acquisition was; would it work to
bring an outside company into that model? And what we've proven, at least to
ourselves and we think the results there initially are quite good as well, is that, yes,
that works.
So Jan. And Brian as cofounder, are clearly amazingly talented. I mean with 50
people at their company, they've built a product and a network that has almost half-
a-billion people actively using it in ﬁve years. No one in the history of the world has
done anything like that before. So I frankly think that, even if this weren't the
standard way that we were doing it, that it would be pretty stupid for us to interfere
in a big way.
Now, that said, I mean Jan and I also know each other really well and have a great
degree of trust and our strategic thinking overlaps a lot. So I think that what you'll
ﬁnd is that there will be diﬀerent ways that the organizations can work together to
accelerate each other's growth or to link in diﬀerent ways over time, maybe, if we
think of something, although that's not the plan upfront. And I think that there's
going to be quite a good deal of beneﬁt that the two get from being connected.

Next question.
Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.
{BIO 15948659 <GO>}
Thanks, guys. Jan, can you talk about how the product may evolve from its current
state, one-to-one or one-to-many messaging? Are there other product areas that
look interesting to you that you see out there?
Then I guess a question for Mark or Jan. WhatsApp has actually moved ahead of
Facebook Messenger in many countries. Can you just give a sense of what are the
strongest countries for WhatsApp versus Messenger and kind of how you see those
two coexisting. Thanks.
{BIO 17854849 <GO>}
Sure, absolutely. I think we will try to not talk about the product roadmap today
because we've historically not done it and we don't usually talk about our upcoming
features or our upcoming releases. But what's important to understand and what
Mark has mentioned previously is that WhatsApp will stay independent and
WhatsApp will continue to operate autonomously.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - David EbersmanWe have certain goals we've set out for ourselves in general at WhatsApp on what
we want build into our product this year and we will continue to execute on those
goals. Those goals include making our product better, faster, more eﬃcient. And we
care about details and we will continue to focus on those details. So not necessarily
very sexy but things like message speed delivery and application reliability and
battery life and bandwidth usage, all that matters on a smartphone. And that's always
been our focus and it will continue to be our focus.
So you will see our product evolve. It will have new features added to it in the next 12
months. We will continue to upgrade independently and autonomously and we will
continue to add features we actually planned to do earlier this year, over the next 12
months. So that's not changing but, over the next 12 months or 24 months, our
product will evolve and it will become better.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
And in terms of how Messenger and WhatsApp are going to coexist, our thinking on
this is that they actually serve fairly diﬀerent use cases. So Messenger, what we've
seen, evolved from Facebook Chat, which was more of instant messaging, not SMS
and it's widely used today for chatting with your Facebook friends. And a lot of the
messages are not real-time. They're someone will send someone a message and
then, almost like a more informal email. And then expect a reply later in the day.
WhatsApp evolved from this model of really replacing SMS. It's a service for very
quickly and reliably real-time communication with all of your contacts and small
groups of people. And we think that those are two pretty big and diﬀerent use cases
and that the world needs both and that we're going to help our community the most
by continuing to invest in both.
So Jan is saying that WhatsApp obviously has their roadmap and is going to keep on
pushing on that independently. Similarly, the Messenger team is going to continue
with their roadmap exactly and they're going to continue operate independently as
well, with the team that today inside Facebook.

No. We don't have those details to share today. As we've talked about in terms of
monetization, it hasn't been the top priority for the Company and won't be. So as
they roll this out in sort of country by country as they choose, we'll learn more over

Thank you very much. Just a couple of clariﬁcations. David, can you just help us

was a competitive bid but maybe just any more color on that would be very helpful.
Then, in terms of growth, while you're not releasing any maybe split between
international and domestic, where most of that growth is coming from. Is it mostly
international or is it really split evenly domestic and international? Thank you.

Sure. So let me take the second one ﬁrst. I mean you can't be growing at a pace like
that without growing pretty broadly around the world and that's what's happening
with this service. So it's extremely impressive how they're executing.
In terms of valuation, as we've discussed in the remarks, the sort of primary thing that
we focused on was just how healthy this network is and how well it's growing andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19

Q - Robert Peckour conﬁdence that, if you have a network of this size with people who are as highly-
engaged as customers are with WhatsApp, that they're really on a path to get to be a
network of 1 billion people or more in a relatively short period of time. And so we
looked at other networks that have achieved that kind of size and scale and what
kind of value that they've created and what they're worth and that helped give us a
framework for thinking through what might make sense here.
The only other thing that I would add is that this service they provide is tremendously
useful to people and we've always believed that, if you bring a lot of utility into the
marketplace, that sets you up to build a great business over time. If you think about
messaging, it's the number-one activity on smartphones. As Jan said, there's 1.5
million to 2 billion smartphones out there today. That's going to grow to 3 billion, 4
billion, 5 billion smartphones over time.
And they're already at a place now where the messaging volume running through
WhatsApp is nearly the same as the scale of the entire telecom SMS messaging
volume and that's $100 billion business for carriers in terms of direct messaging fees.
So this is a really valuable service that people are willing to pay for.

Robert Peck, SunTrust.
{BIO 2272241 <GO>}
Yes, Mark, could you maybe talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics? You've
obviously got other large messaging platforms out there; LIME, WeChat, Kakao, Kik,
etc. Could you talk about the technological moat around the Company? And have
you been able to quantify any sort of data sharing and lift you'd get from sharing
data back and forth? Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-19

Operator{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Yes. I mean messaging is a very competitive space as you're saying. WhatsApp, I
think is the clear global leader at this. If you go country by country, there are
countries like in Korea or Japan where another messaging service is bigger but if
you look across the world, I think WhatsApp is, in most countries, across Europe and
Latin America, India, a lot of places in Asia; it was kind of the clear leader.
And I think a lot of this gets down to the details that Jan was talking about in an
earlier answer where these guys just obsessively focus on simplicity and speed and
reliability. When they go into a country, they don't rest until their service is faster than
SMS and as reliable with, obviously, all the disadvantages that come with going over
the data network instead of the voice network.
So that's, I think, the technical advantage that these guys have. It's a company of
really hard-core engineers who are obsessing over perfecting messaging, not
adding a lot of bloated features into a messaging app. And I think that that's the way
that that's the right strategy. I think that's what people want. And over time, I think
people are going to pay for that and want to pay for it and will be happy to, to pay
for the best one.
