Presentation
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Tesla and SolarCity combination
conference call. (Operator Instructions)
As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce
your host for today's conference, Mr. Jeﬀ Evanson. Sir, you may begin.
{BIO 17513488 <GO>}
Thank you, Chanel. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our call to discuss the
combination of Tesla and SolarCity. From Tesla, I'm joined today by Elon Musk, JBFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

Elon MuskStraubel, Jason Wheeler. And Tesla General Counsel Todd Maron. From SolarCity, we
have Lyndon Rive, CEO; Peter Rive, CTO; and Tanguy Serra, CFO.
Earlier this morning we issued a press release and a short investor presentation at
the same web address as this webcast.
During our call we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking
statements. These are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual
events or results could diﬀer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties,
including those mentioned in our most recent SEC ﬁlings.
We're going to start today's call with some comments by Todd, our General Counsel,
followed by comments from Elon, Lyndon. And then Jason. (technical diﬃculty) Q&A
and during the Q&A time, please try to limit yourselves to one question and one
follow-up so everyone gets fair time.
And also, let's please stick to the discussion of the combination this morning. We
certainly can discuss other matters about Tesla Wednesday evening this week, when
we report our ﬁnancial results for Tesla's Second Quarter. (Operator Instructions)
With that, I'll turn it over to you, Todd. Please begin.
{BIO 18879554 <GO>}
Thanks, Jeﬀ. Good morning, everyone. Just real brieﬂy before passing it oﬀ to Elon,
wanted to go over the quick overview of the transaction, which, if you have the
investor presentation, is on slide 3.
Under the deal, Tesla will acquire SolarCity in an all-stock transaction. SolarCity
shareholders will receive 0.110 shares of Tesla stock for each share of SolarCity stock
and this corresponds to a per-share value of $25.37. The pro forma ownership of the
combined company would be approximately 93.5% Tesla and 6.5% SolarCity.
The expected close is in Q4 of 2016 after we go through the standard SEC review
and regulatory process. There will be a special approval process for this deal where
the transaction will be subject to the approval of the majority of disinterested
shareholders of both companies voting at each shareholder meeting.
So with that I'm going to pass it over to Elon, who can speak more about the
objectives of the deal.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think I've spoken quite a bit at length probably about the objectives. So I don't
think there's anything new I have to add. It was described when we announced it
and then again in my master plan update. But the entire deal is actually driven by a
need to bring together the products on the factory and the solar side to create anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

Page 3 of 24Lyndon Rive
Jason Wheelerintegrated product for the end-user. The end-user being all the way from the
individual to the utility.
So the idea is that there's one sales process, one inﬂation process, one service
contact, one phone app to monitor things. And then, on the hardware side, that we
can integrate the power electronics and the energy management grid from DC from
the solar panels, DC from the battery pack. And mixing and matching that to provide
AC to homes, businesses, or, in the case of utilities, in those cases very high voltage
DC.
So this is really all part of solving the sustainable energy problem, something that
has been a goal from the beginning. In fact, for my sort of ﬁrst tongue-in-cheek
answer today I should say master plan 10 years ago. That's why we're all doing this is
to try to accelerate the advent of a sustainable energy world and I think this is an
important step in that direction. Thank you.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
I will add to that; this is Lyndon speaking. Many of the (technical diﬃculty) listening
right now are very familiar with Tesla but may not be that familiar with SolarCity. Just
to elaborate more on the importance of vertical integration, when SolarCity started
we, at ﬁrst, didn't do our own installation. Quickly we realized that in order to provide
the best services and the best products, you need to do your own installation and
can control that customer experience.
So we vertically integrated our installation services and our ﬁnancing services and
was able to provide a better experience for our customers and separate it from the
competition. We became the biggest in the country. Now one out of every three
systems installed in the country is installed by SolarCity. We are larger than the next
50 total companies combined.
In order to continue to maintain this diﬀerentiation, you've got to do more than just
vertically integrating the services. You've got to vertically integrate the products as
well. And so that's the next phase of the Company and Tesla creates some of the
best products in the world. When you add their manufacturing expertise and the
investment they are making into storage, as Elon mentioned, it's going to be very
clear that this company of solar combined with storage will be able to provide
energy at a lower cost than traditional forms of energy.
And that energy won't just be energy as we know it today; it will be energy plus grid-
related services, where you can address all the grid needs when you add storage to
the equation. So I'm very excited about this next phase and I think together we can
really accelerate the adoption of clean energy.

Cool. Thanks, Lyndon. This is Jason. I'm speaking to page 12 of the presentation we
sent out ﬁrst.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 4 of 24First and foremost, the headline here is we believe we can generate substantial cost
eﬃciencies with the combination of the two companies. Right now we are targeting
$150 million within the ﬁrst full year after closing.
If I drill down on that, some of the details: clearly there's going to be sales and
marketing eﬃciencies. There are opportunities to rationalize our sales channels.
We're talking about one brand in a complete solution for the customer. There's also
opportunity to leverage our combined digital and retail capabilities.
We also think there's real opportunity just to improve the overall value proposition
when combining the two companies.
On hardware costs, there will certainly be supply chain eﬃciencies. There are
common components between the two companies. Inverters is a great example;
rationalizing the software as well.
We believe there is substantial opportunity to reduce installation and service costs.
Elon has talked about this already. But we are talking about one trip by one truck to
install three products -- solar, storage. And home charging -- for our vehicles.
Improving manufacturing eﬃciency. We've talked a lot about the machine that
makes the machine. To make this a little bit more real, I will give an example.
When Elon and I sat down and started reviewing our Model 3 CapEx plans, there
were new buildings everywhere. And I think Elon has been very clear about talking
about volumetric eﬃciency. As we rationalize these plans we've talked a lot about
there's no need for new buildings; we can do this in the space that we have, for the
most part.
So that is an example of where we think manufacturing eﬃciency will come into play
and we believe that this is going to be applicable to SolarCity as well as they
continue their journey down manufacturing.
There's obviously opportunities to reduce customer acquisition costs as well. This is
a slide in the deck on page 11 which just talks about North America and I think there's
a couple of key things that jump out there.
One, in the markets that SolarCity is currently operating in, Tesla has a footprint there
as well so we've got nice concentration within those shared markets. Then, obviously,
Tesla has got a global footprint as well, which in the future we can certainly leverage.
Then we also believe there is opportunity to cut capital costs as well.
So moving on to the next page; I'm on page 13 now. I think the headline here is the
Tesla SolarCity ﬁnancing strategy is really underpinned by two key factors. One of
those factors is the continued maturation of Tesla's production capabilities. We
already announced this at the beginning of -- or at the end of Q2. Our productionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 5 of 24capacity for vehicles grew 20% quarter over quarter and over 40% year over year, in
spite of some of the challenges that we've talked about with ramping up Model X.
Number two, SolarCity has a formidable project ﬁnancing acumen. I believe that this
is a real asset and, as I've gotten to learn a lot more about it, I think we are really
going to be able to take advantage of this great capability that the company has
built across the enterprise.
If you look at the combination of these two factors, it gives us great conﬁdence in
our ability to continue to access capital markets when necessary. So that's the
headline story around that. But let me drill into it a little bit.
There's ﬁve points on page. One, greater visibility into cash ﬂow dynamics of the
combined company. As stated, we are very encouraged by the observed
improvements in S and X production, which is naturally going to lead to positive
delivery momentum. In addition, we are quite impressed by the cash ﬂow generation
of SolarCity's large market-leading installed base.
Number two, Tesla's disciplined capital expenditures, applying that across the
enterprise. We've demonstrated capital preservation capability at Tesla. In our Q1
earnings we talked about $217 million in CapEx, which is signiﬁcantly down from the
run rate in 2015.
Also, the physics-based, ﬁrst principles approach we're taking to Model 3. I've
already mentioned volumetric eﬃciency. We're also displaying a healthy disregard
for conventional wisdom. It's always been thought that increase in capacity require
step-change increases in capital.
We're looking for diﬀerent to optimize assets that are already in place and breaking
through that. We believe that will be certainly to SolarCity in the future as well.
Number three, we've got great conﬁdence in our initial capitalization and we've got
a goal to delever the enterprise in the future. Number one, drilling down on this, we
will govern the near-term debt growth at SolarCity concurrent with the development
of a rationalized capital plan across the enterprise. And second point here, we will
continue to build our credit proﬁle to open up new sources of capital over time.
Next point, we've got revenue growth that is driven by new products that are already
under development. Model 3 is the key example here. We'll generate gross proﬁts
from that vehicle and that will enhance our overall leverage proﬁle as an enterprise.
Also, the combined solar and storage oﬀering is expected to fuel revenue growth
and should help us self-fund future investments.
Last point on the page, realized synergies and cash ﬂow. I covered a lot of that on
the last page. But overall, just to circle back, we think each company has things thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Ben Kallo, Robert W. Baird.
{BIO 16897436 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about the 45-day go/stop
provision? Is it just a formality? If something were, someone else were to come in
and give a higher oﬀer, how would that impact, Elon, your next step in your master
plan?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well if someone were to come in and make a higher oﬀer -- we (are presuming)
more than like a $0.01 higher oﬀer -- then I guess the independent Board members
would be compelled to accept that and we would have to ﬁnd another path. I have
committed to vote my shares in favor of whatever alternate oﬀer comes through. So
if an alternate oﬀer comes through that is materially better for SolarCity
shareholders, then I assume the independent shareholders would accept that.
I should point out I had no role in establishing this valuation for the oﬀer that was
made, nor do I with any of the mechanics of that. Went into this was -- I was fully
recused from the matter. So I know about as much as you do about how this price
was obtained.

I wanted to follow up here just quickly on the $150 million. Can you break down a
little bit more speciﬁc numerically where that is exactly coming from? Also, again
given a few months now, what are the speciﬁc targets you're thinking about in terms
of storage and where geographically are you thinking it could take place?
{BIO 17513488 <GO>}
Julien, you broke up a bit there towards the end of your question. Could you repeat
it please?
{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
Yes, I apologize. The $150 million, can you break that down a little bit more
quantitatively? Then with regard to the storage element, can you quantify what kind
of projected deployment on the SolarCity side you would expect? And perhaps a
little bit more comment by region.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sorry, before you start targeting such a -- again, I do want to remind everyone on the
call that the deal isn't done. This is simply a recommendation from the independent
Board committees. It must go through SEC review and it must then receive a vote of
a majority of the independent shareholders of Tesla and a majority of the
independent shareholders of SolarCity. Only at that point is this actually a deal.
So this is a prospective deal. But it would be probably at least a few months I'm
guessing. We don't control the SEC timeline before it actually becomes a deal. So it's
likely to close sometime in the Fourth Quarter. Just to preface all the questions.
Because I think some of the articles I'm seeing seem to assume that a deal has been
done. But it's only done the SEC review and two sets of independent shareholders
voting and that is at least a few months away. Sorry, go ahead.
{BIO 17513488 <GO>}
All right. Jason, do you want to take the ﬁnancial question and we will go back to
Elon for the storage penetration?
{BIO 19481227 <GO>}
Sure, yes, no problem. Julien, great question. Thank you for asking it.
Right now we're not assigning the $150 million at any lower level of detail than that.
But let me talk you through some of the things to think about. One of the things is
obviously Tesla's retail footprint is a real example to drive down customer acquisition
costs. We have more than 3 million people that come through Tesla, our Tesla retail
locations, every year and there is a broad overlap in the types of products that theseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

Page 8 of 24A - Lyndon Rive
Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith
A - Lyndon Rive
Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smithcustomers are looking for, which we think plays right into SolarCity. So one, great
opportunity for sales channel rationalization.
Another one we've talked about as well, we install home charging and usually we do
this through third-party providers for our Tesla vehicle sales. Also, it would be a
separate person coming out to your house to install a battery storage solution and a
separate person coming out your house to install a solar solution. In the combined
entity we can do all of this with one truck and one trip. So there's real opportunities
for synergy on the installation and servicing side.
Then the other key one that we are looking at across the Company is manufacturing
as well. We have been in the manufacturing business for many, many years now. We
have developed a lot of experience in this area. SolarCity is still in the beginning of
that journey. So there I think are a lot of key learnings that can be applied to
SolarCity.
If I was going to kind of wrap that all up, I think really looking at customer acquisition
costs is a key source of synergy. Looking at reducing installation and service costs is
another key source and then also looking at the manufacturing capabilities of the
combined entity is a third key source. Of course, we're going to look for more
beyond that and we believe there are potential revenue synergies, large potential
revenue synergies in the future as well. But just on the cost side there's a lot of meat
on the bone.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Then in terms of the storage adoption, the way I see it, the ﬁrst product available for
residential customers is primarily going to be focused on backup. But you'll see that
there is policy changes that are occurring where the grid is looking for grid services
and so when you combine solar with storage you can provide essentially most of the
grid services that the grid needs.
New York came out with a joint agreement with the solar industry and the main
utilities there describing a three; to ﬁve-year glide path of how solar and storage
would work together. SolarCity just did a -- just announced a pilot with PG&E in
Northern California of how solar and storage again provide grid services. So as that
policy becomes more common across the diﬀerent utilities, I see that almost all
systems will be deployed with solar and storage combined, call it over the next three
to ﬁve years.
{BIO 15955666 <GO>}
But no speciﬁc quantitative targets on storage deployment yet?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Nothing that we will say.

{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
As the companies actually get integrated, remember the companies aren't
integrating; the deal is not yet approved and of course there will be considerably
high ﬁdelity on that. But I would take the sort of $150 million, $200 million estimate, I
think that's conservative. That's what my gut feeling here is. I think we will
signiﬁcantly see that even in the ﬁrst year.
Patrick Archambault, Goldman Sachs.
{BIO 4638109 <GO>}
Thanks. Good morning. I guess my ﬁrst question is the three; to ﬁve-year time frame
for when solar plus storage makes sense, is that in all jurisdictions of the United
States or is that some?
Obviously, there's diﬀerent rate levels and regulations as well. And there are places
like Hawaii that make sense now. But other states where it's going to make sense in a
longer time horizon. So that was my ﬁrst clariﬁcation.
Then secondly, just related to that, the question got brought up last call. But it does
beg the question of why now? If you've got sort of half a decade until this makes
economic sense and the degree of diﬃculty of what you've got going on over the
next 18 months is so high, why was the decision made to take this on right away?
Why not wait until some of these more diﬃcult operating hurdles were gone over I
guess?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
I just want to add one clarity to my comment on the three to ﬁve years: that is with
full mass deployment applying to essentially almost systems we are deploying.
Naturally, the adoption will occur a lot earlier with many of our customers.
If you combine solar and storage and you can provide a backup oﬀering at
essentially roughly the same rate as what they are paying for energy today, in many
of the spaces we operate we see high adoption will occur. My comment on the three
to ﬁve years is essentially getting to a point where almost every single system that we
deploy all has solar and storage. So I just wanted to clarify that. There will be a
growth period from now until then as we integrate.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
This is really long-term thinking here. In order for the right scenario to transpire in
three years, we need to take the action now. You can't take the action in three years
and then have it instantly be the right move; it takes time to get there. So this is an
action now which is anticipating several moves ahead.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

Okay, if I can just ask a clariﬁcation, it's just that there are a number of studies from
credible sources that have put the kind of --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So they say.
{BIO 4638109 <GO>}
-- lower cost of energy. Well I mean just people like the RMI that have done a lot of
work on this. And I'm not saying it's 100% right. There is assumptions into every
piece of research. But I was just wondering -- their view is that the levelized cost of
energy as sort of equaling the grid cost is further out than what you guys would
suggest.
And I was just curious -- maybe you haven't read their work, I don't know -- but
where do you see yourselves being diﬀerent? Is really -- is it just the manufacturing
costs that you feel you can get it better than what some of those assumptions are?
I'm just kind of curious on that point.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well it's important to bear in mind that the cost of energy varies quite dramatically
around the United States and throughout the world and the pricing mechanism for
that energy also varies considerably. In some countries there's quite a huge premium
depending upon the time of day that you use energy.
But in the United States, for example, Hawaii has very expensive electricity. So we
expect to see a lot of activity in Hawaii. Certainly well before, say, Texas, which has a
very low cost of energy.
So one shouldn't look at this monolithically. But rather as the competitiveness of
solar paired with battery improves, it starts to address more and more of the total
market for electricity. Initially addressing only where electricity is very expensive,
then where electricity is moderately expensive, then slightly expensive. And
eventually reaching the point where it's competitive on -- relative to the average
price of fossil fuel energy.
So that's a sort of steady march in that direction. It requires a lot of technology
development, operational improvements. And economies of scale, all of which this is
-- this merger is intended to achieve.

Q - Rod LacheIf I could just chime in on that too, this is JB. I think most of our projections (technical
diﬃculty) oﬀ, especially for a well-integrated product, are more aggressive than what
most of these diﬀerent industry studies have been assuming.
And also, it's not just about levelized energy, as Lyndon was saying. There's a lot of
other beneﬁts that have speciﬁc value when you can have a very well-integrated
product with storage. I think it's really key to take those beneﬁts into account,
whether it's just backup power or whether it's aggregated grid services that these
distributed resources can be provided.
{BIO 4638109 <GO>}
Got it, okay. Thanks, guys.
Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank.
{BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. Was wondering if you can share -- maybe it's just a stab
at what the revenue synergy opportunity might be or the extent to which customer
acquisition costs for solar can decline. Also, just from a high level, from a Tesla
shareholder perspective, can you just talk a little bit about the ﬁnancial impact of the
combination? What is the impact, just roughly, on the earnings and cash ﬂow as you
look out at the combination in 2017, 2018. And 2019 versus Tesla alone?
{BIO 19481227 <GO>}
Sure. This is Jason, Rod. Let me -- there's a lot of questions built into that; that was
like a paragraph there.
First of all, on the revenue synergies, I think you look at the combined footprint of
the two companies and I just think that there's some more eﬃcient way just to drive
revenue. If you look at the digital capabilities, from a marketing perspective, that
SolarCity has, the physical retail capabilities that Tesla has, I think there's real
opportunity there.
But I also think the story of the value proposition of combined solar and storage is
not well understood and I think putting the two companies together makes that
message quite clear. And we're going to really be able to help educate consumers
on the value there. So I think that's also a huge source of potential synergy.
Now in terms of modeling out into the future, 2017, 2018, 2019, we are certainly taking
a look at that. But this is the early days of integration and digging through that. So
we're not going to provide a lot of detail on that at this time. But more to come.

{BIO 15826276 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. Lyndon, I just had a question on your cash ﬂow
breakeven targets. I think you had said previously that you will be breakeven,
achieving breakeven by the end of this year. Do you still expect that to be the case
given the new installation run rate?
Then, as you think about the combined company, what do you think about the split
between leasing and direct sales? I think the majority of your business today is
leasing. Is that going to be the case going forward or you expect more of direct sale
approach?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Yes. So in terms of our forecast for cash ﬂow positive for Q4, we still feel good about
that. We will be updating our investors and providing a more detailed cash ﬂow
forecast at our earnings call on August 9. But we are still well on track to achieve that
goal.
Your second question on leases versus loans or cash sales, we've actually seen an
increase in loan and cash sales and so over time I actually think loan and cash sales
will become a larger portion of our business. Speciﬁcally, as we start diﬀerentiating
more with products and I think customers would want R&D equipment, too.

Q - James Albertine
A - Elon MuskGreat. Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask, if
possible -- and apologies, as we are again much more focused on Tesla and have
never covered SolarCity in the past.
We wanted to understand a little bit about where SolarCity is in its product cycle
from an investment standpoint. We know where Tesla Motors is with the Model 3
coming up and the cash needs there. But wanted to understand what the key cash
components or needs were in the short term for SolarCity.
Then, as you think about that answer, are we going to be expecting an infusion as it
relates to the combination? So it sounds like, I think I heard you say a minute ago the
combined solar and storage proposition is not well known. What is entailed with
that: higher advertising costs, consumer education? Really trying to get a sense and
triangulate here where capital is needed and where capital is coming from in the
short term. Thanks.
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Let me answer just the combined solar and storage. We actually think it's going to
appeal to a diﬀerent emotion to customers today. Today the primary emotion for
going solar is it's environmentally a better strategy and you can save money.
Once you add storage to the equation, you have backup. So you go from saving
money, environmental. And then reliability or safety. With many of the large climate
events that are occurring, blackouts are quite common here on the East Coast. On
the West Coast you have earthquakes and this type of insurance, this type of product
will appeal to a large base of customers. So we actually think they'll actually help
with acquisition costs and bring it down.
In terms of capital for SolarCity, as I said, our goal is to be cash ﬂow positive in Q4.
As we look at ramping up the manufacturing facility in next year, that's will assume
additional capital. I think with Tesla's help we will be able to make it more eﬃcient
and I think that answers your questions.

Actually -- Elon here, if I could just add one thing, which is I do think we are -- again,
the deal needs to conclude. We're still probably at least a few months from that
being done. But I think we would expect a decrease in the marketing expenses and
the sales expenses for SolarCity that's quite substantial.

we have a tremendous amount of foot traﬃc that I think is underutilized because we

{BIO 15211204 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the questions. Just to drill in a little bit
deeper; I know this might be tough. But to what degree can you talk about or
quantify the customer acquisition costs, integration cost reduction?
Then I think I just heard Lyndon mention that Tesla might support the manufacturing
launch of the Silevo. Can you discuss that in any degree as well? Thank you.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
On the manufacturing side, as Jason was articulating, I think Tesla at this point is
starting to become quite good at manufacturing and, in fact, I think with the
Gigafactory and with Model 3 I think we will start -- obviously this is -- we need to
show that we can do this.
But I'm starting to feel conﬁdent that it's possible to dramatically improve the state of
the art of manufacturing by applying a physics-ﬁrst principles approach to the
manufacturing process and to be quite speciﬁc at really applying a couple of the key
concepts behind the rocket equation to factories. One being the usefulness density
of a factory which deﬁnes the capital expenditure associated with the factory and
then the excess velocity of product from that factory.
Those are actually analogous to two elements of (our) equation and we found that
by applying those principles to automotive manufacturing and to battery
manufacturing, we have been able to come up with dramatic improvements that we,
ultimately, think will lead to at least a half order of magnitude improvement of (our)
next best auto factory in the world.
Now, of course, talk is cheap and we need to show that that's true. But the math
suggests it is. So we will be applying those same principles to the production of
store sales, panels. And modules as well as making those systems really custom-
designed to a house or location, business, whatever the case may be. And making
them beautiful. I think this is very important. There needs to be an asset to yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

{BIO 15211204 <GO>}
Great. And one more, if I may. In terms of the solar storage business, as you guys
ramp, the focus of SolarCity historically has been residential. But 10% to 20% of the
business in a quarter could be commercial. Is there a focus at all for that business to
pursue the commercial opportunities that might be more economic near term, or is
it focused solely on the residential side?
{BIO 15308288 <GO>}
Most of you actually don't know this. But we are actually the largest in the country as
well when it comes to the commercial industry, behind the meat of commercial. And
we have actually been selling a fair amount of storage already for behind-the-meter
commercial.
With commercial the utilities separate demand cost from energy cost and so when
you provide solar combined with storage, you can oﬀer customers a higher level of
savings plus they have backup. That division is growing really nicely inside the
Company. Then just the utility scale business, we've done a fair amount of work
there.
We've announced the large project in Hawaii where we can ﬁrm up energy when you
combine solar and storage and can provide a large part of the island's energy needs
at night. And with the beneﬁt of storage, the ramp-up and ramp-down period is
almost instant. So we deﬁnitely see that market growing and it has been growing.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
If I can add a little bit there, because I think, just to touch on what Lyndon was saying
at the end there, it's common for SolarCity or (inaudible) my company to be cast as
competitive with utilities or belligerent, in a belligerent situation. But actually I think --
I really see it as quite diﬀerent from that. I see us as really working hand-in-hand with
utilities to transition the power generation to a sustainable scenario long term.
And I think it's very important to bear in mind that as transport becomes electric and
as a lot of heating, which is currently using fossil fuels, becomes electric, the demand
for electricity is going to increase dramatically, probably by a factor of something in
the order of at least 2, maybe 3. So that's actually going to present a huge challenge
for utilities, where they are either going to have to build a huge number of new
electricity plants and lots of new transmission wires all over people's neighborhoods
and new substations all over people's neighborhoods, which people don't want and
it's a big headache for the utilities to do.
Or you can combine centralized renewable energy generation with localized
renewable energy generation on the rooftops. So I think there's a prosperous future
here for both utilities and rooftop energy providers and everyone wins, because this
is a growing pie, a rapidly-growing pie. When a pie is constant or it's shrinking, thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

A - Elon Muskis obviously where you get kind of negative competition. But this is really a case
where the pie is growing rapidly and I think there's plenty of room for utilities and for
rooftop providers like SolarCity.
And I think that is what people want. I think we will want that. If you ask the average
person do you want a ton of new power lines going through your neighborhood, do
you want a ton of new substations in your book, nobody wants that. And it would
take ages to do that and I think it would probably get stuck in permitting and it's just
not a good way to go.
On the other hand, if you say do you want beautiful localized rooftop generation
paired with transition to sustainable central generation? I think it's the obvious thing
that we all want for the world and that's the solution we should all ﬁght for.

Good morning, everyone. Elon and Jason, you both mentioned in terms of synergies
one visit, one installation, one app (multiple speakers). I guess I wanted to get your
thoughts on one bill, which presumably simpliﬁes it as well. And whether you think
you need to build something bigger internally from a ﬁnancing perspective or
potentially form a JV with someone to facilitate that.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I don't know about a JV. I'm not the biggest fan. I just have a hard time with JVs just
trying to think of any good examples that work. I'm in old fool writing -- having
simple deals where parties understand each other and what not, like what we have
with Panasonic.
A lot of people think we actually have a JV with Panasonic. But we don't. We just
have a simple, real short, couple pages contract or something and just everyone
understands the basic principles of what it means to work together. But you don't
have all the governance issues of a JV, which usually leads to problems down the
road.
But we will have, I think, as we combined companies, actually a stronger balance
sheet. It sort of stands to reason, if you are going to maintain, say, cash reserves in
one company and then cash reserves in another company, you can't take the
probabilistic combination of what both companies need. It's actually less eﬃcient to
have cash reserves in one company or another and I think a stronger balance sheet
means you can also raise reﬁnancing a lot easier.
I'm not sure if anyone else would like to comment on that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

Edwin Mok, Needham and Company.
{BIO 15222334 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. Elon, I have a question about your master plan. You
mentioned that -- on the plan you actually said empowering individuals to be their
only utility. So kind of conceptually do you see that the solar business should have
more of your customer owning the solar system versus right now solar is mostly a
leasing, which has been SolarCity's only system? So that's my ﬁrst question.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think it's up to the customer. But I think we want to -- and SolarCity by the way, is
already starting to do this. But really oﬀer Tesla's -- as we do with cars -- three
options: outright ownership; a loan, which you can get an extension of your house
mortgage, which is actually a very low cost of capital way to do it.
Actually it's cheaper than what SolarCity can do. So I think it's sort of actually -- it
involves a bit more paperwork with the bank usually. But it's actually the most
economically eﬃcient way to do it is an extension of the loan you have. Or have
SolarCity do a lease. But SolarCity's cost of capital is higher than that of the
individual in most cases. So the logical move is actually to either own it outright in a
cash purchase, or to add it to your home mortgage. And I think we're going to push
a lot more in that direction and also, of course, it decreases the dependency of our
solar business on the capital markets.
{BIO 15222334 <GO>}
Great, that's very helpful. Then just a question on the technology development. I
think in your prepared remarks you mentioned that some of the components, such
as inverters, you can potentially develop your own or how some technology synergy
there.
Maybe can you give us some more color in terms of which areas that you guys are
working; have already started working on together or which areas that you guys plan
to start work together on these kind of technologies, joint technology development?

Q - Colin Ruschfavoring Tesla. If we're independent companies it has to be an arms-length
transaction, where the same thing is oﬀered to other companies. Everything has got
to be run through the independent Board committees.
It's very unwieldy and, in fact, one of the things that really prompted the timing of
the merger was just the diﬃculty of, for example, this big utility deal that we're doing
in Hawaii, which my saying is we will be the largest combined solar battery dealer in
the United States and perhaps the world. And how we had to spend months running
it through independent Board committee of Tesla and SolarCity getting conﬂict
waivers. And we were like, man, we are going to do dozens and then hundreds and
maybe thousands of these deals. There's no way we can keep running -- we can have
such an unwieldy process. It's just crazy. So we've got to combine the companies.
But obviously until we combine the companies, we are constrained by conﬂict of
interest. The irony of a lot of the reporting around this merger is that they were
reporting on, oh, there's all sorts of conﬂict of interest in the merger. I'm like, no, the
conﬂicts of interest are if we don't merge. The point of the merger is to get rid of the
conﬂict of interest.
So we can't really -- we can only talk prospectively what we might do. But we can't
actually do anything. It's very limited what we can do until we have actually one
company.
{BIO 19481227 <GO>}
Maybe just quickly on the inverter point, power electronics is something that is really
quite core to Tesla and I think it is something we see as a really strong competency
of ours. Most people don't realize it. But Tesla is one of the biggest manufacturers of
power electronics in the world if you look at all the charging equipment in the cars,
the inverter that runs the motors in the cars. So looking forward it's something that
we see a lot of potential on and we see this interesting and lucrative opportunity if
we can more aggressively innovate and integrate that with storage.

I was going to say it turned out that Tesla would not need to provide a loan to
SolarCity.
{BIO 19481227 <GO>}
Yes. What he said.
{BIO 15823117 <GO>}
Then you just talked about your power electronics capabilities and certainly that's an
area for innovation in terms of the integration of these assets. I would expect that
you would probably apply some of Tesla's engineering expertise on that. How
quickly do you think you could have a product that fully integrates the two without
using that outside inverter to assist the integration?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think we don't want to jump the gun on future announcements. But we are
internally betting on the come here. So if it doesn't go through it will be a bit
awkward. We are betting on the come on on integrated, just some power
electronics, which actually does get quite complex actually. It's not an easy technical
problem to solve and solve well in terms of mass volume cost aesthetics, longevity of
the electronics.
But as JB is saying, I think we're probably the best in the world on advanced inverter
technologies and we're kind of working that direction kind of hoping that this all
goes through. But again, with SolarCity still working at arms' length. So less than
ideal. But we want to reserve the product announcements for the right timing as
opposed to this is more of a ﬁnancial call.

capital to really help with that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

I'm not sure what that means. But I think we are going to do okay on the capital front.
I did mention at one point that there may be some art in doing a small equity capital
raise as a combined company just to delever and derisk the balance sheet. But small
meaning kind of low to mid single-digit percentages. So --.
But I don't think we need more than that. Tesla's core business of Model S and X
sales and Powerwall and Powerpack sales we'll be generating quite signiﬁcant
positive cash ﬂow. SolarCity's business will also be generating a lot of core positive
cash ﬂow. So it's really mostly about scaling up to Model 3 and then scaling up the
advanced solar cell and module manufacturing. If we weren't in such a crazy rapid
growth mode, we would be producing signiﬁcant positive free cash ﬂow.
{BIO 5762430 <GO>}
I'm sorry, I was really kind of coming from the idea that there might be a third party
that you would be talking to in some other way. But it sounds like nothing like that is
going on.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
No. I mean I'm sure there's third parties we could talk to. But there just doesn't seem
to be a need right now.
{BIO 5762430 <GO>}
Okay. Then just a second question and a follow-up to sort of the eﬃciencies you gain
in manufacturing and I certainly applaud you for trying to be more eﬃcient on
manufacturing over time. It sounds like you are trying to really advance the ball more
than other folks have.
Just curious what that means for employment in your plants. Sort of the dumb guys'
view of the auto world, which is where I come from, is usually a 250,000 unit plant
has about 3,000 workers in it and it sounds like you're going to have a much greater
capacity with maybe a lot fewer workers. It does get into sort of this existential
question of if there's less manufacturing and less employment, where does the
demand ultimately come from?
Once again, I applaud you for trying to get more eﬃcient. So I'm not making any
judgment on that. I think that's actually the exact right thing to do. But just as you
think about employment in general, it just seems like it could start hollowing out the
demand side. And this is a broader question, not just so speciﬁcally for you. But it
seems like you are going to make a lot of progress. How do you guys think about
that?

Operatorvehicles? This is going to apply to many professions. It's not unique to automotive. I
think we are going to have to rethink the whole social contract.
But we can spend a long time dealing with philosophical and existential questions.
But in the speciﬁc case of Tesla's factories, I actually think we're going to have more
people, not fewer people. But the volume in vertical integration will be a lot higher.
{BIO 5762430 <GO>}
But the ratio of worker (multiple speakers) the ratio of worker to output, I'm just
curious where you think you could get that to.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's going to be substantially better than anything else out there. We will have a lot of
work. But we will have -- I estimated, for example, that the Gigafactory will probably
end up at triple its original expected output from 50 gigawatt hours to probably 150
gigawatt hours. And the headcount we had estimated about 5,000 or 6,000. I think
it probably ends up more like 10,000. But that is tripling of output for a doubling of
workforce.
So that's -- we actually will be with a higher training level. I think we're going to have
to establish schools and training and everything because a lot of the work is going to
be more sophisticated and involve maintenance and upgrading of machines and
dealing with anomalies in the production process. So it's going to require a lot more
training, as opposed to sort of basic repetitive actions, which really are better done
by machine.
I think the quality of work will be more interesting and it's going to require us to
engage in training and I think establish internal training -- high levels of internal
training as well as work with educational institutions to make sure that the students
are graduating with the level of training that's needed to deal with a very
sophisticated machine that makes a machine. So I think it's more rewarding and
interesting work. But one that requires more training.
{BIO 19481227 <GO>}
In Nevada, we are actually already partnered with several of the local colleges and
universities and technical schools, setting up curriculum that really focuses on just
those things. Basically working with automation, ﬁguring out how to maintain it. It's
been really interesting; there's huge interest from students and also the workforce in
general.

Thanks for taking the question. Two questions here actually. First oﬀ, how can the
combination of SolarCity and Tesla help derisk the Gigafactory as Model 3
production ramps? And speciﬁcally insuring that there's an outlet for the additional
battery output into grid storage application.
{BIO 16619298 <GO>}
I can maybe take a shot at that one. A lot of the initial growth and scale up for the
Gigafactory is focused very much on Model 3. So we don't really absolutely need
some large storage market to justify or ﬁll up the Gigafactory. It's actually ramping
up as fast as we can possibly grow it.
That said, though, we do see, I think as we said a few times, incredibly strong growth
in the storage products coming out of the Gigafactory and eventually those could
make up a very large % of the output. I think if we are able to do a very well-
integrated product and we can see the demand that Lyndon was talking about
earlier ramping up to essentially all the solar installations, that could really help ﬁll up
that portion of the storage demand in the intermediate term.
{BIO 22099627 <GO>}
All right. Thanks for that. I guess maybe this one is for Elon. But a lot of people have
made the comparison in saying that General Motors or Ford, it never made sense for
them to acquire Exxon Mobil. So why should Tesla and SolarCity combine? I think
that it's a bit of a false analogy and ignores the key diﬀerence between distributed
renewable energy infrastructure and potential autonomous vehicle ﬂeet owner long
term.
Elon, I'd like to get your thoughts and a little bit more of the longer-term leverage
between a ﬂeet of autonomous vehicles and a distributed network of renewable
energy infrastructure.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Sure. It's always dangerous to apply kind of past historical analogies to a future that's
very diﬀerent, conceptually diﬀerent. But I think it takes time for people to kind of
adjust their templates and sort of re-appreciate the dimensions by which something
should be viewed.
Because one could also have said, for example, with the advent of when there were
just horses and carriages and going towards automotive companies, that's like
clearly the horses -- the horse companies and carriage companies weren't
combined. So why should car companies produce motors and vehicles? But when
you have integrated things with a car it makes sense to have the motor and the car
designed by the same company. So you can have a good integrated system that
works together well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-01

OperatorThat same paradigm didn't exist in horses and carriages. There wasn't a good
rationale for the carriage companies also to own all the horses.
Now with solar, you really need to combine storage because obviously the sun
doesn't shine at night and sometimes it gets cloudy and there's variance during the
day for how much energy is produced. It's obviously lower in the morning, peaks in
the middle of the day. And then is lower at dusk and then oﬀ at night. So naturally it
would -- we need to oﬀer that power because people want electricity 24 hours a day
and so it naturally lends itself to being an integrated product.
Then you also want to factor in when does it make sense to charge the electric car?
You want to charge electric car at the right time of day. You don't want to charge it
and kind of deplete your home storage unit. If you know that dawn is about to break
and you're going to be generating electricity -- you want the (inaudible), the battery
in your car. And the solar power to all work together and provide you with a great
solution for your home.
And so I think that there is natural product integration here where there isn't all
gasoline and cars. You don't want a gas station at your house. It doesn't make any
sense.
I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to
management for closing remarks.
