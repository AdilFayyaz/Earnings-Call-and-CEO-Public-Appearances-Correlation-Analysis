Good morning, everyone, and welcome to PepsiCo's 2022 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders. Let's begin by introducing each of my fellow directors who are on the
line -- Segun Agbaje, Shona Brown, Cesar Conde, Ian Cook, Edith Cooper, Dina
Dublon, Michelle Gass, Sir Dave Lewis, David Page, Bob Pohlad, Dan Vasella, Darren
Walker, and Alberto Weisser. I would like to thank the Board for their guidance as we
face the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic and the onset of the deadly conﬂictFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04

advice, always representing the best interests of our company and our shareholders.
With the Board's support, we suspended the majority of our operations in Ukraine to
enable our colleagues to seek safety for themselves and for their families. At the
same time, we're providing ﬁnancial assistance and other aid to our Ukrainian
associates, whether they stayed in the Ukraine or ﬂed to Poland, Romania or the
Czech Republic. In Ukraine, we transformed our Lviv warehouse to serve as a
temporary rest stop for our employees and their families moving out of the conﬂict
zone, and we've guaranteed contracts with local potato and dairy farmers.
In Poland, we transformed our headquarters in Warsaw into the PepsiCo Hotel. So
far, more than 150 PepsiCo families, about out 450 people have passed through. In
Romania, we've taken over ﬁve motels to house 600 people, including 200 families
with more than 250 children. And we opened a school for approximately 200
displaced children in Bucharest. In the Czech Republic, our bottler Mattoni is
graciously housing 70 Ukrainian PepsiCo families in their oﬃce, which has also
converted into a hotel called Mattoni House.
We've made the decision to suspend the sale of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other
global beverage brands in Russia, including 7Up and Mirinda, and Mountain Dew.
We're also suspending discretionary capital investments and all advertising and
promotional activities in Russia. As a food and beverage company, now more than
ever, we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business. That means we
have a responsibility to continue to oﬀer our other products in Russia, including daily
essentials such as milk and other daily oﬀerings, baby formula and baby food.
By continuing to operate, we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our
20,000 Russian associates. Our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people who are
caught in the middle of this deadly conﬂict and we join all of those praying for
peace. The conﬂict has added complexity to an already very dynamic environment.
The pandemic has created massive disruption to society and our business. In 2021,
the pace of markets reopening around the world was varied and our team did an
amazing adapting to new consumer and customer behaviors, whilst keeping our
colleagues safe and supporting our communities. But it's not just the pandemic.
We're seeing major shifts in consumer behavior that date back to before 2020.
They have been ongoing supply chain and inﬂationary pressures. The competition
for talent has never been more ﬁerce, especially in developed markets. And we
continue to face the impacts of climate change. For many companies, this is a make-
or-break moment, a moment that would require new skills, new processes and new
partnerships, that would require continually re-evaluating businesses as usual, that
will require working harder than ever. In a lot of ways, that's exactly what we've been
doing at PepsiCo for the last three years. Ever since we adopted the key behaviors of
the PepsiCo way and we began our winning with purpose journey, but we too must
adapt to meet this moment and we're doing so by evolving our strategy to winning
with pep+.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 18Introduced in 2021, pep+ is the future of our company, a strategic end-to-end
transformation that places sustainability and human capital at the center of how we
create growth and we create value. It recognizes a new business reality where
consumers are becoming more interested in the future of the planet and the future
of society. Winning with pep+ reﬂects the way we plan to win in the marketplace and
position ourselves to deliver top-tier ﬁnancial performance, was continuing to
transform ourselves to create value for all of our stakeholders. It embeds pep+ ﬁrmly
at the center of our business from how we innovate to how we operate, to how we
run our teams and build our brands. And it is the key to sustaining the kind of
performance we delivered in 2021, a year that saw us become an even faster and
even stronger and even better company, a year that was in so many ways one of the
most successful years in PepsiCo's recent history.
We are becoming an even faster company, which is reﬂected in our ﬁnancial
performance. I'm very pleased with our results for the full year as our business
delivered 9.5% organic revenue and 12% core constant currency earnings per share
growth, the fastest space we have delivered in over ﬁve years. Among the highlights
of our performance in 2021, our total shareholder return outpaced the consumer
staples category 20.5% to 18.6%. And our return over the past three years has been
71.5% compared to 67.7% for the category.
PepsiCo Beverages North America displayed superior execution and delivered 10%
organic revenue growth, representing its fastest rate of organic revenue growth on
an annual basis in over ﬁve years. Frito-Lay North America delivered 7% organic
revenue growth for the full year, reﬂecting both volume growth and positive net
revenue realization. Our international businesses accelerated and delivered 11%
organic revenue growth. It's the strongest rate of net revenue growth in over ﬁve
years. We continue to win in the marketplace as we held or gained share across
many of our key markets, including the US, Mexico, Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia and
Poland.
Our customers ranked us number one in the Kantar PoweRanking survey for the sixth
year in a row, which reﬂects our role as a valued partner and demonstrates the
beneﬁts of investing alongside our customers to help them drive growth. Our core
operating proﬁt increased 8% and reﬂected a double-digit increase in our
advertising and marketing spend. We announced a 7% increase in our annualized
dividend eﬀective with the expected June 2022 payment. This will represent
PepsiCo's 50th consecutive annualized dividend per share increase. And we
announced that our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $10
billion of PepsiCo common stock through February 2026.
In 2022, we expect share repurchases of $1.5 billion and dividends of $6.2 billion,
which will bring total cash returns to shareholders to approximately $7.7 billion, up
from roughly $5.9 billion in 2021. We're also becoming an even stronger company by
transforming ourselves and building new capabilities. Our global business services
continues to help fuel PepsiCo's growth and it's 5,000-plus associates continue to
partner with all sectors to build capabilities across a growing number of functions toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04

agility and re-imagine digital user experiences.
We established PepsiCo's ﬁrst two Digital Hubs in Dallas and in Barcelona, with plans
to expand to more locations in the future. These hubs will drive PepsiCo
digitalization agenda and are expected to create more than 500 new high-caliber
data and digital jobs over the next two years. Our eCommerce business delivered
signiﬁcant growth and shares across all major accounts in the US channels, enabled
by best-in-class digital capabilities and leveraging PepsiCo's scale to drive channel
development and establish deeply entrenched competitive advantages. We created
a global marketing function to help us elevate consumer centricity across the
company, continue delivering best-in-class brand growth and build on our successes
to take our marketing capabilities to a whole new level.
We expanded and extended our multi-year productivity plan that aims to deliver at
least $1 billion in annual productivity savings through 2026. We entered into a new
business venture with Beyond Meat to develop, produce and market plant-based
protein products. We also entered into an agreement with the Boston Beer
Company, whereby Boston Beer owns and manufacturers Hard Mtn Dew low-alcohol
beverage and our Blue Cloud Distribution entity distributes the product. And we
completed the divestiture of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI
Partners for pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, was retaining a 39%
non-controlling interest in a newly-formed joined by venture that will operate across
North America and Europe.
And thirdly, we're becoming an even better company by operating within planetary
boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and for people, with our
strategic end-to-end transformation, PepsiCo Positive. pep+ drives action and
progress across three pillars -- positive agriculture, positive value chain and positive
choices. When it comes to positive agriculture, we're working to source our crops
and ingredients in ways that restore the earth and strengthen farming communities.
We will do this by striving to spread regenerative practices across 7 million acres by
2030, which is approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint.
We estimate this eﬀort will eliminate at least 3 million tons of greenhouse gas
emissions by the end of the decade. We're also aiming to improve the livelihoods of
more than 250,000 people in our agricultural supply chain and communities by
2030. In 2021, we launched Agrovita, an initiative with Proforest and the PepsiCo
Foundation, to beneﬁt more than 37,000 people over the three years in the
production landscape in Mexico, with a focus on women and small-holder farmers
who produce plantains, cocoa and palm. And we set a goal to sustainably source
100% of our key ingredients by 2030, expanding to include not only grower-sourced
crops like potatoes, whole corn and oats, but also key crops from third parties such
as vegetable oil and grains. As of 2021, we're using 100% RSPO physically certiﬁed
palm oil and 100% Bonsucro certiﬁed sustainable cane sugar globally.
PepsiCo was recognized with two major awards for our continuous commitment and
improvement in positive agriculture. The Field to Market's Collaboration of the YearFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 18award as well as the 2021 Environmental Excellence Award by the Illinois Corn
Growers Association Board of Directors. When it comes to positive value chain, we're
working to build a circular and inclusive value chain. We'll do this by several things --
setting a goal to chief Net-Zero emissions by 2040, a decade earlier than called for
in the Paris Agreement. In 2021, we added Mexico, our second largest market, to our
list of 100% renewable energy countries, helping us on the journey to meet our goal
to source 100% renewable electricity across all our company-owned and console
[ph] operations globally by 2030. Approximately 70% of our global electricity needs
are now met by renewable sources.
We're also aiming to become Net Water Positive by 2030, by replenishing more
water than we use. In 2021, we began a partnership with N-Drip to help farmers
around the world to adopt water eﬃciency technology across 10,000 hectares by
2025. We're also continuing to expand access to safer water globally, reaching more
than 68 million people since 2006. And our goal is to reach 100 million people by
2030. We're introducing more sustainable packaging into our value chain, with new
goals to cut virgin plastic preserving by 50% across our global beverages and
convenient foods portfolio by 2030 against the 2020 baseline. We will do this in part
by using 50% recycled content in our plastic packaging and scaling the SodaStream
business globally.
In 2021, we launched all Pepsi branded products in 100% recycled PET bottles in
Spain, with plans to expand to 11 additional European markets in 2022. We also set
goals to eliminate virgin fossil-based plastic in all European crisp and chip bags by
2030, and convert all US Pepsi branded products to 100% rPET by 2030. And we're
continuing to advance our more than $570 million racial equality journey, including
growing our Black and Hispanic managerial populations in the US, and increasing
our spend with diverse suppliers. We now spend more than $1 billion annually with
certiﬁed diverse enterprises in the US across categories, ranging from marketing to
manufacturing.
And when it comes to positive choices, we are continuing to evolve our portfolio of
beverages and convenience food products, so that they are better for the planet and
better for people. We'll do this by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both
new and existing convenient food products that are better for the planet and will
deliver nutritional beneﬁts, prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole
grains. Expanding our position in the nuts & seeds category, where PepsiCo is
already the global branded leader, including leadership positions in Mexico, China
and several Western European markets.
Accelerating the reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-
based targets across all our portfolio and cooking our convenient foods oﬀerings
with healthier oils. We are over 70% of the way toward our 2025 targets for reducing
added sugars, sodium and saturated fat throughout our portfolio. And continuing to
scale new business models that require little or not-single use packaging.
SodaStream already sold in more than 40 countries is bringing PepsiCo ﬂavor
options like Pepsi Zero Sugar, Lipton and bubly to 23 markets. The new SodaStream
Professional platform is expected to expand into functional beverages and reachFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04

Page 6 of 18David Flavellmore than 10 additional markets by the end of 2022, part of the brand's eﬀort to
help consumers avoid more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030.
We're also delivering important packaging innovations like an industrially
compostable bag made with plant-based materials, which debuted in 2021 with Oﬀ
The Eaten Path. To give you an example of what pep+ would look like in practice,
imagine our iconic Lay's Potato Chips. With pep+, we envision Lay's will start with a
potato grown sustainably on an originative [ph] ﬁeld and then be cooked and
delivered from a Net-Zero and Net Water Positive supply chain, sold in a bio-
compostable bag with the lowest sodium levels on the market. That's a positive
choice. That's the best-tasting number-one potato chip of the future. That's how
pep+ will be better for people, better for the planet and better for our business.
So as you can see, we're becoming even faster, even stronger and even better in
many diﬀerent ways. The majority of the credit belongs to our incredible associates.
Over the past year, our global and local teams came together as one PepsiCo to
beat the odds and create smiles for all our stakeholders. We will continue to rely on
our people in the years ahead. The changes we're seeing in the market are likely to
accelerate. The demand for sustainable consumer-centric innovation will continue to
increase. The expectations of people and society will continue to escalate. The virus
will be with us for the foreseeable future and the deadly conﬂict in Ukraine tragically
has no end in sight.
But, but as I speak to you today, I'm more conﬁdent than ever in PepsiCo's long-term
success. Not only do we have the right people, but we also have the right
investments, the right culture, and now, in winning with pet positive, we have the
right strategy. When we collaborate across our organization and win with external
partners around the world, our shareholders, our consumers, our customers, our
communities, we can create even more smiles and position ourselves for long-term
success. That is the magic of PepsiCo.
Thank you for joining us on the next phase of our journey, for the conﬁdence you
continue to place in us with your investment, and for your participation in this year's
Annual Meeting. And now, I'll turn it over to David Flavell, Executive Vice President,
General Counsel And Corporate Secretary, who will serve as Secretary of the
meeting and lead us through the agenda.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We've designed the format of this virtual meeting to
provide shareholders with the same rights and opportunities to participate, as they
would at an in-person meeting. As is our custom, we will conduct the business
portion of our meeting ﬁrst and answer questions at the end of this meeting. The
meeting agenda and rules of conduct are available on the Meeting Website. We ask
that all review those items, and we appreciate your cooperation with the rules of
conduct.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04

Page 7 of 18As a reminder, shareholders attending the virtual meeting can vote their shares
online from now through the closing of the polls, by logging into the Meeting
Website as a shareholder and clicking the Vote Here button on the bottom of their
screen. If you've previously voted by proxy and do not wish to change your vote,
your vote will be cast as you previously instructed and no further action is required.
We've received questions that were submitted by shareholders in advance of today's
meeting that we will address during the Q&A session as time permits. If you've
logged into the Meeting Website as a shareholder, you may submit a question by
selecting a topic and typing your question in the ﬁeld labeled Enter Question. To
ensure that we receive your questions before the Q&A session is closed, we
encourage you to submit your questions now. Though we may not be able to answer
every question, we will do our best to provide a response to as many questions as
possible. To give everyone a chance to ask a question, we will limit each shareholder
to one question. Questions on the same topic or that are otherwise related may be
grouped, summarized and answered together.
Consistent with state law and our bylaws, a list of shareholders entitled to notice of
this meeting has been available for inspection at our Principal Oﬃce since the 28th
of March, 2022. The Inspectors of Election, Beth VanDerbeck and Matthew Criscenzo
from Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions are attending the meeting today
and have previously taken the oath as Inspectors of Election at this meeting. I've
been informed by the Inspectors of Elections that a majority of the votes entitled to
be cast at this meeting are represented by proxy. And therefore, we have the
necessary quorum under state law and our bylaws.
Now that we have a quorum, I declare this meeting to be duly convened for
purposes of transacting such business as may properly come before it in accordance
with state law and our bylaws. The polls are open for voting. We will close the polls
after the proposals have been presented. We will now proceed with the formal
business of this meeting. Because we did not receive notice of any additional
matters to be considered beyond those in the proxy, no other proposals or
nominations may be introduced at this meeting.
So we'll begin with our ﬁrst agenda item, which is the election of Directors. I place
before the meeting to serve as Directors for the coming year, the 14 individuals
whose names and biographies appear in our Proxy Statement. Our Board
recommends a vote for each of the nominees for Director. The second agenda item
is the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of KPMG as the company's independent
registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2022, which I now place before the meeting.
Brian Hegarty and Ian Bildaberg [ph] are also present today, representing KPMG and
will be available to answer any questions during the question-and-answer session of
the meeting. Our board recommends a vote for the reiﬁcation of the appointment of
KPMG as PepsiCo's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2022.
The third agenda item is the advisory vote to approve the compensation of the
named executive oﬃcers identiﬁed in our Proxy Statement, which I now place before
the meeting. Our Board recommends a vote for the advisory resolution to approveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04

order that they appear in the agenda. Each of the shareholders or their
representatives will have three minutes to present their respective proposals. So,
we'll now turn to the ﬁrst shareholder proposal requesting that the company adopt a
policy and amended governing documents as necessary to require the Chairman to
be an independent member of the Board, which was submitted by Mr. Kenneth
Steiner. Ms. Kam Franklin will be presenting the proposal as his representative.
Operator, could you please open the line for Ms. Franklin?
Good morning. Can you hear me okay?
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Yes, we can. Please go ahead. Thank you.
Proposal for Independent Board Chairman sponsored by Kenneth Steiner. The
shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopted an enduring policy and
amend the governing documents as necessary in order that two separate people
hold the oﬃce of the Chairman and the oﬃce of the CEO. Whenever possible, the
Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent Director. The Board has the
discretion to select a temporary Chairman of the Board who is not an Independent
Director to serve while the board is seeking an Independent Chairman of the Board.
The Chairman shall not be a former CEO of the company.
This policy could be phased in when there is a contract renewal for our current CEO
or for the next CEO transition. The proposal topic won 52% supported Boeing and
54% supported Baxter International in 2020. Boeing then adopted this proposal
topic in June 2020. The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally diﬀerent and
should be held by two Directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely
independent of the CEO and our company. The proposal topic won 44% support at
our 2012 Annual Meeting. This 44% support likely represented 51% support from the
shares that have access to independent proxy voting advice.
A CEO serving a as Chair can result in excessive management inﬂuence on the
Board and weaker oversight management. The CEO gets comfortable with being his
own boss with the current CEO serving as Chair, this means giving up a substantial
check in balance, safeguard that can only occur with an Independent Board
Chairman. Management says it wants ﬂexibility, which is another way of saying the
management wants what makes it feel comfortable, which may not be in the best
interest of shareholders. A Lead Director is no substitute for an independent Board
Chairman. The value to shareholders of having a Lead Director is perhaps 10% of the
value of having an Independent Board Chairman. A Lead Director cannot call a
special shareholder meeting and cannot even call a special meeting of the Board.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 18Ramon Laguarta
David FlavellA Lead Director can delegate most of the Lead Director duties to the CEO oﬃce and
then simply rubber stamp it. There is no way shareholders can be sure of what goes
on. The lack of an Independent Board Chairman is an unfortunate way to discourage
new outside ideas and an unfortunate way to encourage the CEO to pursue pet
projects that would not stand up to eﬀective oversight. Plus, PepsiCo shareholders
are restricted in bringing new ideas to management in a manner that has traction
because shareholders have no right to act by written consent. And an example from
a company who share price went from $130 to $200 in 10 months, the 2020 Lowe's
annual proxy -- the 2020 Lowe's Annual Meeting proxy said Lowe's Independent
Directors determined that having a separate Chairman and Chief Executive Oﬃcer
aﬀords the CEO the opportunity to focus his time and energy on managing the
business and allows the Chairman to devote his time and attention to board
oversight and governance.
Please vote yes, Independent Board Chairman, Proposal Four. Thank you.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. Franklin. Our Board has carefully considered this proposal and
believes that it is important to have the ﬂexibility to determine whether roles of the
Chairman and CEO should be separate or should be combined based on the
company's needs. The Board has deep knowledge of the strategic goals of the
company, the unique opportunities and challenges that the company faces, and the
various capabilities of our Directors and the company's senior management.
Therefore, the Board is best positioned to determine the most eﬀective leadership
structure to protect and enhance long-term shareholder value.
Our Board currently believes that PepsiCo and our shareholders are best served by a
combined Chairman and CEO role, together with a strong Independent Presiding
Director. PepsiCo has a track record of strong long-term performance under this
combined leadership structure. The Board also believes that our strong corporate
governance policies and practices provide for an objective and independent board
leadership structure necessary to oversee management and the key issue facing the
company. Among other things, we have a diverse and experienced board comprised
entirely of Independent Directors, except for the Chairman and CEO, all Board
Committees comprised solely of and chaired by Independent Directors, and regular
executive sessions of Boards and its committees without the presence of the CEO
and other members of management.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee revisits the leadership
structure regularly as part of its ongoing board assessment process to determine
whether it remains in the best interest of our shareholders. For these reasons, the
Board believes that the action requested by the proposal is neither necessary nor in
the best interest of PepsiCo or our shareholders, and recommends that shareholders
do not support this proposal.

{BIO 15136572 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity to introduce item ﬁve on behalf of
Harrington Investments regarding the importance of PepsiCo's global political
transparency. I'm Paula Johns, Co-founder and Director of ACT Health Promotion, a
Brazilian coalition of over 1,000 members focused on reducing the deadly toll of
non-communicable diseases. I speak to you today from my home country Brazil.
Here, 50,000 people die due to the consumption of ultra-processed foods every
year. And PepsiCo recognizes that the food and beverage niche is a major inﬂuencer
of the health of people around the globe. This can't be emphasized enough.
The dire human toll in Brazil and globally is both avoidable and exacerbated by
PepsiCo's political interference. Operating through trade groups like ABIA and ABIR,
PepsiCo has eﬀectively blocked or watered down a range of life-saving nutrition and
public health policies. Both groups lobby aggressively against policies to protect
children from consuming products harmful to their health, such as the prohibition of
soda sales in elementary schools. As the leader of an organization that monitors
health promotion deals in the last 15 years, I can say with conﬁdence that the
concern for children's health PepsiCo claims in its well-written reports does not
mirror the practice of their trade associations in the corridors of the Brazilian
Congress.
Although it claims to be committed to transparency, a new report ﬁnds PepsiCo
sources from a production chain involving deforestation and human rights violations.
In Brazil, PepsiCo snacks are produced of corn planted illegally on indigenous land.
The corporation suppliers subject indigenous people to toxic pesticide exposures
and the lack of oﬃcial action to stop these abuses may well stem from political
pressures by the corporation and its suppliers that we wouldn't know given the
corporation's lack of disclosure. I oﬀer this example as just one illustration and onlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04

Page 11 of 18Ramon Laguartaone important country of some of the 200 countries and territories PepsiCo does
business in.
You as investors, as well as directly aﬀected by PepsiCo's political activities globally
deserve and indeed need total transparency. Why should we in Brazil, for instance,
have any less visibility than those in the US? Why would investors not have a view of
political spending on activities in the global ﬁle [ph] as they do in the US, after all
nearly half of PepsiCo's business is international.
PepsiCo's position on the grounds that they disclose some, but not all, of its political
spending globally is the perfect argument for a yes vote on Item Five. Let us ﬁll in the
signiﬁcant gaps in disclosure that remains and leads up to our ﬁrst stated [ph] value
of advancing overall welfare of the societies across the globe. Thank you very much.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. Johns. And I would like to explain now the Board's position on your
proposal. We recognize the need for corporations to ensure strong governance over
their corporate political activities, as well as to provide transparency with respect to
their advocacy and related actions. And we have worked to ensure active oversight
and abundant corporate transparency around this topic. We have not, and we do not
plan to make political contributions to candidates outside of the US. Although no
international political contributions are currently planned, we have publicly stated on
our website that we would disclose any international contributions on our website,
along with all our US contributions.
We also follow our national transparency rules regarding the disclosure of our
contributions to trade associations. As a general rule, the trade associations with
which we engage internationally do not provide contributions to political candidates
and we expect our associations to inform the company if they were to begin
engaging in this way. With respect to scientiﬁc research, we believe that adherence
to ethical principles is essential and we have adopted the PepsiCo position on
conduct of scientiﬁc research. The position outlines our guiding principles on
transparency, conﬂicts of interest, and minimizing bias and best practices with
respect to PepsiCo-sponsored research and research conducted by PepsiCo
associates with external research partners.
Among other things, we require sponsored researchers to follow accepted
principles of scientiﬁc rigor in order to adequately test the stated hypothesis and
assure accuracy of data produced. In addition, the position states that we will make
available on our website links to PepsiCo-funded research at the time of publication

Frederick Alexanderdisclosed in its US tax re returns. Given our robust public reporting and our current
policies and practices, which both meet high standards and are reviewed on a
regular basis, the Board believes the reporting called for in this proposal is neither
necessary nor a good use of company resources, and recommends that
shareholders do not support this proposal.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The third shareholder proposal on the ballot is requesting
a report on public health costs, submitted by The John Bishop Montgomery Trust.
Mr. Rick Alexander will be presenting the proposal as its representative. Operator,
please open the line for Mr. Alexander.
{BIO 3629949 <GO>}
Thank you. Thanks to the Chairman and all the members of the Board for allowing
me to speak today. My name is Rick Alexander. I'm the CEO of The Shareholder
Commons, which is a not-for-proﬁt organization that advocates for the interest of
diversiﬁed shareholders. In particular, we focus on the fact that it is often the case,
although it's an uncomfortable truth, that the best ﬁnancial outcome for an individual
business is not necessarily the best ﬁnancial outcome for its diversiﬁed shareholders,
especially when the company's proﬁts come from the externalization of certain costs.
Moving to the company in particular, in our proposal, I want to note something that a
recent McKinsey Report said, which was that obesity today has the same impact on
the global economy as armed violence, war and terrorism, and only a shade less
than smoking. These three are far and away the largest global economic impact
areas driven by human behavior. So, our -- this proposal, Proposal Number Six, asked
for a report on the public health costs that the company's food and beverage
business creates and the manner in which such costs may aﬀect its diversiﬁed
shareholders who rely on overall market returns to support the value of their
portfolios.
In brief, we worry that the products that the company markets and sells are
contributing to the 3% hit to GDP as measured by the World Health Organization --
the 3% hit to GDP created by the obesity crisis, and that hits the portfolios of all of
PepsiCo's diversiﬁed shareholders. And I want to -- I appreciate some of what we've
heard today about the eﬀorts the company is making in this area, but I want to
highlight some facts. These facts come from the Global Index 2021 prepared by the
Access to Nutrition Foundation, a very respected non-proﬁt group funded by parties
like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation.
So, here's a couple of salient facts from that report. Only 21% of PepsiCo's global
sales consisted of healthy products. Only 6% of the sales came from products
suitable to market to children. From 2018 to 2021, there was no improvement in the
nutritional proﬁle of the products that were assessed by the Foundation. Of the 25
companies assessed, PepsiCo ranked 18th for the healthfulness of its products
proﬁle. Overall, the company scored 4.5 out of a possible 10. Clearly, there's roomFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04

Ramon Laguartafor the company to sell more healthier products. And clearly, from what we've heard
about the company's ﬁnancial health, it is trading oﬀ its contribution to the obesity
crisis in exchange for improving its proﬁtability and we would say that's a bad trade
for shareholders and that it would be in the interest of shareholders for the company
to repair -- prepare a report on how it considers those tradeoﬀs.
So in closing…
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Mr. Alexander, can we ask you to wrap up your remarks, please? Thank you.
{BIO 3629949 <GO>}
Yes. The loss in economic growth created by obesity crisis threatens the diversiﬁed
portfolios of company's shareholders and we would ask that the shareholders vote in
favor of Proposal Number Six. Thank you.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you very much, Mr. Alexander. I'd like to now provide an overview of what is
the Board's position on this proposal.
We truly embrace the role that we can play in promoting a balanced diet that
supports health and wellness. And we've long been committed to being a part of
that solution, the solution to the complex issue of the role of diet in obesity and in
under nutrition. There are a number -- numerous factors that contribute to obesity
and we believe it is not feasible to accurately quantify external public health costs for
speciﬁc food and beverage products or categories in its isolation. The World Health
Organization assessment referenced in this proposal is based on a 2014 McKinsey
Global Institute Report that states obesity is impacted by numerous health,
socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, of which diet is just one of them.
It is our belief that existing research and analysis has eﬀectively identiﬁed the
multitude of factors that contribute to obesity under collective public health cost,
and the resources that will be required to attempt to produce the proposed report
will be better spent on our signiﬁcant existing eﬀorts in this area. While PepsiCo
closely monitors and actively manages sustainability risks as part of our Enterprise
Risk Management Program, our sustainability agenda reﬂects a much, much broad
ambition to drive positive action for the planet and for our people. September 2021,
we introduce pep+ and reinforced our commitment to evolve our portfolio and to
improve its nutritional proﬁle and help improve nutrition access.
The pep+ framework includes incorporating more diverse ingredients in food
products, expanding our position in the nut and seeds category. We already have
the global branded leader position. Accelerating our reduction of added sugars and
sodium by 2025 and cooking our food oﬀerings with healthy oils, and partnering
with communities to advance food security and make nutritious food accessible toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 14 of 18David Flavell
Ramon Laguarta50 million people by 2030. We also continue to take aggressive steps to implement
many of the actions recommended by the WHO. Our multifaceted approach
includes developing and publishing the PepsiCo nutrition criteria, providing clear
labeling information about product ingredients, adherence to responsible marketing
policies, admitting the highest standards for food quality and food safety.
In addition, we're increasing more nutritious options in our portfolio through
innovation and through acquisition to oﬀer more choices and meet consumer needs
as part of a balanced diet. Recent acquisitions and strategic investments include
expanding the presence and availability of SodaStream, a joint venture partnership
with Beyond Meat to produce and market plant-based oﬀerings -- plant-based
protein oﬀerings. Be & Cheery, which is one of the largest convenient food
companies in China with product oﬀerings that include nuts, dried foods and meat
snacks; and Pioneer Food Group, one of south Africa's largest food and beverage
companies with a strong position in cereals, juice and other nutritional food staples.
We also engage with many third-party organizations to inform our sustainability
strategy. That's what organizations that work with young people and communities to
promote the development of lifelong healthy habits, including the Partnership for a
Healthier America and Alliance for a Healthier Generation in the United States; the
Food Standards and Safety Authority of India's Safe and Nutritious Food @School
campaign; EIT Food a pan-European partnership aimed at empowering innovators,
entrepreneurs and students to accelerate innovation in food; and in Canada, the
Canadian Foundation for Dietetic Research.
Given our belief that it is not feasible to accurately provide the requested report due
to a number -- numerous factors that contribute to obesity and PepsiCo's ongoing
commitment beyond enterprise risk management to follow the recommendation of
the United Nations and the WHO, in order to be part of the solution, the Board
recommends that shareholders do not support this proposal.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We will now address questions submitted about the
proposals that we just reviewed. I remind you that there will be an opportunity for
general questions not related to the proposals after the formal portion of the
meeting is concluded. And also, we are limiting each shareholder to one question to
give everyone a chance to ask a question. Firstly, we received a question relating to
the advisory vote on executive compensation regarding the quantum of executive
compensation. Mr. Chairman, can you please tell us about PepsiCo's compensation
philosophy?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, David. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
regularly reviews PepsiCo's executive compensation programs with a set of
independent advisors to ensure that we have alignment with our business strategy,
market trends and long-term operating goals. Our pay philosophy is underpinnedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 15 of 18David Flavell

David Flavellby strong pay for performance principles, which signify that executives only receive
incentive payouts when PepsiCo achieves its performance targets.
Since variable compensation is the largest component of an executive's pay, on
average around between 85% and 90%, the majority of compensations for our
executives is at risk. This strengthens alignment with shareholders' best interests as
executives are incentivized to deliver on our ﬁnancial and operating goals
communicated to investors. All compensation programs also incorporates some
governance features such as payout maximums and stringent claw-back provisions
triggered in the event of gross misconduct.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We've also received a few questions related to the
shareholder proposal on the public health cost report, including whether the sugar
content in our regular beverages can be reduced and the total share of our food and
drink sales made up of healthier products.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yes, thank you, David. As I said in my earlier remarks, PepsiCo embraces the role we
can play in promoting both a balanced diet and healthy portfolio that supports
health and wellness. We've long been committed to being part of the solution to
what is a very complex issue, the role of diet in obesity and under nutrition. And over
the last few years, our innovation has been focused on new product platforms and
new brands that oﬀer consumers reduced or non- sugar, lower-sodium and lower-
saturated fat options and positive nutritional ingredients.
And we've been quite successful, I might say, in scaling many of these eﬀorts,
including Pepsi Zero Sugar or Pepsi Black in other parts of the world, Mtn Dew Zero
Sugar, Gatorade Zero, Baked Lay's, SunChips and Oﬀ The Eaten Path. We've
established science-based targets to get [ph] our portfolio expansion and
reformulations eﬀorts. And we report every year our progress on all these targets.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't see any further questions pertaining to the
proposals. That concludes the presentation of the items of business that you've been
asked to vote on in today's meeting. For those shareholders who have not yet voted,
we're preparing to close the poll and we'll give you only a few more moments to
cast your vote using the Vote Here button on the Virtual Meeting Website, as I noted
earlier. If you have previously voted, you do not need to take any further action.
Now that everyone has had the opportunity to vote, I declare the polls closed. I've

Thank you, David. There would be no further business to come before the meeting.
The formal business portion of this meeting is now adjourned. We'll now address
general questions. For the general question, also joining me on the line, together
with David, is our Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Oﬃcer; and
Ronald Schellekens, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resource Oﬃcer.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
We'll begin with questions that we received in advance of the meeting or during the
course of meeting. And please note, we will attempt to answer as many questions as
we can. Noting that time is short and we'll start oﬀ with ﬁrst question which we
received. Super Bowl is one of the most expensive advertising buys of the year.
PepsiCo is active with several snacks and beverage brands. How does PepsiCo justify
this expense?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yeah, thank you for the question. Good question. As you know, PepsiCo has a
longstanding with the National Football League, which forwards us [ph] many
opportunities to drive consumer engagement throughout the year and during the
Super Bowl speciﬁcally, which is consistently the most watched and the most highly
engaging cultural events of the year in the United States.
Super Bowl is also one of the biggest at-home entertainment events of the year,
which is a huge opportunity for our brands. Our relationship with the NFL and
association with the Super Bowl enables us to promote in tens of thousands of retail
displays throughout the NFL system and in the weeks leading up to Super Bowl,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-04

with consumers at the point of purchase.
On top of that, we regularly evaluate all of our advertising and marketing decisions
to determine the return on investment and our research -- latest research shows that
Super Bowl constantly provides tens of millions of dollars of return to our business
every year, including media value and retail sales as consumers stock up on our
products to watch the game.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The next question we received is, what is PepsiCo doing in
regard to Ukraine?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you, David. I stated earlier in my prepared remarks that PepsiCo's ﬁrst
priority continues to be the safety and the security of our Ukrainian associates. We
remain fully committed to supporting our Ukrainian employees and have already
provided approximately $14 million in aid to assist our Ukrainian associates and
Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries. This includes direct ﬁnancial assistance,
services, chargeable donations and in-kind product support such as dairy, water and
fridges to help the humanitarian relief eﬀorts.
In particular locations -- in the Ukraine, we're providing accommodations and
ﬁnancial support for more than 300 displaced employees and their families. In
Poland, we've transformed our headquarters in Warsaw into the PepsiCo Hotel, as
we call it. 450 people have passed through that hotel. In Romania, we've taken over
ﬁve hotels to house 600 people, including 200 families with more than 250 children.
And we began to redeploy people temporarily in their new countries and created
jobs for PepsiCo family members. So, a very comprehensive eﬀort to support our
associates. We believe that the war is never an answer and we stand with all those
calling for peace.
{BIO 22140116 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The next question we received is, did PepsiCo consider
purchasing Planters Peanuts when it was for sale recently, or it was acquired by a
competitor? It seems like it would've been a good ﬁt for the Frito-Lay business, salty
snacks and the good-for-you side of the business. If PepsiCo did not consider
purchasing Planters, why not?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Thank you for your question. As a matter of practice and we've done this historically,
PepsiCo does not comment on mergers and acquisition speculation.

believe that the administrative cost of executing one outweighs the beneﬁts that we

questions. Given the time, that concludes the question-and-answer session. Any
