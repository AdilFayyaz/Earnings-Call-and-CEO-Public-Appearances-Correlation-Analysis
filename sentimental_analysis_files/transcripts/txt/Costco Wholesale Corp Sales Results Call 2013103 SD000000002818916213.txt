Good morning. And thank you for calling Costco Wholesale Corporation. I am David
Sherwood, Director of Finance and Investor Relations and this morning, I will review
with you our sales results for the ﬁve-week retail month of December, which started
on Monday, November 26 and ended on Sunday, December 30.
For comparable sales results, this ﬁve-week period is compared to the same ﬁve-
week period last year, speciﬁcally Monday, November 28, 2011 through Sunday,
January 1, 2012. December included 34 selling days this year, closed for Christmas,
versus 33 days last year where we were closed for both Christmas and New Year's.
The New Year's holiday falls in the January reporting period this year.
Before I begin, let me start by stating that the following discussion will include

domestic and international economic conditions, including exchange rates; the
eﬀects of competition and regulation; uncertainties in the ﬁnancial markets;
consumer and small-business spending patterns and debt levels; conditions
aﬀecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate; actions of
vendors; rising costs associated with employees, including healthcare costs; energy
and certain commodities; geopolitical conditions and other risks identiﬁed from time
to time in the Company's public statements and reports ﬁled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update
these discussions due to subsequent events or circumstances.
Now with regards to sales, as reported in today's press release, net sales for the
month of December came in at $11.21 billion for the ﬁve weeks ended December 30,
up 12% compared to the $10.05 billion reported for the similar period last year. NetFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-03

Page 2 of 3sales for the 17 weeks ending December 30 came in at $34.42 billion this year, up 9%
compared to the $31.68 billion for the similar period last year.
Comparable sales results for the ﬁve-week December retail month and the 17-week
ﬁscal year-to-date reporting periods were as follows. For the ﬁve weeks, the US was a
plus 8% and for the 17 weeks plus 6%. International for the ﬁve weeks was a plus 10%,
17 weeks plus 8%; total Company ﬁve weeks plus 9%, 17 weeks plus 6%.
Inﬂation and gasoline prices, as well as stronger foreign currencies compared to last
year, had a positive impact on comparable sales for both periods. Excluding these
eﬀects, comparable sales for the period were as follows. In the US, the ﬁve weeks
was a plus 8%, 17 weeks plus 5%, international ﬁve weeks plus 6%, 17 weeks plus 5%;
total Company for the ﬁve weeks plus 8% and 17 weeks plus 5%.
In addition to these items, this year's December retail month had one additional
sales day as compared to last year due to the calendar shift of New Year's Day. As a
result, December's total and comp sales results beneﬁted by approximately 2%.
In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights for the
month of December were as follows. On a regional and country basis, the US
regions with the strongest results were Texas, Southeast and Midwest. On an
international basis in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Mexico, Canada
and Australia.
Moving to our merchandise highlights, the following comparable sales results by
category excluded the positive eﬀect of foreign exchange. Food and sundries
comparable sales for the month were in the mid to high single digit range. Within
food and sundries, the departments with the strongest results were cooler, candy
and foods. We experienced a slight amount of inﬂation in food and sundries
compared to last year.
Comp sales results for hardlines were positive in the mid to high single digit range.
Better performing departments were hardware, automotive, health and beauty and
consumer electronics. Softlines experienced positive comp sales results for
December in the low to mid teens range. Better performing departments within
softlines included small appliances, housewares and women's apparel. Fresh foods
experienced positive comp sales in the mid to high single digit range for the month.
Produce and service deli experienced the strongest results. Fresh foods was slightly
deﬂationary in December due to slightly lower year-over-year meat prices.
Within the ancillary business -- hearing aids, optical and gasoline -- showed the best
sales results. The average selling price per gallon was $3.32 this year compared to
$3.29 last year. Overall, gasoline price inﬂation had a very slightly positive impact,
less than 10 basis points on the December comp. Comp gallons were also up year-
over-year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-01-03

Page 3 of 3Strengthening foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the US dollar resulted in a
lift to our reported total December comp sales of a little less than plus 1%. Total
international comps for the ﬁve-week period came in at plus 7% in local currencies.
But resulted in a reported comp of plus 10% when converted into US dollar.
The average transaction year-over-year in December was higher by approximately
plus 3.5%, which includes the beneﬁt from foreign exchange and gasoline price
inﬂation. Comparable traﬃc frequency was up a little over 5%.
Cannibalization for the month of December had a negative impact due to total
Company comparable sales by a little more than minus 0.5%. Looking ahead,
January sales, another ﬁve-week reporting month due to the 53 week retail reporting
year, will include 34 selling days versus 35 days last year as we were closed for the
New Year's Day this year. We anticipate that the calendar shift of New Year's will
negatively impact our reported January sales, which will end on Sunday, February 3
and will be compared to the ﬁve weeks ended Sunday, February 5 last year.
Costco currently operates 622 warehouses, including 448 in the United States and
Puerto Rico, 85 in Canada, 32 in Mexico, 23 in the UK, 13 in Japan, 9 in Taiwan, 9 in
