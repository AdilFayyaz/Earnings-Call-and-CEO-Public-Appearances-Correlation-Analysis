questions addressed. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin.
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
Thank you, Howard and thank you all for joining us on short notice. I hope, you had a
chance to read the press release and download the slide deck from our Investor site
and I appreciate the opportunity to provide some additional details about
Lululemon's acquisition of MIRROR. I'll walk you through the slides. Now, let's start
on Slide 3. Let me begin by sharing these thoughts about the announcement today
and what it signals for the future and why it has been so compelling to all of us.
There is something special about Lululemon, a well-informed intuition. We listen
deeply to our guests, ambassadors and our collective. We've developed our ﬁve-
year vision and strategy, understanding the future and the opportunity to integrate
both digital and physical experiences, recognize the power of versatile sweat
activities and bring together physical, social and emotional health. Our ﬁve-year
strategic road map was built around these premises. We invested in this future
through omni experiences, our partnership with MIRROR in 2019, digital sweat
oﬀerings and our dynamic channel infrastructure. We are seeing these trends
accelerate to create a structure change and we're ready. MIRROR is an important
step in our strategy in creating the future of the sweat life. With this grounding, I'd
like to introduce you to MIRROR. On Slide 4, you'll see the details around MIRROR. I
know, we've spoken about MIRROR during some of our earnings call since our initial
investment in 2019.
Founded in 2016 and launched in 2018 by our former Lululemon ambassador, Brynn
Putnam, they remain in the early stages of their life cycle. They have grown incredibly
fast in just two years with so much runway ahead giving the expanding home ﬁtness
market and our acquisition enables us to signiﬁcantly raise the awareness of MIRROR
as they become part of the Lululemon's family. MIRROR has an appealing business
model, which includes revenue streams from both the sale of its proprietary device
and also a content oﬀering via an ongoing subscription model. And they compete in
the $500 billion market for global physical activity, a large and rapidly growing
subset of the 3 trillion market for global wellness.
They're known for innovative at home interactive ﬁtness studio experiences that
combine both the screen and a mirror to deliver live and on-demand sweat content
while at the same time allowing the user to see their physical form. Versatile ﬁtness
and activity oﬀerings with weekly live classes and thousands of on-demand workouts
as well as immersive one on one personal training. Workouts range from boxing to
boot camp to yoga and meditation. Energized community and inﬂuencer buzz, very
strong guest loyalty, which is very similar to what we have at Lululemon and powerful
and scalable content platform. It's US-based today with opportunity to expand inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-29
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 3 of 11North America and around the world. And what are they doing well? MIRROR
operates a lean and eﬃcient model and generates the vast majority of their sales
through its website mirror.co. They also oﬀer compelling value proposition
compared to other ﬁtness hardware that is limited to a single discipline and very
strong online channel sales and marketing. The Lululemon and MIRROR partnership,
as I mentioned, MIRROR CEO, Brynn was a Lululemon ambassador in New York,
which created a foundation for our partnership from the beginning. We made an
initial investment in MIRROR in mid-2019, which has allowed us to see the synergies
between our brands. Earlier this year, MIRROR launched a new meditation content
vertical with Lululemon global ambassador, Gabby Bernstein. Other ambassadors
have also launched content on MIRROR recently including our long time
ambassador, Baron Baptiste. These are just some of the reasons that this is an ideal
ﬁrst acquisition for Lululemon with an incredible growth opportunity going forward.
On Slide 5, we share some of the key stats with you and some of the successes by
the numbers. As you can see, since launching in 2018, very impressive growth. These
numbers start to show the opportunity for scale as part of Lululemon. $100 million
plus in revenues expected for 2020, a 50% split between female and male
demographics, 70-plus new classes per week, 40 plus types of diﬀerent classes and
only 10% today are actually familiar with the products, so the potential around
driving awareness and consideration is signiﬁcant. In the bottom of this page, you
can see the trend line for their search growth, which has accelerated at the
beginning of the year and continued as COVID-19 increase the importance of in-
home ﬁtness. Beyond these impressive details, let me also provide insights into why
this is the right acquisition at the right time.
On Slide 6, I'll share with you the same vision that we shared last year during
Analysts Day. The MIRROR brand naturally folds into our vision, which I shared at that
point. Our vision is to be the experiential brand that ignites a community of people
living the sweat life through sweat, grow and connect. On Slide 7, at that same time I
shared with you our 2023 ﬁve-year growth plan to achieve our vision, called The
Power of Three, which is comprised of three pillars. Innovative products with growth
in our core product categories and doubling our men's business, omni guest
experiences with expansion through experiential stores in our membership program,
our agile store formats and our digital growth, which would double in ﬁve years and
expanding markets with continued growth in our core market of North America and
meaningfully more growth in international markets led by China, which we expect to
quadruple in ﬁve years. We remain committed to these growth targets and we are
conﬁdent in our ability to navigate the near-term challenges of COVID-19 while we
continue to invest in our future. And that's where today's announcement ﬁts in nicely.
Although, building on our power of three strategy, we do not need the acquisition to
achieve our 23 goals. This initiative would be incremental to the ﬁve-year numbers
we shared with you. The next slide details our strategic roadmap to support this
pillar. We have been identifying and implementing ways to enhance our digital
sweat life oﬀering for at least the past year. We made the initial investment in partner
with MIRROR 12 months ago, studied and learned the business from the inside and
decided to pursue this opportunity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-29
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Even prior to COVID-19, digital has been enabling new experiences and behaviors
within the sweat life ecosystem. COVID-19 accelerated an already emerging trend.
Our strategy is based upon digital content is changing, how and where our guests
sweat, grow and connect. Pre-COVID, 64% of our guests utilized an at home digital
sweat option. COVID phase, 75% of our guests utilized an at home digital sweat
option and post-COVID, 86% of those with at home equipment say they will use at
home digital sweat the same or more as they had been using prior to COVID-19.
Digital content is changing and studio and trainer models for our ambassadors are
changing with that.
With this, we have more opportunities online with experiences that created
community feel through the digital environment. Our omni strategy is rooted in
supporting our community vision to foster connection among people in the practice
of the sweat life inspired by our ambassadors in a seamless physical and digital
journey, scale the sweat life to reach more of our guests and future guests with the
power of community, bolster our competitive advantage to modernize our
grassroots marketing and to accelerate membership growth, integrated digital
solution to enable even faster expansion.
The next slide details the ecosystem that we're creating and supports this
acquisition. The MIRROR platform provides a versatile and immersive in home sweat
solution that will leverage the powerful Lululemon ecosystem, including community,
the MIRROR gains access to our guests in collective, made up of our guests and
members, the physical infrastructure. MIRROR can be used to further connect the
physical through events, experiential stores, local studios, ambassadors. MIRROR
gains access to our ambassadors for content creation and opening curated platform.
MIRROR gains are trusted lens of curation, and we gain the versatile and immersive
hardware in home and that's a compelling combination. A place in the home, daily
mindshare and a platform for ambassadors. And that is where the synergy just
begins. On the next slide, we place the synergies between Lululemon and MIRROR
side by side, this combination between Lululemon and MIRROR will provide
meaningful synergies to both our businesses. What we bring to MIRROR is access to
our large growing and loyal guests, leverage distribution channels to scale growth,
utilize marketing channels to lower guest acquisition costs, expand talent through
our unique ambassador community, reduce consideration barriers with strong brand
credibility and lead generation from our most engaged guests.
What MIRROR can bring to Lululemon, expand and innovate our omni guest
experiences, dynamic platform to enhance and scale the guest oﬀerings, accelerate
monetization of digital sweat, create immediate revenue stream with the path to
proﬁtability, amplify Lululemon ambassadors and creates community and establishes
product integration opportunities. The next page provides the ﬁnancial details.
Meghan Frank is joining me on the call for Q&A along with Alex and can answer any
questions you may have on the ﬁnancials. But let me just highlight the following.
The purchase price is $500 million. We will ﬁnance the transaction from our $1.5
billion of liquidity, which includes over $800 million in cash, our existing $400

A - Meghan Frankclose in the next one to two weeks. On the ﬁnal slide, I'd like to summarize what
makes this acquisition so compelling. And in conclusion, let me summarize what
makes us so excited about moving forward with MIRROR.
First, MIRROR brings a content platform that connects our sweat life ecosystem and
integrates our strong assets. Second, MIRROR allows us to oﬀer new omni
experiences to our guests and support them to live the sweat life in many new ways.
Third, Lululemon can bring signiﬁcant awareness to MIRROR through our marketing
and distribution channels, help them grow and reduce customer acquisition costs.
Fourth, our vision and Power of Three plan has not changed. MIRROR grows growth
adds to the potential. And ﬁnally, with the ﬁnancial strength and liquidity to
complete this transaction and continue to run our business day to day and plan for
contingencies. Thank you for joining us today. As you can see, there are many
considerations that made this acquisition an ideal opportunity for both Lululemon
and MIRROR as well as the guest and members of both brands, and I look forward to
answering your questions.
Questions And Answers
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator
Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from Erinn Murphy from Piper Sandler. Please
go ahead.
{BIO 17718258 <GO>}
Great, thanks, good afternoon. I guess a couple of questions from me. First, just
maybe on the path to proﬁtability of MIRROR. I would love to hear kind of they
integrate with you guys, how that looks and then maybe a couple for Meghan. Sorry
if I missed this. What was the existing -- what is the exiting user base of MIRROR. And
then what was revenue in 2019? I'm assuming 2020 plan to get $200 million plus
was clearly enabled by what we've seen in this digital transformation this year. Thank
you.
{BIO 21694519 <GO>}
Yeah, hi Erinn, it's Meghan. So in terms of the path to proﬁtability, what we are -- what
we disclosed was that they will be modestly dilutive to our EPS for the full year of
2020 and that's excluding deal related costs. And then they will be modestly
accretive in 2021 again excluding deal related costs. When we look beyond that, I
think it's a little bit too early to share our thinking as we move into the integration
phase. So we'll come back on that when we revert back to providing guidance for
2021 and beyond. And then in terms of existing user base, we aren't going to be
sharing any metrics around that. I'd say, outside of program, subscription sales, the
key metrics that we looked at as we looked at the deal were around retention,
member engagement and satisfaction and we were pleased with the strength we
saw in those metrics as we completed our process.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-29

Okay, thank you. Fair enough.
Thank you. The next question comes from Matt McClintock from Raymond James.
Please go ahead.
{BIO 16452505 <GO>}
Hi, yes, everyone. So I guess two questions, the ﬁrst one is, it sounds like the way that
you're approaching this from a ﬁnancial model perspective is MIRROR as a
standalone investment, it can generate revenue, it can generate proﬁt and at the
same time, it helps with acquisition -- customer acquisitions. Can you at least
elaborate a little bit more in terms of the ability to sell product, Lululemon product, is
that in any way in consideration of this acquisition meaning being able to use
MIRROR to sell Lululemon outside of just being able to use MIRROR to drive broader
brand awareness of the Lululemon brand, just can you dig a little bit more just
actually selling products? Thanks.
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely, Matt. It's Calvin, when we look at the opportunities, what I loved
about MIRROR was as you led, it's a standalone business that is going to drive very
good revenue growth. Would be proﬁtable. We'll be able to connect to our
membership plan and program to accelerate both of those and they will over the
coming years be a meaningful driver of our collective growth. In addition to that the
fact that we are going to be building on our community, which we know today drives
loyalty the fact that we will have a place in the home, have daily mindshare, guest
interacting with the brand with a sweat ambassadors and instructors wearing
Lululemon, which is where the brand built a lot of the momentum early on with
grassroot marketing in the communities, having that opportunity as well as
additional initiatives that we've talked about of how we introduce product to the
guests using this platform in the house is incremental and absolutely something, we
considered and we'll look to innovate and pursue. But as just a stand-alone, it's a
meaningful -- will be a meaningful business and our ability to connect the two and
into contributing to driving more apparel sales is absolutely something we've
considered but it wasn't the primary thesis behind the investment which to me is just
another level of incremental growth driving loyalty and daily mind share with the
guest which by the way over the last few months, we've learned since our community
initiatives and sweat is a huge advantage for our brand that guests are interacting
and thinking of Lululemon not just for a transaction in need that they're interactingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-29

Q - Adrienne Yiwith the brand on an ongoing daily basis and this just reinforces and it allows us to
be in that discussion, which will have and we've seen it -- a positive impact on
apparel sales.
{BIO 16452505 <GO>}
Thanks for that Calvin and then just as a follow-up. I hate to ask this but in the fourth
quarter, you made the statement that you were prepared to make investments and
use your strong competitive position to make investments and this is clearly example
of that, but I have to ask just liquidity making such a sizable investment during this
time. How do you think through that? How does that play into your calculus given
that there is constant fears that there might be a second wave of Coronavirus coming
through? Thank you.
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
Yeah. No, absolutely Matt. A couple of things, one as we shared in our quarter one
this year although our operations was impacted, we were able to still generate a
proﬁt. We shared with you the momentum that's happening in the business, both
globally as well as in North America as stores open and we've continued to see
triple-digit growth in our online business. There is strong demand for our product.
We are servicing that demand through our stores that have opened and continue on
online with quite strong growth and we've modeled a variety of scenarios. We're
open everywhere, but New York, we closed Houston. When we close stores now, we
still default to a BBR position as well as curbside pickup or buy online pickup at door
so even a default close position isn't what it was earlier in April.
So we modeled a variety of scenarios, both with the North America, the globe and
feel very, very conﬁdent in the liquidity of the business and we've added $300
million in additional credit facility, which gives us $1.5 billion at our disposal. So we
feel very good and have modeled a variety of scenarios and felt good about the
acquisition at this time.

{BIO 22704408 <GO>}
Yes, good afternoon and congratulations. Calvin, I was wondering if you had talked
about the $500 billion, physical ﬁtness, but I think that you're talking about the more
-- more broadly. I was wondering if you can help us kind of dig into the component
that is digital Connected Fitness and then also the opportunity with the physicalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-29

A - Meghan Frankinfrastructure. If you could help us with that as well. How big is that potentially part of
the business and when would that be more aggressively rolled out? Thank you very
much.
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
No, absolutely. I'll talk and I'll leave -- Meghan, in terms of the size of the market, we
sort of share the $500 billion addressable market opportunity and I think there is a
variety of ways we can deﬁne it within that number. We know that at home is
evolving, at home through these subscription models are evolving and growing
exponentially. So we see the size and potential behind this space is being very
dramatic, what we get excited about when we think of the integration into our
physical space is one, selling obviously MIRROR on lululemon.com, we're going to
be testing in the back half, selling it in a number of doors learning and being able to
roll that out. Once you see MIRROR, once you see the platform, the fact that you only
need one in store to display it, the fact that we already have the logistics and the
technology to do BBR where guests are ordering in store and having it shipped to
their house, we already have that behavior inside the organization.
So from an eﬃciency standpoint, we are very eﬀective to be able to oﬀer that and
then as we've built out and thought about it through our experiential stores through
our events and our ambassador community, how we leverage the platform to
support those, how we think of a network of experiential stores where we can be
ﬁlming live classes to produce content for MIRROR. The synergies again, what we
appreciated about MIRROR and the growth that they've achieved so far, which is
very signiﬁcant considering the opportunity and awareness behind the brand is
predominantly done through online.
They have two physical locations and the rest of their business has been grown
online, which is one of the reasons why their proﬁtability model is going to tip
proﬁtable I think quicker than some other models out there, but our ability to bring
that into the physical drive awareness, tap into our online and leverage our network
is a big part of the vision that we have in building out the ecosystem.

Your next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
{BIO 5302683 <GO>}
Thanks for taking my question. Fascinating acquisition. We've seen kind of a mixed
track record of athletic brands getting into the IT hardware space or buying
platforms, but it seems very opportunistic, Calvin. Isn't the way to think about this is a
small company with a great product and service that's very synergistic with your vast
legions of guests and consumer faithfuls that you can introduce this brand to
potentially million -- this product and service to millions of new customers, is that the
right way to think about it? And in every Lulu store eventually, if everything goes as
according to plan?
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
Hey, Omar. I think that is one of the lead ways to look at the acquisition. What we
liked about it compared to other acquisitions that have been made in this space is it
is a revenue driver. It has the recurring revenue of a subscription model. The guest is
purchasing a product and what immediately Lululemon can bring is awareness,
channel distribution at a very low cost and drive unit sales, which will drive that
reoccurring model of subscription then you layer in the content that we can bring
through our vast ambassador community globally, 2000 plus ambassadors not to
mention our global, our legacy ambassadors then you roll in our store network and
experiential stores to be able to create hubs, where we can continue to enrich that
content or the additional of events. I mean, content, we're going to enrich but
outside of all of that they make money today, guests buy a product and use a
product and we're excited about that.
The point that we can sell and have the potential to sell even more apparel through
the loyalty and building loyalty with our guests and expand that is completely
incremental to the investment thesis and what needs to happen, and I think that's
where some of the other ones are challenged when it's you're acquiring the ability
or the opportunity to then convert to a sale. This is a sale and it's a proven sale and
we're going to bring awareness and consideration that will drive it and as we build
out, integrate that ecosystem and community. I think, it will layer in more opportunity
for us going forward. That's the right way to look at it.

No, it's, I would say what's been one year we've been in relationship. We've been in
relationship with Brynn going back with her being a legacy ambassador. We started
the relationship, a year ago. It's always been a space that I've been very interested in.
It absolutely supports and builds upon our exciting vision and we've test and learned
leading into COVID and I would say the opportunity of COVID is that it's brought the
future closer to the present and we were able to see the power of in-home sweat,
the power of community, the ecosystem, the adoption by guests and really the
potential that we have around driving awareness and consideration and through our
own channels, the way the guest was interacting with our brand, our ambassador
community through a variety of digital sites being able to oﬀer that on an ongoing
basis through that. So it was in the works and it clearly accelerated our learning and
the potential and guest adoption sooner.

{BIO 18088928 <GO>}
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just speak a bit more
about how we should think about the ongoing investment in contents for MIRROR,
especially as you integrate more with the Lululemon ambassadors?

More from a dollar perspective.
{BIO 16657186 <GO>}
Yeah, well, again, I would not model or view any signiﬁcant change in our need to
leverage the ambassador community and create the opportunity for them on the
platform. MIRROR has a very eﬃcient operating model when compared to others.
And we don't see that changing meaningfully and our relationship with our
ambassadors already sort of allows us to utilize them in this particular manner and
leverage on this platform if they're equally excited about it. So we're excited aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-29

meaningful change to the model that MIRROR has already established.
{BIO 18088928 <GO>}
That's helpful. And then one last real quick one. I'm curious if you know what
percentage of MIRROR's subscribers are active Lululemon customers?
{BIO 21694519 <GO>}
So there is approximately a 50% overlap in the customer base between MIRROR and
Lululemon, which we view as an opportunity on both sides.
