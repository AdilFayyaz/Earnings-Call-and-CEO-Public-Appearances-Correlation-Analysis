With that, let me hand this meeting back over to Jensen for a brief business update,
after which we will answer stockholder questions. Please note that given our time
constraints, we may not be able to address all questions.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thanks, Tim. 25 years ago, we set out to solve the problem of 3D graphics for video
games because we believed it would be one of the great computing challenges and
be a driving force of the computer industry. It was an insight that has propelled us to
become the leader in computing technology today. For 2 decades, we pushed to
make the GPU better and better to satisfy gamers' appetite for realism, compounded
by a market that grew to become the largest entertainment industry in the world.
We made another great decision a decade later. We would make the GPU
programmable so that it would be an inﬁnite palette for video eﬀects and be able to
simulate the dynamic physics in the virtual game worlds.
With CUDA programming model, we invented a new supercharged form of
computing. NVIDIA GPU computing was born. Since then, we continuously widened
the aperture of our vision to bring GPU computing to new ﬁelds, medical imaging,
weather simulation, molecular dynamics, biology. GPU computing now accelerates
practically every ﬁeld of science. Last year, the Nobel Prizes in both chemistry and
physics were made possible by our work.
Then one day, the GPU was applied to an algorithm called deep learning, sparking
the Big Bang of artiﬁcial intelligence, that will allow us to solve the unsolvable.
Computers can now write software that no human could write. We're contributing by
building the most advanced computing platform for AI so that every company in the
world can infuse intelligence into what they do.
With GPU computing, we've accelerated AI by 500x in just ﬁve years. And we're not
slowing down. Our latest-generation Volta has reinvented the GPU. Volta is the ﬁrst
Tensor Core GPU, a new breed of GPUs designed to turbo charge AI. NVIDIA GPU
computing has achieved escape velocity at just the right time. As Moore's Law
comes to an end, at a time when developers need more computing power than ever,
GPU computing gives them the rocket ship they need.
The success of our GPU computing model is clear in the numbers. In ﬁscal 2018,
revenue was up 41% to reach a record $9.71 billion. Gross margins expanded 110
basis points to 59.9%. Earnings per diluted share were $4.82, up 88%. And we
returned $1.25 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
We continued our fast pace of growth in the First Quarter of ﬁscal 2019 with growth
in each of our businesses. Revenue reached a record $3.21 billion, up 66% from a
year ago. Gaming revenue grew $1.72 billion to 1 point -- gaming revenue grew toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

A - Jensen Hsun Huang$1.72 billion, up 68% from a year ago. Design and visualization for enterprises grew
to $251 million, up 22% year-over-year. Our data center business grew to a record
$701 million, up 71% from a year ago. The automotive business grew to $145 million,
up 4% year-over-year. We're doing great with our DRIVE autonomous vehicle
computers. Over 370 companies, ranging from OEMs to car system makers, start-
ups, robot taxi services, are developing autonomous vehicles on our platform. We
expect product ramps to start in late 2019 and beyond.
About 6 weeks ago, we held our 10th Annual GTC Conference, ground 0 for GPU
computing movement. We announced new products for new markets. First, we
reinvented computer graphics yet again. Combining ray tracing and deep learning,
NVIDIA RTX makes possible real-time ﬁlm-quality graphics for the ﬁrst time. What the
ﬁlm studios currently do in large-render forms can ﬁnally be done with NVIDIA RTX
GPUs.
We announced new hardware and software that can save big money for data
centers. Just one of our new DGX-2 systems can replace hundreds of traditional
servers. And with our fourth-generation TensorRT deep learning auto compiler,
Internet companies can oﬄoad the image and speech recognition, language
translation, recommendation workloads to our GPUs and get a big boost in data
center throughput.
In auto, we demonstrated a simulation platform, where autonomous cars can be
tested safely in virtual reality.
And in health care, we announced a medical imaging supercomputer to modernize
the millions of medical imaging devices in use today with AI.
These are really exciting times. The advent of AI allows computers to solve previously
unsolvable problems. It's creating new opportunities like no time before. The
computing model we pioneered nearly 15 years ago has positioned us to make great
contributions in many -- in great many industries and ﬁelds of science. We're thrilled
to be inventing the future. We can't do this without the support of all of our
stakeholders. Thank you.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thanks, Jensen. We'll now move to the Q&A. First, we'll address all questions and
comments that have come through our soft order form. And then we'll answer any
questions that come through the virtual meeting portal. We created the form so that
our stockholders would have the opportunity to ask us questions prior to the
meeting, allowing for more eﬀective communication.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 18I will read out loud each question or comment as submitted, except removing
personal details. In some cases, we have received multiple questions asking about
the same or similar topics. So we can group these questions together to avoid
repetition.
The ﬁrst question, is there diversity within the Board of Directors?
A diverse board is important to us. And we strive to enhance diversity. 2 of the 3
most recent additions to our board are women. We strive to maintain an appropriate
balance of diversity, tenure and skills on the board. We select directors based on
their unique skills, professional experience, perspectives and backgrounds, which
enable them to eﬀectively support and oversee NVIDIA's complex business.
Second question. Why does the company have so many directors? Does the
company get its money's worth? And why does NVIDIA require such a large Board of
Directors?
This isn't larger than most boards. NVIDIA's business is global and complex. We
need to have a lot of skills represented on our board to ensure that the company
receives the appropriate level of oversight and governance as our business
continues to evolve. Each director has been nominated to the board because of their
individual and collective competencies in areas such as management, operations,
industry, ﬁnance, academia, emerging technologies and marketing. And although
we do not have a target board size, the size of our 11-member board is comparable
to other companies in the S&P 500.
Third question. In my view, the board has too many venture capitalists sitting around
the board table. There needs to be an accountant who is currently in practice as well
as some hardware industry executives who are also currently working in the sector. It
might also be a good idea to have an HR professional at the table. Either expand the
board or replace some of the venture capitalists with others who have the expertise
I've identiﬁed that is currently missing from this board.
We believe the D.C. directors focus on R&D -- research and development and have
broad inﬂuence in promoting innovation. They're experienced with trends in the tech
industry and the developments of new models. These skills are important to us and
have played a signiﬁcant role in positioning NVIDIA for the future. Several of our D.C.
directors are former operating executives, ﬁnancial experts and former lawyers and
signiﬁcant shareholders of NVIDIA, which aligns them with our shareholders. With
respect to adding a practicing accountant, current hardware industry executive or HR
professionals to the board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
will discuss your recommendations. We do have a number of directors who are
ﬁnancial experts and former Chief Financial Oﬃcers, current and former hardware
industry executives as well as current and former leaders with experience in HR
matters. So we feel the board has the appropriate level of expertise to address the
company's needs at this time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 18Where do the new directors see the company 10 years from now? And are they
excited as the regular stockholders are about the future?
Our board believes NVIDIA is well positioned for the future with signiﬁcant growth
opportunities in all of our major market platforms. At the heart of our opportunity is
the incredible growth of computing demand for AI, just as traditional computing has
slowed. The GPU computing approach that we have pioneered is ideal for ﬁlling this
vacuum. And our invention of the Tensor Core GPU has further enhanced our strong
position to power the AI era.
The next question. Is there a 5-year or more strategic plan road map available for
review?
Yes. We discussed our long-term strategies and business opportunities in detail at
our Investor Day in late March. You can view the presentation on our Investor
Relations website.
Next question. How long do you expect Bitcoin miners to keep using NVIDIA chips?
And will they keep ﬁnding new ways to use them? You have instructed retailers to
not sell to them. Is the only way to tell someone is using them for Bitcoin is buying
multiple GPUs at once?
Our GPUs are not used to mine Bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies, like ethereum, are
mined using GPUs. We have speciﬁc GPUs for cryptocurrency mining that cannot be
used for gaming.
Can you further explain your relationship with cryptocurrency ethereum in terms of
how, if any, it aﬀects your bottom line and your business?
Ethereum and crypto mining is a recent GPU application. It is a bonus in our
business. But volatile. It's not really a factor in our core business. We have great
growth drivers without crypto. Gaming, data center and AI and self-driving cars are
great businesses.
What is the business vision to move beyond crypto demand and going into edge
computing, AI processing engines and the IoT space?
Cryptocurrency is a small piece of our business today. 3% of our Q2 revenue
guidance. Our strategy for edge computing is Jetson, a tiny computer for
autonomous machines, like manufacturing and inspection robots.
As more start-up companies are -- another question. As more start-up companies are
building chips dedicated to machine learning at the diﬀerent market segments, what
is NVIDIA's strategy in keeping diﬀerentiation -- diﬀerentiating itself against the
competition? What are the risks or the impact from having the big top vendorsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 18acquiring such start-ups and building their own customized hardware for their
clouds?
The world has recognized that CPU scaling has slowed and that deep learning
workload will overwhelm their data centers. There are many types of networks.
Building a programmable and fast accelerator stack, like NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU, is
hard and expensive. And we're moving fast. ASIC's ﬁxed-function accelerator may be
ﬁne for an appliance. But for the high-capital and operating cost of a data center, it
puts a large premium on ﬂexibility and overall throughput. How much of the
workload we accelerate and by how much we accelerate is ampliﬁed by the cost of
the data center.
Next question. How do you anticipate competitors in China?
The answer is we are a global company. And we do business all over the world,
including China. AI is the future of computing and will be a very large market. We
expect competitors from many places. We have to continue to move at the speed of
light to stay ahead.
Do you see any stock splits in the horizon? And will there be stock splits soon?
Although we've had stock splits in the past, we do not have any plans for stock splits
at this time.
Another question. Are the fonts printed in the proxy material intentionally small and
poorly formed to discriminate against certain people? If not, please direct the
appropriate parties to avoid ﬁne print and make possible easily, legible and visible.
Thanks.
The text of our printed proxy statement is in at least 8-point type, as required by the
Securities Exchange Act. Still, we strive to state in plain language and improve the
readability of our proxy materials.
Next question. Why is customer interaction on social media so poor? No response to
questions. No response to the -- on the GeForce Experience either.
We have 150-plus social channels globally to ensure that there are topic-relevant
channels for our more than 22 million followers. While there's a steady ﬂow of new
content, keeping up with conversations across this is a challenge. There's room for us
to improve here. And our teams are in the process of revamping our social
responsive strategies so that we can be more engaged.
Next question. Why not hire a public relations individual, like myself, to constantly
submit positive press about NVIDIA governance, state-of-the-art progress,
competition and immediately counteract negative, misleading press releases
aﬀecting the value of NVIDIA stock and the image -- and image in the tech sector?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 18Thanks for your suggestion. We do have a seasoned team of PR professionals for
each of our businesses in major countries where we operate. These individuals
maintain relationships with media and various other types of external inﬂuencers
with the goal of both furthering and defending our brand, our products and our
objectives in the marketplace.
Next question. Hi, I know this sounds crazy. I love your company and all its
innovations. But I would like to know if you ever intend on expanding your online
clothing with more choices and maybe add a leather jacket, like CEOs, with
company logo on the back. Hi. nothing else to comment on. Keep up the great work.
Thanks -- thank you for your feedback. Our CEO also likes the leather jacket that his
family picked out for him very much.
Onto next question. Uber has recently stated that it will restart its self-driving car
testing in the coming months. When will NVIDIA restart its self-driving car testing?
We have suspended our self-driving car testing so that we could learn as much as we
can from the recent incidents. And we exercise the greatest care and the greatest
possible caution in the testing of our self-driving cars. Since suspending, we've been
doing testing on private roads and in virtual reality simulators. We expect to resume
our public road testing in the near future.
Is NVIDIA currently being bottlenecked in terms of fulﬁlling demand by the
production limits of TSMC? Additionally, is NVIDIA concerned with the slowing pace
of process node shrinking?
TSMC's process technology is unquestionably world-class today. I don't -- we
benchmark process technology constantly and continuously. And I can say with great
certainty that TSMC's process is leading in just about every possible respects. And
they're an excellent supplier for us. They're very responsive to our demand and our -
- the scale of our business, which is growing, as all of you know. And with respect to
process node slowing, it is true that Moore's Law has slowed. And some would argue
that Moore's Law has even stopped. And that's the reason why NVIDIA's GPU
computing approach has found so much adoption in the last several years. Our
method of accelerating computing is radically diﬀerent than the traditional methods
used by CPUs. And as a result, we're able to accelerate specialized applications even
without transistors continuing to become cheaper and faster. Our approach relies on
parallel processing instead of sequential processing. And I think that, in the coming
years, as Moore's Law has slowed, our approach is going to get more and more
traction. It's one of the reasons why we're growing so fast.
When will GeForce Experience exit the beta phase? Also, can you share with us the
expected pricing structure of the product at launch?
I think the question is actually related to GeForce NOW. GeForce NOW -- because
GeForce Experience is -- has been out of beta for many years. Just ﬁrst of all,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 18GeForce Experience, as you know, is a cloud application and service that allows us to
optimize the gaming PCs for each one of the conﬁgurations -- many conﬁgurations
and the applications that the gamer plays. And by automatically tuning and
optimizing the computer for each one of the games, we essentially turn what is
otherwise a very diverse set of conﬁgurations of PCs into a coherent gaming
platform for developers as well as for gamers. And GeForce Experience also has all
kinds of applications that allows you to take photographs of your best moments and
sharing your heroic moments with your friends using -- by capturing the videos. And
so all kinds of great features that go along with GeForce Experience. I think your
question is related to GeForce NOW, which is a cloud streaming, game streaming
platform that we've been working on for quite some time. GeForce NOW is
essentially a game platform in the cloud. It's a super gaming PC that is sitting far
away from you in the cloud but has the ability to process the game and stream the
game to you so quickly that it appears if your -- the device that you have or the
computer that you have isn't -- is a powerful gaming platform. The technology is
really hard to solve. The performance matters. Lots of virtualization technology is
needed in order to share that resource with a whole lot of diﬀerent gamers. And we
have to make sure that the latency is so low that it appears as if your computer is
right next to you. These are really complicated technologies. Quality of service is a
great challenge. And so we're going to continue to keep working on this for some
time yet. And so we have no immediate plans to bring it out of beta. And that's why
it's great. The waiting list is quite long, I understand. And so for people who are on
the waiting list, I appreciate your patience. We're trying to make sure that everybody
who has a chance to enjoy it enjoys it with a great experience.
Is drive.ai's robot taxi powered by NVIDIA?
I'm not sure what they've said publicly recently. But most of the robot taxi platforms
around the world uses NVIDIA's chip technology or chip and computing system at
some level. And so -- and the reason for that is because NVIDIA's processors, as you
know, is incredibly good at parallel computing. And we do so with great
performance, great speed as well as great energy eﬃciency. And when all of these
sensors are collecting information, we're processing tens of algorithms at the same
time. And we're processing the sensory input from all the surrounding cameras and
surrounding LiDARs and radars. We're fusing all these sensors together. We're
applying computer vision algorithms, artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms, driving
planning algorithms to help navigate the car, help drive the car. And so NVIDIA's
technology is really ideal for it. And most of the robot taxi -- in fact, almost virtually all
of it, the ones that I know of anyways, use NVIDIA's technology at some level.
The next question. Can you dispel concerns of competition you envision from
BitMate and Google? Can you share speciﬁc progress in your other markets beyond
the 4 corners of gaming, ProVis, data center, autonomous vehicles, for example,
CLARA adoption and Isaac?
So ﬁrst of all, thanks for the question. That's a large question. But let's tear it down.
BitMate designs chips for Bitcoin mining. And we don't do Bitcoin mining. And that's
not our core business. As I mentioned earlier, one of the recent applications of GPUsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 18A - Timothy S. Teter
A - Jensen Hsun Huangis a cryptocurrency called ethereum and other cryptocurrencies like it. They tend to
be very hard to turn into an ASIC because it requires the general purposeness of our
GPUs. As an application, that is small for us in our overall business. It is volatile
because the pricing of cryptocurrency goes up and down. The way to think about
that, it's a bonus in our business. Our core business is growing nicely without it. And
as you already mentioned, our businesses are growing in gaming. And ProVis. And
data center and autonomous vehicles. These are large growth opportunities for us.
And so cryptocurrency is a small part of that. And it's -- the way to think about that is
to think about it as a bonus. With respect to CLARA, CLARA is a really exciting new
platform that we're developing. There are something along the lines of 3-plus million
medical instruments on the road. They tend to -- these medical imaging instruments
don't get upgraded very often. The lifetime of these medical instruments are quite
long. And its development time was even longer than that prior to that. And so the
technology that are inside these instruments, although many of them -- most of the
modern medical instruments use NVIDIA's GPUs for computational imaging, the
installed base consists of a lot of medical instruments that have been around for 10-
plus years. Recent advances with artiﬁcial intelligence gives us an opportunity to
upgrade, if you will, remotely or virtually from a data center these medical
instruments and apply AI technology to them so that we can enhance their ability to
detect or recognize images. Isaac is another platform. Isaac is the world's ﬁrst
platform for autonomous machines. Autonomous machines is a computer, if you will.
It could be software. It could be software and a computer as well as a device. And it's
able to operate and perform its function largely autonomously, which means that it
has to be able to perceive -- sense and perceive its surroundings, reason about what
to do and act accordingly. And so an autonomous machine would be a self-driving
car. And we have a very specialized version of that we call DRIVE. There are some
general applications of it, whether it's a farming equipment that can detect which
one of the crops needs to be fertilized or which one of the fruits could be picked.
These autonomous machines could use a more generic version of our platform we
call Isaac. Other applications of it includes manufactured robots in the future. They
could be visual inspection robots, picking robots. All the things that are mundane to
do but requires human levels of perception, we can now do with Isaac. We already
did that one.
{BIO 3936302 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Any update on the company's plans for autonomous driving cars?
We now have some 370 companies from car companies to what is called in the
industry Tier 1s or car computing system makers to robot taxi services and start-ups
that are now working on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. And the production ramp of
most of these cars will start in the late 2019 and beyond. And so it's relatively soon.
We've got a lot of people working on it. The automotive industry is working really
hard on it. There's a lot of testing yet to do. And I think it's going to be fantastic
because everything that moves someday will be autonomous. Every car, every truck,
every shuttle, every bus will be autonomous. And so this is going to be a very large
market. And we've invested so much in doing so. And we're so good at it. I thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

future.
What is the TAM for health care that NVIDIA is working towards? We work -- our
health care business -- our health care practice has several diﬀerent areas. The ﬁrst
area, an area that we've been working in for a long time -- don't take it oﬀ so I can
see the question -- that we have been working on for a long time is medical imaging.
Just about every CT, MRI and modern ultrasound machine includes NVIDIA's CUDA
GPU inside for computational imaging. And we use it -- it's used for image
processing, image reconstruction, segmentation, which is identifying organs. And
maybe even detection. It's used in -- we have businesses in radiology. Just about
every radiologist's workstation has NVIDIA's GPUs inside. And so medical imaging is
a big part of our business. That's probably something -- has a market opportunity, if
you kind of guessed, the world has 3 million medical image instruments. If 300,000
of them are being updated each year, if each one of those medical image
instruments, depending whether it's a CT or MRI, which could have several thousand
dollars of NVIDIA GPUs inside, to an ultrasound machine which has several hundred
dollars' worth of NVIDIA technology inside, that kind of gives you a sense of the size
of the medical imaging market. We -- as I mentioned earlier, we now have a new
platform we call CLARA, which has the opportunity to remotely from a data center
enhance the capability of the 3 million installed medical imaging systems. And we're
early days in that. It's going to take several years for us to get that platform into
production and -- but the excitement around it is really great. We could basically turn
just about any scanner into an AI supercomputer with Project Clara. There are a
couple of other areas of health care that we're quite successful in. One of them is life
sciences. Whether it's molecular dynamics or quantum chemistry, we do incredibly
well there. Recently, you might know that the Nobel Prize for chemistry was for an
instrument called cryo-EM, cryogenic electron microscopy. And the image
reconstruction process is intensely computationally heavy. And it's an application
called RELION. RELION runs on NVIDIA GPUs. And without NVIDIA GPUs, it wouldn't
have been possible to reconstruct these images in any kind of a reasonable time.
And so life sciences, whether it's computational, molecular dynamics or imaging
instruments like cryo-EM and RELIONs, we're doing really well there. Then lastly,
we're starting to see a lot of interest and a lot of development around genomics
using the latest-generation technologies. It is becoming quite exciting to be able to
do relatively near real-time sequencing of human genomes so that we could have
better early detection of anomalies with your cells.
Cryo -- crypto mining has helped increase the demand for graphics cards and
revenues for Q1 2018 as well as increased graphics card retail prices. My forecast,
crypto mining will decline by this year's end while prices for graphics card return to
their lower prices.
I really hope so. Our prices are set. And when demand is so extraordinary, as a result
of crypto mining, the end market price of our graphics cards causes it to become
unaﬀordable for many gamers. And so it's -- the demand is great for crypto mining
and -- in Q1. And it was hard on the gamers around the world. Ultimately, our gaming
business is growing incredibly well. And so as soon as the prices of the graphics
cards come down, as they have, the demand from gamers will jump. And so what'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

Page 13 of 18A - Unidentiﬁed Speakerinteresting is when crypto demand is strong, miners buy our graphics cards. When
crypto demand is not strong, gamers buy our graphics cards. And so I think the
simple way to think about that is think about crypto as a bonus. Our core gaming
business -- our core businesses in gaming and high-performance computing and
artiﬁcial intelligence and in self-driving cars are doing so well that with or without
crypto mining, we have a growth -- we have a wonderful growth business behind us.
Next question. When can I order a 1080 Ti Founders Edition from NVIDIA's store web
portal without it being sold out in a blink of an eye?
Gosh. Let's see. What's the answer to that? We've just got to build more and get
them back on to the web stores. And so we'll get on top of it. It is the case that -- I'm
sorry that demand has been so great. The 1080 Ti is just one of the best -- it is the
best GPU the world has ever made. And its versatility is fantastic. From gaming on a
4K display -- to be able to enjoy games at 60 frames a second in 4K high dynamic
range to people who are using it for digital content creation, whether it's Photoshop
or Premiere, to people who are using it -- researchers who are using it in universities
to do deep learning and AI advances, to even crypto miners. The 1080 Ti is
unquestionably the best GPU the world's ever made. And so we'll keep working
hard on keeping the demand up.
Does NVIDIA have any plans for stock buyback any time soon?
Yes. We will continue to buy back stock and are associated with our capital return
program.
Are there any plans to provide your new AI technology to control bot players for co-
op and enemy control in order to provide an online experience making obsolete
lobby wait times, cheating and friends that are unavailable?
A smart bot that makes friends -- that makes up for friends that are unavailable
probably works against the other objective of cheating. But nonetheless, the online
game companies are working super hard using AI to detect cheats. And in fact, for
these large ecosystems, where there are hundreds of millions of gamers, the only
way to the detect cheats is using AI machine learning techniques. And so I don't -- I
think that those bots already exist. And they're using -- they're being used
extensively in games today. With respect to friends, the high-level point is that future
characters and their artiﬁcial characters in video games are going to become
increasingly intelligent. They will animate as if people are animating, whether they're
animating through new terrain. They'll talk to you like -- and hold a conversation with
you in a way that is very humanlike. And as a result, these friends -- virtual friends that
you could play with in video games are going to become more and more
sophisticated and more intelligent. I think we've already done that one, yes?
Yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

Our GPUs have been the segment with the highest revenue. What about the Tegra
processor segments? And how are sales in there?
The Tegra processors -- let's see. I see your revenue grew 86% year-over-year. The
Tegra processor is used in several diﬀerent applications. One of the funnest
application is the Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch uses one of the -- one of
NVIDIA's Tegra processors. And as you know, the Nintendo Switch is selling like
crazy. And some of the applications are so clever. And the recent Nintendo Labo is
one of my favorite things in the world. Using cardboard, you could turn these
Nintendo Switches into little tiny robots or pianos and all kinds of interesting
applications. I love this. The second application is our self-driving car. The DRIVE
computing platform is based on a next-generation Tegra processor called the Xavier
processor. Xavier is the world's ﬁrst SOC that's designed for autonomous vehicles. It
has a huge amount of sensor input processing capability, artiﬁcial intelligence,
computing, parallel computing for localization and planning applications. And so it's
also in our DRIVE autonomous vehicle strategy. Then the third part is Jetson. Tegra is
also in our Jetson. It's the chip inside our Jetson platform, which is our robotics
platform and our autonomous machine and edge computing -- Edge AI computing
platform.
The next question. India has, this week, announced they want to be a leader in AI.
How is NVIDIA partnering with companies in this large market? Do you plan to
partner with the Amazon, JPMorgan, Berkshire? Can you sell, Jensen, leather jackets
online today on Amazon? NVIDIA logo mugs? T-shirts, too? Can you tell I love
NVIDIA?
First, I love NVIDIA, too. And so you're in great company. We create -- we -- NVIDIA's
strategy with AI is to create an open AI computing platform. AI is the future of
software. And for the very ﬁrst time, we're able to solve problems that were
previously unsolvable. AI is really quite amazing. You have a machine that's able to
write software that no humans can, a machine that can write software so complex
that no human, no computer programmer can possibly imagine writing something
that incredible. And so the type of problems we're able to solve for the very ﬁrst time
is really growing. And it's stunning for everybody. And it's created enormous
opportunities. AI is so important and so capable that no industry and no nation can
possibly ignore it. It will have an economic impact and a social impact for every
industry and for every country. And so I'm excited to see that India is putting their
resources behind this important technology trend. We're an open computing
platform. We're the leading computing platform -- HPC platform and AI platform in
India. We're the leading platform in just about every single country. And we work
with every single company. Whether it's Amazon or Microsoft or Google or
Facebook, our GPU computing approach is adopted by everybody. And we love
working with everybody involved. JPMorgan Chase is in the ﬁnancial services
industry. And we work with many ﬁrms in the ﬁnancial services industry as they apply
AI to their businesses. And Berkshire, I don't know what we're doing with Berkshire.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

I -- what is top on your wish list for ways the White House can support AI innovation
as a top priority for the country?
First of all, I think that our national laboratories, which creates the open platforms for
researchers, is in desperate need of investment. And we want to make sure that our
national supercomputing initiatives continue to get the investment and the attention
of funding.
Let's see. Let's see. Let me just read the question ﬁrst. NVIDIA's ﬁnances are doing
well. And currently, cash dividends are at $0.15 per share. Can you see an increased
dividend in Q2 of this year?
Our dividend is an important part of our capital return program. Our Board of
Directors and management will continue to review future increases.
Why does NVIDIA hold its Annual Shareholders' Meeting virtually? I'd love to see
Jensen Huang live at NVIDIA's awesome new headquarters in Santa Clara.
I -- well, let's see. This method is supereﬃcient and allows a lot more people to
participate. And that's one of the reasons why we decided to do it this way. And as
you could see, the number of interesting questions that we get by doing it virtually is
quite large. And so I think that this is a fairly good approach. If you would like to
drop by our new headquarters, feel free to. It is quite an interesting design. And
when you're inside it, you could really feel the energy of the building. And so we're
more than happy to host you. Just drop by.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

Page 16 of 18Do you believe DRIVE Constellation certiﬁcation may be required more for
companies to get their AVs on the road?
First of all, DRIVE Constellation is a virtual reality supercomputing platform that we
created to allow cars -- autonomous vehicles to be tested in these virtual worlds. The
basic problem is this: the world drives about 10 trillion miles per year. And if we're
super, super rigorous and we continue to test our cars, in several years, we will
achieve a few million miles. And most of those miles are actually quite peaceful
miles. As you know, most people who drive on the roads every day rarely run into or
bump into any challenging circumstances. And yet, if we wanted to -- if we want to
test our autonomous vehicles, we want to stress test them and put them in diﬃcult
circumstances. And so we created a virtual reality simulator that allows us to drive in
virtual reality billions of miles. And we hope that by doing so, by the time that we
have our products on the road, they'd be much more robust and they've
encountered a lot more stressful circumstances and ultimately create our platforms
to be a lot more safe.
Our condolences go out to the family of late Director William Miller.
I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Bill was a long-term board member. He's
been with us from practically the beginning. And he was an excellent board member.
He was incredibly wise. Helped our company through some very challenging times.
He's was a great mentor to me and the rest of the management team. We'll miss him
greatly.
Are any of NVIDIA's processors a part of the CRISPR revolution supply chain?
The CRISPR workstations do have NVIDIA GPUs in them.
Will your responses to our Qs today be available to the public shortly?
A copy of the webcast will be available on NVIDIA's website until May 30.
Follow-up question. Since there is a demand for both crypto miners and gamers for
GPUs, can't the company increase production? Demand has been skyrocketing on
all segments. Can we ramp up production to meet these demands? This, in turn,
could help reduce the prices for graphics cards on the retail level.
I absolutely agree. And we try to. The diﬃcult thing, of course, is that crypto demand
is volatile. And so we have to be mindful how many we -- how much capacity we put
in place. But nonetheless, the single best thing we could do for crypto -- to address
crypto is to serve the demand and to make possible for the GeForce cards that we
built for gamers to be aﬀordable to gamers. And so your recommendation is exactly
what we try to do. We just try to do it in a mindful way.
Are you concerned about any trade war with China? Or are you optimistic?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 17 of 18Wars are no good for anybody and -- including trade wars. You know that most large
companies operate on a global level these days. And the world is surprisingly small
in many respects. And China is a large market for us. We do business in China. We've
been doing business in China for some 20 years. And so we're hopeful. And we
hope that whatever trade issues will be resolved.
In the past few quarters, the data center business appears to be growing
approximately $100 million quarter-to-quarter. Given that the TAM for this segment is
$50 billion, are you expecting a faster uptake at this business in the near future?
I would say that we're growing really fast. And the rate of growth is related to the
applications that we accelerate in the data center and customers' qualiﬁcations of
our products for large-scale scale-out. And both requires an enormous amount of
work. Recently, at GTC, we announced our fourth-generation TensorRT model
compilers, a deep learning neural network compiler. These deep learning networks
are enormous. They're written by computers. And these models are huge. And
they're just large computational graphs. And TensorRT, the program, the compiler
that we created, allows us to compile this graph, optimize it and make it run
optimally on our processors. The speedup is really quite incredible. It could be
anywhere from a factor of 2 to a factor of 10 faster than the output -- the native
output of these frameworks. The second thing that we have to do is, in addition to
image recognition, support all the various workﬂows -- the many diverse workﬂows
that are showing up in data centers. The number of models and the diﬀerent types of
AI applications that people are creating for their data centers is just exploding. And
so the versatility of our platform makes it incredibly useful. We know that we can
support every neural network model that comes along because it was trained on our
architecture. We know it will run on our architecture. And recently, TensorRT
supported not just images. But also speech recognition, language understanding,
language translation, product recommenders and recommendation systems in
general. And so the amount of workload that we can oﬄoad in a data center has
grown signiﬁcantly. So that's one of the limiters. And we're in trials and early
development with hyperscale data centers all over the world. Then the second is just
getting these systems qualiﬁed into the large-scale infrastructures. The opportunity is
there. And this is going to be a very large market. AI is the future of computing. And
so I look forward to our continued growth in this sector.
We're nearing the end of our allotted time for the meeting. So we will take one more
question.
In a blog post about the NVIDIA DGX SATURNV in (2016), you guys mentioned that
you will use it to improve your -- improve GPU designs. I was wondering if you could
comment on how well this approach is working in terms of the discoveries that you
guys are making and how deep learning is being streamlined into the development
process.
Since about seven years ago -- 6, seven years ago, we realized the importance of
deep learning not just as an algorithm for computer vision. But as a general
methodology for developing software in the future. And so we invested in creating aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-16

Operatorsupercomputer in our company. We have something along the lines of -- let's see.
Something along the lines of 600, 700 petaﬂops of deep learning capability inside
our computer -- inside our company. And it's continuously saturated by researchers
that are doing work. We're using deep learning in just about every aspect of our
company today, from self-driving cars, of course, much of the basic research we're
doing in deep learning. You might have seen the base generation and painting
technology we created. The progressive GAN and the conditional GANs that we
invented that is considered to be really great -- groundbreaking work. We're using it
for computer graphics. We're using it for robotics. We're using it in our health care
endeavors. And so we're doing -- we're using deep learning in just about everything.
The way to think about that is wherever you have large-scale optimization problems,
large-scale optimization problems, deep learning has proven to be an extraordinary
approach. And when you think about the GPUs we built, we're building a GPU that is
-- or the GPUs we build are unambiguously the largest chips the world makes. And in
order to create these GPUs, it's no longer possible to craft them by hand. We have to
use all kinds of algorithms and computer science approaches to optimize these
GPUs -- these very, very large GPUs. And deep learning is -- has been very useful in
that endeavor as well. Okay.
