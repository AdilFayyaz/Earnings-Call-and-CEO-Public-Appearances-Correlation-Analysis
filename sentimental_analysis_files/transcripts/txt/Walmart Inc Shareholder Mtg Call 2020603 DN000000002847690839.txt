Thank you, and good morning, everyone. It's my honor as Chair of the Walmart
Board of Directors to welcome you and formally open our 50th Annual Shareholders
Meeting. Although a virtual meeting isn't how we envisioned holding our 50th
shareholders meeting. I'm proud of who we are and what we've accomplished as a
company over the past 50 years. Obviously we're meeting under extraordinary
circumstances. There is the pandemic which we have been responding and adaptingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

violence of racism which is tearing at our country. We mourn the senseless death of
George Floyd and our hearts are with his family. Unfortunately and tragically his
death is just one of far too many instances of injustice.
We also stand with our associates and communities. We share your deep sense of
frustration and pain. We know we have a role to play in helping create a more just
and fair country, and to ensuring that we uphold and strengthen our commitment to
diversity and inclusion within our company. And I know these sentiments are shared
by all the members of our Board of Directors who have joined our virtual meeting.
Also joining online are representatives from Ernst & Young Walmart's Independent
Accountants. Inspectors of election today are from Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Based on their report, the majority of the shareholders entitled to participate in the
meeting are represented online. We have a quorum and may proceed with the
business portion of the meeting. Therefore, our meeting is oﬃcially called to order. It
is now 10.35 AM, the polls are open and will close after the presentation of the last
shareholder proposal.
Only shareholders who held shares as of the record date for this meeting are
entitled to vote shares. If you have already voted your shares, there is no need to
vote again unless you wish to change your votes. If you would like to vote your
shares or change your vote, you may do so while the polls are open by following the
instructions on your screen.
Now I would like to acknowledge the 11 director nominees, including myself who are
up for re-election this year. They are Cesar Conde, Tim Flynn, Sarah Friar, Carla
Harris, Tom Horton, Marissa Mayer, Doug McMillon, Steve Reinemund, Rob Walton
and Steuart Walton. Thank you all for your willingness to continue to serve our
company.
Next, I've asked Walmart President and CEO, Doug MacMillan to share an update on
the company's priorities during this unusual year. Then, I've asked Rachel Brand, our
Corporate Secretary to take us through the formal business portion of the meeting.
Doug?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for your interest in our
company. As you would know, we've been operating in a diﬃcult and volatile
environment. We're proud of our associates for how they've responded. Most of my
comments will be related to how we've been navigating the global health and
economic crisis, but I want to start by speaking to what we're all currently
experiencing here in the U.S. The killing of George Floyd is tragic, painful and
unacceptable. It's important that we all understand that our problems as a nation run
much deeper than one horrible event. The pain we're feeling reminds us of the need
to support each other and come together. Until we as a nation confront and address
these hard realities, we will never achieve the best of what we can be.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 20Walmart is an inclusive company that is fundamental to our values and culture. We
remain committed to these principles. We're motivated to continue our work related
to diversity and inclusion inside our company and to ﬁnding ways to inﬂuence the
various systems that exist in our country in a more impactful positive and inclusive
way. More than ever, given the disruption and volatility we and the rest of the world
are facing, we've learned that it's critical to keep our purpose and values top of mind
because they service guideposts to help us navigate the health and economic crisis
as successfully as possible. We developed a set of ﬁve priorities to guide our
decision-making since the crisis began and I'll use them to frame the rest of my
comments.
They are: One, support our associates that are serving on the frontlines. Two, serve
our customers that need access to food and critical supplies. Three, help others
including the communities we serve, new associates looking for work, the suppliers
we partner with, those who lease space in our stores plus the work of federal, state
and local governments. Four, manage the short-term well operationally and
ﬁnancially including our cash position and inventory level. And ﬁve, drive our
strategy forward even as we navigate a crisis.
First, our associates, they have been ﬂat out amazing. So our ﬁrst priority has been
supporting them in every country where we operate, their physical safety, ﬁnancial
health and emotional well-being have been at the top of our list. In the U.S., we've
done that by providing extra pay and beneﬁts including two special cash bonuses to
all hourly associates and assistant managers in our stores, Sam's Clubs, distribution
and fulﬁllment centers. We've done similar things in our international markets to
support and reward associates.
From an operational standpoint, we reduced store hours to allow for additional
cleaning and sanitizing, implemented protocols for temperature checks and installed
sneeze guards at pharmacies and checkouts. Also, all associates are required to wear
face coverings which we've provided to them. We've hired more than 300,000
associates in the U.S., the majority on a temporary basis to help relieve some of the
burden faced by our current associates in stores and supply chain facilities as well as
to help provide opportunities for people who've been displaced from their previous
jobs. We've also implemented a number of beneﬁts to support associate health and
well-being and we're pursuing strategies for testing associates for the virus,
including in the longer term antibody testing. Of course COVID 19 has aﬀected many
communities and our people. We felt the impact of this awful virus within our
Walmart family and we mourn the loss of some of our own. Our hearts go out to
their families.
After supporting our associates, our next priority is serving customers. This has
meant adjusting to rapidly changing demands, when the crisis ﬁrst hit, we saw sales
shift heavily towards food and consumables as we had previously experienced in
China. This was followed by a do-it-yourself phase related to home projects,
entertaining and educating. We saw a third phase begin inﬂuenced by stimulus
dollars, call it, relief spending. Here, sales increased in categories such as apparel,
televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys. Our supply chain is among theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 20Rachel Brandmost capable in the world, but in this environment, we've stretched it. We're working
intensely to recover our in-stock position.
The third priority for us has been to help others. This has included taking steps to
support suppliers in some instances with greater ﬂexibility with delivery windows
and ﬁnancing. For our in-store tenants, we waived or discounted rent through April
and May. It's also meant supporting community organizations that serve as a social
safety net. Through the company and foundation, we've given more than $35 million
to COVID-19 relief and response initiatives.
Finally, we're collaborating with federal and state governments. As of today, we've
opened 187 COVID-19 testing sites in 31 states. We've worked with our apparel
suppliers to produce PPE for healthcare workers. This has led to the delivery of 10
million additional medical gowns so far with 81 million scheduled for delivery
through the end of June with the help of McKesson. As we've supported associates
and serve customers and communities, we've also been able to eﬀectively manage
the business and continue to make progress against our long-term strategy.
Before this crisis, we were already seeing robust adoption of online pickup and
delivery as this crisis created the need for social distancing and required people to
stay at home. Customers embraced pickup and delivery even more. In the U.S., we
quickly rolled out ship from store to temporarily meet the surge in orders placed on
Walmart.com. We also launched Express Delivery to provide customers the
convenience of having their orders delivered to their door in under two hours.
Express Delivery is available from nearly 1,000 stores today and our goal is to be in
around 2,000 by the end of June.
At Sam's Club, the value of a membership has never been more evident, and we've
seen strong growth with SamsClub.com as we've seen with walmart.com. Our 26
international countries are experiencing diﬀerent impacts and timing as it relates to
COVID-19. I'm really proud of the work we've done around the world to serve our
customers during this time.
I want to close where I began, by thanking our associates. We're more grateful to
them than I can articulate. The eﬀect this virus is having around the world has made it
clear that we all need to do everything we can to help each other and our
communities get through this. At Walmart, we're blessed to have a unique set of
assets and a strong business that puts us in a good position to support our
associates and serve our customers, communities and shareholders. I wish you and
your families good health and thanks again for your interest in Walmart.
Now please allow me to turn it over to Rachel Brand, our Executive Vice President of
Global governments. She will take us through the presentation of the proposals.

Unidentiﬁed Participantbusiness ﬁrst moving into a Q&A session after the meeting adjourns. The rules of
conduct for the meeting are available on the virtual meeting site. Under those rules,
each person presenting a shareholder proposal will have 3 minutes to present it. A
chime will be played when there are 30 seconds remaining and another chime when
there are 10 seconds remaining. There are 8 matters to be brought before the
meeting today only these eight items if properly presented will be voted on. The ﬁrst
four items are the company proposals, they appear in the proxy statement as
proposals one through four. The ﬁrst is the election of 11 directors. Information about
each Director nominee can be found in the proxy statement. The second proposal is
a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of Walmart's named
executive oﬃcers. The vote on this proposal is advisory, but the Board will consider
the results in evaluating our executive compensation program. The third proposal is
to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young as the company's Independent
Accountants for the ﬁscal year ending January 31, 2021. The fourth proposal is to
amend the ASDA Sharesave Plan 2000 by increasing the number of shares available
for issuance under that plan.
Now we will move on to the shareholder proposals. The company's response to each
one can be found in the proxy statement. I will recognize each presenter when it is
his or her turn to speak for 3 minutes. The ﬁrst shareholder proposal appeared as
number 5 in the proxy statement. It was submitted by PWB investors and other co-
ﬁlers. Conrad McCarren will present it on behalf of the shareholder proponents.
Operator, is Mr. McCarran on the line?
Yes.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
Thank you. Mr. McCarran, you have 3 minutes.
Thank you, and good morning. I'm Conrad McCarran, Senior Vice President of As
You Sow, which ﬁled Proposal number 5 on the proxy statement today, which asks
the company to issue a report assessing the environmental impacts of continuing to
use single-use plastic shopping bags. Walmart distributes an estimated 18 billion to
20 billion single-use plastics carry out shopping bags per year, which contribute to
plastic pollution. About 1 trillion single-use plastic bags are used annually across the
globe or about 2 million distributed every minute.
Plastic bags are a major component of the global plastic pollution crisis. Every year
Americans reportedly throw away 100 billion plastic grocery bags, most used for
only a very short time. Only an estimated 1% to 3% of these plastic bags are recycled,
which means that the rest are either landﬁlls, burned or escaped into the
environment. It is estimated that about 100,000 marine animals are killed by plastic
bags every year that end up in the ocean.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

Rachel BrandFurther plastic bags can take a 1,000 years to break down in a landﬁll and are among
the top 10 most commonly collected plastic materials in the Ocean Conservancy's
Annual International Coastal Cleanup. For many years, our competitors including
Costco, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods have not distributed plastic shopping bags.
Competitor Kroger has agreed to ban plastic shopping bags by 2025. Kroger's CEO,
Rodney McMullen has commented "the plastic shopping bags days are numbered,
our customers have told us, it makes no sense to have so much plastic only to be
used once before being discarded and they are exactly right". We believe that
Walmart failure to match its peers and fully phase out plastic bags poses reputational
and ﬁnancial risks because of the potential to contradict Walmart's public
positioning on sustainability. The company's public communications, statements and
advertising clearly emphasize environmental sustainability and social responsibility,
and acknowledge the need for reduction of plastic bag distribution.
Walmart management has failed to provide evidence to shareholders that it has
adequately studied the ﬁnancial and reputational risks of continuing to use plastic
shopping bags. This proposal merits shareholder support to send a message to
management that a stronger response is warranted. Shareholders would receive
beneﬁt from a more detailed discussion of the company's awareness of and plans to
deal with the environmental.

Rachel BrandThank you. Good morning. My name is Christies Phees, and I would like to thank you
for the opportunity today to move shareholder proposal number 6. I want to, of
course, recognize that our attention today is focused on the pandemic of racism in
our country, and these past months, we've all been focused on the COVID-19
pandemic threatening many lives and livelihoods around the world. We are really
living and a historic moment in American history. Our shareholder proposal requests
Walmart's due diligence in preventing a future global health crisis of our own
making. The growing threat of antibiotic resistance.
The current pandemic illuminates the need to act, to reduce or avoid threats before
they result in signiﬁcant loss of life and economic disruption. Antibiotics are the
foundation of human medicine and they are losing their eﬀectiveness. Scientist
estimate that by 2050 antibiotic resistance could cause 300 million premature
deaths and up to 100 trillion dollars in global economic damage, if no action is taken
to protect these medicines. And one of the biggest causes of antibiotic resistance is
the overuse of antibiotics in food animals. Walmart has an immense impact on the
way food products are grown and raised, just one of the largest purchasers of meat
products in the country. Currently, the company allows its suppliers to administer
antibiotics important to human medicine to farm animals, a practice that fuels spread
of antibiotic resistant superbugs. In fact last fall, consumer advocates reported
binding superbugs in samples of pork purchased at Walmart stores. Reputational
damage and litigation from such reports is a clear threat to our company, but even
more importantly, this is an incredible risk to public health.
Walmart currently asks its meat and poultry suppliers to report on the use of
antibiotics on farms. Our proposal asks the company to then investigate this data
and provide strategies for how the company might act to reduce its risks related to
antibiotic resistance.
The board's opposition statement rightfully points out that antibiotic use in food
animals is a very complex issue. Among those complexities is the current regulations
which allow use of antibiotics in healthy animals that are "at risk". While on the
surface this sounds logical, the term at risk is often interpreted to include animals
that are raised in poor unsanitary condition and in fact instead of cleaning up those
conditions, farms are permitted to use critically important antibiotics to prevent
sickness in animals. If Walmart is truly committed to changing systems for the better
protecting its business and its consumers, it will beneﬁt the company to assess which
suppliers are using such poor practices and shift its purchasing accordingly. This
responsive action would reﬂect and implement the company's real priority to
preserve antibiotic eﬀectiveness and thereby reduce risks for the company
shareholders. Thank you for your time.

Cynthia Murray. Operator, is Ms. Murray on the line?
Yes.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
Thank you. Ms. Murray, you have 3 minutes.
Good morning, and thank you. My name is Cynthia Murray, I'm a Walmart
shareholder and associated for 19 years and a member of United for respect. I'm
proponent of proposal 7, which urges the board to adopt the policy to include hourly
associates on the list of director candidates. The Coronavirus create huge risk at
Walmart. We keep seeing outbreaks connected to Walmart stores in the news, and
thousands of Walmart workers have tested positive for the disease. At least 22
people who work at Walmart have died. Walmart delays, failures and inconsistencies
have exposed a serious disconnect between Board oversight and what's needed in
the stores. Our experience serving our customers, keeping stores open and meeting
safer eﬀorts show how valuable it would be to Walmart to have associates in the
boardroom. With Coronavirus, it's like Black Friday in my store even though there are
policies on customers' limits, there is no enforcement inside the store. I will be 67 this
month and have asthma. My husband and son are both at high risk, I took two leaves
of absence after my daughter reminded me that my job shouldn't put my life at risk. I
came back to work at Walmart to ﬁnd that my store now has its fourth manager in a
year, raising serious concerns about consistency. It's not just my store. We surveyed
over 1,500 associates weeks after Walmart announced they were limiting the number
of people in stores, fewer than 1 in 10 reported they could always maintain
appropriate distancing. Coronavirus is new but the failures of Walmart responses
aren't new to us. Paid sick leave is one of the area where we've told management for
years that the policy incentivize people to come to work sick. Now even with the
pandemic leave policy, 45% of those surveyed were still likely to come to work if they
don't feel well, largely due to fear of discipline or being unable to aﬀord to stay
home. These and other gaps in Walmart responses are life and death for us and for
customers and a huge risk to the company.
Sam Walton said the folks on the frontlines, the ones who actually talk to the
customers are the only ones who really know what's going on out there, but our
inside don't make it up the chain. On the board we could be a balance again short-
term thinking and risky corporate behavior. Every day Walmart hourly associates
show our commitment to long-term success of the company. We need a seat on the
Board for ourselves, our families, our communities and shareholders. I urge
shareholders to vote yes on proposal 7. Thank you.

Page 9 of 20Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThank you, Ms. Murray. We appreciate your views. As Doug mentioned, some of the
many actions to prioritize the safety of associates and customers that the company
has taken and more extensive information about this, including actions taken
regarding safety, pay and beneﬁts can be found on our corporate website. The
Board recommends a vote against the particular proposal you made for the reasons
explained in the proxy statement.
We'll now move on to the ﬁnal proposal, which appeared as number 8 in the proxy
statement. Carolyn Davis will present it on behalf of Organization United for Respect.
Ms. Davis pre-recorded her presentation, which we will now play.
Shareholders of Walmart Inc. Walmart urge the Board of Directors a strengthen
Walmart's prevention of workplace sexual harassment by formalizing the Board's
oversight responsibility, aligning senior executive compensation incentives,
reviewing and necessary overseeing a revision of company policies that are
important to shareholders by December 31, 2020, where actions taken admitting
conﬁdential and priority information. My name is Cat Davis, I worked at Walmart for
12 years. I am a member of United for Respect. I'm also a victim of sexual harassment
at Walmart some years ago. We had an assistant manager who was very ﬂirtatious
often by his sexual advances towards women. My colleagues discussed he was
making sexual advances regularly. One day while I was at work he approached me
with his credit card in his hand. I asked him why are you handing me your credit
card? He said you can take it and buy whatever you want clothes, nails, other things
that he thought women were interested in. I thought it was a joke. He told me to take
the car and go on a spending spree, but in return I have to check into a hotel in my
name, so he can meet me there after he go oﬀ work. I didn't accept this oﬀer, but he
did repeat himself and I said, no. He seems surprised that I had turned down the
oﬀer which made me wonder how many times he had made this oﬀer at Walmart.
And I'm reporting this to you now for the ﬁrst time. I didn't report it before because
no one has stopped him before. I assumed that my voice would not make a
diﬀerence. At some point, another associate there reported him and instead of being
ﬁred, he was transferred to another store about 30 minutes away. He was terminated
initially, but it took too long for Walmart take a compliant seriously. As a member of
United for Respect, I am committed to approach thousands of stores and have heard
stories about managers, vendors and consumers who have sexual harassment
associates without signiﬁcant consequence. Walmart harassment policy must be
improved and must be applied consistently. We need to ensure when a complaint is
ﬁled, Walmart immediately launches an investigation and informs the person who
ﬁled the compliant with their ﬁndings and any action that Walmart has taken.
When the manager or supervisor commits sexual harassment, Walmart should
terminate them. The stories of how I and others were sexually harassed at Walmart
do not need to happen. Walmart policies are not following its policies means that
shareholders face signiﬁcant risk. Workplace sexual harassment have gotten a major
attention from an elected oﬃcial, the media and policymakers and spurred
signiﬁcant public debate. Additionally, a company whose culture tolerates sexual
harassment tends to have higher turnover and less productive employees.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

A - Kary BrunnerMr. McMillon, Chairman Penner, if our associates had a voice in our corporate Board
room, we could work together to ensure that all associates are safe. Robust Board
oversight is especially important at Walmart to address ongoing sexual harassment
issues. I urge shareholder vote yes on this proposal as the largest corporate
employer of women in the U.S. Walmart clearly should be a leader in preventing
sexual harassment and holding wrongdoers accountable. We urge shareholders to
vote for this proposal. Thank you.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
Ms. Davis. Thank you for your views and for telling your story. Although we don't
support your speciﬁc proposal we agree with much of what you said. We do not
tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace. Any reported sexual harassment must
be taken seriously and investigated and they are. We encourage associates report
misconduct. We investigate those reports and we take action when misconduct is
found. Using that process we will investigate the concerns you've raised today. You
can ﬁnd more information about all of this in the proxy statement.
This concludes all of the matters to be presented for shareholder consideration at
the meeting. It is now 10.59 AM and the polls are closed.
Based on the initial report from the inspectors of election, the preliminary voting
results are as follows. Each director nominee has been re-elected by a majority of the
votes cast. Each of the other company proposals has passed and each shareholder
proposal has failed to receive a majority of the votes cast. The preliminary voting
results will be announced in the press release later today and the oﬃcial results will
be disclosed in the ﬁling with the SEC. The 2020 annual shareholders meeting is
now formally adjourned.
We will now pause brieﬂy before moving into a Q&A session moderated by Kary

Questions And Answers
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Good morning. I'm Kary Brunner, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We will now
take the next 30 minutes to respond to questions submitted through the virtual
meeting platform. We will answer as many questions as we can in the remaining
time. Relevant questions that could not be answered due to time constraints, the
company will provide responses on the Investor Relations section of our corporate
website as soon as possible. Substantially similar questions will be grouped together
and responded to collectively.
The ﬁrst question is while we recognize that Walmart has taken many steps to protect
workers, customers and investors from adverse impacts related to COVID-19, given
the reports of ongoing workforce and operational issues at Walmart facilities, is the
Board of Directors tracking and able to disclose the following performance metricsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

due to COVID-related illnesses, workforce turnover rate, changes in workforce
productivity, changes in workforce compensation incentives and employee
engagement and morale? Doug.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Thanks for the question. Happy to respond. The answer is yes, we have been
keeping the Board up to speed routinely through video conferences, written
messages and individual conversations and we've shared metrics, try to describe this
quantitatively as well as qualitatively. As you may know, we've done a number of
diﬀerent things, including trying to create an environment where associates that
shouldn't come to work, don't, whether they feel uncomfortable, might not be
feeling well, have a pre-existing condition. We created a 3 tier leave policy and we're
happy to report that since it's been established more than 270,000 associates have
access that leave policy and taken advantage of it. That gives us some conﬁdence
that it's been eﬀective because it's so important that those that are uncomfortable
don't come to work. As you also know, we've been hiring people to help get the
work done, ﬁll in those gaps and we're pleased to have had the opportunity to hire
more than 300,000 people since the middle of March to work at Walmart U.S., to
help cover for those that have taken leave or have called in, our call-in rates by the
way have been fairly consistent during the crisis and that's one of the metrics that
we've been sharing with the Board.
In addition to the leave policy, I think you're aware of the many operational changes
that we've made -- the usage we're making at PPE, the steps we've taken to increase
social distancing, that includes things like closing earlier so that we can clean, having
associates answer a series of questions, taking their temperature, providing masks.
We've shipped during the crisis to the U.S. alone with an 110 million masks to our
associates in stores, clubs, distribution centers, fulﬁllment centers. You've probably
noticed we're using Flexiglass in diﬀerent parts of the store, making hands sanitizer
available. And as it relates to social distancing limiting the number of customers
coming into the store has been an important step, but we've also done things like
put one way arrows down on the ﬂoor to encourage customers to avoid each other
going down the aisle. In addition we've created some extra pay and beneﬁts to
appreciate those associates and whether they called in or whether they came to
work. We've announced two specialty cash bonuses that totaled approximately $755
million, and in our fulﬁllment centers we increased our temporary pay about $2 an
hour.
We also pulled forward our ﬁrst quarter MyShare bonus, which help get cash in the
hands of our associates early in the crisis and we got a lot of good feedback from
them as it relates to that. They just done an incredible job, and as you heard me say
earlier, we created these ﬁve priorities to remind us all each day what it is we were
trying to do and the ﬁrst priority on our list was to support our associates on the
frontline, nothing happens if they're not supported and they're not pleased with how
the company is taking care of them. A number of us have been going to visit stores,
clubs, distribution centers, e-commerce fulﬁllment centers around the country during
the crisis, I have been to quite a few states myself and have visited with a lot of our
associates and asked repeatedly on those visits what more do -- what more can weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

now, folks have had a hard time coming up with additional things that we can do, but
if we come across any more ideas to help keep them safe, we'll certainly consider

{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Hi, thanks for the question. As probably most of you know we released earnings a
couple of weeks ago and we described the quarter as really several quarters within a
quarter, and as Doug mentioned, the initial stock up and then stimulus dollars came
out in the middle part of April and we had another acceleration of sales. And when
you look at the mix shift that we had between e-commerce and our stores, that is
something that we think will accelerate going into the future, so our e-commerce
business will become even more important than it has in the past. We also had
additional cost, we had about $900 million in additional costs in the quarter, some of
those will be more permanent, like cleaning and sanitation, but about three-fourths
of those cost, or what Doug alluded to a minute ago around associate bonuses and
pulling forward, bonuses and things that we did for our associates, which we're very
happy to be able to do that.
The strategy that we've been implementing around omnichannel is the right
strategy, and I think this period of time has shown that to us even more and I think to
our investors and our customers as well that we're there for them, no matter how
they want to shop whether it's in stores, whether it's pickup or delivery or e-
commerce, we have the ability to do to do that. And when you combine that with the
great assortment and the great prices that we've always been known for, it's a
strategy that we believe is a very, very important and very, very viable for the future.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I just had -- we've had this strategy for a while now and a vision for our future
business model, which results in a ﬂywheel. The experience over the last few months
has really accelerated that and increased our conviction that we've got the right plan
and thankful to have the assets to put together to bring into life, not only in the U.S.
but around the world, and we are seeing customer behavior across countries exhibit
some consistency. People still want to shop in stores and clubs and it's great that
we've got a bunch of them and they also want to shop on their app online and in the
future we want to shop in even more ways and what we'll do is just keep building
new products and making them available to customers in a way that we can be there
in a way they want us to be and then have the supply chain behind it which includesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

A - Doug McMillonthe usage of stores to be able to fulﬁll those orders in the way that they expect
quickly and cost eﬀectively. So I just leave this experience so far saying it feels like
we're on the right track strategically. It will drive change in our business model and
we are well on our way to make that happen and now we've even -- feel even more
strongly about it.
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question -- actually we received several questions on online
competition and if there is a second wave in this pandemic, logistics and delivery to
customers. How will they be improved and how do you appraise competition in that
last mile delivery? And also are you applying robotics to better compete with online
competition?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Sure. That's a lot of questions. I'll try to be concise in my answer, but it'll take me a
little bit of time to get through all that. Again, we think our omnichannel strategy is
the winning strategy and it's great to have the capabilities that we have today. I
appreciate the support to be able to make investments in e-commerce as we have.
I'll focus on the U.S., but a lot of what I'm about to say would apply to international as
well. Let me start with the supply chain because we don't have the product we can
take care of customers, and I'm appreciative of our merchandising team, our
replenishment teams around the world in a way that they've responded to the
changing demand, and Brett just outlined a few minutes ago because the categories
were impacted in diﬀerent ways at diﬀerent times and have been doing this almost
30 years now and I've never seen anything like the pressure that our supply chain
team has been on, but our teams have done a nice job responding being creative
and they just worked really hard, which leads me to the next group to thank, which is
our suppliers.
Our suppliers have been collaborative, transparent with the situations that they've
been dealing with. We sell a lot of diﬀerent categories, so we touch the food
categories. You've seen the pressure that the meat business have been under for
example, but it's more than that, we've had some stress in kind of shelf stable dry
grocery goods as well, but all the way across the store from food into apparel and
general merchandise, there have been pressures there too. I've not been in stores in
a long time and seen the kind of pressure that our craft and fabric department has
been put under from an in-stock point of view. I haven't seen puzzle sell in a long
time like we've sold them recently and so being able to predict those things both us
and the suppliers and respond back quickly has been a challenge, but again the
suppliers have done a great job of helping us recover and make that happen both
for our e-commerce business as well as our stores. So if that step recovers and we
improve our in-stock, then the question becomes, where do we put the inventory
based on how customers want to shop? And of course we want to improve our in-
stocks at store level, that's the number one focus that we have at the moment. But as
those of you that follow the company know we've increasingly been supplementing
our e-commerce fulﬁllment with store fulﬁllment and we've got a great assortment of
around 120,000 items in our super centers and they can be used for pickup
experience for customers as well as delivery.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 14 of 20A - Kary BrunnerAnd over the last few years, we've expanded that pickup business as we shared
before, it's got a very high Net Promoter Score, our customers love it. I've been out
in parking lots, the last few weeks and our associates are especially grateful of the
opportunity given the virus to be able to pull up in the parking lot and get their
orders. That capability being able to pick eﬃciently in store which dates back to our
UK business where we started to begin with and imported it over to the U.S., then
unlocks the ability to deliver and we use a variety of delivery capabilities to service
the customers' needs and we have our own independent contractor platform called
Spark. We also worked with a number of third-party providers to cover oﬀ our last
mile and that variety of capabilities we think gives us not only some resilience, but
also the ability to scale quickly and I've been impressed with the latest innovation
that the team has been able to accomplish and that's this Express Delivery
opportunity for customers to be able to get an order in less than 2 hours. We went
through a period of time during the crisis where we were really suﬀering from an in-
stock point of view and had to reduce the number of pickup and delivery windows
out of the supercenters because our in-stock wasn't reliable, that lasted for a few
weeks, but the team recovered and as in-stock got better we opened up more and
more slots for pickup and delivery and then they layered on top of the Express
capability and scaled it. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, we got 2,000 stores and the
teams working quickly to get to 2,000 stores and more, and I think that's going to be
something our customers are going to love in addition to the services that we oﬀer
already.
So we'll keep innovating as it relates to last mile and be competitive in that space.
And then Kary, I think the last part of the question was related to robotics. And there
are a number of technologies, machine learning, artiﬁcial intelligence which are --
which apply to our demand forecasting ability, but also robotics inside stores and
automation in our distribution centers that we will continue to pursue. We have a
history of doing that, the company's innovated over time with self-distribution and
the things that we do in our supply chain and that will continue. But our business will
always be a people business. We have had real signiﬁcant increase in the number of
associates that we've had the last few months we've gotten now globally north of
2,350,000 associates. We've seen that number tick up as we've hired all these
additional associates, including the temporary help and I think for a generation of
retail to come will still have a lot of people and a lot of jobs. Now those jobs will
change and they need to. We've got to prepare our associates for the future of work.
Our businesses around the world and as countries we need to all continue to drive
productivity. But as we do that we want to bring our people along. We want them to
be trained and equipped, be ready for change and understand the new system that
we're trying to build. So it's exciting to see that our teams have put in place a
number of diﬀerent pieces of automation. I think we're still very much in a test and
learn phase. In some cases, we've scaled things like fast unloaders to help the
associates in the back room, manage freight and we do some shelf scanning these
days with a device that roams up and down the aisles and that's been helpful as it
relates to modular accuracy and those are just two examples of technology that we'll
put together to bring this higher level of productivity through. But as I mentioned,
we'll do that with our people and bring them along in the process.

A - Kary Brunner
A - Donna MorrisThank you, Doug. Brett you can take the next question, how secure is the dividend
and share buybacks?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Sure. So the company is in excellent ﬁnancial position as you would have seen in our
ﬁrst quarter results. We held more cash -- hold more cash currently and it's just a way
for us to have more ﬂexibility as we go forward. We have very strong access to the
capital markets and our cash ﬂow is very strong. It has been strong in the past and it
was strong again in the ﬁrst quarter. As we allocate capital and we make those
decisions, the ﬁrst thing that we always want to do is invest in our business and
you've seen us do that over time through capital expenditures, through investments
in associates, through investors -- through investments in customer experience.
We're very committed to our dividend. We've had 47 years straight of increases in
that dividend. So I think that demonstrates the fact. And then we have a long history
as you know as investors of share buybacks and there's a number of things that we
consider in making that decision over any period of time, but we feel very, very good
about the value of the company.
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Thank you, Brett. The next question will go to Dacona Smith, who is our Executive
Vice President and Chief Operating Oﬃcer at Walmart U.S. I see some empty shelves
at our local Walmarts', are these related to disruptions in logistics for example,
Chinese factories ports being closed. How bad are these disruptions to supply
chains and is this improving? What could be done short and long-term to prevent?
Dacona.
{BIO 20980414 <GO>}
Yeah, Kary. We are seeing some improvements in big parts of our business. Clearly,
there were some disruptions, but we're seeing parts improve and as approved in-
stock inside the stores is clearly improving as well. I would really to relate to Scott to
touch on further on the supply chain disruption, but we can see improvements inside
the stores.
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, Dacona. The next question is, it appears as though Walmart's paid
COVID-19 related leave is only provided if there is a mandate from health authorities
to quarantine or a conﬁrmed diagnosis. Otherwise, it appears that individuals who
believe that they may be exposed must use valuable PTO time to take unpaid leave.
Will this policy not result on false choice for Walmart associates leading them to
choose between coming into work while sick, which potentially could infect others or
going unpaid utilizing valuable PTO largely because mass testing is simply still not
available? Donna Morris, our Chief People Oﬃcer will take that one.
{BIO 16617461 <GO>}
Thank you. Our ﬁrst priority since the outbreak of the pandemic has been the overall
support of our associates. The COVID policy applies to all of our frontline hourly
associates, whether they be regular, part time, full-time or temporary. And it hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

A - Kathleen McLaughlinbeen in place since shortly after the pandemic outbreak here in the U.S. I believe the
exact date was March 13th. So we have in fact been very, very active in encouraging
all of our frontline hourly associates, if they are unwell, feeling unsafe or believe they
should not be in the workplace to leverage the leave policy. And as Doug shared
earlier, we feel somewhat relieved that our overall associate population has accessed
the leave policy to assure that they can be away from work, once again no
implications in terms of their attendance or our time oﬀ policies.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Just to repeat the cash bonuses that we provided so far went to everyone so that
helped and then having the quarterly bonus not be attached to attendance anymore
also ensured that the associates got money through that too as well.
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Okay, thank you. The next question is for you Doug. Is Walmart planning any further
global expansion?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Our focus right now is on our existing markets. We just got such a great opportunity
where we are not only in the U.S., we've got a tremendous business in Mexico and
Central America, Canada, big opportunity in India. If you follow the company closely
that we've made a large investment there and continue to be excited about our
opportunities there. So we're positioned with large populations, with other
characteristics in these markets that cause us to be bullish on the future. So that's our
focus and don't have anything else to that.
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you, Doug. Kathleen McLaughlin will take the next question. She is our
Chief Sustainability Oﬃcer. As a shareholder proposal was denied, what does
Walmart doing internally as a company to address the impact of single-use plastic
bags? Kathleen.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Thank you very much for your question. We agree that plastic waste is a critical
priority to address and we have prioritized that through an initiative to tackle all
forms of single-use plastic across our business that includes packaging, that includes
plastic bags. As it turns out plastic bags make up about 6% of our plastic footprint
considering other forms of packaging across the assortment. So we're absolutely
tackling that as long as -- as well as everything else. We're doing if you things, one
we're really focused on accelerating elimination of plastic -- reduction of plastic and
recyclability across our entire assortment with partnership with suppliers. We're a
core partner of the on MacArthur Foundation and we have a roadmap working with
suppliers across all use cases of plastics including bags, but also clamshells bottles,
ﬁlms et cetera. We've also worked closely with systemic that has created a global
roadmap of diﬀerent kinds of plastic and recommending approaches to eliminate
waste across the diﬀerent use cases working very closely with us, but also fellow
members of the Consumer Goods Forum.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-03

A - Dan BartlettWe held summit last fall and issued a plastic packaging playbook that's now publicly
available for all suppliers. It's about 700 people come to that summit including
suppliers as well as industry experts to accelerate reduction, substitution
enhancements in packaging to make it fully recyclable. We have committed to
recycled content as well as recyclability and that's available -- more information
about that is available online in our ESG report. With respect to bags speciﬁcally,
we've undertaken two major initiatives, one is working to reduce the use of bags in
stores. We've made reusable bags prominently available on carousels. We've done
more aﬀordable promoting their use among our customers and also oﬀering
opportunity to recycle bags in stores and we do take a fair number of bag that way.
We also of course comply with any regulations and legislation about plastic bags
and that actually helps us go faster. It helps to shift consumer behavior.
The second thing we're doing is piloting approaches to eliminate the use of plastic
in our grocery pickup operations. We've seen very positive uptake of that. We're
excited about what we're seeing there and encouraged to roll that out if COVID
complicates this situation as many will know in terms of single-use packaging and
bags and so on, but it's something we remain very committed to and we're excited
to make progress on it. I would say stay tuned, we have additional things we'll be
announcing quite shortly around this that are more collaborative eﬀorts bringing in
some other retailers. We think this really is a whole system challenge where we need
policymakers and retailers to unite and shifting behavior in this system. So stay
tuned.
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Thank you, Kathleen. Our next question is, how have you been aﬀected by recent
unrest in Walmart's main operating cities? Doug, do you want to take that one?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. We have been impacted. It's -- as you would guess in a minority of
locations. We've had some stores where we've had inventory loss and some physical
damage, but it's not where many stores as a percent of total and the team has done
a really good job of keeping our associates and customers safe. We've been pretty
aggressive as it relates to closing stores, closing stores early and that's what we'll
continue to do through the crisis. We'll just focus on associate and customer safety
and then recover as needed beyond that.

approached us with the mentality of having maximum ﬂexibility for on the ﬂoors --
on the ﬂoors in which there will be oﬃce space. And so there are certainly be
learnings that we'll adapt and implement as a part of this in the design structure and
implementation. So the good thing about it is that we're at a period in this process
where we can adopt best practices without disrupting the overall timeframe of the
project.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
As you've heard from other businesses. It's been impressive to see how diﬀerent
parts of the organization can work in diﬀerent ways. Our technology team for
example has continued to have tremendous momentum with many of them working
from home. We've announced some changes related to that part of our team, but
big picture, I think in a post vaccine world, we're going to need oﬃce space and
people are going to collaborate and work together. And so I don't anticipate
signiﬁcant changes, as Dan said, we've got ﬂexibility in time should we learn things
that change our minds, but as this crisis has gone on, we've noticed things that were
missing. Just one example would be, it's hard to on board a new associate in this
environment. How do you get to know people, how do you get a sense for what
culture is like and culture inside a company is such an important aspect that I think
being present with each other is going to matter over time and that will inﬂuence the
way we think about our new home oﬃce campus.
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Thank you, Doug. You might take the next question as well, how is Walmart stepping
up and competing against Dollar stores, that seem to be increasing share?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We think about the customer ﬁrst and competition is in the peripheral vision and our
job is to have a value relative to our competition, price leadership and EDLP are
obviously really important to us. As it relates to dollar stores, hard discounters and
others like that. It's really important that we get our sizing right, our packaging, right,
so that customers can compare price. We're competitive as it relates to pricing and
then we oﬀer more, a supercenter has a broad assortment as opposed to those
types of competitors and lately we've been expanding our other capabilities to
create ease of use, including the delivery capability. So again, we basically build out
an omnichannel business customers can get what they want, including strong
opening price points, private brands and enable us to be competitive with all forms
of competition.
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Thank you, Doug. Dacona Smith will take the next question. With regards to how
stores are reinforcing traﬃc ﬂow during this time among customers, are these
guidelines mandatory or suggested the customers? And is there a reporting

that customers understand the importance of social distancing and then we've also
used directional arrows. In addition to that, there has been communication over our

as that, Kary, there are several steps that stores can take to communicate any
concern, so that we can help reinforce those guidelines. So stores we feel really
good about the processes we have in place and the actions that stores are taking to
ensure that we keep customers and associates safe.

delivery service been? Has the virus had an impact on getting more stores use
delivery or is this still work in progress?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
It's been really successful and we're scaling it further. I think it's here to stay and our
customers are responding really positively. Our NPS score on delivery and pickup
both high and the encouraging thing is we've shared at several of our investor
conferences over the last few years is that when customers use pickup and delivery,
they shop with us more often. Again this omnichannel approach one brand multiple
experiences for customers is a winning strategy and I think delivery will be an
important component of that.
{BIO 20114316 <GO>}
Thanks, Doug. We have time for maybe one or two more questions. What is going
on in India during this time more broadly?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Okay. It's a big question. It's a big country. There's a lot going on in India. As it
relates to our business and we've operated cash and carry stores there for a long
time and are pleased to have been in the market. We source some product out of
India, but most recently, the big news is the investment we made in Flipkart and
PhonePe and that's going really well. We're pleased with the investment, excited
about the team there and the progress that they're making in India and in many
emerging markets, things can be volatile. There are regulation changes and today
we're dealing with COVID-19 in India just as we are in other markets. And so the
team's doing a nice job of being ﬂexible responding to the environment that they're
operating in, in the last few weeks, back up and operating serving customers
eﬀectively and making it happen.
