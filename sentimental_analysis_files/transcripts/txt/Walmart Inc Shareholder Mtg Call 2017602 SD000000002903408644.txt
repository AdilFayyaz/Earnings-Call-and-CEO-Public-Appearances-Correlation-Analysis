Good morning, Walmart. I'm here with 14,000 of my Walmart U.S. associate friends.
How's it going today? Are we going to have a good time? Over to you, Dave.
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
Good morning, Walmart. Now I am absolutely delighted to introduce you to over
2,000 associates from 27 countries around the world, who serve over 110 million
customers a week. So say hello, Walmart International.
Okay. Now it's my great pleasure to introduce the newest member to our team. He's
made a massive diﬀerence to our business already. It's Marc Lore, who leads our e-
commerce business.

already awkward enough. I knew it was going to be like this. I know you're all going
to be doing this. How's everybody doing this morning, by the way? This is incredible,

14,000 people here today from 28 diﬀerent countries. That's incredible. It's
incredible.
I actually -- I grew up just next door in Oklahoma. And I still live there today in a little
town called Tishomingo. So I've been hearing about this -- yes. You've never heard
of Tishomingo. I've been hearing about this famous Walmart Shareholders' Meeting
for years now and it always seemed to me like you guys would do this. You'd get
together as one big, happy Walmart family, have a great time, listen to some good
music. It actually just reminds me of my Shelton family reunions, except they don't
ever start at the crack of dawn. They usually end at the crack of dawn. But anyway, I
can promise you guys that we're going to have a good time this morning, okay? So
what do you say? Are you guys ready to get this thing going? Well so to kick things
oﬀ, I want to bring up a sharp guy with a good sense of humor. He's in charge of
carrying on the Walton family tradition. Good luck with that, right? Please help me
welcome the Chairman of the Board of Walmart, Greg Penner.
{BIO 5585986 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, Walmart. It's my honor as your Chairman to
formally open our 47th Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Thank you, Blake, for that kind
introduction. And I really do mean that. That was much better than that guy last year,
James Corden.
At our Shareholders' Meeting, we conduct our share of business. But most of all, we
like to have fun. That's how Sam Walton wanted it to be. Sam started doing
shareholder meetings like this many years ago to drum up interest in our company.
He wanted to show people why we're diﬀerent and to celebrate with associates from
our stores. This is a picture of Sam and Helen canoeing, not on one of the many
family canoe trips. But as part of the shareholder meeting in 1981.
Sam succeeded beyond imagination with Walmart. And if he were here today, he
would be the ﬁrst to credit our associates with that success. He would simply want to
say thank you. So to all who have been a part of this amazing story, especially our 2.3
million associates in 28 countries around the world, thank you. Thank you for making
a diﬀerence every day.
At Walmart, we have a lot to celebrate right now. There's no question about that. Our
company is moving in the right direction. We've demonstrated this with 11
consecutive quarters of positive comp sales growth in Walmart U.S. And we've also
had strong performance at Sam's, international and, especially, in e-commerce. In
fact, last quarter, we grew our e-commerce business by over 60%.
As encouraging as our results have been, there's nothing we love more than hearing
good things from our customers. Recently, I was copied on a great customer e-mail
about the progress we're making online. And I thought I'd share it with you today.
The subject is now shopping on Walmart.com. "I'm so glad you nudged me to switch
to Walmart.com. In the past, I tried Walmart.com but always went back to that otherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 43website because it just seemed easier. Walmart.com is now so great. It works easily
every time and it has all the items I need. The packages arriving at our door this
week have all been from Walmart.com. It has improved so much."
Feedback like that is so encouraging, especially when it comes from someone who I
know for a fact is a tough customer. You see, that e-mail was sent to my wife, Carrie.
And it was sent by my mom. I'm not sure what to make of my mom shopping on that
other website before. But I do appreciate her honesty and her enthusiasm. If mom
says it's true, you know it is.
At Walmart, we have every reason to be encouraged right now. But that doesn't
mean we can get comfortable, be satisﬁed or slow down. That's not an option for us.
And it's really not an option for any retailer in this environment. Here's a recent
headline that says it all, The Retail Apocalypse. And look at that chart. More than
3,500 store closures just in the early part of 2017.
Walmart is well positioned for the tectonic changes happening in retail. We invested
$2.7 billion to raise wages and improve our training programs. We purchased
Jet.com, which was our largest e-commerce acquisition ever. And we've expanded
our online marketplace by millions of items to 50 million in the past year alone.
Those are big changes. And they're paying oﬀ for us. We've also made lots of
smaller changes, many of them in the stores, that have improved the customer
experience. But it's still not enough. We have to stay aggressive. We have to be
nimble, move fast and take risks. Sometimes big risks. And our ears should perk up
when we hear voices that say what we're trying to achieve can't be done.
Throughout our history, we've proven the skeptics wrong, whether it was bringing
discount retailing to small towns, developing state-of-the-art systems and logistics to
lower our costs or oﬀering food and general merchandise under one roof in our
supercenters. This is who we are. And it made us great and it will drive our success in
the future. Sam called it swimming upstream, the 10th out of his 10 rules for building
a successful business. And it's the rule that resonates the most with me. I recently
came across a video where he talked about it. And I want to play it for you now.
(Video plays)
What a great message. And I think Sam's words ring as true today as they did then
because now, more than ever, we need to swim upstream. And we need some of
those mavericks. Is this the easy path or the comfortable path? No. It's going to be
harder and it's more strenuous. But it'll make us stronger, leaner and better
positioned to do the big things to once again deliver the future of retail.
Now swimming upstream doesn't just apply to our associates and leaders. It also
applies to our board. We've made signiﬁcant changes over the past couple of years
to the board's structure and governance. We've deepened our expertise in
technology. We've optimized the number of seats. And we've made several
processes improvements to be nimbler. We also continue to have strong,
independent voices. And 7 out of our 11 nominees are independent. Let me take a
few moments to introduce our directors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 43I'll ﬁrst recognize 9 directors in addition to myself who are up for reelection. And I'd
like to ask them to stand as I call their names and to keep standing. And please hold
your applause until the end. Our lead independent Director and Chairman, Jim
Cash, Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee, thank you; the
Chair of our Audit Committee, retired KPMG Chairman, Tim Flynn; former American
Airlines Chairman and CEO, Tom Horton; Yahoo! President and CEO, Marissa Mayer;
Walmart President and CEO, Doug McMillon; the Chair of our Strategic Planning and
Finance Committee, former PepsiCo Chairman and CEO, Steve Reinemund, who
unfortunately couldn't be here today; the Chair of our Technology & e-Commerce
Committee, Instagram CEO and Co-Founder, Kevin Systrom; Game Composites'
CEO, Steuart Walton; and of course, my predecessor as chairman of the Board of
Directors, Rob Walton. Thank you, all for your willingness to continue to serve.
Now I'm very excited to introduce one new independent member who has been
nominated to join the board, Carla Harris. Carla, please stand up. Thank you. Carla is
a Vice-Chairman at Morgan Stanley. She's actively involved in her community and
has been a strong advocate for women in business. In 2013, she was appointed by
President Obama to chair the National Women's Business Council. And the board
will beneﬁt from her deep ﬁnancial expertise and role as a champion for women.
Carla, the board and I are looking forward to working with you.
Stepping oﬀ the board and not standing for reelection are 2 directors who have
made signiﬁcant contributions to our company. They've both been strong advocates
for the work we've done at Walmart with women's economic empowerment and
diversity and inclusion programs. First, Pam Craig is the former CFO of Accenture
and had an outstanding 34-year career with the ﬁrm. She's brought a global
perspective and ﬁnance and technology expertise to our board. Pam's leaving us a
little earlier than we would like. But we've enjoyed working with her and have
beneﬁted tremendously from her time with us. Thank you, Pam, for your service.
Linda Wolf is the retired Chairman and CEO of Leo Burnett, a global advertising
agency. Linda's brand management and range of perspectives have beneﬁted the
company tremendously during her 12 years on the board. She's been deeply
involved in reshaping our associate training programs and compensation structures
as chair of the Compensation Committee. And Linda has also worked closely with
our lead independent director and myself and others on many of the changes to the
board over the last couple years. Linda, you should be proud of the diﬀerence
you've made for our company. And you've become a dear friend to all of us. We're
going to miss you. Thank you.
Our business is moving in the right direction. The changes we've made over the past
couple years, big and small, are starting to pay oﬀ. But we still have a long way to go.
So this is no time to be timid, to slow down or to listen to any voices of doubt. We
stay aggressive, work nimbly, move fast, take risks and we swim upstream. Your
Board of Directors has tremendous conﬁdence in you, our associates. And in our
leaders. And just as important, we're proud of you. So is our Walton family. We thank
you for everything you do. Now let's set out to do what we've done before and IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

meeting.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back, Blake Shelton.
{BIO 4216433 <GO>}
Man, I can't wait to introduce our next guest. But before I do, I think there's
something that we all need to see from last year. So let's take a look. God, James
really has a way to making people feel special, doesn't he? I got a text from Doug
earlier this week that just said, "Good luck topping that." And as you guys probably
know, I'm a competitive guy. And I think I've got just the thing. Let's do it. Ladies and
gentlemen, this is the moment you've all been waiting for. I was hoping for a bigger
reaction. Our next guest goes by many names, the tower of ﬁnancial power, the
minister of mathematics, the pharaoh of ﬁnance, the king of comps, please help me
welcome Walmart's Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Brett Biggs.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Okay, yes. Good morning. I have this silly dream that one year I'm going to come up
here and there's nothing strange going on when I come out here. That it's just
normal. I can like do my speech and we can just move on. Maybe next year, from the
ceiling, I don't know. I hate to -- I don't get oﬀended [ph] by any of your ideas. How
cool is this week? It is so much fun to have you here. And it's so much fun to have
you here to celebrate our company. We have built together an incredible business.
And it's a business that's positioned to win today and a business that's positioned to
win in the future.
Now as he said, I'm the ﬁnance guy. So we're going to get to some numbers in a
minute. But before I do that, I want to tell you just a quick story. So when I was a kid, I
loved to play sports. Yes. That's me #24 striking fear in the hearts of opponents. I was
and I still am really competitive. And when I was in eighth grade, I remember asking
my dad whether I should focus more on grades or whether I should focus more on
sports. Don't laugh. I was okay at sports. And he gave me that dad look. You know
that look. And he said, "Yes. You'll do both." Now my dad knew the value of being
balanced and how important that was to being successful, probably also ﬁgured the
NBA wasn't calling on #24 anytime soon. But that story and the importance about
both is what came to mind as I was thinking about, this morning, what to say and
what to talk to you about this morning.
Less than a year ago, we talked to our investors about a new ﬁnancial framework.
And it consists of 3 key elements of how we measure our success: strong eﬃcient
growth, operating discipline, strategic capital allocation. But if you think about it, it
really comes down to just 2 main things that we need to do as a company to be
successful: grow comp sales in our existing stores, in your stores and in e-commerce.
I saw that group in the back. And we need to spend our money more wisely. So it's
about doing both every day.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 43So David Glass is here this morning. I got a chance to see Mr. Glass earlier today. Mr.
Glass was our CEO after Sam Walton, for some of you who were newer to the
company. And he once said there are 2 ways to increase proﬁt: cut expenses and
increase sales. Pretty simple. But I like that next part. But we must do both well to
succeed. So let's talk about how we're doing.
In growing sales, this company, your company, is unbelievable. Last year, sales were
up over $13 billion in constant currency with total revenue of $486 billion. And all of
you played a part in that. It's unbelievable. Is anyone here from Walmart U.S.? I
thought I heard you earlier. Walmart U.S. has reported 11 straight quarters of positive
comp sales and 10 straight quarters of comp traﬃc in our stores. Great results. So get
ready. How about Sam's Club? We -- I get an extra minute every year for that. Well I
have to go on now at some point. But you guys are awesome. Sam's Club has had
positive comps for 5 straight quarters. And when we think about technology, you
guys are leading the way in using technology to take care of our members. Thank
you.
I think I heard some folks from Walmart International. So 10 of our 11 markets posted
positive comp sales last year. And 7 of those markets grew comp sales by more than
4%. That's what we like. International, thank you.
So I think Marc Lore called them this small but ﬁerce group in the back. How about
U.S. e-commerce? Wow. That may be a small group. But this has been a huge year.
Last year -- or last quarter, U.S. e-commerce reported 63% sales growth.
Unbelievable. That's a great job. So as we've grown sales, we've made important
investments. We've made investments in people, in you, in technology. And in other
key areas of the business. And it was the right thing to do. But as we've grown over
the years, we haven't been as disciplined as we should have been in managing our
expenses. And to get better, we always have to be honest with ourselves, right?
So we usually like seeing charts go up and to the right. But not this one, not
expenses. And I know that we can grow sales and we can be better with how we
spend our money. And I know it because we're starting to see results. We're starting
to see expenses growing slower than sales in many parts of our business. And as you
can see, we plan to doing better going forward.
But to continue on this journey, it's going to require new technology. Greg said it,
new processes. And most of all, a committed team of associates like you. A few
weeks ago, I had the chance to see one of these great teams in action. I visited store
4601 in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Got a few from New Mexico here. Last year, sales in
that store were up about 5%, over $100 million in sales. And proﬁt was up even more
than sales. And at the same time, inventory was down. Unbelievable results. Let's
take a look. (Video plays)
We have John with us here this morning. John was put -- I got to spend some time
with John. That is a guy who knows his business, he knows his numbers, he knows his
customers. And I just about didn't get out the store without cheese balls. He wasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 43Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Melody Metzpushing those hard. John, you are awesome. You're what we need as an associate.
Thank you.
So guess what would happen if we did what John and David and Carol and the team
were doing everywhere around the world. We would run a better business with
better customer service, bigger bonuses for associates and happier shareholders. So
I usually like straight lines. I like this squiggly line. Do you have any idea what that is?
Yes. That's our stock price since the beginning of last year. We've gone from a little
over $60 a share to almost $80 yesterday. It's all you. Our customers and our
investors are starting to see that we can do both. I'd like to see that line keep going
up. How about you? So how do we keep doing both? It's what you do every day.
We're going to grow sales. We're going to be item merchants. We're going to know
our numbers like John does. We're going to be in-stock. We're going to delight
customers. And when it comes to expenses, we can make a diﬀerence. I know we
can by ﬁnding ways to do more with less, to eliminate waste, to be more careful with
supplies. And every dollar counts.
If we were able to be 1% better in expenses, just 1%, that would be over $1 billion
every year for the company. We can pass those savings on to customers. We can
invest in technology, we can invest in e-commerce and we can invest in you. So each
one of these dollars that you get in your stores, dollars, pesos, rand, reals, yen, yuan,
rupees, every one of these that a customer gives us in sales is earned every day.
They trust us. But more than ever, they have choices. So we need to be disciplined
about how we spend the money that they give us. So can you help us do both? Can
you help us grow sales and be better in how we spend our money? I'm going to ask
you to say it with me. Let's make a commitment. How about that? Can you say it with
me? We will do both. I was almost convinced. Let's go one more time. We will do
both. You're awesome, okay.
So Walmart is one of the strongest companies to ever exist on this planet. We have
all the resources we could ask for. And now it's up to us. It's up to us to continue the
success now and into the future. For me. And I bet you feel the same, there aren't
many things in life that are more fun than winning. It feels good, doesn't it? And if we
can do both, if we can grow sales and spend our money wisely, we will win. Let's go
do it. Thank you.

the opening ceremony carrying the ﬂags and representing their countries. Let's just
take a minute to recognize all of our Integrity in Action Award winners and their
inspiring acts of integrity. There they are right there. Thank you, all. Congratulations.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

Page 12 of 43So now it's time to get down to the oﬃcial business of the meeting. The Inspectors
of Election today are from Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Based on their report,
we have a quorum and may proceed with the business portion of the meeting.
The polls are now open. And they will remain open until approximately 10:50 a.m.
Only shareholders who held their shares before close of business on April 7, 2017, or
their proxy holders, are entitled to vote shares. If you have not voted or wish to
change your vote, raise your hand and the ushers will pass you a ballot.
There are 8 matters to be brought before the meeting today. Each will be taken up in
the order in which they appear in the agenda. Only these 8 items, if properly
presented, will be considered and voted on today. As a reminder, no one may
address the meeting unless recognized by our Chairman, Greg Penner, or by me as
Corporate Secretary.
The ﬁrst item of business is the election of 11 directors. Greg introduced them all to
you this morning. And additional information regarding our directors and director
nominees is contained in our proxy statement.
The second company proposal is an advisory vote to determine how often we
conduct advisory say-on-pay votes. Our shareholders last voted on the frequency of
say-on-pay votes in 2011 and has been an annual agenda item for our Shareholder
Meetings ever since. The board continues to believe that holding an annual advisory
vote on say-on-pay is the most appropriate option for our company and for our
shareholders. The vote on this proposal is advisory, which means that the voting
results will not be binding.
The third company proposal is an advisory vote to approve the compensation of
Walmart's named executive oﬃcers. Our executive compensation program is
designed with an emphasis on performance and is intended to closely align the
interests of our senior executives with the interests of our shareholders. The vote on
this proposal is also advisory. However, our board and our Compensation and
Management Development Committee will consider the results in its regular
evaluations of our executive compensation program.
The fourth company proposal relates to the ratiﬁcation of the appointment of Ernst &
Young LLP as the company's independent accountants. Ernst & Young has held this
position since 1970.
So now we'll move on to the remaining items. First, the 3 shareholder proposals that
appeared in the company's proxy materials. The company's responses to each of
these shareholder proposals are detailed in our proxy statement. Now out of respect
for everyone in attendance, we ask that each presenter please stick to your 3 minutes
of allotted time and refrain from speaking on topics unrelated to your proposal.
The ﬁrst shareholder proposal requests that Walmart adopt a policy that the
chairman be independent. Amy Ritter, representing the International Brotherhood ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

{BIO 21289474 <GO>}
Thank you. So much. Good morning. My name is Amy Ritter. And I am with Making
Change at Walmart. And I urge you to support proposal #5, which asks the board to
appoint a chairman who is completely independent of the company.
Walmart needs an independent chairman to make sure it has the best possible
oversight and that the board acts in the best interests of all shareholders and
American workers and not just the privileged few. Walmart has 1.5 million employees
in the United States and a total of 2.3 million in the entire world. These are amazing,
hard working women and men. And they are the main reason Walmart makes
billions of dollars in proﬁt every year. They are the reason that top executives get
millions of dollars in salary and stock and why the Walton family today is worth more
than $130 billion.
Make no mistake, these hard-working workers have earned and deserve a better life.
So why should they have to work nearly 1,000 years to earn what CEO Doug
McMillon makes in just 1, some $22.5 million? Walmart talks about its average hourly
wage for full-time U.S. workers being $13.75 an hour. But how many of your 1.5
million workers in the U.S. actually make that? Can you please tell us? Because no
one seems to answer that simple question. From the countless Walmart workers who
have called us, e-mailed us and reached out to us, we now know that they don't
make your average wage. So the question that Walmart board and management
should answer to is this. How can any Walmart worker build a better life when
they've been with your company for ﬁve years or more and still only make $9 or $10
an hour? Could any of your leadership here survive on $9 an hour? Why are tens of
thousands of Walmart workers forced to apply for food stamps or other government
assistance paid by taxpayers when Walmart could easily aﬀord to pay a real living
wage?
Every day, we hear the stories of Walmart workers brave enough to speak out. We
hear about women and men ﬁred unfairly, the pay they have yet to receive, the raises
they are denied and some of the struggles that they endure. They're told to be afraid
of us, of the UFCW Union, even though all we've done is advocate for higher wages,
improved beneﬁts and a better life for all Walmart workers.
Please (inaudible).
{BIO 21289474 <GO>}
So today, I'm here to ask you, your executive leadership and board one simple thing.
Will you sit down with us to discuss these shareholder resolutions and the changes
that you can make today that would change the lives of your employees forever?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

Walmart board more independent and more accountable. So I want to thank all of

Thank you, Ms. Ritter. The second shareholder proposal requests that the board
provide proxy access for shareholder nominees for election to the board. No one is
here today to present this proposal. So we're going to move on to our third
shareholder proposal.
This proposal requests that management nominate at least one candidate for the
election to the board who is an independent director with environmental expertise.
Carolyn Davis, representing Organization United for Respect, will present this
proposal. Good morning, Ms. Davis.
{BIO 20300950 <GO>}
Good morning. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the Organization United for Respect, I am
speaking in favor of resolution #7, which reads as follows: Be resolved, shareholders
request that management nominate at least one candidate for election to the board
at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders who has a high-level of expertise and
experience in environmental matters relevant to global supply chains, transportation
or energy eﬃciency and is widely recognized in the business and environmental
communities as an authority in such ﬁelds as reasonably determined by the
company's board or the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee
and will qualify subject to exceptions and extraordinary circumstances clearly
detailed by the board as an independent director under the deﬁnition Walmart uses
to classify its directors, provided, however, that no director shall be considered
independent if he or she has had a ﬁnancial relationship with an organization that
has received in any year in the previous three years more than $100,000 from
Walmart's majority shareholders, a member of the Walton family or the Walton
Family Foundation. The nomination should be made in a manner that does not aﬀect
the unexpired term of any director.

Janie GriceMcMillon, has made it clear that retailers like Walmart will only survive if their
business creates shared value that beneﬁts shareholders and society.
As part of this commitment, he made bold promises to become one of the most
environmentally sustainable retailers and to invest in us, the associates. Climate
change is directly threatening our communities. And despite everything we hear
today, the facts remain. Walmart's greenhouse gas emissions that directly cause
climate change are not decreasing. They are increasing. And Walmart's use of
renewable energy that is going up is going down. And as far as investing in
associates, the unfair leave policies, reduced hours and low pay make it diﬃcult for
most of us to pay our bills and to take care of our families.
Walmart can and should live up to the promises it makes. Investing in associates
means letting us take care of our children when they are sick and accepting our
doctor notes. Investing in associates means that new parents at Walmart are allowed
time to bond with our children. Walmart's female executives receive 10 weeks of
paid family leave. Let's do the same for hourly associates, women and men. Investing
in associates means ending the open availability requirement and giving associates
set schedules so we can plan our lives and be there for our families. And for our
planet, it means having an independent environmental expert on the board to hold
us accountable to our promises. Thank you. So much.

Thank you, Ms. Davis. Thank you, Ms. Davis. We appreciate your viewpoint and your

Walmart U.S. Thank you, Ms. Grice.

Good morning.
Mr. Chairman, I oﬀer the following resolution: Resolved, shareholders request that
Walmart Stores, Inc. report annually to shareholders on the percentages of full-time
hourly associates at Walmart U.S. broken down by racial and ethnic groups and the
percentages of part-time hourly associates at Walmart U.S. similarly broken down by
racial and ethnic groups during the previous ﬁscal year. In preparing this report, we
believe that the company should use the racial and ethnic categories used in the
company's culture, diversity and inclusion report.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 16 of 43Jeﬀrey J. GearhartMy name is Janie Grice and I'm a 3-year associate from Marion, South Carolina. I
work out of store 1829. I love working at Walmart and serving our customers. And my
coworkers, all of you are my family. When I started working at Walmart, I made just
over $7 an hour. Thanks to associates speaking out for fair pay, we received a raise.
Today, I make over $10 an hour. I appreciate that Walmart took this important step.
But too many of us are still part-time. Too many of us have schedules and hours that
change so frequently we can't plan our lives or line up a second job. Too many of us
still can't pay our bills. The good news is solutions are easily within our reach.
At my store, for example, experienced associates like me are eager to work full-time
hours. But instead of increasing our hours, management hires more part-time
associates. Working full-time hours would help us deliver the quality service that our
customers deserve. Because full-time work at Walmart often means a set schedule
and better pay, it would also help bring economic stability to associates and our
families. Sam Walton said, "If you want the people in the stores to take care of the
customers, you have to make sure you're taking care of the people in the stores."
That's the most important single ingredient of Walmart's success. That's why I ﬁled
this resolution. I know that Walmart can do better.
As you know, at Walmart today, the makeup of our management and executives
doesn't reﬂect the diversity of our frontline workforce. Walmart did the right thing by
releasing that data and committing to diversity and inclusion in how we recruit, hire,
develop and promote associates. Disclosing the makeup of full-time and part-time
associates would help us stay true to that commitment. Recently, Walmart declared
that we've entered a new era of trust and transparency. So I'm asking our CEO, Doug
McMillon. And the Walton clan to embrace fairness. Please tell us the average wage
for women versus men at Walmart. Tell us if women are concentrated in part-time
jobs. And please adopt this proposal. Tell us if people of color are concentrated in
part-time positions that typically pay less. If there is a problem, we can ﬁx it together.
Thank you.
{BIO 16355444 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. Grice. Thank you, Ms. Grice. And I also want to thank you for your

we have heard diﬀerent perspectives from our proponents. And at Walmart, we really
think it's important to show respect to everyone even if we don't necessarily agree
with everything that's said. There are many of us here that are truly proud to be a
part of the company and proud of the great things we've done.
There are a couple of points I do want to provide some clariﬁcation on. First, with
respect to our associates. The $2.7 billion investment that Greg mentioned earlier in
training, education and wages, that really happened. That's real. We're also investing,
as you heard, in technology to make our associates' jobs easier and to help them
serve our customers better. Last year alone, 150,000 part-time hourly associates
were converted to full-time associates. And over 200,000 associates were promoted
to positions of greater pay or responsibility.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

Dave, is what makes Walmart unique.
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
So whether they want to visit their local store, shop from a mobile device at their
kid's soccer game or even get a healthy meal on-the-go, we have innovative
solutions for every occasion. A great example of this is the expansion of Online
Grocery to Pick up in the U.S. Yes. It's a huge timesaver for anyone with a busy
schedule, especially a mum with small kids. She can order online, choose the pickup
time and location and an associate will load everything into her car. And the best
part? She never had to unbuckle a car seat. So let's meet Jackie, who just tried it for
the ﬁrst time. (Video plays)
{BIO 15323604 <GO>}
I love that video. Isn't that great? And there's more to the story. You see, Jackie's
other daughter was in the very back of the car. And you couldn't quite see here. She
has cerebral palsy and autism. So she's easily upset by sounds and crowds. And it's
because of this that Jackie told us that she's extra thankful to be able to shop this
way.
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
You know what? The ability to make a diﬀerence in the lives of others is what makes
Walmart so special. And that was a great example, Gisel.
{BIO 15323604 <GO>}
Yes, I agree. Absolutely. And soon, busy moms will be able to get their items even
faster with our free automated pickup. So you just drive up to the machine in the
parking lot, you enter a code and it appears in, get this, Dave, 60 seconds. 60
seconds. After testing, it'll be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Imagine
that. And we'll be the only retailer in the world to have this set up.
{BIO 7334339 <GO>}
And you know what? The great thing is we've hired dedicated associates to ﬁll the
unit. So it's another terriﬁc example of how technology incorporated into the
business can create jobs.

That's great, Gisel. But you know what? We're also innovating to make paying even

Our associates are excited about it. But also, our members are really excited about it.
Check out this feedback. They're absolutely delighted. And associates are always
telling me about how it's transformed the shopping experience from an errand to
something that our members actually love doing.
And as a busy mom myself, I can completely appreciate that what we're working on
together is not just about technology that makes life easier, Dave. You see, my

Today, we recognize another great Walmart associate. And actually a great team,
with the Sam M. Walton Entrepreneur Award.
Walmart Pay has helped create the kind of fast, easy, seamless shopping experience
that our customers want. Since its launch, more than 7.3 million Walmart Pay
transactions have taken place, about 3,000 new customers try it every day and 90%
of them will use the service again.
This recognition isn't just about what Walmart Pay has achieved, it's also about how it
was created. It went from concept to launch in only 18 months and it involved a 180-
person team from across multiple departments. Walmart Pay stands out as a great
innovation for our company and a great example of how our company can innovate.

I'm Greg Benham [ph], Produce Supervisor from Sam's Club 6605, Gilbert, Arizona.

Howdy, Greg, nice to meet you. Thanks for being here. I'm from Arizona, too. I'm

Hi. Kathleen. Hey everyone. Good morning.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Thanks for coming.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
So Kathleen, sorry to be a bit late. I was back there in the green room with one of our
performers. And I don't want to say who it is yet. But they've got an entire taco bar
set up back there. Are you kidding me?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
I'm sure you love that. So just the other day, I was asking John if he had to eat just
one food for the rest of his life, what would it be? And of course, he said...
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Tacos, right? That's right. It's my favorite food. And plus, you'd have so many options.
You could have beef, you could have chicken, pork or ﬁsh.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. That's right. We realized tacos would actually be the perfect thing to talk about

Kathleen McLaughlinwho made it. A single taco illustrates so many of the ways that Walmart helps people
and the planet.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
So we thought we'd talk to you today about what our company is at our very core.
We're merchants, right? We buy and we sell merchandise. And product is the hero in
everything we do. And that's especially true at Sam's Club. Okay.
So before I get too far into this, I just want to say that we're oﬀ to a great start this
year. Thank you, to the entire team. And thank you so much for the First Quarter. Way
to go.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Good job.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And Kathleen, with so much of our merchandise, we have the ability to make
opportunities come to life. For example, these tasty tortillas, they come from a
woman-owned supplier, Ole Mexican Foods. And Veronica Moreno, she started the
business with just one machine in Atlanta, Georgia. But she worked hard. And today,
her products are on thousands of shelves and she employs hundreds of women.
Walmart and Sam's Club do a lot to support (inaudible). We do a lot to support small
and women-owned businesses. Don't we, Kathleen?
So we do a lot, right?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
I think what John was trying to say is we do actually a lot to support small and
women-owned businesses all around the world through our women's economic
empowerment initiative. It's brought our customers and our members lots of really
outstanding products. You'll hear more about that this morning.
Talking about tortillas makes me think about what goes in them. So corn, wheat and
the work that we do with farmers all around the world to optimize fertilizer. Now that
lowers costs and it also lowers emissions. So work like that, along with things like
reducing packaging, reducing food waste, reducing energy in factories, creating
innovative new products like LED light bulbs and cold water wash, Walmart and our
suppliers have already taken out millions of metric tons of greenhouse gas from
supply chains all around the world.
And we just announced a new goal. Walmart and suppliers aim to take out, in our
supply chain by 2030, a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions. Isn't that fantastic?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

Okay, Kathleen. I know everybody wants to know, how big is a gigaton?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
So a gigaton is a billion, that is billion with a b, tons of emissions. So it's basically like
taking 200 million cars oﬀ the road for an entire year.

Wow. 200 million cars.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Okay. So let's keep going. I think a lot of people like beef in their tacos, right? Yes?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. Yes.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Well did you know that Walmart works with cattle farms in Brazil to help reduce
deforestation. And we're using a mapping tool that lets a supplier look at 75,000
diﬀerent farms to understand the impact those farms have on the environment. And
we're working with a group called The World Resources Institute to help globalize
this technology.
Okay. Maybe you'd like to have carnitas in your tacos, right?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
That's what I like, carnitas.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Well in China, we're doing a traceability pilot with pork using block chain
technology. And what block chain does is it allows someone to track a product from
the farm all the way to the shelf and then have a record of it each and every step
along the way. And that's a really important part, Kathleen, of the new food safety
collaboration center we launched in China just last year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

That's right. Go China. So if you're talking about a ﬁsh taco or a shrimp taco, we've
been working hard to address the social and environmental challenges in the
seafood industry.
So for example, the Walmart Foundation has supported the Sustainable Fisheries
Partnership to address environmental risk and prevent disease with small-scale ﬁsh
farms.
We're also working on promoting worker dignity. So in another example, we've
supported Golden Dreams, which is coming up in a minute. It's a Burmese language
app from the Issara Institute. So seafood workers can use this app to read and
provide reviews about potential employers, recruiters, service providers.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And Kathleen, it's such important work because it's changing lives for people who
work in the supply chain.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yes. That's right.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Okay. I have another question. Can you have a taco without salsa?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Of course not. So for some of the people who farm the tomatoes, the cilantro, other
produce that people like to have in their tacos, we've been working to really improve
their lives. Take a look at this story about a farmer in Mexico who is supported by a
program, the FundaciÃ³n Walmart de Mexico. (Video plays)
That farmer's name is Emiliano. And he told us that program lifted him out of poverty
and has helped him send his 5 children, you saw in that video, to school.

Isn't that amazing? I'm so proud of this company and I'm proud of the work we do,
I'm proud of the work you do. And I'm proud of the work we do in stores, in clubs

Thank you. Thank you, John and Kathleen. Man, all this talk about tacos is starting to

Hi. I know I've been messing around up here a lot this morning and having some fun.
But I do want to take a minute and point out something that I think is really
important. And that's the fact that you all haven't lost sight of what really matters.
And that's people.
Man, like I said in the beginning, man, I just -- I grew up over here in Ada, Oklahoma.
My dad was a car salesman and my mom was a hairdresser. They shaped who I am
today.
And my journey to be here, about a-million-to-one shot. And you all's journey to be
here, about the same odds. Yes. You guys have more than 2 million people who work
for Walmart around the world. You all earned the right to be here today by making a
diﬀerence to people around you. We can't lose sight of things like that.
That's why I still live in Oklahoma and it's why I still love visiting the big towns and
the small towns and doing concerts. It's why I still love to give back to our military
service men and women, just like Walmart does. It's why I get a thrill out of coaching
and mentoring people, just like you all do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

Good morning, Walmart. And a very good morning to my e-commerce folks over

Thank you, Victoria. Good morning, everybody. It's a real privilege to be with you all

At Walmart, we're ﬁnding diﬀerent ways to serve customers by combining the
passion of our people with the power of technology. And no one knows that better
than our associates themselves. And the very best bit of my job is I get to see it
ﬁrsthand, with associates just like Rhonda Diggs [ph], who's here with us today.

{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Hello, Walmart. Wow. This is amazing. How you all doing? You having fun? Me too.
The energy in here is absolutely contagious, just like that e-commerce growth, 63%
last quarter. Thank you. Thank you, all, especially to the E-commerce group. Great
job, guys.
So does everyone want to keep this growth going? Me, too. So let's continue
empowering our customers to shop smarter so they can save money and time. We're
doing that on Jet.com by showing customers how to build bigger, smarter baskets.
And we're doing that on walmart.com too. Take a look.
When you go to walmart.com, you can immediately see the items you most
commonly buy, even the ones you buy in store. That's my account. Hi. wait. Shampoo
and conditioner? There must be somebody else in my family. I haven't needed those
in a long time.
Notice, with just a couple of taps, you can get free 2-day shipping with no
membership fee. But what if you want to save even more? Well you can pick up the
same order in a store and get a discount. We oﬀer that discount because pickup
avoids the most expensive part of shipping, last mile delivery. And so we share those
savings with our customers.
But what if you want items sooner than two days? What if you need it today? Well
that's where Walmart really has the advantage because we have stores everywhere.
Almost 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart. And because of this
network, customers can pick up products in a matter of hours. We have been testing
same-day delivery from a number of our stores.
Talking about stores. Judith, wow.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Thank you, Mark. Wow indeed. Because of the hard work of our associates
absolutely everywhere, we're delivering strong results for our company and we're
delivering great service for our customers however they want to shop. All around the
world, we're thinking about what's possible and trying out new innovations.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

Judith McKennaIn one of our stores in Texas, Tomball, customers are using interactive displays to
shop and learn about new technologies like connected home. In Michigan, one of
our customers can use an automated pick-up machine, which is completely self-
service. You simply walk up to it, scan a bar code and your delivery comes to you
instantly.
In Mexico, we've got digital kiosks, that allow anybody to place an online order in-
store even if they want to pay with cash. And in the U.K., we're testing new robotic
technologies and automated solutions in our distribution centers. But that's not all.
Right across the U.S., we are using data and analytics to change the way that work
gets done in our stores. Routine processes like price changes or stocking the shelves
are becoming faster and easier. And new mobile apps and tools, such as information
on sales, markdowns, customer feedback are available at your ﬁngertips without
ever having to leave the sales ﬂoor.
Marc, technology is helping us in so many ways. It's providing convenience for our
customers. But it's helping to make sure that the work that our associates do is
simpler and more valuable. And most importantly, that gives them time to serve our
customers.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
It deﬁnitely does, Judith. Walmart has a strong history of innovation. But the real
diﬀerence maker has always been our people. Let's look at that map again. We have
over 5,000 stores and clubs in the U.S. and at each store, there are hundreds of
associates commuting to work every day, many of them are driving.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
That's true.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
So this has us thinking, doesn't it Judith?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
It certainly does. And you're right about our associates making the real diﬀerence. So
what if associates, like Rhonda [ph] for example, wanted to make a stop on their way
home, deliver a dotcom order and earn a little more for doing that?
So that's an idea that we wanted to test a little bit more. So we've began testing
associate delivery program in just a few stores that gives our people that option.
Associates can download an app mark, receive notiﬁcations if there's a customer
along their route home that wants to wait [ph] an online order. And then if the
associate wants to, they can deliver that order. It's quite simple.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

been writing some pretty good music together these days. Because of you.
So here's the verse we've written with our results so far, just last year. Customer visits
are up, we're bringing prices down, we're managing inventory and in-stock well,
sales were up over $13 billion last year in constant currency and total revenue
reached $486 billion. Earnings per share were higher than we expected coming into
the year. $31.5 billion in cash ﬂow gives us the fuel to grow. And we returned $14.5
billion to shareholders. Well done. And thank you.
What's the word for it? We're also writing a verse with our service to communities
around the world. We're using our strength to help others, to create shared value for
our business and for society. Customers have always trusted us for low prices. But
they also want to know that the products they buy are good for their families, the
people that made them and the planet. Many of the suppliers that produce these
products are women. In 2011, we pledged to source $20 billion from women-owned
businesses. And we met that goal last year.
That's a big number. And one of those women is Sarah Frey [ph]. Sarah [ph], would
you please stand up? She's down here in front of me. Sarah's [ph] a farmer. And she
started -- could your son stand up for a second, too? Hi, guys. Her boys came with
her today. She's a farmer. And she started selling watermelons to one of our stores in
Illinois out of her pickup truck when she was 19 years old. And guess what? Last year,
she sold us over 5 million watermelons. She's promised me those didn't all come out
of her pickup truck, because that's a big number. When it comes to watermelons and
pumpkins, we don't know of a larger grower in the United States. And she's a job
creator in 7 states. Way to go, Sarah . Congratulations. And thank you.
Last year, we met another goal that we started in 2011. We supported training in
retail, in factories and on farms for 1 million women around the world. You belong to
a company that is making a diﬀerence in people's lives. How do those results feel?
What's the word for it? Bam. So we're not stopping there. We recently set new goals
to increase the use of renewable energy, to take a gigaton of emissions out of our
supply chain, to create 0 waste in our operations and to sell more sustainable
products. Here in the U.S., we're really proud that we're on track to achieve a 10-year
commitment to source an additional $250 billion in products that support American
jobs.
Now our -- obviously, we don't do all that by ourselves. Our suppliers work with us
on all of these eﬀorts related to sustainability and U.S. manufacturing and other
things. And I want to ask them to stand up. If you're a supplier to our company today
and you're in this arena, would you please get on your feet and let us appreciate
you. Thank you for the great products that you sell to us. They're scattered around. I
hope that you know we mean that and we appreciate your partnership.

not only as it relates to creating shared value. But also when it comes to ethics and
compliance. We would rather have a bad ﬁnancial result than to take a shortcut.
We want your children and mine to be proud of the choices you and I make in the
things that we do. We have a strong set of values at Walmart, don't we? And the
verse that we're writing today is about more than just ﬁnancial results. We value
more than that, right? Now while our values and those kinds of commitments aren't
changing, a lot of other things are. As we often say, the only thing that's constant at
Walmart is...
Change.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Isn't that amazing? Everywhere I go around the world, everybody knows the answer
to that question. It's because it's true. And technology is changing what customers
expect and how they shop.
The next verse in our song is about them, our customers. They are the reason that we
have jobs. If we don't get ahead of where they're going, they'll choose to shop
somewhere else. So where are they headed? Well they've always wanted the best
prices. They want value for their hard earned money. And they should. And they want
great merchandise, high quality, something new, something that's just ﬂat out
awesome.
And today, more than ever, customers expect and deserve to save time. Time is a
currency like money. They want an easy, enjoyable experience without friction and it
has got to be fast. The historic trade-oﬀ between price and service doesn't really
exist anymore. So we're creating a better shopping experience for customers and a
better working experience for ourselves as we strive to serve them. I want to give
you an example. Toni Hayes [ph] started as an overnight stocker. But now she
manages the grocery department in store 622 in Oklahoma City. Toni [ph], would
you please stand up? She's right here in front of me.
So a few weeks ago, a group of us are in her store. And she showed me how she
drives modular accuracy and in-stock with a new app we've developed for our
mobile devices. With this new app, Toni enjoys her work more. And she's getting her
work done faster, which gives her more time to serve customers. She impressed me
with her desire to learn and to adopt new tools. There's something I want to say to
Toni . What's the word for it? Bam. Nice job. Way to go.
Let's talk about some more examples. Sherpa Manaharan [ph] is a Personalization
Engineer using machine learning to monitor the weather. And make sure we're
sending swimsuits to Florida and raincoats to Seattle at the right time. Carlos Kirk

Page 39 of 43provide real-time inventory and price changes. Bowen Gong [ph] is a data scientist
on the Sam's Club technology team. He leads computer vision eﬀorts. He leads
computer vision eﬀorts that are aimed at eliminating the checkout process
altogether. We're experimenting and we're inventing.
We have tests going on with digital endless-aisle shopping, automated pickup
towers in stores, automated pickup stations in the parking lot, robotics and image
analytics to scan aisles for outs, the use of block chain for food safety. And machine
learning in our pricing systems to assist merchants. And we're doing more than just
testing. We're scaling things, like 2-day free shipping with no membership fee on
millions of items. A Pickup discount when customers want to pick it up. Grocery
pickup around the world, including a grocery pick up business at Sam's Club. We're
piloting the use of stores as shipping locations in China and Japan. And Jet fresh
delivery is now available to half the U.S. population and growing.
We have started to invent the future of shopping, again. We are making every day
easier for busy families. And we are using new ways of working to do it.
You're writing a really great song right now. And it is awesome to hear. What's the
word for it? And there'll be more where that came from. And as exciting as all that
stuﬀ is, I want to be clear that we don't believe technology is the answer to
everything. The secret to our success will always be our people.
Now no doubt, our work will be diﬀerent in the future. Robots, drones, algorithms,
we'll do some of the work that we used to have to do. And some people are afraid of
what those changes will bring. But I don't think we should be. Instead, I think we
should recognize that we'll be able to learn, grow and change together. All of us at
Walmart. And more broadly, in business, education and government, must work
together to ensure that this generation and the next are trained and ready with the
skills they need to succeed.
From the invention of the steam engine, to putting a man on the moon, to mobile
devices, as technology has changed, society has adapted and our lives have gotten
better. But sometimes, change can be hard. And we must be prepared to embrace
change and learn new ways of living and working. We're all doing that now. It would
be hard for me to ﬁnd anyone in this arena that doesn't have their smartphone within
reach. It's now integrated into your life and mine.
Well we see the opportunity to improve our business and help lead this change.
Today, together, we're building a new Walmart. As we're reinventing how we serve
customers, we're preparing you with the latest tools and training to serve them and
grow in your career. Let's all be lifelong learners.
You can see the beginning of our work in the academies in the U.S. and the U.K. and
the technology we're placing into your hands. Looking ahead, we'll compete with
technology. But we'll win with people. We'll be people-led and tech empowered.
We'll win because we're purpose-driven, with clear and meaningful values and anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

our competitive spirit and keeps us out in front.
Now we want everyone to be part of this. We embrace diversity in this company. And
we are committed to creating inclusive environments in every store and in every part
of our business. We have all kinds of jobs. And we want the most talented people in
them. You can learn to run a store, be a leader in a distribution center, drive a truck,
run a tire center or lead a customer care center. We're growing jobs in new areas.
We have data scientists, machine learning engineers. And mobile app developers, to
name a few. More than ever, Walmart will be a ladder of opportunity, a place where
you can build your dreams and grow.
Now let me introduce you to a few other people I've come across this year who are
doing just that. And I want to start with Amanda Sykes [ph] and Susan Chyna [ph].
Now let me warn you, kind of like Willie, these people are a little bit crazy, too. But in
the best way.
I met them a while back in the U.K. -- stand up, guys. They work in England, they lead
our meat and seafood business in their store. And between them, they have 55 years
of service. It doesn't look like that's possible. And they wanted me to tell you that
during their careers that the company has given them ﬂexibility. So not only would
they be great colleagues. But they'd also be great moms. They've raised kids over
that period of time.
And when I was in their store, it kind of went like this. There was a pizza counter. And
we were selling a bunch of pizzas. And they were bragging about how much they
were doing in volume. And the pizzas look great. And all of a sudden, I hear these
voices down the aisle. And these ladies are like, "Hi. if you want to see something,
come on down here with us, because we got it going on." So I go down there. And
their meat and seafood counter is gorgeous. Take a look at it behind us.
Now it looked like that on the day that I was there. And then they laid the big news
on me, that they had been voted the best meat and seafood counter in the country,
not just within Asda. But the entire U.K. I'm proud of you both. You had a good
week?
Yes. Fantastic week. Fantastic. Everything's great.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
So I thought it might be good if they came to the shareholder's meeting. And I'd like
to give them a bam. What's the word for it? Bam. Bam. Thank you, both for being
here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-02

Unidentiﬁed ParticipantOur customers love it when we have personality, when you talk to them, have a
conversation with them when you're walking to an item, they've got customers who
keep coming back because they love them. That's what we're all out to do. That's the
way that we're going to win. Now I mentioned earlier that customers are looking for
great merchandise. Raise your hand if you're a merchant. Right now everyone's hand
should be up.
Let me introduce you to another merchant. This is Ricardo Costa [ph]. Ricardo [ph],
come up here and stand by me. So Ricardo is the store manager in our Heartland
store in Toronto. He started 19 years ago in Lawn and Garden, now he runs a store.
And he's done such a good job of being an item merchant that he's earned what
they call Maverick status in Canada. That word sounds familiar, doesn't it? And he
reminded me of Sam Walton, because he was grabbing me by the arm. And running
me from one place to the other. And he'd go to a side counter and he would say --
now let me remind you, he's a Maverick. So he gets to make more choices about
what he features. He's earned some freedom. So he's dragging me to a side counter
item. And he's saying, "I know we can sell more of this." And he's bringing it out,
building a big feature. And sales are going up by multiples. And he was just doing it
over and over again in his store. He's a merchant. We all need to be merchants like
Ricardo .
And by the way, I heard that you recently applied for a promotion to lead more
stores in your market. And I just wanted you to let you know that you got that job.
Congratulations. (inaudible) All right. Go get them. So now your job is to spread that,
right, to all the stores you're responsible for. Way to go. Congratulations. Thank you.
We all need to be merchants like Ricardo , every single one of us. So folks, it's pretty
simple. This is our moment. Our plan to win is clear. And it will be you that will make
the diﬀerence. But it's always been that way, our people make the diﬀerence. Have
you heard that before?
Yes.

Hey all. Okay. So at this time, I can now inform you that the polls have closed. If you
ﬁlled out a ballot and have not handed it in, please pass it to an usher now. We will
now announce the unoﬃcial preliminary voting results from today's meeting.
Proposal #1, election of directors. All 11 director-nominees were elected. Proposal #2,
a nonbinding advisory resolution to establish the frequency of say-on-pay votes. For
this proposal, the majority of the shares present and eligible to vote were voted in
favor of holding our say-on-pay vote annually. Proposal #3, a nonbinding advisory
resolution to approve the compensation of Walmart's named executive oﬃcers. This
proposal was approved by a majority vote. And Proposal #4, the selection of Ernst &
Young as independent accountants. This proposal was also approved by a majority
vote. Proposals 5, 7 and 8 did not receive the required votes. And therefore, each of
them failed.
No presenter was made available today to present Proposal #6. We will issue an
announcement later today with the approximate voting percentages for each of
these proposal. The oﬃcial results for each of the proposals will be disclosed in a
ﬁling next week with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The business portion of this -- our meeting is now adjourned. And let me please
welcome back to the stage, our Chairman, Greg Penner.

That was a ﬁne morning, wasn't it? Doug, I just want to let you know that next year,
I've got dibs on Mr. Willie to introduce me.
I want to close the meeting by saying thank you to all of our shareholders for your
support of our company. Today, I hope you've seen why your Board believes we are
so well positioned to once again deliver the future of retail. I'd also like to again
appreciate each of our 6,000 associates here today. Please share with your fellow
associates at home how grateful we are for everything they do to make the

has been on display here today.
