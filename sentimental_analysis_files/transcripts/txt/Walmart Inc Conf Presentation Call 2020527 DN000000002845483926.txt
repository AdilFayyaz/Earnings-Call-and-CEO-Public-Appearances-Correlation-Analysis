{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. Hi. Welcome to the Bernstein's Strategic Decisions
Conference. We're very happy today to have Brett Biggs join us for a second
showing at the conference. Of course, he's master of ceremonies and the CFO for
Walmart, Inc., the big boss job. And I've known Brett for a long time. I have utmost
respect for him and the work that he and his team do, all the time. Obviously
Walmart is doing incredible job now, and we're very happy to have them here as the
country goes through such a diﬃcult time.
Of course, as usual, we do want to make the disclosure that there are going to be
forward-looking statements contained in this presentation that many times there will
be phrases that will refer to events for which we are making guesses. One of the
components that I think we're going to do is I'll ﬂash the screen up in just a second.
But be sure to realize that as you're in the Pigeonhole questions, please don't try to
reach for those extra components that one that doesn't disclose. This is a Strategic
Decisions Conference. And so, we're interested in those larger strategy issues, and
not focus so much on the ticky-tacky of the dynamics of earnings and details.
And so, with that, I'd like to move on to a couple of opening questions for Brett. The
ﬁrst thing that we wanted to start with something kind of simple but I think very
profound. We've certainly seen this incredible growth in the grocery business. It's
been a necessity for the marketplace; it's been a necessity for people just to keep
themselves running. But, I always think that Furner and Doug were general
merchandise folks by training and their background, and every time I would hear
Doug speak and Furner, when we worked with him in China, [ph] he would not
forget that it's general merchandise shop as well. What opportunity you guys see in
that space? We often hear about the mix conversation. So, I'd love to just hear how
you guys think about general merchandise opportunity now or in the future?

Brett Biggs
Brandon FletcherYes. You bet. Thanks, Brandon. Thanks for having us. I appreciate it. So, this is round
two for us at your conference. So, a little diﬀerent than last year, to say the least. Yes.
As you mentioned, Doug and John both kind of came up through that part of the
business, and it's still a big part of our business. When you look at food and
consumables in the US, over 55% or so would be food and consumables, but there's
a big general merchandise business, and it's certainly that way on the eCommerce
side. So, it's a big part of our mix and you saw some of that in the ﬁrst quarter. As we
went through the quarter, early part of -- mid part of March, late part of March, we
became pretty much a grocery and consumables company, and then, as the stimulus
checks came in, in mid-April, reverted back to more of a normal mix, although even
more to the general merchandise side.
So, as we go forward and you see the work that we've done on attracting more
brands to the sites, where we're doing marketplace, the things that we're trying to
do with brands in stores, private label, which has become a bigger part of our
business, and we're very much focused on that general merchandise business. One,
it's -- you need that from a assortment standpoint for the customer to be relevant on
everything else that you want to sell. But then, as you mentioned, mix is a big part of
the ﬁnancials that we put out and the results that we need to have, having that GM in
there is important.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. And one follow-up on that. When we talk about eCommerce, one of the stories
has been, because click-and-collect on has gone so well on grocery that we saw
more general merchandise quote items into that basket. I know people still say the
app's not entirely merged, okay, ﬁne, but we certainly see some of that product
shifting over. Has that adoption rate in terms of baskets beginning to look maybe a
little bit more like an old school supercenter basket start to show up a little bit?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. Part of that has been us being able to get the assortment. And let's talk about
online grocery. We call -- it started out being called online grocers, really a lot more
than grocers. We had a fairly limited mix of general merchandise. Now, it's not
exactly the entire supercenter, but it's much closer to that than it was. And over let's
say the next year or two, I think almost everything in supercenter, you'll be able to
put in that online grocery basket. So that's important. But, as we get people coming
into the store, doing pickup, there's a big part of general merchandise that's a part
of that. The merging of the apps, as you mentioned, the blue and the orange app is
really important to the experience for the customer. And I've used it recently and I do
see the diﬀerence that it can make in getting general merchandise, making it easier
to get general merchandise into the basket.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. That seems right. As some of the stores and some of the logistics hubs were
getting closer to their operational speed limits, was there -- is there a sense that --
I'm trying to frame this right way. What are some of the learnings you had or that --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 19Brett Biggs
Brandon Fletcher
Brett Biggsor at least early senses of where those chokepoints might be, right? Because
suddenly the stores are clearly being both logistics hubs and service because they
were one of the essential services still open. And we know that Tesco years ago had
kind of pulled a lot of that pick entirely out of stores because they're physically more
constrained and they just didn't have that room to do that. Did you guys hit that
point, where you're like, there's just too many people in the store at this point, not
just because of COVID, but because of the physical diﬃculties of logistics of a pick
process and customer shop?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We tested a lot of things over the past several weeks that we weren't
anticipating testing necessarily, certainly about how to get people through an online
channel and get them to the stores as well. We were, even before COVID, going
back to last year, as we had online grocery stores that were starting to hit their fourth
year, we were starting to learn where those chokepoints might be. And so, as a
customer, if you think about the customer that's in the store, you got to make sure
you're not causing them a problem as you have pickers in the stores, people that are
coming in the stores can actually get around what they want to. So, we had a lot of
technology driving that, become more eﬃcient at picking diﬀerent time slots or
having people come in. So that again gives us more picking capacity.
So, there are a lot of things that we're already working on that experience with
COVID, we'll get additional learnings, accelerated learnings coming out of that. And
even as you know, we turned -- we had ship from stores. So, we had about 100 stores
give or take, where we could ship items from stores to customers' homes, we hadn't
used it a lot. So, we accelerated over 1,000 in a matter of weeks, and we'll have over
2,000 that are capable of doing that. So it's just having the ﬂexibility to kind of do
what we need to do, when we need to do it, and having the capital to do it. Financial
strength, obviously we have to go do that. But then also Brandon you know this
company well, I've been here 20 years. The ability of this Company to move with
speed is remarkable. I quit saying amazed, we're not amazed by it anymore. But it's
remarkable to have a $500 billion company that can move as quickly as we can and
when we need to.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
One of the things that -- we had some investor interest on this on omni-channel, I
didn't see it as much as a change as I think maybe some of the investors did, which is
with Jet.com kind of kind of turned oﬀ as a brand, not turned oﬀ as an operation or
as a team et cetera or as a capability, but as a brand, does that really mean that
Walmart can be an urban hipster brand and the rich elites are okay shopping at
Walmart and we don't have to worry about that old notion of, can Walmart hit the
promise of being good enough for everybody, but not too good for anyone?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
And the brand, we may -- there may be still some things that we do with the brand.
It's amazing how sticky the Walmart brand is. And we found that by acquiring Jet, itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 19Brandon Fletcher
Brett Biggswas almost four years ago. And as we started utilizing Jet for diﬀerent things, we
kept ﬁnding the Walmart brand was really, really strong with consumers. And when
you look at our customer base versus -- and lay it against the demographics of the
US, it's actually strikingly similar. So, we do appeal to every demographic -- and
particularly now, when you look at -- price has always been important. We've been a
winner on that for years. We've always been big in assortment, we're getting better
in assortment. Convenience is the one area, you go back ﬁve years ago that people
could have argued that Walmart's not convenient enough. I think that's not true
anymore with online, with stores, everything that we can do for customers, pickup
delivery, we are convenient. So when you put all those things together, whether
you're lower income, middle income, higher income, I think we've got what you
want, even items now that three years ago as a customer and as an executive, I
would have thought, I don't know if we have that online. We do have it online. And
so, if I can do that and get the right price, why would you not go to walmart.com?
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, we've always been believers that the ability to be a price and
convenience location for some and a price and assortment location for others, is one
of the unique attributes that Walmart can provide. And that's true. When I say
unique, I mean genuinely unique. A handful of companies around the world can
aspire to that that model. And then, yes, I have been impressed that some of the
service components that normally might be a little bit of a reach, people are signing
up for it. And I mean, we talked before about how some of the service in the stores
really has gotten much better, electronics, especially compared to the old days
where it was lacking. Even within many incentives as a Walmart associate had to go
to electronics, they will ﬁnd themselves going to competitor because service just was
there and now that's not. It's just -- it's really quite important.
I wanted to turn a little bit to international. Again, I know it's not a huge thing for that,
but the demand shocks in other markets may be places with a stimulus, they may
have less opportunity than we've seen in terms of kind of sustained small businesses.
Should we worry about a V-shaped recovery in the US and something sad or a less
eﬀective letter elsewhere in the world?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I think it's going to be -- and it's hard to look at international as international,
because every market is so diﬀerent. And even within the US, I think as you talk
about V shape, U shape, swoosh shape, whatever shape you want to think about.
We're going to see that in diﬀerent parts of the US even. Because you look
internationally, as you mentioned we're seeing some of the same challenges we
have in the US, which is channel shift, mix shift, demand cycles, very quick demand
cycles. Canada will look a lot more like the US Typically Mexico, amazing business at
Walmex just continues to do incredibly well. But like you said, every country's got a
diﬀerent pattern of stimulus, some much more -- you're seeing more stimulus in
Canada than you will right now in South Africa, for instance. And so, we'll have to
work our way through that and are working our way through that. We'll have toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Brett Biggscontinue -- that is going to continue probably for the rest of the year, trying to work
our way through some of those things.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. I think, the one that we've got questions on were kind of I'll call it Flipkart. So,
thus far, again you got to look at the numbers. It doesn't look like India had as bad or
disastrous things people had thought, but at the same time, the construct of this
dynamic is just as important in India as it is everywhere else. And so, kind of had the
sense that maybe that's even a tailwind for Flipkart, the way it is for others. Do you
have kind of sense of where you guys are on that? I know, it's early days.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. it's early. And Flipkart for us obviously is a really long-term investment. Go
back to the middle or end of March through really most of April, Flipkart was
eﬀectively kind of shut down, because of government regulations. The country was
really in a lockdown for about three weeks and then there were just some slow
reopening diﬀerent parts of the yellow, red, yellow, red, orange, green zones and all
that in India. We're starting to get back to a little bit more normal operations there.
And just like with every other country, I think India will go through a diﬀerent cycle.
They were pretty early to shut the country down. So, we'll see how that plays out. But,
it's a great business for us and I think will continue to be for a long time.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. Now, we have more time, we deﬁnitely would chat about some of the -- like the
payments business you guys have there I think.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, PhonePe. Yes. It's great.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
There's just so much. I mean, we've had entire conversations on just about payments
business now, because that's just such a remarkable growth.
The other thing is, is China at some point a similar, I'll call it, diﬀerentiated bet in the
way that we've seen kind of a big amount of capital go to Flipkart. I mean, obviously,
nobody forgets that it's on the board. But should we -- when we're thinking about,
okay, listen, Walmart's going to have to pony up some more capital in China. I don't
know when but it's going to have to come someday somewhere.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}

{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. And it's already a big business. I mean, India, we have a very, very small business
but China we've grown more organically and have a big, big supercenter business.
Sam's Club is doing incredibly well there. We continue to grow through the Sam's
Club channel. So, I think, in ways we've made big bets. We did a partnership with
JD.com. We own around 10% of that company, which has been a nice investment for
us. So, we've made some pretty big bets in China. They've just been more gradual
over time versus the big investment that we made at one time in India.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Makes sense. On Sam's, is there another market that you guys think could be in
China, because China has been awesome for Sam's? I mean, it's half the reason why I
can take a swing at Costco every now and again, because you guys are doing so well
in Chain. But, is there another market for Sam's that you feel that way? I mean,
Mexico has already been great on that basis?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, what's working in China is it appeals to middle, higher income, which is
emerging quite a bit in China. And so, it appeals to that income demographic.
Mexico plays a little bit of a diﬀerent role. But as you said it's been a great format for
us there, obviously a great format in the US Adding diﬀerent retail, brick and mortar
formats going forward is probably going to be less prevalent than we would have
had in the past as a company just given where retail is going. You'll see more
investment going into maintaining our existing ﬂeet and growing our eCommerce
business, but it's where we've got Sam's, it's fantastic.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
When you think about that, if you guys go internationally, one of the things that we
found is how big city matters so much diﬀerently in terms of how you serve that than
anything else. And the US, frankly, doesn't have that many big cities, not really, not
certainly by a global deﬁnition. But most of the rest of population, most of the rest of
the world is densifying and at crazy levels relative to US experience. Does that lead
to that notion that on top of the idea that there's a price assortment and serviceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Brett Biggsoﬀering that can hit the right component, if you can take just enough convenience?
Is there a sense that there is kind of an urgent way of doing things and the suburban
way of doing things and that maybe the global battle is more about that urban way
of doing things?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think that -- yes, there's certainly an element of truth to that. I mean, the US is -- we
have big cities. There are diﬀerent big cities. You have Dallas-Fort Worth, which has 8
million people, but it's spread out of East to West almost 100 miles. It's very diﬀerent
than 8 million people in a city in Japan or in China, just the way it's constructed. So,
even in Dallas-Fort Worth, you get -- there's an urban part of Dallas-Fort Worth but
there's this kind of big suburban part of Dallas-Fort Worth. Just to use that as an
example. And our formats work incredibly well in the US, having now eCommerce
where you can be -- you can more easily deal with last mile and big cities. And then,
we're great obviously, in suburban and more rural areas. It's going to be interesting, I
think how -- we deﬁnitely were seeing urbanization in the globe until the last eight
weeks. It's going to be interesting coming out of this how people -- does that trend
continue, or do we stay a little more suburban, rural than we then we were heading
coming into COVID.
But, I think no matter how that trends with what we've done in eCommerce and the
size of the eCommerce business we have and the stores, but the ability to pull that
together in an omni-channel solution is something really globally no one's done.
And we said, Brandon, go back four or ﬁve years ago, we were saying, we think omni
-- this is the way to go. And no one's really done this. So, there's not a playbook.
We're writing the playbook as we go. Those investments have paid oﬀ a ton in the
last 10 weeks. And trends are going to accelerate. Trends are already happening,
coming into this COVID time period are going to accelerate and investments we
made in last four or ﬁve years are I feel the right investments. So, I like our strategy
going forward.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. I think that's pretty clear. When we think about that kind of longer run strategy,
if we think about threats maybe to that -- what seems to be a pretty good path to
success over the next ﬁve years, that's an open space. Let me just suggest one for us,
which is -- do we think that the EDLC/EDLP loop is still working. Because
eCommerce seems to take so much capital, right? And I know some of this is just
observability, right? You push in the capital, you got to wait for utilization curve in
order for that EDLC/EDLP thing to work. But with stores, the unit economics were just
so incredible that you'd be like, oh, great, these are awesome. This is (inaudible)
store in McAlester, Oklahoma and nobody's ever going to do that again. And so,
with D.C., it's going to be like, man, there's a lot of money in the ground. And so,
that's -- my worry is does that loop still work. But there may be another threat that I'm
not seeing that you guys worry about a little bit.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 19Brandon Fletcher
Brett BiggsNo, I think you described that pretty well. It's -- capital is really diﬀerent. If you go
back to '13, '14 -- 2013, 2014, 2015, more than half our capital is new stores. This year,
it'll be less than 20%, and most of us in Mexico and China. So, it's -- the use of capital
has changed a lot. It's getting your associates more eﬃcient and the tools that we're
giving them, making it easier for customers in the stores, making it more enjoyable
in the stores. That's now where the capital is going. I think that'll continue.
Technology, of course, that'll continue for a while. But, I think for me, the biggest risk
for us -- and I usually answer this question this way, it's just, how quickly can we get,
there's no end, necessarily to the strategy. This is omni strategy, but how quickly do
we get to where, not some of the time or most of the time, but all the time that we
are top of mind with customers across United States and across the markets that
we're in. We're really, really high on that list. We have a lot of customers. We are
number one. We want to be number one with all consumers. And I think speed and
moving rapidly toward that, whether it's getting the brands that we want in stores
and online. We've made great progress for that. Getting the capacity on our
fulﬁllment centers and distribution centers that we want. And again, we've made
great progress toward that.
And balancing all that out with the returns, and the ﬁnancial results that shareholders
expect and I think we've done a pretty good job of that. That's what we're trying to
do. But, I think, if you asked Doug the same question, he would probably give the
same answer. It's just -- we just have to keep moving really quickly to solve problems.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense. And I will say from a perspective of that, it's
been amazing how much evolution has happened. But, if I go back to my own
experience in that, getting everybody to get on board with the omni-channel
process was a while, right, it was a while Because I go back to 2005 and 2006, there
are strategy components we're working on that we're anticipating this universe,
probably too early, of course, anticipate the universe, but it did take a while to get
going.
Now, as Doug did and as you guys accomplished, it's been incredible speed in the
last couple of years. And that's, I think, made up a lot of the gap. But I think that's
probably the right identiﬁcation of the issue.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, it's interesting. We were -- I mean, to your point, we were slower than we should
have been on eCommerce. And I'm realizing that there were a year -- I remember
talking to investors, go back 5, 6, 7 years ago, and when I would say the supercenters
are going to be an asset, you got strange looks. And supercenters are a big asset for
us, and the supercenter will change, it will evolve. But having that space that close to
customers is going to be a big part of what we do. I've gone back and asked
executives from the past about the time when we went into groceries, and a lot of
the things that you hear are the same things that we went through in the last several
years around stores and eCommerce that back then, groceries, they weren't ﬁghtingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 19Brandon Fletcher
Brett Biggsgeneral merchandise, it was complementary. Now, eCommerce and stores are
complementary as well. We have to remember that.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yes. No division 1 and division 27 used to feel quite a heck of a football team. And
the same thing happened at the early phase dotcom. I remember how many times,
my favorite way to ﬁgure out where the wind was blowing was whether or not to
pickup for online was in the front of the store or back of the store. Am I going to
force you to walk through the store because the store is the business here that I want
to make it more convenient work for you because the consumers is the business.
And again, (inaudible).
The other one that I think has caused people to doubt a little bit maybe -- maybe it's
not the EDLC/EDLP loop but just headlands, it's just wage increases. So, hats oﬀ to
you guys for -- to making the right moves to help everyone during this incredible
work with extra risk, get a little bit more. One of the things though that I think people
are thinking about is, arguably, and this is a little bit more of my personal view. I think
you could say that the value for work society has given to, what if we realize are
central worker society function has been a little bit arbitrarily low too long? I'm not
smart enough to know the way that you do that without disrupting the function of
the capital system, but we understand there might be some version of a living wage
question. How do you guys think about that even though I think you guys led that
charge to get wages back up? Maybe it's still isn't high enough and kind of a sense
of where you guys are head is on terms of potential that may be long run pressures
of income inequality just are going to push wages higher?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, I want to start answering that question with -- you started there with our
associates, which, it's hard to even ﬁnd the right word what I've seen, when I've gone
into stores with the work our associates are performing, the attitude that they have. I
think so many of them feel like and they rightly should that they're serving their
communities, they're helping people keep moving in this diﬃcult time and that's
exactly what they're doing. And so, what they've done is amazing and deciding to do
the one time bonuses, the two rounds of one-time bonus in the US, we've done
things internationally and important for the bonus in the ﬁrst quarter was as an easy
decision. It just -- it felt really, really good to do that and to honor them.
Wages is a lot of things that go into determining what wages should be the market
you're in and the work that's being performed. As you mentioned, going back to
2015, we raised wages from -- in the seven to the facility starting rate nine -- sorry,
nine, facility stating rate, we were sevenish in minimum wage and then went up to $11
over the last couple of years. Deﬁnitely the right thing to do for associates. And
there's diﬀerent costs of living in diﬀerent parts of the country. So, it's hard to look at
what with one basket.
We've got to be competitive in market, so -- people won't work for you. And so,
we've got to make sure that we're paying competitive wage in each market thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Brett Biggswe're in. And over time, we'll just have to continue to evolve. Again with where the
market goes and what we're doing as a company, all of that goes into that wage
discussion. But, we're being very strategic about it. There are -- as we get places in
the country, where wages are increasing is getting more competitive. Certainly we're
addressing those things to ensure that we can get the associates that we need into
those stores and be able to keep them as well.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
There's been a lot about this, if the unemployment program was richer than wages in
some markets, if the states had relatively generous unemployment beneﬁts that
people won't come back to work. Were you guys on that as a component, I mean,
you've hired a lot of people, other large players have hired a lot of people. I assume
you've been able to meet the demand, because you've seen the people in the stores
and you see them adding all the protection measures and making sure they're
guarding people coming in line, et cetera. So I assume that hasn't been the barrier
yet, that you haven't hit that point, that you can't ﬁnd labor at the right -- at a fair
wage.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I read the same thing as you do, I mean about that dynamic. And so that will play
itself out how it play itself out, how it ends up playing itself out. But clearly, we've
hired more than 250,000 people just in a matter of weeks into fulﬁllment centers
and stores and distribution centers. And I think, for the most part, people want to
work, they want to contribute. And I think in a time like this, people want to be a part
of the solution to what's going on in the world. And I think they feel a sense of that.
That's my take on it.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
That makes a lot of sense. I have a couple more that I want to run through. But I just
want to remind everybody that on Pigeonhole we do have questions. And we have
several in there that can be seen. Just submit and vote for those so that I can share
some of those with Brett. One of the other things is tariﬀs. So, we kind of thought
that risk was gone. Rhetoric's gotten scarier frankly. And, I think we would start
putting it back on the table. We certainly have seen some of it move out of China
underway for the retail industry broadly. I know that a long time ago, we'd advocated
being less exposed to China on a resource base, and that's why you guys have
dozens of oﬃces around the world to target those and everybody else does too?
But, how does -- how do you guys balance as other global companies must, the
sense of kind of a home country bias but also caring very much about servicing and
being a part of the Chinese comp? Is that hard? Is it still ﬁne? Is it still just kind of like,
okay, there's some ﬁghting happening in between Washington, Beijing, but we can
stay centered? Just would love any color on that?

Brett BiggsYeah. I mean, we've talked about before, I mean, even in the US, still most -- I mean
the large majority of our goods are purchased here. And then, once you get to the
smaller part, that's not purchased here, there is a part of that, obviously it's in China
and they're a big trading partner for the country, as well as for Walmart. It takes a
long time for supply chains to move because you just got to have the manufacturing
base and the labor base in the country to make that happen. 18 months ago seemed
like all we were talking about was tariﬀs. And so I think, those discussions started
taking place 18 months ago, a lot of companies started looking for diﬀerent places to
source. And I'm sure some of that has continued over the last several months. Our
merchants are, they're so good at what they do and there's such -- you got to look at
price and assortment where it's coming from, and cost and all the things that they
look at, with our suppliers. And they're great at dealing with that. And even if we
went through list one, list two lists three, with the tariﬀs over that period of time, they
managed it in a way that was pretty seamless for our customers, which is the main
thing that that we want to do. And so, we're just going to, we'll continue to work our
way through that, whatever it ends up being, just like we always have.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. One of the things that's come up as a kind of a sub version of that is that we've
heard from some retailers that they've had a harder time getting a hold of PPE or
hand sanitizer or other components because the dependency on the Chinese supply
chain for a lot of that for good historical reasons, because it was that -- I'll call it semi
complex manufacturing right? It wasn't super simple injection plastic molding but it
wasn't also kind of a higher order Japan or Germany manufacturing. Has that
happened for you guys? Have you guys been able -- I mean, it looks like you'd get a
hold of what you need to get a hold of, but have you had that like you had to go
someplace diﬀerent because, China couldn't do it anymore, because the demand
wasn't there, the availability of supply wasn't there?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. Our team, our, what we call, asset protection teams as well as our executive
team strictly in Walmart US, were really early on ensuring that we had what we
needed. And we're starting to get what we needed for PPE, for mask, for plexiglass,
and all the things that we had, they were early into trying to secure that for the
Company. So, nothing right now goes without challenge. But, I think we were pretty
successful in getting what we needed for associates, for customers.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
It's remarkable. And you can just see you moved earlier. And our simple test is, we
take someone's hand sanitizer and we see essentially is it actually hand sanitizer, or is
it just some ethanol that smells like someone who's drinking too much on the
weekend. And you can just see like who sourced on time, and who essentially can.

We spent a lot of time looking at PPE without the whiskey drink. But I'll tell you why.
This reopening component, think about what we heard from Target yesterday from
Brian Cornell, we want to be the safest store shop in America. It's becoming,
arguably -- this is a little dramatic, but PPE or safety is kind of like human rights,
right? And so that notion of going what is eﬃcient in order for people to want to
shop again. And so, there's a whole set of folks who didn't go through the essential
transition you guys already did. Well, they're going to have to do it. And so, all of
those dynamics become quite remarkable.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We're pretty early to meet our customers in the stores. The evolution of masks
and just the advice, we and others were getting from various agencies went through
its evolution. And we're obviously were following everything we need to in the
states. But trying to stay ahead of that and just knowing what makes customers and
associates feel safe, that's really important. And to your point, I think it's going to
continue to be important for a while, who knows how long, but if customers and
associates don't feel safe in your stores, they're going to ﬁnd somewhere else to go
and we want to make sure people feel safe.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. I don't want to go too far down the tangent. But, just because, it was my job a
long time ago to write the SARS1.0 defense plan, which had a whole set of operation
things, which seems kind of look like a click-and-collect. So, I feel relatively proud of
it. One of the other components was there was a dynamic of, if you actually had to
have, I'll call it a clean part of the store and the dirty part of store. So, you might
receive and that's the dirty part of the store and you would treat stuﬀ, either with
hydrogen peroxide or ozone, and then you clean part of the store.
Have you guys had a place where -- was there a sense or -- has there been a notion
that maybe there's even a -- there is more evolution to happen in the way that the
stores run, even though today is really good but maybe this isn't the ﬁnal way to
make the system as safe as can be?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We're learning things every day. This again -- there's no playbook for this. I mean,
there were SARS and H1N1.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}

Brandon FletcherYeah. There's no playbook for this one. So, we're learning as we go. And like we do,
we'll respond to customer what the customer wants, what we need to do, what's the
right thing to do, what our associates want. It's got to be all that coming together to
help us write that playbook.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
And to be fair, what's fascinating with this one is, it's highly infectious, still terrifyingly
high fatality rate, but lower than what people were imagining, right, at the time, the
notion of what SARS1.0 or Ebola was, was essentially super high mortality, but slower
infection. And so, there isn't -- this was not contemplated well, but by probably
handful of people in epidemiology. Private label has been awesome, you mentioned
it before. Mostly when other companies do this, they do it for margin enhancement.
You guys have a diﬀerent complex role. It doesn't mean that there's a good margin
and probably there is. But sometimes just people will go, well, you have to do that to
defend all the year, you have to do that to be -- have an opening price point that
keeps your lower income customer engaged. How do you guys think about the
private label world at all?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. It's evolved a lot over the last several years, and we've put a lot of resources, a
lot of people against it. And when I used to go early in my career to the UK, and I'd
see 50% private label and a lot of places in Europe, I never thought the US would
ever get anything close to that because growing up as a kid, I remember private
label being generic. It was not good product and thought the US will never do this.
Now, I still don't think as a country, we get to 50%. I think this is a still a very brand
focused customer in the US But it's more prevalent than I would have thought, even
10 years ago. And Aldi and Lidl have done a really nice job with that. The lessons we
learned in the UK in particular is you don't compete with an opening price on
quality. You've got to compete with a mid-tier quality on private label. But we've
taken that pass through, a great value is one of the biggest brands in the world, not
just for us, in general. And then, we've taken that -- we've gone from 21 -- I think it
was 21 private labels of Sam's Club basically to 1. We've evolved on general
merchandise stride with mainstay and other things that we're doing on that side of
the business. So, it creates loyalty as well, with customers, there is that margin mix
that's important, but it creates a loyalty with customers that we're seeing. And it's just
another -- it's kind of another arrow in the quiver of how you address customer
need.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. I think that's right. And we think you guys hit quality really well on private label.
And we've even seen those variations where you'll do -- you'll have an eco-friendly
private label, you'll have a true opening price point that kind of looks like the old
one, and then you'll have what we think of as an Aldi color, like yes, that's really
good. It's got the right quality; it's got the right component.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Some of the things we're doing with market side and just really, really good product.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. That's exactly there. And one of the things that we always see is Kroger has
done a very good job of private label and they have that same aspiration, which is
you almost are proud to have bought it and be like, listen, I'm going to convince you.
Try the Kroger traditions, pizza sauce, it's exceptional. And I think you guys are
getting to that point.
Just two more quickly and then I've got some audience things. I'm curious about the
sale of VUDU, and I'm not after any commentary you guys haven't made from there.
But one of the things that is a criticism we sometimes hear is that technology comes
inside of Walmart, has a harder time getting it seed and growing and then kind of
going someplace else. And that's not a perfect example for you, even because the
whole business moved from where the original business case was. But, I do kind of
want the more general question of, do you think that Walmart's made moves to
where entrepreneurs can really come in and start showing their vision inside of
Walmart as opposed to, it's a place that would make you nervous about taking their
baby and helping it use the scale?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. A lot of times what you'll see, we make an acquisition is it really just integrates
into Walmart. And there are times where you have a technology that -- a technology
or brand that you buy and Bonobos will be an example where -- Bonobos is basically
still Bonobos today. And there's places where you acquire something like a
Shoes.com that really brought all that assortment onto walmart.com. And it makes
sense to integrate what we've done with those two businesses. The things that we've
done in Store No. 8, delivery into the home, delivery into the fridge is the early
testing and early -- testing and early pilots we've been doing there came from here.
That was some folks we brought into the Company. And so, that's evolved and
ﬂourished. We do need things that we can do at scale. That's important for the
Company. There's only so many smaller things you can do. You really need to be
able to scale things up to make sense.
When I look at what we've done with Store No. 8, some of the technology you've
seen with Scan & Go that it worked in Sam's, work at Walmart US, it's a diﬀerent use
inside of Walmart US It's really exciting what we've done. And I think this is a place
that if you're a technologist and now with Suresh as our CTO, our new CTO, your
products and your ideas can ﬂourish here and actually you can scale them in a way
that maybe you can't do it on your own.

Brett BiggsA couple of quick ones, which is I'm looking oﬀ the list. So, ﬁrst is, could you please
talk about the entry of Facebook into the Indian retail market through an investment
in Reliance Industries? Game Changer or just everybody's going to show up there
one day?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
India's competitive, we knew that. Reliance has been a competitor for years. I mean
I've been going to India personally since 2004. We started looking to our initial foray
into there. So, it's been competitive, Reliance, Amazon. So, when you have 1.3 billion
people, it's going to attract a lot of investment, a lot of the reasons why we went
there. So, it's not surprising.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Another one is, what is the biggest opportunity you see arising from this pandemic?
So, is there place where, there's extra CapEx dollars that you're more likely to spend
as a result of 2020?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We make decisions all the time and choices, trade-oﬀs, and there's diﬀerent
elements that go into that calculus. This is a big one, this is going to change how
consumers shop. I think that's story still to be written. How much do consumers
change? So, clearly e-commerce is going to -- was already accelerating -- that
probably celebrates another level. And so, as we look at how do you fulﬁll that need?
Will we have more fulﬁllment space than we would have had otherwise? Probably, I
don't think it's dramatically diﬀerent because we'd already been adding fulﬁllment
space. There are diﬀerent ways that you'll use your stores, more delivery, more
pickup than in the past probably. But again, we are heading in that direction. So, I
don't see massive changes in how we would spend capital, because everything we
were doing was already heading in that direction. It's not like we have to stop and
start. So, it'll accelerate some things, but I don't think it'll be dramatically diﬀerent.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
It's a selﬁsh follow-up on that, which is, we've seen some of those smaller pickup
points be tested in Chicago and other places. And we're curious, if -- because you
have really good density in lots of places, but maybe not all the density you want in
all of the places. Is that still a possibility? Are those still thoughts that are on the
table, or is it sort of like -- and these are super boxes and we're just going to ﬁgure
out how to make (inaudible).
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
No, I think things -- there are so many things that are still on the table and addressing
-- continue to more eﬃciently address the urban customer is important. That's a
large part of population that we have. The great thing is we have businesses,
whether it's in London, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tokyo, we have businesses that haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Brandon Fletchermassive density. So, we know how to do those things, a little diﬀerent than the US So,
again, we've got to ﬁnd things that we can scale, having one-oﬀ type of pickup
facility in the Chicago isn't going to make as much sense? But now, what we can do
with supercenters, what we can do with eCommerce, home delivery, Sam's Club
home delivery, I don't think there's a customer set that we can't address and aren't
addressing.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Okay. Do you see the opportunity as -- some people have framed this is a market
share came from mom and pops because they just couldn't do the things in omni-
channel that had been done. But do you think you're also kind of gaining better than
fair share, even against some of the larger competitors?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Can you repeat? I'm sorry, Brandon, I can't quite.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. There's an argument that mom and pops haven't been able to do anything on
omni-channel for obvious reasons, low capital, can't do websites, so on and so forth.
But the notion is, do you think you're just winning against the weakest of the players
or there is actually places where you are actually taking share against some of your
stronger competitors?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. You have to do both. And on the small business, the mom and pop, what's
interesting is that where those kind of businesses are thriving, and there's a lot of --
there is, Bentonville Arkansas, and there's businesses that are thriving here. But on
marketplace, our marketplace business in the ﬁrst quarter grew faster than our
eCommerce business. And so we're getting more and more sellers onto that
platform. And what we're doing with Walmart fulﬁllment services, we're making it
easier for them to get on and sell their goods. They don't have to develop all the
infrastructure, we have that and we're doing some of the same things in India and
other places like that.
So, I think there's a way for the small business to win in this as well. I certainly think
we're going to be one of the big winners in retail today, for a long, long time. And to
do that, you've got to beat the best of the best. And we know who those major
competitors are. And I feel -- again, I feel good about our strategy and our oﬀerings
going forward.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
A couple of rapid ﬁre ones. I think you've answered this before, but I'll say it anyway,
which is, how do you guys think about the proﬁtability path for eCommerce, areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Brandon Fletcherrevenues awesome, and are you going to keep accelerating it? It looks to us like the
proﬁtability is improving, maybe from not a great level to an improvement level, but
love any color on that kind of path towards accelerating proﬁtability?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We came into the year and we thought eCommerce losses would shrink in the
US They did in ﬁrst quarter. And everything that we've been saying needed to
happen, it's starting to happen. You've got to leverage ﬁxed in a better way and
we're seeing that happen. Once you get the technology in FC and the people in --
and eCommerce business, actually, once it gets started, will lever even more quickly
in a store business, it just takes a while to get there.
Contributed proﬁt margin, contribution margin is really, really important. And with
the mix of business that we're seeing, we're getting more brands in home and
apparel and higher margin business. We're seeing that contribution margin move
up. And once it gets to a point, again, it levers a lot more quickly. So, the underlying
things that need to happen for us to get to proﬁtability in eCommerce, it's
happening. It's not happening as fast as we would like. Has it been slower than we
thought? Yes. But I'm seeing a lot of positive things.
{BIO 19653159 <GO>}
Yeah. And we've said this before, one of the things for me in that whole division is
right out of the gate four or ﬁve years ago, when you did your ﬁrst drive-thru click-
and-collect in Bentonville, I saw my favorite basket, which was a kayak and some
snacks for the ﬂoat trip. And as soon as you get that available, and again, you may
order the kayak the day before, right and it comes overnight and ships on the truck.
But, when that basket happens, no one's going to (inaudible) ask proﬁtability. It's
going to be (inaudible). Two quick ones and then I have a unifying question that
we're asking to everybody. Are we entering a period of inﬂation or deﬂation with
regards to food? And I know that's just kind of a guesswork. And then, is that
diﬀerent than a general merchandise?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We're starting to see a little bit of inﬂation as we came into early March. The lack of
inﬂation to some degree was helped by us. What we had done in pricing over the
last three or four years, particularly in the food side. And so, we were keeping
inﬂation lower, maybe than it would have been normally and our price gaps are very,
very good versus competitors. People have been predicting inﬂation for a long time,
and they've been predicting higher interest rates for a long time. And it just -- it
hasn't happened. So, I'm not an economist. One would think with the stimulus
monies, you've seen that you would start seeing some inﬂation, and we will in
pockets, it'll be by diﬀerent categories. But, I think we're just going to have to be
prepared for whatever comes at us.

going to work. I don't know, maybe. You never know. I'll ask the uniﬁed question. As
you think through and beyond the pandemic, how do you expect your priorities to
shift, especially as they relate to cutting costs or increasing levels of investment?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think it's and. We've already talked about that, as we released earnings of Q1. There
are things that we've seen work with customers, whether it was before COVID, or
during this period of time that we're going to lean in, and we're going to lean in
hard that we think will beneﬁt us competitively in the long-term. And then, there's
places that we look at and say, I say the world's going to change a little bit. I don't
know why we need to keep doing X. And we're going to go after that in a smart way.
We're going to work diﬀerently, everybody's going to work diﬀerently than they did
