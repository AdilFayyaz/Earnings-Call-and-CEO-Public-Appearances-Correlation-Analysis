Well, good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for joining us Evercore ISI's
Autotech and AI Forum. My name is C.J. Muse, Semiconductor and Semiconductor
Equipment Analyst here at Evercore ISI. Very pleased to have NVIDIA with us today,
speciﬁcally Ali Kani, VP and General Manager of Automotive. We've got roughly 35
minutes to hear from Ali, he's going to present brieﬂy, and then we'll move to Q&A.
If you have any questions in the audience, please feel free to e-mail them to me, and
I will try to put them in. And with that, thank you, Ali, great to have you here, and I'll
turn it over to you.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here today. We can jump in. So these are
just going to be our forward-looking statements.
Okay. So just wanted to start by talking about our automotive strategy at NVIDIA.
And I think where we really diﬀerentiate ourselves is that, we're very focused on
building a platform that's open and modular, such that partners can work with us at
any level of the stack. So, we have some customers who just buy our computers in
the car and they built the full autonomous driving stack, do the training, simulation,
build their own AV application, and cockpit application themselves, and that's a
great partnership for us.
But we have cases where customers also ask us to build their autonomous driving
application, and do the training and simulation for them. And we design this stack in
a modular way such that you can actually pick and choose what you want from
NVIDIA. And the fact that we sort of build this stack end-to-end ourselves, makes our
product better across the stack.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21

Page 2 of 12And just to note that we also have customers who don't use our computers in the
car, but they work with us in the cloud for training and simulation. And so, having
that open and modular platform that happens to be end-to-end is really fundamental
to our strategy and a big reason of the success that NVIDIA's having in the
automotive business. Next slide.
So one of the things we do to make self-driving development easier for our partners
is we try to build a platform that makes it easy for people to build their own
applications. So even though we're building an autonomous driving application and
a cockpit application, many of our customers and actually most of our customers
build it themselves. And so we try to build a platform that is really attractive for those
partners. So we have a computer architecture and a sensor set that we create that
actually is designed to be functional, safe and secure. And we provide the
infrastructure and tools for an OEM to build their own AV application and cockpit
application. And the fact that we built the platform in this sort of open, modular way,
we design it to be upgradeable across generations.
It makes it so much easier for our partners to develop on our platform, we have
customers who were, for example, using the Xavier platform. And since our platform
is designed to be upgradeable, it's easy to take -- I'm sorry, a point computer and
upgraded from a Xavier computer, and we design that platform to be software
compatible. So the applications you build on Xavier can just run on Orin when you
get it. And designing the platform that way saves customers so much time and
wasted investment, right? And that's a big part of our strategy, is just make it easy for
people who want to build their own AV development. And the only reason why we
can do this is we're building the platform ourselves and we recognize those issues.
And so we try to enable the things that help us to develop faster to our partners in
the ecosystem.
Okay. So we talk about making the platform upgradable, the way I think about this is
similar to how Tesla builds their cars is, you could buy a Tesla with a hardware 2, but
then you can upgrade it with the hardware 2.5 and then you can upgrade it with a
hardware 3. Part of what we're doing is building this equivalent sort of TDP computer
form factor and TDP compatible computer that you can then just plug in from your
vehicle. And so we keep giving you these upgrades as an OEM. Take your Xavier
computer, upgrade it to Orin computer, upgraded to Atlan computer. And the pace
of innovation that NVIDIA oﬀers OEMs is really signiﬁcant. And because it's software
compatible, all the investment you make on us, on our Xavier platform can be pulled
over to the Orin platform. And this is why the ecosystem in our platform is growing,
because once you develop on our platform there's a lot of advantage for you to stay
on it, not just because the roadmap keeps getting better, but we make the platform
so easy to go from one generation to the next.
Okay. So once we move up into the application software, there's just a lot of work for
OEMs to do. And one of the areas that we're diﬀerentiated is, we have the full self-
driving application that's available for our partners. And so if OEM right now wants
to invest in electriﬁcation and the base vehicle OS, they can partner with us to do the
Parking application, the self-driving application, the end cap application for them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 12And this is more about, do OEMs want that help or not. But having that capability,
one gives us the opportunity to help OEMs in more ways than just a standard
component supplier. But it also -- all that learning that we have in developing this
application feeds into our next generation chip. And our chips are actually better
next generation, because we're delivering all this application where we realize, well,
if we put this into the chip, it will even be better for someone building a self-driving
computer next time. And so our products actually are increasingly sort of
diﬀerentiated for people who are actually building self-driving cars.
So we talk about that end-to-end ﬂow from training to simulation. The real
diﬀerentiator for anyone building AV in our mind, is the speed of that development
ﬂow. And the reason why I say this is building an ML ops development ﬂow that has
to be safe and secure has never been done in the industry. This isn't like you're
building software in a cluster or it's an Android tablet or iOS tablet, if you do
something wrong, it's okay, you just later do a software update and it can get better
over time. Building a self-driving computer, you have to make sure that it's safe and
secure. So you want to be able to test software in simulation before you roll it out to
the car. You want to be able to test the software in shadow mode inside the car
before you update it in the car to make sure you're not causing any negative
experiences for drivers. And to do that, you need a software development ﬂow that
has a bunch of interconnected AI leaks happening at the same time.
The way you build a map is a AI loop, you have to take data from the road, you need
to train networks oﬀ of that data, you need to build a map and then you need to OTA
it into the car. You take that mapping network, but you also feed that mapping
network into your perception network for the car, because a map is actually a good
way to train your path reception network. And so those loops are interconnected,
and everything you're doing also gets tested in a single loop as well as a self-driving
loop, and making that self-driving loop essentially be identical to that digital twin
simulator is a lot of work. How you build that software development ﬂow such that all
these pieces are interconnected safe and secure and actually designed so that you
could quickly ﬁnd an issue, root cause it, ﬁx it.
And then OTA it in a car, the speed of doing that is a core value proposition for
anyone building autonomous driving software. And that's where we're investing as a
company, is that end-to-end ﬂow. We have a DGX system that we sell to help people
with training. We have constellation systems that we help people with simulation,
and we have the AV software. All of those things have to intertwine together to form
a software development ﬂow that's eﬃcient. That's where we're focused on
innovating and diﬀerentiating, and I really believe that that actually is the core source
of advantage for one AV company versus another.
So, I think here we just wanted to point out the NVIDIA ecosystem is going through
signiﬁcant growth. There's traditional OEM's, like a Mercedes, and a Volvo, and a
Hyundai; but there's a whole slew of NEVs [ph] most of which were building a car the
way you would want to build it, if you could reimagine what a future car would be.
Most -- all of those companies are developing on the NVIDIA platform, whether it's
Neo, the Auto, X Pang, Farady Futures. And then all those companies are alsoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 12Q - C.J. Muse
A - Ali Kanibuilding robotaxis, or autonomous trucks, vast majority of them are also developing
on our platform. And I think that ecosystem is also a source of advantage. And the
reason is, is when people develop on our platform, we learn from them. They tell us,
hey, there's something here that you could do next time. Can you make your
software better in this way? Could you make your hardware better in this way?
And we take those learning's and we incorporate them into our roadmap. And I'm
particularly proud of the fact that there's hundreds of companies developing AV and
it's not just an OEM strategy, it's a platform strategy. This slide show you guys OEM
partners develop on platform. But we actually just work with camera vendors and
radar and lidar and mapping partners and Tier 2s, Tier 3s, all of those OEMs, all
those ISVs and startups building software or hardware vendors in ecosystems,
they're also bringing up their products on our developer platform. And we think
that's great, it's not -- we're not just trying to service OEMs.Anyone's building an
application or a product that connects to our computer, we want to work with them
to make their application run best on our platform or their sensor work best on our
platform. And I think that's a core part of our advantage.
We always talk to you guys about it, but I wanted to give you guys the background of
why we do it and why we think it really helps us diﬀerentiate. And I think we've
mentioned this before, but our pipeline is growing and it's across the board. It's not
just passenger vehicles, its robotaxis, its trucks. And it's not just in terms of hardware,
right, there's customers who now increasingly want to work with us on software. And
so when we put all those options together, our pipeline is growing signiﬁcantly, we
have more than $8 billion pipeline now.
Questions And Answers
(Question And Answer)
Great. Ali, thank you for the presentation. I guess to start, I'd love to kind of level set
where were NVIDIA's automotive business is today, $500 million plus in ﬁscal '21, to
what you kind of see in the future, particularly as you look at that pipeline of $8
billion extending out to ﬁscal '27. So, is there a way where we can kind of level set
what is kind of legacy infotainment, smart cockpit, L2 plus autopilot other? And how
we should kind of see that ramping in the coming years?
Yeah, I mean, we mentioned legacy infotainment is less than a third of our business
and will continue to dwindle away, and combined with smart cockpit together legacy
infotainment, smart cockpit is a little over half of our business today. But I think what
you'll ﬁnd is that the mix of AV and self-driving will ramp and grow over time, we'll
start to see an inﬂection later next year and will really try to scale it in calendar year
'23 and '24.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 12Q - C.J. Muse
A - Ali Kani
Q - C.J. Muse
A - Ali KaniAnd in terms of that inﬂection in this second half of '22, what's principally driving that
conﬁdence?
It's really just the wins we've announced. There are a good number of NAVs that
have announced products that go to production in 2022. Lot of those China NAVs
we talked about, as well as the emerging ramp of a couple OEMs, both Volvo, we've
announced is going to be going to production in 2022, and SAIC. So as all of those
vehicles start to ramp up, our business is going to start to see that inﬂection later
next year, and then you'll really start to hit as they ramp up in '23 and '24.
Very helpful. I guess just to take a step back, trying to get my arms around it, the
hardware compute side of things. At the heart of NVIDIA is compute, although
clearly software is becoming bigger and bigger part of the company, but we would
love to hear the beneﬁts of Orin coming into production in '22. And then I guess
perhaps more importantly, we drive Atlan scheduled to come online in 2024, what
that roadmap will be able to support?
So, I mean, I think, ﬁrst let me say, I think Orin is a home run. I mean, I think that just
the amount of traction and success we've had with Orin is far larger than what we
have with Xavier, and we're really excited about the product. And I think it's because
the industry has started to truly appreciate something we've been preaching for a
long time is you really should build a software-deﬁned computer in the car. It's not
just easier for OEMs to update and support and upgrade that experience over time.
But if you think of it in terms of software and services business, it's transformative, it
transforms the business model of OEMs.
And now that we have all these supply shortages in the chip industry, OEMs also
realized that it's a better strategy for their supply management. So there's so many
fundamental areas that a software-deﬁned computer like Orin unlocks for OEMs, I
mean, I think that's what's driving the success. And so now when you talk about
Atlan, when you put our strategy together is, is let's make sure the platform is
compatible. Let's build an Atlan computer that's one factor and power compatible to
Orin and let's build our software stack such that the APIs that people develop on is
compatible from one generation to the next.
Now you see how exciting for us Atlan is because we let our customers upgrade
their vehicles but not have to throw away their software. And so what you can ﬁnd is,
is faster generation advancements from OEMs, whereas before they build one
architecture, you have to keep it for six to eight years, because they don't want to
change the architecture. But our products are architecture compatible, and so what
they can really do is just unlock new features and functionality, because there's a
form factor and architecture compatible upgrade available with Atlan.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21

A - Ali KaniHelpful. I guess maybe to expand on that, IAA Mobility. You focused on speed of
development ﬂow as a key diﬀerentiator for the AV market. You spoke to it again
today. I was hoping maybe you could dig a little bit deeper into the meaning of that?
Is that strictly on the hardware side, software side? Does it play a role in how your
customers are choosing kind of Tier 1, Tier 2 Tier 3 suppliers? Would love to hear, I
guess, more thoughts around speed and how that is so vital for this emerging
market.
Okay. So let me sort of explain what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the speed of
an AV development ﬂow. And what I mean by that is, let's just take Tesla as an
example. We've been reading about how there have been all these accidents that
Tesla's have. If you go analyze those accidents, there's more than 10 of them, almost
every one of them is an emergency vehicle with its sirens on. It's a parked
emergency vehicle, right, every one of them is a parked emergency vehicle, it could
be a ambulance, it could be a police car. But every single case, it's a parked
emergency vehicle and the car just hits it.
And the ﬁrst accident was 2.5 years ago and the most recent one was a couple of
months ago. And so -- and there is no existing proof of any company who is building
AV code, autonomous driving code that they upgrade and update that experience
over the life of the car in a safe and secure way. Tesla is doing that, Tesla is doing
OTAs, right? But I'm saying, there's all these accidents over the last 2.5 years, they
are the same accident, and it's still not ﬁxed in their cars. So the speed of the
developed ﬂow talks about how do you build a self-driving software stack that when
you ﬁnd an issue you actually can root cause it, truly root cause it, there are so many
things in a self-driving vehicle stack. What was the problem that caused that
accident? How do you go solve that problem?
Sometimes you need to go get new data, train a new network for that data, test it,
and then put it in the car, test it in shadow mode, and then OTA it in the car. How
long does it take you to go through that loop? And that capability and expertise is
hard because no one has done it for AI code when safety and security is also critical.
And what I'm saying is, look at the challenge Tesla's has doing it. Even though they
give us OTAs, I have to -- they give us OTAs, the car actually does drive better. But
they don't solve all the problems, there's actually bugs that they still haven't root
caused and ﬁxed. And the fact that it's taken 2.5 years is really not acceptable for a
self-driving car because people's lives are at stake.
And so this ﬂow, this development ﬂow, building it in a way that you can actually do
this eﬃciently requires an understanding of the infrastructure and tools needed for a
new kind of software development. There's very few companies in the world who
actually even know how to do that. And for NVIDIA it's something very unique, right,
is that all these companies that are training their AI networks, they're training them
on DGX systems. And then we've built our own simulator based on Omniverse, toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Q - C.J. Muse
A - Ali Kanimake it such that when you simulate AV, it's actually truly accurate, you could actually
train networks on simulated objects that we build.
You can't do that on like an open GL simulator, you have to build a new kind of
simulator. That's a part of the software development ﬂow and you need to reinvent
and recreate a development ﬂow built for AV driving, and that's why I say it's so hard.
And having the expertise to do that is really not something possible for many OEM's
and Tier 1s. And so it's really good to partner there and sort of build up that
expertise. And I think that's where we really try to diﬀerentiate with our partners.
So you spoke a bit around working with Tier 2s, Tier 3s, and I guess was curious to
hear your thoughts around what you think the landscape will look like when we are
full autonomous. Is this a world where you're going to be kind of partnering with
best of breed kind of radar or lidar or vision and coming together with a full kind of
hardware solution and force maybe Tier 1s or 2s to become more specialized or how
do you see kind of a future here?
I think for us the key is, we really want to design our platform to be open and
modular, so that if an OEM and a Tier 1 wants to develop their application in their
own ways, they can. And so for example, there are cases like Genesect, and
Genesect is like Tier 2 that builds the self-driving application for Volvo. And so we
just let them build the self-driving application on our platform and they pick what
they want, what sensors, what radar they develop the self-driving applications
themselves, and we support them in that way. So our platform is open as, pick your
own sensors, pick your own AI algorithms, either in some cases partner with a Tier 3
or build it all yourself if you're the Tier 2. They can make all those decisions and
we're very supportive of it.
So -- and then we just have other cases where some OEMs might want a little bit
more support from us. And so this is why I say, our platform is designed to be
modular and open. The ﬁrst example is, we're open if you want to build most of it
yourself. But it's modular such that if, let's say, in the case of Mercedes-Benz, you
actually want us to give you the self-driving application. So then we kind of sort of
help inform them then, let's we want to invest on these sensors and we'll build that
software so we kind of are more involved in what happens. But the platform is
designed to be modular such that it really depends on the OEMs.
So I don't think one way is the right way and the other way is the wrong way. I
actually feel like it's just based on, where does an OEM want to invest. Some OEMs
should maybe focus on electriﬁcation in core OS today, and worry about self-driving
application development maybe later or maybe never, right? And so we try to have a
solution from them. But if you actually can do it, I think, we're perfectly ﬁne saying, let
the Tier 2 and the Tier 3 and the Tier 1 deﬁne what they want to do and just develop
our platform, and I think that's great business and we want to make sure you can
support those customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21

Q - C.J. Muse
A - Ali KaniHelpful. A lot of excitement around your partnership with Mercedes-Benz. So curious
if there's any sort of update that you can share in terms of recent activity here and
timing of ramp with drive AGX?
I mean, I think there's no update, I think it's just we're working hard together. It's a
great partnership. We are trying to build software-deﬁned vehicle that's fully
upgradeable over the life of the car. We think it's going to have some of the richest
parking and self-driving applications in the industry. And we're designing at such
that we're going to make it better, customer is going to buy the car, but what the car
can do after it goes oﬀ, that lot will improve over the life of the car. So I think it's a
really exciting partnership and we're really excited to be working with them beyond
it.
And I guess more broadly speaking, what are the most critical designs that we
should be watching perhaps from a magnitude of revenue contribution perspective
over the next ﬁve years?
Well, let me sort of break it out in a few areas. I think there's -- of course, the
Mercedes-Benz engagement is something you should look at. It's going to kick-in in
the back half of that range, right, when a car goes to production in 2024, does take
years to ramp into the full 2.5 million vehicles that they have in their ﬂeet, but it will
ramp into an entire ﬂeet.
And then I think you have some OEM designs, traditional branded designs from
Volvo and SAIC that will also be ramping and will be signiﬁcant. Then I would say,
there's a couple buckets that you should sort of put together, there's all these NAVs
and they ramp starting next year. And there's a lot of cars that they're selling and
there's multiple computers in their car, right? Neo announced four Orin's per
vehicle, and many of the others are multiple Orin's per vehicle. And so once all of
that scales up, it's a sizable and attractive business that we'll be scaling. And then
ﬁnally, it's all those self-driving vehicles. If you look at robotaxis and you look at self
driving trucks, almost all of them are developing on our platform and that is going to
kick in and the volume when you put all of the ecosystem together, and the ASPs of
course for robotaxi or not, they're not buying a single Orin, they are buying like
multiple discrete GPUs, our highest and ampere GPUs.
So there's in some cases more than $10,000 with content per robotaxi for NVIDIA.
And when you take that and you multiply it by a large volume base, I think that's
another big sort of inﬂection point that you'll see in the years to come. So I think all
of those will ramp in this time frame that you're saying. And that's why the pipeline
actually is growing and healthy.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21

A - Ali Kani
Q - C.J. Muse
A - Ali KaniHelpful. I know Jetson has a focus on driving recurring revenues, and just curious,
obviously, there's a hardware and software aspect to your focus. But is there a
priority as you think about pricing to kind of driving that razor blade model? Or are
you more kind of indiﬀerent in terms of pricing hardware versus software?
Yes. I mean, I think we just tried at charge based on the value we think we're
bringing to the table. So we just think of it like that. And I think there's recurring
revenues in multiple ways. Of course, if you build an application and when a
customer upgrades a feature or a function after they buy the car, then there's
recurring revenues from that.
But even when we don't build an application, when you're building a production
vehicle that has to be safe and secure, we need to maintain that release over the life
of the car, and so there's fees there. Every OEM that goes to production with safe
code, we almost need to branch that code for them and give them a stable branch.
And so there's recurring revenues there as well for all our customers. And so I think
that recurring revenue stream based on software and support will pick up as both
the software application customers as well as just traditional chip in OS customers
go to production, because we'll need to continue to maintain and support those
vehicles for the life of those cars.
Helpful. I guess maybe would love to hear your perspective on the competitive
landscape, obviously into Mobileye, you now have Qualcomm with being here. How
do you kind of see -- how do you kind of see things and how do you see things
evolving over the next 5, 10 years?
I mean, I think the market has a good number of competitors who are capable, who
have reasonably good strategies. And so I feel like it's good for the industry. There's
good options, good choice. And we just try to diﬀerentiate with our strategy, right?
Like we're unique in that ﬁrst our platform is open. You can develop on our platform
if you're not an OEM, you can just be a Tier 2 and Tier 3. And we take all those
learnings and we improve the software and the hardware in the next-generation
because of those engagements.
And the second is that we really do have solutions on the infrastructure side. And like
I said that back and ﬂow we think is actually a key diﬀerentiator for anyone building
autonomous driving. So helping customers with a training solution or a simulation
solution that's kind of unique to NVIDIA. And so having that end-to-end platform,
especially with diﬀerentiation and infrastructure, really helps us diﬀerentiate. And
then we have cases where customers want to build the self-driving application in
some more traditional way. You mentioned (Inaudible) and Mobileye use. Their
approach is a little bit more NCAP ﬁxed-function CV based AV. Our approach is aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21

Q - C.J. Muse

Q - C.J. Muselittle bit more deep learning, software deﬁned computer. We design our platform to
be programmable and be very heavy on deep learning, and it's diﬀerent than
building an NCAP chip, it's very ﬁxed function.
I've never seen a Mobileye product be OTAed in its life, they've been in production
for so many years. They'll try to OTA car one day, but I'm just saying it wasn't built to
be software programmable and software deﬁned. It's more of a DSP type
architecture. So we're trying to approach it in a diﬀerent way. And so I think where
we're investing and where we're diﬀerentiated are the places that OEMs are going,
and it's the places they seek diﬀerentiation. So I really like our positioning. And I
think the results show with all the wins we've been announcing.
You haven't seen too many new wins from other people, right? Like it's pretty much
been a bunch of NVIDIA wins. The one area where I think you'll see more
competition is in Level 4, Level 5. I think Mobileye will have some Level 4, Level 5
wins. But our strategies a little bit diﬀerent, there is we want the Zoox's, and the
Cruise's and the Aurora's, those guys to sort of be the leaders in that industry, and
they clearly are. And I think what Mobileye does is they go to people who can't build
it and they just kind of build on the platform. And our strategy will be more Hyperion
there, we'll give you the hardware platform then you build the application, you build
the AV.
I think our strategy is the right one for robotaxi in this cycle. And then longer-term,
we may have an AV solution it can help people on that space, right? It just takes time,
we're focused on L2 and L3 today, but L4 and L5 can come in the future.
So we've got roughly two minutes left. So I will leave that time to you in terms of
perhaps summarizing or if I fail to ask anything that you think is important and
relevant, and let you kind of conclude our half-hour with investors. Can you hear me?
I don't think Ali can hear you.

Q - C.J. MuseSo we've got a minute left. I was just going to turn it over to you to either share
something that we didn't touch on, that you think is important or perhaps, just give a
quick summary and ending thoughts.
No. I mean, I think you've asked really good questions and I think you covered most
of the things. I mean, I think the one thing I'll say is that, the automotive industry right
now, the amount of areas that we see fundamental transformation are signiﬁcant. It's
not just in self-driving cars, it's also in electriﬁcation.
And I think one thing I just wanted to say is, I think one area we haven't yet seen
signiﬁcant investment, which I think is going to be exciting is inside the cockpit.
Today a cockpit experience is about cluster and entertainment, those are legacy
applications and you can meet those needs with multiple solutions. But long-term,
the experience in the car, it's going to be kind of like your concierge. The AV is like
your chauﬀeur, driving the car for you, but you actually will have a concierge in a car
that's extremely intelligent and personalized to what you like to do, and you can
interact with it, you can talk to it, you can enjoy shows, you can do video
conferencing. The amount of AI that's needed to enable a true concierge experience
is signiﬁcant and we're not yet seeing that in the car. And I think that that's an area
where we'll see more innovation longer term.
And that also is an area where NVIDIA is unique in being able to provide some of
those experience, because it's not self-driving software, it's like AI software, it's video
conferencing software, speech, ASR, all those kinds of technologies and putting
them together with driver monitoring and document monitoring and fusing it with
the AV experience outside the car such that if maybe your child is about to get out of
the car and there's a car coming from behind you to not let that happen or if you're
about to leave a car and you might have left your purse or your laptop for the
concierge to tell you, that your wallet or your purse is in the back and do you want to
leave it in the car. So much innovation is possible by fusion -- fusing AV with AI inside
the car, and I think that's going to be an area for diﬀerentiation long-term that we're
excited to work on today, we don't have success to mention yet, but I think it'll be an
area where we're going to have some exciting opportunities long-term.
Can I get your Jetson's oven inside my car? Well, Ali, thank you so much for today.
It's always great to spend time with you. So thank you and wish you great health, and
will close there.
Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
You're on.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-21
