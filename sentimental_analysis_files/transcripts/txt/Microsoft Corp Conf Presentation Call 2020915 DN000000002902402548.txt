Good afternoon everybody, and thank you for attending Deutsche Bank's Virtual
Technology Conference. My name is Taylor McGinnis, and I'm one of the software
analysts here at Deutsche Bank. We are ending a great lineup of keynotes on a high
note with Tom Keane, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President of Azure. Tom, thanks for
joining, and great to have you here.
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Very well, thank you for having me.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Perfect. And before I begin with Q&A, I would just like to remind everybody that you
can submit a question via the chat box on the left side of the screen. So with that,
let's get started. Tom, I believe that you've held several diﬀerent roles at Microsoft
over the years and have been a part of the Azure team for quite some time. So to
start, it might be helpful for the audience if you give a quick introduction of yourself
and current role at Microsoft.
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah. absolutely. And again, Taylor, thanks for having me. So I sit in the engineering
team for our cloud computing division at Microsoft, and I'm responsible for all of our
cloud computing infrastructure around the world. So that's all of the places that we
are driving the expansion of our cloud through data centers, the underlying
engineering that we're doing to make our cloud work for our most sophisticated
customers across the industry, the solutions that we're building for industry and that
ranges from commercial industry through to government.
Prior to working in the Azure team, I was involved in standing up the Oﬃce 365
cloud service. And prior to that, I worked on a number of our server products. SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Taylor McGinnisover the last 20 years, I've been busy at Microsoft doing a whole bunch of fun and
exciting things.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Perfect. That's a great introduction. So we as well as many others listening in have
been following this team closely for several years now. But I believe this is the ﬁrst
time that Azure business has faced a downturn or a more challenging environment.
So at a high level to start, based on your recent conversations with customers, can
you share the key trends within Azure and how these conversations have evolved
relative to the past few quarters? Are you noticing any signiﬁcant shifts in the type of
workloads or deal momentum that would be interesting to ﬂag to the group?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah. Look, it's a great place to start. And obviously, 2020 has been a pretty
incredible year in terms of the diﬀerent environmental factors. Satya has described
what we've seen very well, which is we saw two years of digital transformation occur
in the ﬁrst two months of COVID-19. And what has become very clear as we've
moved through 2020, is that a business with a digital foundation with that digital
technology in place has been more resilient and able to handle the challenges that
COVID-19 has brought on.
As we look at the digital transformation that's been occurring, it's very clear that
we've seen an acceleration from customers as remote work has initially provided a
mechanism that has allowed people to, of course, continue operating and then that
is growing as people expect more capabilities to be available wherever they are
working from.
And what we've observed at Microsoft with our cloud computing adoption is that
COVID has broken down some of those concerns that may have existed inside an
organization around, if a particular workload was ready for cloud or if a particular
scenario could be performed remotely, and we've seen many customers begin to,
for example, stand up, of course, Teams and other collaboration technology,
Windows Virtual Desktop, which is a solution that allows a customer to run Windows
10 in the cloud. And then digitally enabling a set of applications and connections to
stand up their business. So really, what we've seen is not just accelerated adoption
from a large set of customers, but also breaking down some of those historical
concerns or accelerating plans that they already had in place to make use of cloud.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Okay. And from what we're hearing verticals like e-commerce and communications
are seeing greater demand and may drive more cloud usage, while others in travel
or hospitality, may be looking to downsize. So ﬁrst, what is the net of this? And how
durable is existing consumption growth in this environment, given that these pricing
models have never really been tested at this scale in a downturn. So how hard -- how
easy or hard is it to scale workloads up and down?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Page 3 of 15Tom Keane
Taylor McGinnis
Tom Keane{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah. We've seen some very interesting behavior from customers, and I'll give you a
couple of diﬀerent examples to make this real.
First of all, obviously, COVID has resulted in a lot of customers needing to make their
services available to their customers in a digital mechanism. And by building these
new applications or cloud-enabling existing applications, that has, of course,
resulted in additional usage of Azure. What we've also seen that was initially a little
bit surprising, but then, in fact, became quite obvious, was an acceleration from
customers on plans that they had to move workloads to the cloud as a way of saving
money. For example, many customers that we've been working with, we have
created plans to move large workloads over to the cloud, and those plans were on
short to medium-term horizon.
And these are workloads like SAP, high-performance computing and other places
where an organization may have invested heavy CapEx in an on-premise
infrastructure. What we've actually observed during COVID is even in industries
where there may be a structural downturn that their cloud plans have actually
accelerated. And so they're now moving more aggressively into cloud as a way to
reduce their on-premise spend and then use the ﬂexibility that cloud provides to
scale their workloads up and down. And so whilst there may be a downturn in the
immediate term for certain industries, other industries are, in fact, accelerating. And
so we're capturing both the up and the down here across the various diﬀerent
workloads.
The other trend that I'll call out, and we'll certainly, I'm sure, talk more about this, is
the move of Tier 1 workloads to cloud. What COVID has shown is that cloud is
resilient. We've become eﬀectively the critical infrastructure that underlines many
positive society right now. And that has given a lot of customers' conﬁdence to move
their most sophisticated workloads, their most important workloads over to cloud.
And these Tier 1 workloads that are highly available that are resilient that power a
business, customers are feeling more comfortable in standing up, and we're seeing
that in diﬀerent industries like ﬁnancial services and sovereign wealth funds and
others who are now using our cloud in diﬀerent ways as a result of the conﬁdence
that they've built in 2020.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Yeah, I'd love to talk about what you're seeing with those Tier 1 workloads and we'll
talk about that a little bit later on. But on this topic secondly, are you experiencing
any impacts from customers looking to optimize their consumption resources in an
eﬀort to save money during this time? And just wondering if you can elaborate the
impact that that's having on Azure growth?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15Taylor McGinnis
Tom KeaneYeah. So of course, the advantage of cloud is that we allow customers to
continuously optimize. And we want to help customers save money, use resources
more eﬃciently and ensure that their infrastructure is set up in the right way. And we
continue daily to be helping customers use cloud in the most eﬃcient way. And
there's absolutely customers who have been able to use cloud to save on their
spend and to conﬁgure their workloads in such a way that they're more ﬁnancially in
line with their expectations.
What we've also seen is that, as I mentioned earlier, digital businesses are providing
signiﬁcantly more agility and robustness. And as such, this is actually driving
increased usage of cloud. And so what our customers are doing is moving more
workloads. And with that, their expectations continue to grow. So, these workloads
that they're moving are often more highly available, have higher resiliency
expectations. And as I mentioned before, some of these Tier 1 workloads. And this, of
course, is making use of all of the diﬀerent aspects of our cloud. So bottom line is,
yes, we're, of course, continually helping customers optimize their usage of
resources, but we're also staying laser-focused on adoption, which is the leading
indicator of success and that focus on adoption and that partnership with customers
is allowing them to move their more important workloads.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Understood. So last quarter, Microsoft again talked about continued strength in
customers signing large long-term Azure contracts. Our initial ﬁeld work suggested
that the COVID environment may have led to a slowing of deal activity and
migrations. But this does not seem to have materialized in any signiﬁcant way. And
it's interesting even to the commentary that you talked about an acceleration in
terms of Tier 1 migration. So, I'd love to get your thoughts there.
So in what ways, I guess, could these checks have been wrong? And how would you
characterize customers' priorities in today's environment and the impact that's
having on Azure's business?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah, this is obviously a place where I work a lot with customers and talk with
customers every day. And I think it's worth explaining our value system, which is that
we have always looked at a customer relationship as a partnership. And the
partnership is 100% focused on joint success, which is getting that customer
adopted and using the technology to go and power their business and to optimize
their internal cost structures. One of the things that we've been doing to ensure that
we're providing the highest levels of understanding for diﬀerent customers in
diﬀerent industries and the highest levels of value is driving industry-speciﬁc
investments. And this oﬀers customers in diﬀerent industries, prepackaged solutions,
products and capabilities that meet their speciﬁc needs.
Now, of course, we'll continue, and Satya and Amy Hood, our CFO, have been clear
on how we help customers through migrations, ﬂexible contractual models. But the
consumption trends that we have seen a proof point that the deals are non-linear.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 15Taylor McGinnis
Tom Keane
Taylor McGinnisAnd the consumption models gives them a lot of ﬂexibility. And so we are hyper-
focused on building the partnership with our customers and helping them adopt
and move to cloud.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
That makes sense. And I'd love to dive into this topic of partnering with customers
and helping them facilitate some of these migrations. So since there can be
signiﬁcant implementation and re-architecting costs associated with migrations to
Microsoft oﬀering -- are you guys oﬀering any resources or ﬁnancial ﬂexibility in
terms of contract or payment terms to help facilitate some of the movement from on-
premise to the cloud in this environment? And then maybe on a similar note, I know
that Microsoft has talked about the possibility for customers to prefer pay-as-you-go
contracts over a large multiyear Azure commitment given the current uncertainty? So
have you seen any material shifts there?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
So as we partner with customers, we are hyper-focused on enabling them to build
their cloud foundation. One of the elements of that digital foundation is often their
cloud control plane. And building this foundation allows them to implement the
security, privacy, compliance policies in such a way that as their organization makes
use of cloud, all of their diﬀerent business requirements, their compliance
requirements and even their cost requirements are factored into that digital
foundation.
This then gives an organization conﬁdence that they can make use of cloud inside
their own boundaries. And those boundaries can be ﬁnancial. We're absolutely then
seeing adoption around that with, as I mentioned earlier, some of these Tier 1
workloads. And these Tier 1 workloads are broadening into diﬀerent industries. An
example is recently, we've announced a lot of work that we're doing around 5G
connectivity. And we've done a number of acquisitions to support that technology
that allow the core of some of the communications infrastructure to be running on
top of Azure. This opens up, of course, more total addressable market. And then with
that, we have a whole range of diﬀerent options in which customers can consume.
And as part of that partnership, we are ﬂexible on the diﬀerent ways in which
customers want to work with us. Focus on adoption is that leading indicator of
success.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Got it. And then I'd love to dive into the guide and some of the ﬁnancials. So the
Intelligent Cloud guide for Microsoft September-end quarter implies less
moderation in the Azure growth rate than we saw in the July-end quarter. So, how
much of this is driven by consumption trends normalizing as customers adjust to the
COVID landscape? And are migrations returning to pre-COVID levels at all or no,
we're still not there yet?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Tom Keane{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Look, we're hyper-focused on adoption every single day. And as I look at the
interactions that I'm having with customers, we're seeing large workloads moving to
cloud, be then cloud-native or cloud migrations. For example, we've talked a lot
about the work that we're doing with UBS, the Swiss investment bank. And they've
been moving key workloads over to the cloud as well as building cloud-native
workloads in complex areas like risk management. We've done a lot of work that
we've talked publicly about with Chevron, and that's allowed Chevron as they do
their work in energy eﬃciency and green energy to make use of cloud for their
digital foundation as well as for new applications that they're building that allow
them to open up into new areas of their business.
We've done work in government. The Veterans Administration, for example, has
been able to further build bridges to serve veterans in the United States by making
use of digital technology and then elastically scaling those applications, matching
patients to doctors more eﬃciently. And then as a result, reducing the risk and some
of the challenges that COVID provides.
So those three examples are examples where those organizations are continuing to
migrate at scale, once they've put in place, that digital foundation, that control plane.
And then we're also building cloud-native applications as their businesses and the
services that they provide to citizens continue to evolve. So, we're really continuing
to see demand from across both dimensions.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
And on this topic, any thoughts you can share on what the shape of a full recovery
might look like for Azure throughout this year and into next?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
I think for us, we are hyper-focused on helping customers in all industries adopt to
cloud. And that starts, as I mentioned, with that control plane foundation. And then
as we work with customers across diﬀerent industries, that's about ensuring that
cloud is there as their digital foundation for their existing business as well as the
foundation for their future business. So one of the hyper focused areas for us has
been the work that we're doing around data and understanding the diﬀerent
schemas of data that each industry is using.
We're now, for example, providing 100-plus diﬀerent solutions for customers in retail,
in consumer goods, in healthcare that allow our data products to natively
understand diﬀerent industries. So, this gives customers conﬁdence to move their
data into the cloud, knowing that the cloud understands their respective industry
and then allows them to go and build on cloud more industry-aware applications
very easily and make use of new technology like predictive analytics or insights and
visualization.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Taylor McGinnis
Tom KeaneSo as we look at that, each customer is a little diﬀerent, and each industry is a little
diﬀerent. But it's very clear that many industries are growing at an incredibly rapid
pace. And that pace has only accelerated in 2020. Obviously, in retail, the use of
cloud computing as people move to online shopping has been signiﬁcant, and
we've spoken publicly about the work that we do with Walmart to allow them to
elastically scale and grow based on their business needs.
Similarly, in Europe, we've talked about the partnership we have with H&M. In areas
like ﬁnancial services, as the interaction points become diﬀerent, we're using our
cloud to allow them to use high-performance computing to eﬀectively decouple
some of the constraints or places that they may have historically been compute
constrained. And we're even now moving into new segments in areas like space,
where we're making use of overhead imagery to help farmers be more eﬃcient or in
the United States to help the Department of Agriculture understand environmental
patterns.
So all of this is to say that we're seeing a lot of growth from a lot of diﬀerent
industries and that things remain very constant and consistent for us.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
That's interesting. Thanks for sharing that. And now I want to switch gears. I'd love to
get your thoughts on the internal data center eﬃciencies that Microsoft is realizing,
which, in turn, of course, is helping to drive really strong gross margin improvement
in Azure. Last quarter, Microsoft mentioned extending the server and networking
equipment useful life from four years -- sorry, to four years, up from three and two
years, respectively. So can you provide some color on what is driving that? And what
opportunities you still have for eﬃciency gains?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah. So obviously, COVID and as we've gone through this two years of digital
transformation in two months has provided us with a very positive problem of a
tremendous amount of demand. So we've been incredibly focused on our
customers and ensuring that they have the resources that they need in order to be
successful.
As we look at our cloud computing infrastructure, we're continuing to optimize. And
as COVID show that there was very strong demand in a very short period of time.
And of course, at Microsoft, this is not just inside the Azure business that we provide
resources to customers but this is also with the resources that built on top of Azure
inside of Microsoft.
For example, Microsoft Teams, communication and collaboration experience is built
on top of Azure. And so the enormous growth that we saw on Teams was a result of
being able to expand the Azure platform and drive eﬃciencies into it in real time.
The physical elements of cloud don't move overnight. The software literally can. And
what we saw during the initial months of COVID was Azure making signiﬁcantFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 15Taylor McGinnis
Tom Keaneimprovements to allow Teams to scale to meet that ﬁrst wave of demand that came
from COVID.
As we look inside the data center, we're constantly innovating and driving
improvement. And that's based not just on supporting customers and their ongoing
demand and moving faster to support that demand, there's also economic as well as
physical advantages to us. For example, we've talked a lot about the use of green
energy and energy cells as a way of driving innovation in how we consume power as
well as removing the dependency. Just yesterday, we announced publicly that we've
brought up from the seaﬂoor in Scotland from 110 feet underwater, our underwater
data center. And whilst that may seem like a crazy idea, we've actually seen
phenomenal viability in some of these concepts that we've been driving out of
research, which has just been nothing short of incredible to see.
And so we continue to drive eﬃciencies into the data center all over the world. And
then we continue to grow that footprint in support of customers and the key thing
here is this is happening not just across the software, it's happening across the
hardware as well and then across the physical environment in which the data centers
reside.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Right. So are there any other interesting examples in addition to what you just
mentioned that you guys have been public about in terms of technologies that are
helping to drive eﬃciencies. And the outcome that, that has when Windows are
actually implemented?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, one theme that I think is really important to touch on, especially during
COVID, is that of cyber sovereignty. Microsoft for a long time has ﬁrmly believed -- in
fact, from our inception, we believe in the needs of enterprises. And one of the clear
needs of enterprises, both commercial enterprises, as well as government is cyber
sovereignty.
During COVID, many countries around the world and many multinationals have had
to think a lot more about their sovereignty. Where do their goods come from?
Where is their supply chain? Where is their data stored? And in line with this strong
belief in the importance of cyber sovereignty, we've been building out data centers
around the world. Today, Azure resides in 21 diﬀerent countries. And over the last six
months, you've seen us make announcements to expand that cloud into even more
countries.
We've seen announcements that we've made publicly around building, for example,
in places like Mexico. We're expanding further in Europe into locations such as Italy
or expansions in the Asia Paciﬁc region and even growth in Africa and other
emerging markets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 15Taylor McGinnis
Tom KeaneAnd so certainly, the cyber sovereignty has allowed us to both grow our existing
footprint with some of the eﬃciencies that I described. And then also grow our cloud
around the world for customers who deeply value that data residency and that cyber
sovereignty. And this then gives us a way to be more ﬂexible to be closer to where
our customers want their capabilities and their capacity and to meet their local rules
and regulations, which is super important as we go and serve restricted markets like
government, ﬁnancial services, health, life sciences and increasingly now, even
supply chain and manufacturing. So that's another place where the innovations that
we've made in economics on the back end, allow us to more eﬃciently and
eﬀectively go and scale globally to meet that cyber sovereignty requirement.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Yeah, I want to press on this a little bit further, and there's probably some overlap in
terms of the questions that I'm about to ask and what you just mentioned. But let's
dig a little bit further on data center expansion. So in the ﬁrst couple of months post
COVID, the spike in usage across certain workloads and in certain geographies,
reportedly led to some data center outages. And if we look last quarter, CapEx
spend increased signiﬁcantly and the Q1 guided for similar levels of spend. So how
are you thinking about ensuring that there is suﬃcient capacity, I guess, to meet
these growing cloud needs? I'm sure some of it has to do with what you're talking
about, the technology enhancements that you guys have had and making sure data
is closer to the customer. But how do you weigh decisions around expansions in a
new data center region versus increasing footprint of existing regions?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah. Look, there's multiple parts to that, and we'll talk through each of them. I mean,
ﬁrst of all, we're incredibly focused on ensuring that our customers can use cloud to
grow and scale. COVID was, of course, an unpredictable event. But as we saw with
Microsoft Teams, as an example, our cloud was able to scale literally overnight and
grow at levels that nothing else has ever represented or being seen from customers
around the world. The fact that we had a global cloud infrastructure allowed us to
scale through that in an incredible way. What we've also done to ensure that our
customers can grow is focus ﬁrst, with our customers in some of the most critical
industries, justice and public safety, police force as an example, human life and other
critical workloads, and we've prioritized and focused on them.
There are some lessons that we learned in terms of providing additional capacity,
and we've been able to respond to that to ensure customers can continue to grow.
And this is a place that we continue to optimize our supply chain, our software as
well as our hardware to respond to customer demand wherever that demand is as
quickly as we possibly can.
When you look at our global infrastructure, we have hyper-scale hero cloud regions,
not just in North America, in Europe, in Amsterdam and Ireland, but increasingly now
in more locations, be that, Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom. And so we've
been doing a lot of work, both pre-COVID and post-COVID to continue to grow that
hyperscale footprint in large locations as well as then in emerging locations. And soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 15Taylor McGinnis

Taylor McGinniswith that, we've been delivering capacity to all of those locations. And we've done a
pretty good job supporting Teams and communication and collaboration, critical
customers in life and safety, our customers in essential restricted industries like
ﬁnancial services and healthcare and then continue to grow on that. And this is a
place that we remain vigilant and incredibly focused.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Perfect. So now turning to the supply chain. Some vendors within the data center
supply chain are expecting the cloud providers to enter a digestion phase in the
back half of this year. So curious how quickly are you able to provision increased
capacity and have historic buying patterns of server, networking and other data
center equipment been lumpy. I guess how have data center eﬃciency gains
impacted these purchases as well?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it's fair to say that in 2020, there's been a lot of thought around supply
chain, not just in technology or cloud within every single industry. Companies are
looking at where their supply chain resides, how is it globally resilient and how can it
respond to diﬀerent global events. And Microsoft and our suppliers are no diﬀerent.
So we continue to look at where we're sourcing our components from, how that can
meet our business needs and how it can withstand the most unpredictable events
that may occur, such as the global pandemic.
As we look at that, we, of course, are continually innovating, both in terms of long
lead activities, as well as ensuring that we have the appropriate buﬀers and reserves
to be how to respond to events, wherever those events occur in the world. And we,
of course, are balancing eﬃciency here with customer responsiveness, and we
continue to tweak and evaluate this approach based on our learnings. And during
COVID, the fact that we had a number of reserves allowed us to rapidly scale and
then we continue to optimize that formula based on our experiences.
We've also had some learnings on our supply chain and continuing to diversify this
globally to remove single points of dependence and to ensure that we have diversity
across all of our ﬂeet. And that means use of diﬀerent parts of silicon, it's been
continuing to do the work we do across diﬀerent suppliers and then continuing to
build partnerships across the industry. So deﬁnitely, as we look at capacity, buying
patterns and all of the work that we're doing, we're, ﬁrst and foremost, focused on
ensuring customers continue to grow and that they can move the workload that they
need to move. We're hyper-focused on continuing to ensure that we have diversity
in our suppliers. And but we then, of course, have all of the things that we need to
continue to grow short, medium and long-term across the data center, the servers
and the software.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Got it. And maybe just to press a little bit further on this. So is there anything that you
can -- is there any additional color you can provide in terms of these lead times? SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 15Tom Keane
Taylor McGinnis
Tom Keanewhen you see in your pipeline that you're going to have some increase in usage or
you're going to see some greater demand, is it really easy to scale up this capacity?
Or do purchases of these data center and this equipment, does it tend to be
lumpier? Or do you have -- or are lead times actually fairly short, such that you don't
have these like big lumpy purchases? Is there any, just any, I guess, additional color
you can provide in terms of how you guys, when you think about data center
expansion and a lot of these capacity buildouts, and how that relates to the spend
on a lot of these data centers?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah. So if we start from the customer lens, obviously, what customers expect of us
as a cloud computing provider is that the elasticity, the capacity that they need is
there when they need it. And that is, ﬁrst and foremost, where we focus as an
engineering team.
The second is, of course, how quickly can we bring that capacity live. And so for a
customer, we want that to be seamless. And the work that we constantly focus on is
what we refer to as doc to live, how long can it take to bring a server from a
warehouse into a data center live and taking customer load. And that's a place
where we have focused immensely on ensuring that, that process is automated, that
it makes use of software through every step of the process and that there's no
human being involved. And that's a continual journey that we are on to optimize that
process. In addition, we continue to design the service and take into account the
evolution of technology, there's new chips come in, new suppliers come in. We're
constantly building service and ensuring that those servers are ready to go with the
second that they hit the data center. So we're adding capacity in dozens of racks, in
megawatts of power, built on networks that can scale to enormous scale.
So we're focused across all those parts of the equation, and we're focused on that
ﬁrst and foremost, with supporting customers. Because as we bring on customers
and we help them be successful with adoption, they'll continue to make use of our
cloud, and we'll, during that process, continue to optimize our supply chain and the
eﬃciency of how long it takes to bring those -- that capacity live.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Great. That's super helpful. And then I now I'd love to talk about the competitive
environment with AWS and GCP. So, do you think Microsoft has been better
positioned in this environment given its existing relationships with large enterprises?
And I'd love to get your thoughts on Microsoft's role in the multi-cloud world, long
term, how do customers utilize that multi-cloud strategy? And can all three major
cloud providers be happy?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah, so ﬁrst, on the second part of your question, multi-cloud is not new. And as a
company, we've done a lot of work and we're constantly in a multi-cloud
environment. In fact, as we look at organizations that may be making use of diﬀerentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 12 of 15Taylor McGinnispart of technologies, the common thread through a lot of that technology is, in fact,
Microsoft's cloud. As we look at, for example, Azure Active Directory, that identity
plane is often used by customers who may not be using Microsoft as their cloud
provider for communication or collaboration or even IAS or PAS.
We've seen a similar thing with our security suite where Microsoft's cloud security
products are, in fact, used across diﬀerent cloud platforms and can monitor the
security of other clouds. That's also true with on-premise and hybrid. We haven't
talked much about hybrid, but the work we've done with Azure Arc allows the
customer to connect their respective infrastructures together into one cloud. And so
the Microsoft's support of the multi-cloud environment has been a phenomenal
success, and we have a number of customers who are using diﬀerent cloud
providers for diﬀerent solutions and having phenomenal success.
As we talk about the competitive landscape, we feel really good about the work that
we've done over a prolonged period on trust. And this trust is, of course, the basis of
why enterprises have felt comfortable with us. The investments that we've made in
security, in compliance and accreditation and connectivity gives enterprises
conﬁdence that they can make use of our cloud to their most sophisticated
workloads. And we strongly feel that, that is a diﬀerentiator for us in the marketplace
versus other. That trust also extends to our authenticity. We are, ﬁrst and foremost,
focused on making our customers successful. There's never a scenario in which
we're focused on competing with our customers in their respective industries in
which they reside. And the focus here has given us a lot of success in enterprise. And
as you point out, that's a place where we are an incumbent supplier, and we take
those relationships and that trust very seriously. The focus on cyber sovereignty and
our global footprint is another place that has given us phenomenal uplift, and we
continue to invest, allowing our customers from all of the diﬀerent markets around
the world where Microsoft does business to make use of cloud regardless of what
their requirements, regulatory need for sentiment is.
And then I think, ﬁnally, we've been incredibly focused on customers and customer
needs in the context of hybrid. This allows a customer natively to make use of cloud
where it makes sense or to make use of their own infrastructure where it makes
sense. And I think the diﬀerentiation for us is that this is where Microsoft started. We
natively have solutions that work on-premise and they natively work inside the cloud.
And this is from our origins and beginnings, and we have been on this journey for a
long period. This is not something that's new to us. It's something that's very natural
to us. And as we focus on adoption around the world, we focus on helping our
customers. And we do this not just as Microsoft, but from a network of thousands,
tens of thousands of diﬀerent partners with that foundation of trust, we feel pretty
good about the way in which that diﬀerentiates us versus other cloud providers.

Let's talk more about hybrid. So, the server products segment continues to show
very strong growth. And part of that success is attributed to the Azure hybrid beneﬁt
program. So can you discuss the progress Microsoft is having, migrating its existing
Windows server and SQL server installed base to Azure? Are these migrationsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

move?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Yeah. So obviously, the advantage that Microsoft has is that the best place to run
Windows server workloads or SQL server workloads is Azure. And the ﬂexibility that
we provide there gives customers a lot of choice. For example, with SQL server, we
have a technology capability that allows a customer to burst their databases into the
cloud based on their business needs. So they don't have to make an exclusive
decision of cloud or on-premise, they have that choice and ﬂexibility. And our
business model and our licensing model reﬂects that.
As we look at the migrations, we're seeing customers all over the world migrating at
scale. And I mentioned some examples in ﬁnancial services, like UBS, in
governments like the Veterans Aﬀairs, and across the world, we're seeing it in every
industry where we work that those customers are moving those workloads and are
taking advantage of these oﬀerings. And this is a unique diﬀerentiator for us. The
hybrid beneﬁt is something that is unique and allows our customers to make use of
Azure for SQL and for Windows, where it makes sense, coupled with that technology
foundation of hybrid that I mentioned.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Great. And maybe as a last question in the few remaining minutes we have. Microsoft
has won several mega Azure deals over the last several quarters, including one with
the Department of Defense, AT&T, Walgreens and several others. Currently, those
are sitting in Microsoft backlog. So, is there any insight you can provide into how
customers scale over time or the impact that those could have to future Azure
revenue growth and what does the current pipeline look for these mega deals?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
So obviously, there's been a number of high-proﬁle wins that we've had in Azure
business, and we're incredibly excited about them. And being closely involved with a
lot of them, the approach that we've taken is consistent with everything that I've
described on this call, which is, ﬁrst and foremost, a focus on making the customer
successful. And with that, that's through a tone of partnership and long-term
relationship. And it's also through a tone of humility, one where we're willing to work
with our partner to ensure that our cloud meets their most important needs. And that
approach, I believe, has served us well and continues to serve us well.
And with each of these large customers, and the customers that are coming on
board in the future, we are focused on ensuring that they can adopt, they can scale,
and then they can move their most important workﬂows over to the cloud. And all of
the work we're doing, these deals, of course, don't happen overnight, but they begin
and drive success. And that's where we are focused day and night is to go and help
these customers feel comfortable. And as they feel comfortable, we see them
making larger commitments to Microsoft. So we think all of those customers that youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15

Taylor McGinnismentioned will continue to scale. They're already running at very large scale on our
platform. And in fact, every day, every week, we see large essential workloads
moving over based on the conﬁdence they're having from their day-to-day
experience.
So I feel good about where we stand with them. And I feel good about the approach
that has enabled us to be successful with those customers. And we'll continue to
apply that approach to future customers so that we can partner with them to help
make their business successful.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Great. And in the last minute, I'd be curious, what are the key areas of investment for
Azure for FY '21? What areas of innovation are you most excited about in the coming
years?
{BIO 17759695 <GO>}
Well, as a technologist, there's a lot. And we're at a phenomenal time in technology
where hardware and software are keeping pace with each other. As we look just at
silicon, the advances that we're seeing is fundamentally up in computing from where
we stand today with the processor into cold logic, quantum computing and the
ability to fundamentally reinvent compute power is just incredibly exciting. And
today, the work that we're doing across graphics and physics, intensive places is
literally removing constraints that have been in place for decades, where a customer
was historically compute constrained in solving some of their hardest problems. If
we look at augmented intelligence, and the work that we're doing there together
with predictive analytics and data, coupled with those investments in silicon, there's
some amazing things we're doing. A technology that we've just been talking publicly
about is one that makes use of our edge to take images from space and images that
may be cloudy on a day with Paul Weather and to use augmented intelligence to put
them together to allow a constant feed that could then be used by an agriculture
company or a government to see what's happening in their environment and how
their environment may be behaving.
IoT is another place where there's phenomenal innovation as critical infrastructure,
which is an increasingly broadening area is relying on cloud computing to know that
all of the diﬀerent parts of an enterprise, a factory, a hospital, is secure, compliant
and up to date. And in fact, we're seeing over 6 trillion IoT signals hit our cloud on a
day-to-day basis. So they are just a couple of diﬀerent examples of where we are
spending a lot of time. We are having a lot of fun, and our customers are partnering
with us to really push us to solve some of their hardest problems. So we're pretty
excited about all of them.
{BIO 20989116 <GO>}
Sounds all very exciting and interesting. But we're up against the time, so Tom, thank
you so much for joining us today, and I appreciate the time you shared with us and
the insights you provided.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-15
