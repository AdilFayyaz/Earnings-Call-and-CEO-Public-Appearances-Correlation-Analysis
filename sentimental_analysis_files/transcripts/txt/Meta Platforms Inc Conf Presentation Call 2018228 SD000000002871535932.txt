Sheryl Kara Sandbergentertain you at least a little.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Try -- yes. Try to keep the energy high. A lot to talk about in general in -- around
Facebook, around social, around the entire ecosystem. I -- Sheryl, I wanted to start
with a couple high-level questions. Facebook had another great year in 2017, very
good revenue growth. The community metrics were overall pretty solid. But there
were some challenges. And I know you've been investing to kind of address some of
these challenges around safety and security and engagement on the platform.
Maybe just talk about some of the investments and the changes you're making on
the platform.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
We had a year where there's a lot that we're proud of. We're proud of the
engagement we continue to provide people, the social connections they make.
We're proud that we're connecting so many people around the world that haven't
been connected and all the businesses that are ﬁnding people to hire and really
growing through Facebook. That said, to say 2017 was a challenging year is -- feels
like a bit of an understatement from where I think we sit. And I think this year is
already and will continue to be a challenging year. And there are so many drivers of
this. But the world is very polarized. And there is a lot of kind of deep-seated worry
about the state of the world, where the world is. And that plays out on our platform.
And we feel it very deeply.
We are taking a number of steps to show that we take full responsibility for
everything that happens on our platform because we have a responsibility, an
opportunity, to maximize the good that's done. But we also have a very deep
responsibility to make sure that we minimize, as much as possible. And it will never
be 100% possible with that. So a couple of things we're very focused on. False news.
People want real news on Facebook. We want them to get real news on Facebook.
And so we're working really hard in this area. People think of false news as politically
motivated. And it is. But it's actually more often economically motivated. People are
writing outlandish headlines so they can get clicks. So they can make ad money. And
so probably the most important thing we can do is go after the economic incentives
and make sure that people who are purveying fake/false news are not making
money from it. And we've done that in a very big way. We also are working with
third-party fact checkers. We don't think we can or should be the arbiters of the
truth. But we know people want the truth. And it's really third parties we rely on to do
that.
Election interference. We are working hard and making sure all of the information on
Facebook is from authentic accounts because fake accounts are actually the source
of a lot of the false news. And they were the source of all of the election interference
we saw. We are working very closely with election commissions all over the world.
We have 14,000 people right now inside the company who are working on
community operations, safety, security, site integrity. We're growing very quickly. And
we'll be at 20,000 by the end of the year, working hard on this across the board.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-28

Page 3 of 16Brian Thomas Nowak
Sheryl Kara SandbergAnd the third area that's really important is the content itself. There's no place on
Facebook for hate, violence, bullying, terrorism. We've always had those policies in
place. And it's up to us to continue to enforce them and enforce them well. We've
made some great progress in areas. 99% of the ISIS terror -- ISIS content we ﬁnd and
take down, we're ﬁnding ourselves now. We're not -- it's not getting reported to us.
But there will always be more to do in these areas. We announced at our earnings
call 1 quarter ago that we were taking all of this so seriously that it would impact
proﬁtability. And that is exactly what we're doing. I think that's important and Mark
thinks that's important and David thinks that's important, not just for the long-run
health of the company and the community but for the short and medium run. So
we're going to continue to make big investments in all of these areas.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Thanks a lot. It's just that there's a lot of engagement. It's a big community. The other
piece of the business is the advertising side. I know it's always important to separate
the community from the ad business. You've been pretty active in continuing to
improve the ad product over the course of the last couple of years. So are there 1 or
2 key improvements on the advertising side that you've made that most excite you as
you think about 2018 and '19?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Our advertising business is strong, growing. I think we have done some good things.
But we have a lot of hard work and, I think, room ahead of us. When I think about the
advertising opportunity we oﬀer, we are the place where if you want to reach
everyone in almost every country in the world, you can. We have a Super Bowl in the
U.S. on mobile every single day and the equivalent of that in most countries. But the
other thing we can do is make ads more speciﬁc, more targeted, more relevant and
measure better because we have pretty unique targeting abilities. And that's good
for both the advertisers and for the community. They really work together. If the ads
you see on Facebook are better targeted, more relevant, that's a better consumer
experience. It also yields a higher return for advertisers because they're reaching the
right audience and using their money eﬀectively.
When you asked the question, you said, are there 1 or 2 big things we're doing? The
thing about our ads business. And I think all online ads business, is this is a game of
basis points increase. This is -- yes, we've launched new products. But for the most
part, we launch products and then we tweak and we tweak and we tweak. And we
keep making it a little bit better and a little bit better. And I think a lot of the
performance you see now is really the compounded earnings of all of those basis
points improvements that make the ads a little bit better. So I'll share 2 speciﬁc
products we've worked on. Dynamic Ads. Dynamic Ads are ads in our site which are
taking into account information from the person of things they have looked for. We
launched them for autos, we launched them for travel. We continue to launch new
verticals. And we continue to make them a little bit better. Anyone who listens to our
earnings calls knows that I do love a good case study. So fear not, I have some with
me.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Brian Thomas Nowak
David M. WehnerAirbnb did Dynamic Ads for travel. And what they did is they looked at -- they served
ads that were speciﬁcally to people who had looked for but not booked speciﬁc
locations. So when you got the Airbnb ad, what you got was the ad for the location
you were interested in. That's the kind of experience we can oﬀer that makes the ad
so relevant. And we did a conversion list study. So we measured all the way through
from buying the ad to actual booking the vacation. And they had a 5.7x return on ad
spend. So anyone who's ever looked at ads knows how high that is. Another
example, TwirlyGirl, a small example, they're a retail store, they sell -- retail e-
commerce site, selling clothing for young girls. They did a 12-second video of a girl
twirling in a dress. And it linked directly to a product.
This is through our Collection ads, another ads product we launched where we can
go directly to products. And because they were linking directly to the products, they
had an 8.7x return on ad sales. And importantly, 80% of their business last year came
from Facebook. I think the old adage of I'm wasting half my ad budget, I just don't
what half, just doesn't have to be true anymore. And we're going to keep making
improvement after improvement, really day after day, week after week, to get those
slight improvements that make that more true.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
I think that's a great way to think about the basis point tweaks and basis point
increases. So let me turn to Dave then a little more on the mechanics of the ad
business of what we've seen. If we look over the course of the last year, it looks like
the ad revenue growth is increasingly being driven by pricing, where the average
price of the ad units is increasing. Can you just help us understand a little bit more
how you think about, A, the ability to continue to grow impressions faster? Then what
about driving price higher? Do you still see a lot of runway for price to drive the ad
business?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Brian. It's a great question. I think we do see that there's -- we have
continued opportunities to grow impressions on both Facebook and Instagram. So
we are optimistic about our ability to grow impressions. And we talked about that on
the call. We have seen that the character of revenue growth has shifted more to
price. So this past quarter, it was a 43% increase in price year-over-year and a 4%
increase in impressions year-over-year. And that's an inverse of what we've seen in
past years. So it's increasingly driven by price. But I think a lot of the areas that Sheryl
just spoke about, which is these basis point improvements in our ads products, it's
about taking the inventory that we have, the impressions that we're bringing to our
customers, making them more relevant for our customers and also, at the same time,
allowing advertisers to deliver real business results from those impressions more
eﬃciently. So that's playing through to better ROI for our advertisers. And if we're
doing that, prices go up for the eﬀective CPM for us that we're getting. And I think
that's what's playing through and not the price increases that we see on the
platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 5 of 16Brian Thomas Nowak
David M. Wehner
Brian Thomas Nowak
David M. WehnerBut we think that's really being driven by us getting better at ﬁnding the right place
for our advertisers to bring their messages. So I think we monitor that as best we can.
Are we seeing an ability to drive better ROI for our advertisers? Because we don't
want to see price increases driven by an erosion in ROI for advertisers. And we don't
think we're seeing that. We don't have perfect information. But we don't think we're
seeing that. So I think we're optimistic about all the diﬀerent product improvements
that we can make on the advertising side. A lot of the things around targeting,
around getting the right unit, as Sheryl spoke about, will translate into our ability to
continue to drive improved pricing on the platform.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Shifting back to engagement a little bit. Engagement continues to be a --
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
It's a pretty hot-button topic,
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Widely discussed topic in the investor community over the last 4 to ﬁve months.
Mark talked about some changes to the News Feed to prioritize more meaningful
interactions. So a few questions behind that. So the ﬁrst one is, can you just help us
understand what does that mean? How are you measuring the success of those
eﬀorts? Then as you think about the impact on the advertising business or the
advertising ROI you deliver to your advertisers, what's the impact of the News Feed
changes on the ad business?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Sure. So really, at the end of the day, it's pretty straightforward what we're trying to
do with the changes that Mark talked about on the call and that we've been talking
about since then, which is we're trying to make sure that Facebook has that -- is that
community where you can come and you can connect meaningfully with your friends
and family. And we measure that and we think about that in terms of are we driving
engagements where you're commenting on somebody's post, where you're liking
someone's post? Things that we can measure and to optimize against. And we can
then see, okay, that is where we want to focus the attention of Facebook, is really
driving those meaningful connections. And as we do that, it's just about how do we
rank things in News Feed with the signals that we have. Things that are more passive
consumption. So things like passive consumption of video, that does take a bit of a
hit and that translated to the decreases in the time spent that we saw in Q4. So that's
sort of part and parcel with that.
But when it comes to how that impacts the business, the impact of the business is
much more muted because we're still seeing that there's lots of post-engagement.
So when you're taking away time from things like passive video, it doesn't mean
you're not seeing as many posts in News Feed. So there's -- I don't think the impact
on the business is really that profound relative to the impact on time. So we're stillFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Brian Thomas Nowak
David M. Wehner

Sheryl Kara Sandbergdriving a lot of engagement on News Feed and the number of posts that you see.
That's important in terms of the drivers. Then broader -- a broader brush, as we drive
a better quality of experience on Facebook and as we drive more meaningful
content interactions, we think that, that just improves the environment on Facebook.
And I think the advertisers beneﬁt from that over time. And I think that will be
reﬂected as well.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Got it. Since the Fourth Quarter earnings, we've had a lot of investor questions about
some of these quality changes that you mentioned in the past, these video changes,
et cetera. And really zeroed in on the North America daily active user numbers, I
think, fell by a small amount, like 700,000 people. Are those the changes that
caused the 700,000 people to drop oﬀ in the quarter? And as you step back, what
gives you conﬁdence that there isn't a deeper issue with Facebook where you have a
user churn or a user engagement problem? And what gives you conﬁdence that
engagement in users will continue to grow and be steady from here?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes. When it comes to the decline that we saw sequentially from Q3 to Q4 in the U.S.
and Canada market. And we break out U.S. and Canada as our North America
segment, that is a trend that we don't see continuing on an ongoing basis. So at the
level of penetration that we have in the market, we have such a high level of
penetration in U.S. and Canada, there's going to be some volatility around this just
given where we are. To your speciﬁc question, were the changes that we made that
were really focused on driving meaningful interactions, the changes that drove the
DAU sequential decline, the answer is no. It was really other quality changes that
we're making around things like notiﬁcations that led to that particular issue. So
again, we think there's -- continues to be great opportunities to improve the product
and make it better. And we think that, that will be reﬂected in us continuing to get a
big audience.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Helpful. The -- so we have the mothership, Facebook. And then you have multiple
other platforms. And Sheryl, I wanted to ask you about some of those other
platforms. Starting with Messenger and WhatsApp, they have a lot of users. I think
there's still a lot of questions around how is consumer behavior diﬀerent on
Messenger and WhatsApp versus the other platforms? And how do you think about
driving monetization over time? So maybe talk about those 2 big platforms.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
What Messenger and WhatsApp are is direct one-to-one communication. And that's
absolutely exploding on mobile phones and, I think, particularly on these 2
platforms. Messenger now has 1.3 billion active users, WhatsApp has 1.5 billion. And
people are doing something very diﬀerent, I think, than they're doing on our other
platforms, where it can be more broad sharing to a group of people, either a smallFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Brian Thomas Nowak
David M. Wehner
Brian Thomas Nowakgroup or one-to-one interactions that people are having. We're very focused on
growth and we're very focused on the engagement and the consumer experience in
both. But we also see big business opportunities, even though they're at diﬀerent
stages. With Messenger, we already have 18 million businesses that are using
Messenger to interact. And again, we're being slow and deliberate -- no one get too
excited too quickly -- about the monetization opportunities because we're going to
be slow and deliberate. But I do think they're very big over the long run because if
you already have 18 million small businesses working on it. And we see the
possibilities and we see the early activity. I think around ﬁnding customers, we can
already see the marketing possibilities. And we already see a lot of good work on
customer care that can happen.
And I'll share a recent example. Kia launched a Messenger bot. And they ran click-to-
Messenger ads which puts people who are interested in this car to directly
communicate on Messenger with a bot. And that really matters because it wasn't that
expensive for them to stop that, right? They weren't stopping the messages. And
people started Messengering the bot. And they were asking for price quotes or
asking for vehicle specs. And the bot was able to answer those questions really well.
They saw 2x their conversion through that engagement than they did on their own
website. And that's an early example. But I think it shows what's possible. And again,
what we want to do is we want to drive up the ROI for advertisers so they can do
things in a more targeted, more speciﬁc, more automated way and measure all the
way through to their results. WhatsApp is earlier. But we did just launch our
WhatsApp for business app. And we are seeing good engagement and good
excitement from the community. Businesses are already using WhatsApp, particularly
in the countries where WhatsApp is really strong. You deﬁnitely see a lot of
businesses using them as well as around the world. And so, again, early days, we're
not telling anything. But long run, I think the potential is really big.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. It was nice to see Messenger was called out in the K. It was the ﬁrst time as a
driver of ad revenue. So it's early. But it's starting to at least be in print.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
It's early.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
It's very early. One of the platforms that's a little further along is Instagram. I know
you talked about 2 million advertisers on Instagram at this point. And the question I
have on Instagram is, Mark has talked about the growing use and the growing
importance of Stories. So maybe it's a question for both of you to talk about the
monetization cadence of Stories, maybe unique challenges you face, how you
monetize Stories. Then, Dave, how do you think about integrating Instagram Stories
into the revenue pile over the next couple of years?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-28

Instagram is a big opportunity for us. With Facebook and Instagram, we have the 2
largest mobile ad platforms in the world by far. Instagram has great visualization.
When people share on Instagram, they're sharing in a very rich way. And what's
really been a very, very fast growing type of product, which is Stories, really takes
advantage of that. For people hopefully who use them, Stories are very immersive.
Stories let help you tell your story in a narrative way with videos and pictures. And so
it's a really big opportunity for people to communicate. And anytime on our platform
people can be communicating, there's an opportunity for businesses to interact in
the right way. Early days on Stories revenue is well. But working well. And I'll share an
example.
Buck Mason is a small men's clothing store based in Venice, California. It's a cool
story because they started selling clothing out of their garage. And now they have 3
locations and an e-commerce site. They ran Instagram Stories ads that encouraged
people to swipe up and shop the shirt. So they went from this story-immersive kind
of format to a very speciﬁc product. And they were able to target men 25 to 54 living
in the U.S. and they did Lookalike Audiences. So what we can do, again, because of
the targeting investments we make and continue to make, is when you ﬁnd an
audience on Facebook that's working for you or the current customers you have, we
can help you ﬁnd the audiences that look like them.
So we can say, okay, this is what works. We're going to show this to another group of
men between these ages that we think would be interested in these products. And
the results have been really good. They had over a 3x return on ad spend. And so
what you're seeing there, I think, is the same thing that is already happening and will
happen more with Stories, is the front-end that consumers see is the product. So it is
Instagram photos, Facebook videos, Instagram Stories, Facebook Stories. The back-
end is the ads database we have, the people who advertise with us, all of the
targeting information, all of the measurement ability we have. Once you can match
and ﬁnd a good audience on Facebook, we can help you ﬁnd that same audience on
Instagram. And I think the power of those 2 things together are really exciting,
particularly because Stories is such a vibrant and visual format.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, Mark talked about how important Stories is for driving sharing. And it
really lowers the barrier to sharing. Just right prior to coming in here, I had a
wardrobe malfunction and a button -- my top button popped oﬀ my shirt.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Did you buy something through an ad on Facebook?

Brian Thomas Nowak
Sheryl Kara SandbergNo. I did not. But (Anil) did ﬁlm me sewing the button back on. And that's something
that I probably don't want to share for permanent record on my Facebook page.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
You did just get (multiple speakers)
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Exactly. So -- but it's a great thing to just share as a story that will appear and go
away in 24 hours because that's probably how I want it to be. But the thing that is
very real trend is this type of sharing is becoming very prevalent on all of these
diﬀerent platforms, whether it be Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp with status.
And so I think that's something that we're going to be working with over the next
several years as we see that transition. And from a monetization perspective, Sheryl
talked about this, the format is a format that works really well with advertising, much
like Feed. But there's diﬀerent things about it than Feed. It's a fully immersive
experience in the sense that it's usually full-screen. So that's a positive. But there's
still a lot of work that we need to do to build the ad products to work the same way
they do in Feed as to work in Stories the same way. So ultimately, we think it's a great
opportunity. It's still early. But we think it's going to be a very important trend to
watch in terms of how it aﬀects the business model as well.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Sheryl, I want to ask you about video. And speciﬁcally, Facebook Watch. I'm a big fan
of Tom vs. Time as a Michigan man. So our (inaudible) survey data show that it's just
some pretty good traction on Watch. It shows that 40% of users in the U.S. are using
the product at least once a week. So I have a series of questions. One, any reaction
to that number? Then, two, at a higher level, can you just talk through sort of early
learnings on Watch and how you determine whether or not to invest in the types of
content you're putting on the platform? What analytics are you looking at for you to
determine where to spend money on?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
So when we think about Watch, what we thought about was creating a place where
people could ﬁnd content and have a speciﬁc place to ﬁnd it and engage around it.
And some of it will be longer form content. So there's a lot of video on Facebook.
But it ﬂows through News Feed. So it's not categorized or cataloged. So if you want
to ﬁnd something, you have to ﬁnd it in News Feed or go to that page. Watch is
trying to solve that problem by having a speciﬁc place where you know you can go
and ﬁnd content in a predictable way. Because we have to kind of stock the shelves -
- you can't like start a tab and not have anything there, we funded some of the
content ourselves. But it's still the case that more of the content on Watch has been
provided by others and not paid for by us. And that's deﬁnitely the business model
going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-28

David M. WehnerWhen we think about what we're interested in, we're particularly interested in
content that has a social interaction around it. So Tom vs. Time, which is a great show
and people really liked, Tom has a very active fan club and a very active fan group on
Facebook. And that means that there's a community around that content. They're not
just watching. I don't know, you look like you're in them. That smile says I'm pretty
sure you're in the Tom Brady fan club.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
I am a Tom Brady fan.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
You are? Okay. Well you could just kind of tell. But that -- then you know that, that fan
club -- anyone else?
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
I'm wearing a jersey (multiple speakers)
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Admit it, come on. Hands up. Who else is in the club? Look, we like it. Got a couple
other hands. I think some of you are not admitting it. But that fan club is really active.
And that fan club is keeping the conversation going. And so I haven't seen that data.
That 40% of people that are in there, that's great. What we want to make sure we do
is provide a unique experience and a social experience and a place where people
can ﬁnd the content they're looking for and share it. It's still the case that 40% of --
our 40% is -- 40% of our video views are coming from people sharing. So it's a very -
- video on Facebook has been a very social thing.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Understood. Greatest player of all time. Dave, on the last earnings call, you talked
about CapEx and the operating expense outlook. Some would argue that it seems a
little bit aggressive in the amount that you're talking about spending. So I guess
maybe talk qualitatively about the biggest areas of CapEx and OpEx investment as
you go throughout 2018.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Sure. So in 2017, we grew total expenses, which is what we give guidance on, at a
34% rate year-over-year. And we're talking about an acceleration in 2018 to a range
between 45% and 60%. So a big step-up in investment on the OpEx and cost of
revenue side. What's driving that is really 3 key factors driving the acceleration. The
ﬁrst is the one that Sheryl talked about, about the big investment that we're making
in security and integrity. That's across a number of fronts on the product. We're
investing a lot on the people side. So Sheryl talked about the 14,000 people thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 11 of 16Brian Thomas Nowak
David M. Wehnerwe've got working on product integrity, on community operations, on ads review.
That doubled in 2017. We're going to ramp that to 20,000 in 2018. So that's a driver.
So that's one, the big investments we're making there, driving the acceleration.
The second one we also talked about, which is the content investments that we're
making on the Watch tab. So we're investing in content. And that's going to drive the
expense growth. And that's -- so that's an investment that isn't as dependent on
hiring people, right? So it's something we can get out there and deploy pretty
readily. So I would expect to be spending a lot there. The third is all of the
investments that we are continuing to make and grow at a higher pace than the rest
of the business around AR and VR, AI and also connectivity. So our -- what we call our
sort of -- our long-range or 10-year initiatives. So that's the other big area that we're
investing in. So those are the 3 big factors driving the acceleration of expense
growth in 2018.
On the CapEx side, we're planning on doubling CapEx to $14 billion to $15 billion in
2018. And there, I think, we've got a couple of factors going on. First, we're investing
to just make sure we're prepared for the growth that we expect. So data centers are
30-year assets. It's better to be ahead than behind on those. So we've got, I think, it's
11 data center regions globally. We're investing in developing those. We're looking at
new regions. We want to make sure that we're ahead of the curve, not behind the
curve, on the investments that we need. And we need to make sure that we've got
the right capacity to manage the business eﬀectively and make sure that we can
deliver on all the products. The second thing that's important is we're also seeing an
increase in capital intensity in the business as it relates to a few diﬀerent things.
One example is, just as we support our growth globally, we're not going to have as
high a revenue per user as we would in the U.S. when you look globally. And the
costs are more similar. So we're going to have some diﬀerence in capital, sort of our
CapEx to revenue from that perspective. Then also, we're seeing really good returns
on making investments in things like putting more compute power against ranking in
News Feed, putting more compute power against ﬁnding the most relevant ad for
you. And so we're going to continue to make those investments as long as those
drive good returns. And I think we see some opportunities to do that. So we are
investing to prepare for growth and also to really drive value in the business as well.
So I think we see good opportunities to get good returns on these investments
across both the operating expense and CapEx side.

Understood. So it's been sort of over 30 minutes, we haven't talked about regulatory
yet. So we might as well. We get a lot of questions about the regulatory environment.
So I guess the 2 questions I have on it are just, can you talk about how Facebook is
preparing for any regulatory changes in the overall regulatory environment at a
higher level? Then speciﬁcally focusing on GDPR, how should we think about the
impact of GDPR on Facebook?

Brian Thomas NowakSo on GDPR, I think, fundamentally, it's about how you design your products. And we
design our products with sort of transparency and control as being 2 key
fundamental factors. And that maps very well against what the GDPR framework is, is
really seeking companies to do. So we think with transparency and control, we're set
up well to be in a position where we're compliant with GDPR when the regulation
goes into eﬀect in May. And I think it embodies a lot of what we're trying to do with
the products anyway. So what could be the impacts on the business? Well there's --
we don't know exactly what the impacts will be. I think we're going to be walking
through permission screens for our European -- people using Facebook in Europe.
So there's going to be diﬀerent permission ﬂows that they walk through on things
like how can we use external content to improve ads targeting and the like on
Facebook? Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there's some
potential that people don't -- either they decide they're not going to use the
product, there are some -- there could be some implication on DAU. We don't know
what it'll be. We don't think it'll be big. But there could be some implication there. So
we'll be watching that. The second possibility is just it may hinder some of our ads
targeting capabilities in Europe to some degree. We don't know exactly. Again, we
don't think that, that's going to be a big impact. But we'll be watching that.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Sheryl, there seems to be a lot in the press about questions on social and backlash
against social. Can you just maybe talk about your view on that and how you think
about Facebook's positioning and the societal -- not backlash. But almost negative
impacts on society from social right now?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
We think a lot about our product and responsibility we have to be good for people's
well-being. We announced a change at the beginning of this year around
meaningful social interactions. And so what the data shows, I mean, we try to
research this well and thoroughly, is that not all interactions in social media are
equally good for people in terms of their psychological well-being. When you're
interacting on social media and you are sharing directly, communicating, engaging,
it's actually pretty positive. When you are more passively viewing, it's not clear that,
that's as positive. And so what we did was announce the change in News Feed that's
rolling out that will really prioritize the more direct, the more social interactions over
the more passive forms of viewing. I think what you're going to see from us
continually is we've always built privacy and safety and security into our products.
And we're going to continue to learn and study and make investments and make
sure that people are having a good, a safe experience and, importantly, an
experience that's additive and positive to their lives. We believe that if people are
having a good experience and continue to have that, they'll continue to share and
we'll continue to grow.

Page 13 of 16Sheryl Kara Sandbergwas even something in the press today about Facebook Workplace and kind of
starting to move more into the enterprise side. So maybe talk about that potential
business for Facebook. How do you get into the enterprise or Facebook for
Workplace business?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
So I'll talk about Workplace brieﬂy. But the heart of our SMB work is really worth
some time. So I'll do that, too. Workplace is Facebook for work. It's another app, put
it on your phone or on your desktop and it allows you to have a Facebook
experience that's solely with the people you work with. We've used Facebook
internally for a very long time. And we always had a product where we could keep
our current employees on and anyone who left the company oﬀ. And that's what you
need in order for this to work. And so we just rolled that product out. I think we now
have 30,000 companies that are using the product. And it does exactly what you
think it would do. It makes interaction informal, faster, brings community together.
We're hearing great things from large partners like Starbucks who have told us that
it's really helping them get closer with their employees and their employees closer
with each other.
That's very small compared to what we do in SMBs. So we have 70 million small
businesses, 70 million that have Facebook pages that are using them every month.
We have 25 million small businesses with Instagram business proﬁles that are active
every month. Those are really unbelievable numbers. And what we are able to do is
really get to the heart of helping them drive their business. And this is something
that I was really excited about. I will -- I've been at Facebook a decade next month.
But I remember when I was considering taking this job. And the SMB opportunity
was one of the things I could just see and was much -- was really compelling for me.
So think about small businesses in generations past. My grandfather owned one. You
had to buy -- get a lease, borrow money, start a store. The way you could market --
was marketing in your Sunday circular or in the local newspaper. All of these things
are great; they're expensive. When you think about what small businesses can do
now, anyone can start from everywhere and use Facebook to market. I was in Europe
last month. And I met with a whole group of them. But just to share some of my
favorites. There's a barber in the U.K. He built an app that you could -- he markets
entirely through Facebook. And he built an app where you can schedule your
appointment and go on time. He now has 17 locations and has been employing all
these barbers.
There's a guy from a small town in Italy making ﬁsh paninis, who markets them
entirely on Facebook. And his business is growing and more hiring. And a woman
from Sweden who started selling baby clothes in her living room. Her husband's
Romanian. They've now moved to Romania. They have 100 people employed. And
they're making those baby clothes in Romania. And they're selling them all the way
across Europe. What's exciting to me about this is that those are the most oﬀ-line
businesses in the world. This is a tailor, a barber shop and a chef. And when we think
about one of the biggest underlying challenges that I think talk to the economic and
security, some of the polarization, economic and security and fear of jobs, fear ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-28

Sheryl Kara Sandbergjobs in a world that's more automated, is so important and so palpable and, I think,
causing a lot of the concern people have.
When I think about 70 million small businesses on our site -- we just did a survey in
Europe, 45% of the small businesses who use Facebook in Europe are hiring. And
they attribute that to the 50% of them who are growing sales because of us. And so
we have a responsibility and an opportunity to do good in the world. And I think
probably one of the best ways we already do that. And we're really doubling down
to invest a lot more, is working with small businesses to grow jobs. More than half of
job growth in all of these markets is small businesses. And this is how they're
growing and that's really exciting.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. It's the platform. It's the reach of the platform. The last one, Dave, capital returns.
You have, at the end of last year, over $40 billion of cash on the balance sheet. You
do have a share repurchase program at this point. But just can you talk us through a
little bit Facebook's capital allocation strategy when you think about how to allocate
funds between M&A, shareholder returns and its organic investment?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, sure. The focus is really on, ﬁrst and foremost, investing in the business where
we can drive good returns and drive great value for the community. So the biggest
focus is (inaudible) there. And that's why we're ramping up the investments that
we're talking about across a number of diﬀerent areas, whether it's supporting small
businesses with the right ad tools or improving the quality, the experience with the
investments we're making on the integrity front or just building up the data center
capacity that we need to improve the services and deliver the services globally. So
that's really the main focus of the capital allocation strategy. We do have an active
share repurchase program. We repurchased $2 billion in 2017. We've got a $6 billion
authorization. We'll still be doing share repurchase to oﬀset dilution. So we plan to
do that. But the focus is really growth. M&A, we've been -- we'll continue to do M&A
on an ongoing basis. It may -- mainly it's been tuck-in acquisitions and ﬁnding
speciﬁc areas where we need to augment our capabilities.

But in this room -- no, I think this is really important. I think this audience will think it's

Sheryl Kara Sandbergworkforce. And the Me Too Movement has shown how pervasive sexual harassment
has been. I think it also shows. And this is important, that there are a lot of very good
people and very good men out there trying to do the right thing every day and we
all have to work together. I've been very worried about what I perceive of as the
possible negative impact or backlash on this. And this is what I think it is and I really
want to share this with this audience. Because I'm looking out at a lot of very
important men who run big companies and big ﬁrms. And you guys can make a big
diﬀerence. And investors, you guys have a lot of power and you can make a big
diﬀerence by caring about this.
So my foundation, Lean In, we just did a survey on this. Post-Me Too, 47% of male
managers in the U.S. are afraid to do basic work activities with a woman, including
have a meeting. Male senior managers in the U.S. now say that they're 3.5x less likely
to -- more likely to hesitate to have a work dinner with a junior female colleague than
a junior male colleague and 5x more likely to hesitate to travel with a junior female
colleague and a junior work colleague. For all of the people here who want returns,
you want returns for your investing ﬁrm, you want returns for the companies you
invest in, we know that diverse workplaces give better return. One of the things
that's held women back. And particularly women of color, getting into leadership
roles is that even before Me Too -- this was true when I published my book ﬁve years
ago -- women are much less likely to get mentored than men. They're much less
likely to get that informal time. Women of color are much more less likely than white
women.
And so we have this incredible moment in time where the behavior that never
should have happened will stop, where we can develop and mentor women to get
them into leadership roles. But we just have to be very cognizant of the risks and
make sure they won't happen. So what I want to say is make sure in your ﬁrms,
access is equal. If you or the people you work for or the senior men in the
companies you invest, don't feel comfortable having dinner with women, then they
shouldn't have dinner with men. If they don't feel comfortable doing work travel with
women, because that is very important informal time where you get the kind of time
with your boss that gets you promoted, then they shouldn't travel with men or they
should travel in groups. This is a moment for us to say, "Okay, not harassing us is
important but basic. We need more. And what we need is an equal share of time and
attention that gets women into the roles they need." And so I know it wasn't asked.
Thank you for letting me take the moment. But everyone in this room is interested in
returns. And if you want the very best returns from your own ﬁrms and the ones you
invest in, take a moment to take this moment and help all of us lead by example. My
foundation launched this about 3 weeks ago. We had about 45 very senior CEOs in
the company pledge to mentor her. Go back, be loud and clear, especially if you are
a man, that you are committed to mentoring women now more than ever. It will
make a huge diﬀerence.
