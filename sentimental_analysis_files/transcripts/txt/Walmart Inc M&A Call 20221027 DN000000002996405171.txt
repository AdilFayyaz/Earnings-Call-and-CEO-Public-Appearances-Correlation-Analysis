Welcome to the latest in Walmart series of webinars on our Environmental, Social,
and Governance strategies. I'm Brendan Morrissey, Vice President of ESG at Walmart.
Before we begin, a quick legal note. Following presentation contains certain forward-
looking statements based on Walmart management's current assumptions and
expectations, including statements regarding our ESG targets, goals, commitments
and programs, and other business plans, initiatives, and objectives. These statements
are typically accompanied by the words aim, hope, believe, estimate, plan, aspire, or
similar words. All such statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe
harbor for forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.
Our actual future results, including the achievement of our targets, goals, or
commitments could diﬀer materially from our projected results as the result of
changes and circumstances, assumptions not being realized or other risks,
uncertainties, and other factors. With that, we'll ﬂip the slide and turn to today's
discussion.
Walmart's holding these discussions to eliminate aspects of our ESG strategy in
which we receive questions from the investment community and from other
stakeholders on our ESG strategies. Our goal is to allow you to hear directly from
Walmart's leaders on these topics and to get more context for the strategies
discussed in our ESG reporting.
Our ESG priorities include four themes, opportunity, sustainability, community, and
ethics and integrity. The issues of focus you see here were identiﬁed because of their
high relevance to our business and stakeholders, as well as Walmart's ability to make
a diﬀerence on these issues.
Today, we have the opportunity to dive into one of these priority issues, the dignity
of people in supply chains, which you see highlighted here on your screen. You'llFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27

Global Responsible Sourcing; and Karrie Denniston, Senior Director, Sustainability
for walmart.org.
The ﬁrst part of today's session will consist of an overview of our key strategies on
this topic. We use the remainder of the time to respond directly to questions both
from the audience live today but then also questions that were submitted in advance
with registrations. And we'll just aim to wrap up right at the top of the hour.
First up is a discussion of Walmart's approach to responsible sourcing. So, I'll turn it
over to Kristen.
Thank you, Brendan. I'm glad to be here this morning to talk about responsible
sourcing and people in the supply committee because this is an area where Walmart
has already invested substantially. So ﬁrst, let's talk about what we mean when we
talk about the dignity of people in supply chains, and then I'll get a little bit more in
detail about our responsible sourcing programming.
So, we really think about three components when we talk about dignity of people in
supply chains. One, sourcing products responsibly, and that's sort of the foundation
of our responsible sourcing program, which I'll get into. Two, creating economic
opportunity for people in supply chains. And three, collaborating with others to
address systemic risks to worker well-being.
And so, we see all three of these elements as key, not only to ensuring that Walmart's
code of conduct and our standards for suppliers are met and understood and
upheld but also to maximizing our positive impact for the people who make our
products and for our customers.
So, if we can go to the next slide, let's start by looking a little more closely at
responsible sourcing. So, at Walmart, we expect the products we purchase for resale
or purchase for our own use to be made by suppliers who act ethically, pay people
fairly, provide working environments that are safe and clean, and respect the dignity
of workers. And these are foundational in our standards for suppliers. So, our
responsible sourcing team works with our merchant and sourcing partners across
the globe to put these principles into place in our business practices.
So, I'll highlight a few key elements which you can see on the slide here. First, we
have robust policies including the two I mentioned our code of conduct and our
standards for suppliers, but we also have targeted speciﬁc policies around related
issues such as conﬂict minerals and global force labor prevention. We also provide
responsible sourcing training programs, both internally to our business partners in
merchant and sourcing organizations, and also externally to our supplier community.
We have compliance associates located in 14 countries around the world that
support responsible sourcing and provide ongoing support and guidance to ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 18merchant and sourcing partners around the world. So, they can align their practices
to our program's expectations.
And then monitoring for compliance. We monitor the supply chain for compliance
with our standards, including through audits and investigations, and I'll talk more
about those programs in just a moment. And lastly, I would say we oﬀer tools so that
people in the community, whether they are workers in facilities or internal referrals,
can reach out to us through our potential -- through our global ethics helpline to
make us aware of potential non-compliance issues.
So, if we go to the next slide, I'll get a little bit more into the details of responsible
sourcing. So, you'll see here some of our statistics from our last ﬁnancial year. We
take a risk-based approach to auditing. And so, in addition to conducting an annual
risk assessment, we take a risk-based approach to our auditing as well. So, we assign
risk levels to regions and territories based on the World Bank governance indicators
and other factors that may arise from time to time. And facilities in our lower-risk
areas are subject to audits on a less frequent basis, while facilities that fall into
medium and high-risk areas are subject to more frequent audits. And this is true
regardless of the outcome of their performance on prior audits.
So, to give you a sense of the scope of the program, we assessed over 14,000 of
these audit reports last ﬁnancial year. Each of our audit reports is individually
assessed by a Walmart associate against a set of criteria that is aligned with
international labor norms. Of these 14, 000 reports from last year, over 90% received
a green or a yellow rating, meaning that they were at a very high level of compliance
or had just relatively minor issues to work through. Where we have more serious
audit ﬁndings are allegations such as allegations of a serious safety concern or an
indicator of forced labor. We have teams dedicated to investigating and following up
on these issues, whether they arise from our audits or from internal referrals or from
reports to the helpline or some other outreach to Walmart. Each case is reviewed
and follow-up may include worker interviews, it may include onsite investigation.
And we look into hundreds of these every year.
So, the next steps as a result of these reviews, depending on what we ﬁnd, right? So,
we moderate risk ﬁndings may result in consequences for suppliers, whether that be
what we call a strike or whether it be an orange rating for a facility. And when these
accumulate, the supplier can face serious business consequences up to and
including termination of business with Walmart altogether. And our merchant in
sourcing teams partner with us on these outcomes and promote the program in our
business decisions.
So with that, I'm happy to turn over to Karrie to talk a little bit more about what we
do beyond compliance because while compliance is a fundamental expectation,
Walmart's aspirations are broader than just this. And so to have strong and resilient
supply chains, we need to work with others to address systemic risks.
And so Karrie's going to talk more about that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27

Great. Thank you, Kristen, I really appreciate that. As you mentioned, systemic risks
such as forced labor, unsafe working conditions, gender inequity, these are all ones
that no one business and really no one sector can solve alone. And we know that
lasting and positive change is going to require both collaboration and focused
action.
So, on these issues that we have identiﬁed and really prioritized, we start ﬁrst and
foremost with where we can lead through the business. And Kristen, you already
shared some examples of that work. But from there, we look to identify where do we
have opportunities for collaboration with suppliers, with non-governmental
organizations, with experts, and other stakeholders so that we can better understand
not only root causes but also opportunities for further action. We've committed to
working with others to address risks to dignity of workers in at least 10 supply chains
by 2025. And you see some of the areas in which we've already focused this work on
the slide.
So, that includes things like apparel in Bangladesh, produce in the North American
corridor, tuna and shrimp in Thailand, and electronics that are being sourced into
our US retail market. Now, our work in these areas isn't limited to just these ﬁve and
is much broader. So, I encourage you to keep watching this space. As we continue to
learn we want to make sure that we are sharing what we learn and updating more on
this area.
Now, I've spoken about the approach that we use to address these systemic risks,
and now I'd like to illustrate it with an example of our work in responsible
recruitment. As we've talked about, responsible recruitment is a key issue in supply
chains like produce and seafood. And in 2016, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation
set an aspiration to help make responsible recruitment the standard business
practice for supply chains. And we want to do that and see that change within a
decade.
Now, responsible recruitment, what does that actually mean? It means that workers
should not pay recruitment or similar fees in order to get a job, even if it's allowed by
local law. Workers should be appropriately authorized to work, including meeting
local law and legal requirements around legal age and other requirements. This
really matters because paying for a job can make workers vulnerable. Workers who
pay for a job may ﬁnd themselves in debt before they even start work on day one.
And debt bondage is one of the most common forms of forced labor.
So, we know it's a serious and systemic issue. How are we making a diﬀerence? Well,
we start again where we can lead through our business. Our standards apply to our
suppliers, and they've long prohibited forced labor and labor traﬃcking. And we
expanded on this a few years ago by clarifying and emphasizing that this includes
ensuring that workers have not paid fees to get a job and that they fully understand
the terms of employment and the conditions before they ever leave to start their
employment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27

Karrie Denniston
Kristen AlbertsonBut again, Walmart can't do this alone. So, that's why last year, we launched a
supplier-focused initiative that was focused on responsible recruitment, where we're
inviting suppliers in a few key categories like produce to adopt and report on
practices that demonstrate leadership and leadership related to these kinds of
issues. So, things like responsible recruiting, worker engagement and connection,
and transparency.
In addition to working with suppliers, we extend and compliment this through
philanthropic investment from the Walmart Foundation because we know that
business alone isn't going to be in a place to solve some of the gaps and challenges
that really stand in the way for progress on the overall system.
So, for example, investments might focus on better understanding the prevalence of
recruitment issues and debt bondage, risk factors that are associated so we can
better target action. Some investments help to scale and support tools that can help
with transparency and data. Strengthening public policy systems or helping scale
demand for responsible recruiters.
Just one example, last year, the Walmart Foundation made an investment in the
global fund to end modern slavery. This investment was targeted in helping to create
safe migration corridors for migrants in Malaysia. Through giving tools and
knowledge and awareness of what a worker should expect while simultaneously
helping to accelerate the growth of an ethical recruitment agency.
Now that's just one. Through the Walmart Foundation since 2016, we've invested
over $40 million in these issues. And I would encourage and invite you to check out
the ESG report so that you can see our brief on people in supply chains and learn a
little bit more about this work.
Kristen, I think we still can't hear you.
Can you hear me now?
Yes.
Okay, the third pillar of our work on people in supply chains is building economic
opportunity for people working in supply chains, including the strategies that you
see outlined on the screen here. Again, these often involve business eﬀorts
combined together with philanthropy. So, for example, several of our businesses
have sizable supplier development and producer sourcing programs that createFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27

Kristen Albertsonopportunity for farmers and other small producers through the power of our
purchase orders.
We also provide training and share best practices, including through our Vriddhi and
Smart Initiatives in India to help small producers access markets generally. And,
ﬁnally, the Walmart Foundation has a dedicated grant portfolio that has awarded
more than $67 million since 2017 to beneﬁt over 730,000 smallholder farmers.
Programs funded, help these smallholders increase their yields, access markets,
incorporate sustainable agricultural practices, and strengthen farmer-producer
organizations.
So, Brendan, I think we'll hand it back to you.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Great. Thank you so much for that overview. And we'll just turn to the next slide so
that I can remind everybody where they can ﬁnd more information about this. You
can ﬁnd our ESG reporting on our corporate website, which is listed here,
corporate.walmart.com/esgreport. And if you want to read more about our policies,
which Kristen had mentioned earlier in the presentation, including our code of
conduct, our standards for suppliers, and other related issues, you can go to the site
that's listed there.
And so with that, we'll turn to the Q-and-A and we were fortunate enough to get a
few questions in advance from registrants, and we've seen a couple more pop up
while we've been doing the presentation. So, we'll start with the pre-prepared ones
and then move on to a couple of the other ones that have come in.
And just for everybody's awareness, we are grouping questions as well. So, we have
received a few that we're addressing very similar topics and we can address it once,
and so we'll do that as well. So, the ﬁrst question is, where are you collaborating with
other brands or retailers today? And do you see other such opportunities for
collaboration in the future?
And Kristen, I'll pass this one over to you.
Sure. So, I just returned from Southeast Asia where I was visiting suppliers in
Cambodia and Vietnam, and one of the challenges that I think comes up consistently
in these discussions is the challenge of building systems to increase worker safety
and dignity at large. And so the need for collective action on these topics is exactly
why we collaborate with other stakeholders in order to advance issues.
So, for instance, in Bangladesh, Walmart partners with Nirapon, an organization
focused on monitoring ongoing safety compliance and maintaining the progress
already made on safety in the industry, to monitor safety in our suppliers localFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27

Building Safety Initiative, and we proudly support the great work LABS is doing to
improve worker safety in apparel in footwear industries in Vietnam, India, and most
recently launched in Cambodia as well.
So, the progress of these initiatives, I think shows what can happen when private
companies and public and civil society join forces. We expect the products that we
purchase and sell are made in the right way by suppliers who act ethically and create
safe and fair working environments, as I already mentioned. LABS helps our
suppliers meet these expectations through prevention and mediation of issues
around factory safety.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Great. Sounds like a lot of good opportunities out there and some good successes
as well in the past that has worked out well, both for our business as well as for the
people who are impacted directly, so some potential great opportunities out there.
The second question is one that we got live here, and Kristen, I'm going to just pitch
it over to you because it relates directly to our responsible sourcing policies and
standards. But the question was, does Walmart prohibit the charging of recruitment
fees in connection with work in our supply chains?
Yes, we do. Walmart's principles on responsible recruiting do prohibit the charging
of fees and requires -- repayment of fees where we've discovered the same, and this
is true regardless of what the local law may say about that.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks for clarifying that. And you can see that, for Velika who asked the
question, you can see that in our Standards for Suppliers and otherwise in our ESG
reporting as well.
So, onto the next question that we've received here, is Walmart testing any new
technologies or strategies to get better supply chain visibility or better assure itself
of good outcomes in supply chains? And so Kristen, I think I'll start with you and then
Karrie, I know that we've been doing some investment from the walmart.org side as
well, so perhaps Kristen you can start, and then Karrie, you can pitch in at the end.
Sure. So, this is a great question and deﬁnitely one that is top of mind. And for those
of you who study innovation, you'll know that it's one thing to have a working
technology, and it's quite another thing entirely to get adoption at scale. So, one
area we're investing in for technology and in innovation is relating to a core need
and responsible sourcing for traceability of our supply chain. And as many hereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 18Karrie Denniston
Brendan Morrisseyknow, global supply chains can be complex and improved traceability supports our
responsible sourcing program.
So, we're exploring technologies now that allow us to have improved visibility along
our supply chain. One example is genetic testing of items that allows for testing and
veriﬁcation of sourcing records, both from a risk-based perspective or proactive
response as well. This will be particularly useful at the commodity level where
challenges are concentrated and traceability is more diﬃcult. So, we're exploring a
number of diﬀerent technologies in this regard.
And Karrie, I know we're also making some investments.
We are, we are, and Kristen, I think you talked about this, but one of the things that
we're seeing through the investments we're making philanthropically is this question
of scale and how do we get to scale? It's really key. So, through philanthropic capital,
we're working to test that approach, not only what works, but can we actually get to
adoption for some of these emerging technologies and get them to a place where
they can become more normative.
So, for example, in seafood, we have a series of Walmart Foundation investments
that are supporting, especially a group of organizations, to help advance
transparency tools for vessels at sea, right? This is an incredibly hard area to be able
to get information. There's a lot of complications with that, and technology can play
a really critical role. So, an investment with the Nature Conservancy is helping to
connect the dots between satellite monitoring, so eyes in the sky to electronic
monitoring on vessels that are working to surface issues of overﬁshing and other
sustainability concerns.
At the same time, we're investing with Global Fishing Watch and the University of
California at Santa Barbara. They're trying to accelerate that scale for electronic
monitoring on the vessels for long-line tuna vessels in the Western Central Paciﬁc
Ocean. But the key to all of that, have the technology and have the tools on the boat
and in the sky, it's not just about having it, it's about making it practical and about
making it actionable.
So, another investment Walmart Foundation has made with Global Fishing Watch is
actually trying to test the practice side of it. How do we engage with regulatory
bodies, with industry associations, so that data is getting into the hands of people
who can actually say, this is useful, I know what to do with it, I can now target a
response and I can prioritize places where action is most needed.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
That's great. Yeah, I mean, it's just a great example of how we're taking both a
business and then business approach to it and a compliance bridge to it, but then
complementing that with philanthropy to change the underlying systemsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27

Page 9 of 18Kristen Albertsondevelopments and technologies and really help everybody beneﬁt from our focus in
this space, which is the outcome that we want to see. So, I think a great illustration of
work in this space and our overall approach. Appreciate those responses.
Next question that we have -- we've received a number of questions around human
rights risk and how we kind of value -- how we approach human rights, risk, and
supply chains. So, can you speak to our corporate processes and provide some
examples about how we approach human rights, risk, and supply chains? So I'll start
with again, business ﬁrst and then probably philanthropy.
So Kristen, if you can start out and then Karrie if you can come in after that and talk
about our approaches as well?
Yes, that's a great question as well, and with a supply chain and a company as robust
as ours is, it's helpful to break down our thinking on human rights into a few diﬀerent
levels. One being governance, one being risk analysis, and another being deep
dives into speciﬁc issues. So, at the governance level, we have a cross-functional
human rights working group that supports Walmart teams in advancing respect for
human rights throughout our business.
The working group includes representatives from various functions including ethics
and compliance, Global People, which is Walmart's human resources organization,
labor relations, responsible sourcing, our Culture Diversity and Inclusion group,
global responsibility, government aﬀairs, corporate communications, and our legal
partners. The working group reports to the ESG steering committee, which is a
management committee composed of leaders from various Walmart teams that
reviews ESG issues and priorities here at Walmart. The ESG team is part of global
responsibility, coordinates this human rights working group.
In addition, our chief sustainability oﬃcer and executive vice president of Corporate
Aﬀairs provides regular updates about our ESG initiatives, including those related to
salient human rights issues to the nominating and governance committee of
Walmart's board.
So, on the analysis piece, we use the risk-based auditing system that I've discussed
already. This allows us to make sure we're focused on the most salient issues rising in
our supply chain and the geographies with the greatest exposure, and it allows us to
target our eﬀorts appropriately, based on what we see.
Walmart's Responsible Sourcing team conducts an annual risk assessment, as I
mentioned, and we utilize internal and external data to better understand social
compliance risks in our supply chain and, speciﬁcally, as it relates to certain
geographies and certain commodities. We take a risk-based approach to auditing
our suppliers disclosed facilities by allocating more resources to facilities located in
regions with greater potential risks, as I described earlier.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 18Brendan Morrissey
Karrie DennistonSo, these audits focus on a variety of issues, including worker compensation,
voluntary labor practices, working age laws and standards, working hours, and
facility health and safety standards. And, in addition to monitoring our suppliers
facilities through our audit program, Walmart investigates alleged violations of our
standards for suppliers that we detect through various reporting mechanisms,
including internal referrals, work grievance mechanisms, such as the Walmart Ethics
Helpline, and many other channels that we maintain for reporting.
We also respond to issues that we see in NGO reporting and in the media in this
way. And so substantiated ﬁndings, like I said, result in consequences for our
suppliers or their facilities or both up to and including termination of business with
Walmart.
And I see a question that I'll go ahead and address while we're on this topic. About
the eﬀectiveness of our helpline and how do we know it's working. I would say that
we have a very robust helpline and reporting process and we know it's working
because we see the calls coming in each year. And last year, we opened just around
700 investigations into reports and concerns. So, I think you can see from the volume
that we have a robust process in place for receiving allegations and reviewing them.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Anything you wanted to add on just the end of this question on the human rights
approaches?
Sure. And I think Kristen touched on a lot of them. I'll maybe just go a little deeper
on how we utilize perspectives from external stakeholders, NGOs, public reports,
and how we use philanthropy to extend that even more. So, one of the ways that we
use philanthropy is helping to invest in, I mentioned prevalence studies earlier. How
do we better understand as a sector, not for Walmart, but how does the world better
understand where risk is and how we can prioritize?
So, for example, we've worked with International Justice Mission on understanding
prevalence and seafood with Wilson Institute in produce in the North American
corridor, all focused on workers and potential risks so that we have more data to be
able to target that work. We also engage with stakeholders to pull out perspectives.
So that includes issues identiﬁed by the workers themselves. Through the
foundation, we've supported organizations like ITSA institute, Polaris, Sieto, they're
all doing important work to really generate this data and understanding of
prevalence and issues and give workers avenues to raise concerns that aren't about
anyone, retailer or any one company, but are actually about the system in the sector
overall.
We also do these kind of deep dives into the priority topics. So, Kristen touched on
our work on economic opportunity and livelihoods. One of the things we know as
we look at how small-scale producers are developing is that there are issues aroundFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 18Brendan Morrissey
Karrie Dennistongender equity for who is leading a farm, who is leading a business, and how we can
bring leadership and skill development for women producers. So, that they can take
more of that leadership role.
We have focused approach there. What are the barriers, what are the particular gaps,
and how do we utilize our programs and support to try to get at some of those
issues? That might mean leadership development, working with farmer producer
organizations where women are not only members, but sitting at the Board level,
enhancing skills and capabilities around production, focusing on things like crop
management and diversiﬁcation or connecting women particularly with ﬁnancial
products or technology products that can help them step into some of those roles.
So, it's really about identifying for each of these places, where are their particular
issues, what are the tools that we can put and how do we take those barriers and
really lean in and develop our programs to support them.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Great. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks, both -- thanks to both of you for the
comprehensive answer on that one. Appreciate it. The next question relates to place-
based initiatives. So, Karrie, I think I'll pitch it over to you. The question is, I read in
your disclosures about place-based initiatives with social components. Will Walmart
invest in additional place-based initiatives in the future as a means of helping to
control for social conditions in the supply chain?
So, Karrie, I'll pitch that to you.
For those of you who didn't read every aspect of our disclosure, maybe I will ﬁrst
start by talking about what a place-based project actually is and how we think about
it. So, the idea behind a place-based project is that it's a way of thinking a little bit
diﬀerently about sourcing and it's moving from kind of a linear relationship into one
that considers a landscape in a community and the outcomes, and I'll explain a little
bit more about that.
So, imagine you have 10 farms in a community, and of those farms, we have three
farmers who are really best-in-class in terms of sustainability, labor practices, social
conditions, really doing the things that need to happen to enhance economic
livelihoods and environmental outcomes. But the other seven farms in that area are
not up to that same standard.
Now, we can choose through our suppliers and community to really work with those
three, but the impact at a landscape level could still be really challenging. We can
still have negative outcomes for nature and for people in that community. So, what a
place-based project allows you to be able to do is actually consider and think about
that whole area, that whole landscape, that whole community, what is the plan and
how are we addressing changes and outcomes across environmental, social,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 12 of 18Brendan Morrisseyeconomic. It's about management, but it's also about conservation and restoration of
these places.
It's an important and critical tool that we're really excited about the potential of what
this can mean. But they're not easy to create, they're not easy to build. This involves
having governments, non-proﬁt organizations, multiple businesses who are all
coming together to really collaborate on that plan and help drive changes in how
practices are happening.
So, I'll give you one example of how this is starting to come to life, and you may have
read about this a little bit in recent announcements that have come out, but one
example is our sourcing of tuna from the republic of the Marshall Islands. And this is
a company Paciﬁc Island Tuna, which is a joint venture between the Nature
conservancy and actually the government of the republic of the Marshall Islands. The
tuna is sourced to MSC standards and we are sourcing it for our great value tuna in
our private brand.
What's diﬀerent about this and how this leans into the model of place-based and the
idea of it is that TNC reports that the initiative aspires to distribute 40% of the long-
term net income directly back into the community, conservation, and eﬀorts for
climate resilience. So that includes things like the development of marine protected
areas, coastal restoration and tourism and other economic factors that can be
supported through that kind of work.
Why this matters additionally for social components is this also sets a benchmark for
labor and traceability standards. So, we are able to have more visibility into those
practices because this is such a relationship that's built at the community level. It sets
a benchmark for industry action and it also shows how innovation can happen in
sourcing.
We are additionally working in commodities like rice. We anticipate that this will be
something that we are looking for additional places where this kind of model can
really work. And if you're interested in learning more about it, I'd encourage people
to check out Walmart's sustainability hub. It's a great source of information. We have
a page there on our nature approach and it does list some of the eﬀorts around
place-based projects as well.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
And if you're a Walmart supplier on the line today, you can use that. There's a great
map on there. I enjoy kind of playing around with that. This is how I spend my free
time, but checking that out to identify, take a look at diﬀerent place-based projects
that are out there that are looking for support that we've already taken a good look
at. So, please go ahead and take a look at that and others can as well. So, thanks
Karrie for giving us a rundown on that exciting stuﬀ.
Question for you, Kristen, that came in through the Q&A. It's around recruitment fees
and whether through audits or otherwise, we've identiﬁed instances in whichFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27

Kristen Albertsonworkers have been found to have paid recruitment fees or whether there has been
evidence alleged that people had paid recruitment fees and whether we've been
looking into those. So, if you can provide any -- shed any light on that, that would be
great.
Sure. The short answer is yes, we have received allegations of recruitment fees and
we have conﬁrmed a few of those allegations, and where we do so, we work directly
with the suppliers to implement a plan for a payment of these fees.

Great. Thanks for conﬁrming that. Moving on to the next question, is a lot of the
discussion's been around some of the eﬀorts underway, things that we're doing,
policies we have in place, things like that. This question is really around outcomes.
So, indications that the programs are working. We've been -- and we've touched on
some of those, right? The hotline and its eﬀectiveness because we're getting
allegations and are we identifying recruitment fees? The last question, things like
that. Are there any other things that you can point to in this space that tend to show
that the eﬀorts that we have underway are helping workers in the supply chain and
that there's been overall improvement?
So, let's see -- I'll start with Kristen, I guess again. And then Karrie if you have
anything to layer on we can turn to you.
Sure. I think that our responsible sourcing statistics are pretty illustrative in this area. I
already described sort of the volume of audit reports that we assess every year. And
another data point I can share is that nearly 28% of orange-rated facilities last year
were remediated to either yellow or green assessments as a result of the work that
we do. So, I think this is another telling number and we're also working to track
change on a wider level.
So, Karrie has talked some about our responsible recruitment initiative. We launched
a supplier-responsible recruitment initiative in March of 2022 at our supplier growth
forum. And the initiative invites suppliers, as Karrie described, to adopt and report
on practices related to recruiting, worker engagement, and transparency that experts
believe will facilitate responsible recruitment across business.
So, this helps us to ensure that the policies and standards we've put in place through
our responsible source and compliance program are adopted and understood
across supply chains, and it provides additional support to help make that happen.
I think another good example is the alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which
Walmart was a founding member of. The Alliance trained nearly 1.6 million factory
employees on basic safety and provided more than 1.5 million workers in a thousandFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27

Brendan Morrisseyfactories across to a helpline to anonymously report safety or other job-related
concerns. Approximately 93% of total remediation items across alliance-aﬃliated
factories were completed.
And although the alliance's work has concluded, we continue to prioritize safety in
Bangladesh through other programs, including NeoCon, an organization focused on
monitoring ongoing safety compliance and maintaining the progress that was
already made in Bangladesh through the alliance. This type of engagement I think is
indicative of how we work towards compliance and towards raising standards across
industries generally at the same time.
Maybe the only thing I would build on that, I think that was a great answer, Kristen is
just because we are trying to work where Walmart can lead and really lead through
the business, and Kristen just talk through some of the indicators, we really think
helps show progress and impact for workers and communities.
We are also really trying to get at that system level and continuous improvement.
Those things are just frankly harder to directly measure. And C, we did action A and
therefore here's what happens because it is a part of a system. There are some
things that we use as markers and some of them are large. So, for example, through
philanthropic investment in the Walmart Foundation, investment in an international
justice mission, that was around strengthening criminal justice system, that helped to
support work that led to prosecutions and convictions of traﬃckers. Those are big
things. They're symbolic. They really show us that the system is starting to have
resiliency and health and is starting to work.
But there are also indicators all along the way. There are workers being reached with
knowledge, tools, training. There are ethical recruiters that are starting to grow in
scale. There are indicators that the overall system resiliency is starting to identify,
here's expectation and here's where expectation isn't being met, and closing that
gap.
So, there's a lot of ways to think about impact. I think we're continuing to learn and
evolve in this space, and we really learn a lot from stakeholders who are also thinking
and evolving in this space. But we do think really seriously about the impact of the
actions that we're taking.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Great. Thanks to you both for addressing that. Certainly, a space to watch as it
develops and focus on outcomes, which is the ultimate goal here. Question for you,
Kristen, just on how we work with our suppliers on getting -- seeing improvements in
color ratings of their facilities over time. Can you just speak a little bit to how we
assess reports, the audit reports, and then the communication back to suppliers, and
work through our merchants as well to communicate expectations and promote
overall improvement?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 15 of 18Kristen Albertson
Brendan Morrissey
Karrie DennistonSure. As I mentioned, we have a dedicated team of compliance associates who
assess each and every report that comes through, and we work through our
responsible sourcing teams to provide feedback back to suppliers on our
expectations. And I think you can see from the numbers that we share in our FY '22
ESG report, in the brief on people in the supply chains. Sort of a breakdown on
these issues in last ﬁnancial year's reporting.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for that. And the stat earlier that you had shared on the approximately
28% of orange traded facilities upgrading to yellow certainly is a great sign, I think,
of the way that engagement and sharing of expectations with suppliers and our
policies around that is helping to improve things overall. So, thanks for that.
The next question that I have is just around regeneration. And Karrie, I think I'll pitch
this one over to you. The question recognizes that the company has made a -- set an
aspiration to become a regenerative company. And the question is around, well, how
does that relate to the issues that we're talking about today? How does that relate to
issue of people in supply chains? How does that relate to our overall ESG strategies?
So, perhaps you can speak to that a little bit and bring that to life.
Yeah, I'd be happy to. Thanks for the question, Brendan, because this one is, I think,
really at the heart of this work and everything that we've been talking about today.
So, maybe I'll start ﬁrst with why did we set this aspiration to become a regenerative
company, what does that really mean? And fundamentally, this is a business strategy
and it's a business strategy that explicitly puts people and nature at the center of our
business. It is a recognition that to be a strong company in the longer term, we have
to prioritize practices today that regenerate. Meaning, that they create rather than
extracting or merely being sustainable, we're creating a system where we're putting
more in than we're taking out.
And in reality, that is our ESG strategy. That's -- we're prioritizing the issues that
matter, that are relevant for the long-term success of the business, and we're doing
that in a way that also prioritizes the interests of our stakeholders. So when we look
at that and I think then about, okay, what does that actually -- how does that come to
life for people in supply chain? We look at the wide range of issues that we can focus
on.
And what becomes apparent is that, as a retailer, the dignity and welfare of people
who make products that we sell, who are a part of our customer base, who are part
of communities, people has to be a priority for us. We can't have a strong business
without them, and they also have to do well. Not only that, we have business assets
that can create tremendous value for people, workers, and producers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27

Karrie DennistonSo, our regenerative approach to this issue is one where business thrives and
becomes stronger because workers do better. They're safer, they're fairly paid, they
have economic opportunity that ripples into community where dignity, respect, and
livelihoods really are at the heart. And that -- the fact that it is a business strategy.
We've talked about philanthropy as a tool, we've talked about other mechanisms,
but because this really is core to the long-term aspirations for the business, it makes
it very real in our day-to-day.
So, hopefully that helps clarify a little bit.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Yeah, it does. Appreciate that, thank you. It's a -- these are sort of heady concepts
sometimes and it's hard to appreciate what a company means when it uses a word
like regeneration, and then in the very practical context of some of the issues that
we're dealing with today -- talking about today. So, that was helpful.
Just a quick question for you, Kristen, just around the scope of our standards for
suppliers. The question was asking to conﬁrm that they're in fact our global
standards and that's our universal expectations in the supply chain.
Yes, absolutely. Our standards are global in scope and apply to all of our supply
chain.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Great, thank you. Then we've got a question around sustainable seafood. The
question's with regard to Thailand, but I can broaden it and just say more generally,
and Karrie, perhaps you can take this one. Can you conﬁrm just the scope of the -- in
terms of both social and environmental and anything else you'd like to add on our
focus with regard to seafood?
Sure. Happy to. The answer to that is yes. We actually think about the intersection
between social, environmental, and economic as we look at the seafood sector and
those supply chains. And I'll just give an illustrative of example of why that becomes
so important. I spoke a few moments ago about the Nature Conservancy and Global
Fishing Watch and really thinking about electronic monitoring, and satellite
monitoring, and these kinds of tools.
It's actually very hard to separate the social and the environmental issues in these
kinds of cases. Because if a vessel is illegally ﬁshing, overﬁshing, not reporting
bycatch, utilizing practices that are not ﬁt for our base standards and things that we'd
like to see in accordance with our seafood policy, it's very likely that that same vesselFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 17 of 18Brendan Morrissey
Kristen Albertsonmay also have issues around recruitment and those kinds of practices on the labor
side as well. So, we see these as being really interrelated issues.
Now, the tools, and responses, and how we can support them, sometimes that
comes through an environmental lens, sometimes that comes through a social lens.
But really what we're trying to get at is addressing the issues at that more system
level again. And so, we often have to look at that as two sides to the same coin.
{BIO 20125820 <GO>}
Great. Makes a lot of sense. And then, in the context of our place-based initiatives,
which you spoke to earlier, it really speaks to -- in a situation where that would be an
ultimate outcome, where we're taking care of all of those issues at once and
addressing it that way. So, thanks for that.
I'll just take the last couple directly because they relate to sort of our ESG disclosures
writ large. And so, since I mentioned at the outset that I lead the ESG team here at
Walmart, one question was around -- some information around our small-holders
and diverse suppliers and how we think about that. What I'd encourage you all to do
is take a look at our brief, our ESG brief on supplier opportunity, as well as our
people in supply chains brief, which we've been referring to throughout. There's
quite a bit of information in there around our approaches to sourcing from diverse
businesses, from small-holders and things, and in particular markets, where we do
have pretty deep programs in that space.
In particular, in Mexico and in Massmart. Some really nice things happening there.
And then in the US, $13.1 billion sourced from diverse suppliers last year. Essential --
from around 2,600 suppliers. So, really meaningful sourcing when it comes to those
types of programs.
And then the last question that I saw that I can speak to before we end here today
was around just more -- wanting to see more speciﬁcity on the breakdown of
diﬀerent types of issues that we face and allegations and things. And that's good
feedback. We can take that as feedback just in terms of additional information that
folks would like to see to hopefully get a better appreciation that the systems we
have in place are working and that we're working with our suppliers in the right way
to address those issues. So, I think really good feedback.
So, with that, I think we've reached the end of our Q&A session here today. We're --
it's 9:54 here, Central time, and we'll wrap up. I want to thank my panelists, Kristen
and Karrie, for speaking with everybody here today. Hopefully, it's been useful for
you all. Any questions we didn't necessarily get to we'll shoot some responses out.
And thanks all for attending.
Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-10-27
