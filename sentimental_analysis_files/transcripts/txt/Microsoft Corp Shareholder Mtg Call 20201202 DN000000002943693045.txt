Welcome, I'm John Thompson Chair of the Board of Microsoft. Today we're holding
our Annual Shareholder Meeting in a virtual format. In doing so we strive to make
the meeting as inclusive as possible by oﬀering the same opportunities to
participate as provided at in-person meetings. We really appreciate your
participation today.
In addition to the live webcast of today's meeting shareholders and other
stakeholders have the option to view the meeting through Microsoft Teams on the
Investor Relations website. The team's broadcast will use Microsoft translator and
Azure service that uses cognitive services for real-time translation in several
languages. I'd like to share with you the presenters for our meeting. Speaking will be

Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
Dev will address the business and procedural portion of the meeting, followed by
Amy, who will review Microsoft ﬁnancial results, and ﬁnally Satya will reﬂect on our
progress over the past year and the opportunities that lie ahead. Following Satya's
remarks, we'll have a live Q&A session where Microsoft's President and Chief Legal
Oﬃcer, Brad Smith will join us. This past ﬁscal year included a time of
unprecedented societal and business challenges on a global scale. Through it all
Microsoft work to serve our customers, employees, shareholders and communities
throughout the world and I'm proud of how the company delivered. Microsoft
achieved strong ﬁnancial results and returned $35 billion to our shareholders in the
form of share repurchases and dividends. We look forward to the opportunities
ahead as we remain committed to the long-term interest of Microsoft shareholders.
I'd like to take a moment to address questions we received from several
shareholders about the makeup and diversity of the Board of Directors. I'll take a
moment to talk about the composition of the Board and how we think about
diversity. We have an ongoing commitment to creating a balance and eﬀective
Board with diverse viewpoints and deep expertise. This year's Board nominees
represent a wide range of backgrounds and experience with skills that contribute to
the Board's eﬀectiveness in managing risk and providing guidance to manage.
Of our 12 Board nominees, 11 are independent, which includes me as Board Chair
and all committee members. Microsoft's Board of Directors is one of the most
diverse of any company in the technology sector today. Seven of 12 or 58% board
members represent gender, ethnic, geographic or cultural diversity; and 5 of 12 over
40% of our Board members are women. Further, 3 of our 4 committee chairs are
chaired by diverse directors, and 2 of the 4 Board committees are chaired by
women.
Finally, as we continue to seek diverse representation on the board, we actively seek
highly qualiﬁed women and individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups to
include in the pool from which we select our candidates. As we look to the year
ahead, we remain focused on the opportunities Microsoft has in terms of its
business, shareholder value creation and the positive impacts the company can have
at a global scale. Our engagement with shareholders is not limited to this meeting.
Throughout the year, the Board and management consider shareholder feedback
we receive from a variety of sources. What we learn helps us prioritize our eﬀorts and
identify areas of emerging interest for the Board. Thank you for the trust you placed
in us and the opportunity to serve you and our company as a Director.
And now I'd like to call the 2020 Annual Shareholder Meeting to order. I'll be
serving as the Chair of the meeting and Dev will be serving as the Secretary. As Chair
of the meeting, I have adopted an agenda that will govern the Order of business
and the Rules of Conduct for the meeting. Copies of the agenda and rules are
available on the virtual meeting site as well as the annual meeting page on the
Investor Relations website. The rule of conduct also govern the Q&A session. DevFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Thank you, John and welcome everyone. I'll walk us through the short formal
meeting and then, as John said, you'll hear from Amy and Satya followed by a Q&A
session, but ﬁrst let's attend to a few formalities. The polls are now open for those
who have not voted and will close a few minutes after the presentation of our
business matters. If you previously voted via the Internet, phone or mail, you do not
need to take any additional action.
If you previously voted and wish to change your vote, please do so before the
closing of the polls using the voting buttons on the portal. After the polls close we
will release the preliminary results of the votes. The Board of Directors has appointed
Broadridge Financial Solutions to serve as Inspector of Election. A representative of
Broadridge is participating by conference call and serving as the Inspector. Joining
us today by conference call are Mike Thomson and Chris Webber representing
Deloitte & Touche, our Independent Auditors. In order to provide our shareholders
with the broadest opportunity to ask questions, we've had the shareholder question
portal opened since October 20th on the proxy vote website and have received over
200 questions from shareholders.
Shareholders wishing to ask a question may do so on the virtual meeting portal. We
will be taking both pre-submitted and live questions during the Q&A session. We are
committed to answering your questions and will address as many as time allows
during the Q&A session. We will also post a summary of all of the questions we
received that are applicable to Microsoft business with the answers on our Investor
Relations website.
The notice of the meeting and Internet availability of the proxy materials were
mailed by Broadridge Corporation beginning October 20th, 2020 and it went to all
shareholders of record as of October 8th, 2020. As a result, the meeting is being
held pursuant to proper notice. We have received proxies representing more than
86% of the roughly 7.6 billion shares of the company's stock that are eligible to vote.
This means that we do have a quorum present and the meeting is duly constituted
and will proceed. Today, we have three management proposals and one shareholder
proposal for you to consider. They were all described in the proxy statement for
today's meeting.
The ﬁrst item is the Election of Directors. The following 12 people have been
properly nominated by the Board. Reid Hoﬀman, Hugh Johnston, Teri List-Stoll, Satya
Nadella, Sandra Peterson, Penny Pritzker, Charles Scharf, Arne Sorenson, John
Stanton, John Thompson, Emma Walmsley and Padmasree Warrior. The Board
recommends a vote for each nominee. Our Board nominees are attending today's
meeting via Microsoft Teams.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Page 4 of 18Mari SchwartzerThe second item is an advisory vote to approve executive compensation as
disclosed in the Company's proxy statement. The Board, excuse me, the Board
recommends a vote for this proposal.
For the third item, we ask that you ratify the selection of the Company's independent
auditor Deloitte & Touche for ﬁscal year 2021. The Board recommends a vote for that
proposal.
The fourth item is a shareholder proposal. Requesting a report on employee
representation on the Board of Directors. The shareholder proposal and its
supporting statement are set forth in the proxy statement. The proposal has been
submitted by NorthStar Asset Management.
I recognize Mari Schwartzer, Director of Shareholder Activism and Engagement with
NorthStar Asset Management, who submitted an audio presentation in support of
the proposal. Please play Mari's presentation.
{BIO 20356237 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Mari Schwartzer of NorthStar Asset Management, a
socially responsible investment ﬁrm, representing 61,659 shares of Microsoft
common stock. Today, I'm presenting the shareholder resolution on employee
representation on the Board of Directors. Never before in our lifetimes have our
company or our employees faced such uncertainties as posed by the current global
pandemic. As our company works to navigate these unpredictable time, employees
and their relationship to our company can be the guiding force that allows us to not
only emerge safely, but also stronger and more competitive.
However, recent history has exposed numerous incidents in which Microsoft
employees have taken their frustrations public and spoken out against projects that
they believe go against the values of the Company. From protest against the
Company's work with ICE, amid a national outcry over the separation of immigrant
children from families to demands that Microsoft halt the military HoloLens project,
which an employee later described as "crossing the line into weapons
developments" and requested the company not bid on the Department of Defense
contract for the JEDI projects. Microsoft employees have repeatedly gone public to
voice their concerns. Not only that, but in the past ﬁve years, Microsoft has had to
face pending lawsuits from thousands of current or former employees, who've
alleged gender discrimination and sexual harassment within the Company.
This shareholder proposal seeks to help the Company's (inaudible) by asking for an
exploration of the ways in which non-management employees to attain membership
on the Board of Directors. We believe that more eﬃcient communication between
employees and the Board could lead to increased engagement and retention, faster
alerts to potential pending crisis, more eﬃcient expression of employee assessments
and workforce morale directly to the Board and much more.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 18Dev StahlkopfWe believe that all employees are critical to our company's continued success and
deserve a voice. We also believe that employees with a seat at the table are more
likely to remain engaged and committed to the company.
Our employees are the driving force of our company, but if their trust in
management falters due to disenfranchise or missteps, our company may suﬀer. To
prevent this we suggest allowing and encouraging representation on the Board by
non-management and non-executive employees. We believe that employee
representation on the Board is a key way to ensure that our employees are most
crucial resource remain fully engaged in the long-term growth of our company and
help to ensure operational excellence. We urge shareholders to vote for this
proposal.
{BIO 20589252 <GO>}
Thank you, Mari. The Board recommends a vote against the proposal for the reasons
stated in the company's proxy statement. Microsoft's Board of Directors has a strong
interest in ensuring the company has a work environment enable Microsoft and its
employees to thrive and seize the company's cultural transformation as a key
element behind our success over the past several years. Microsoft employees are
thoughtful and passionate and we think it's a sign of a healthy culture that
employees are comfortable sharing their diverse views. For context though, I'd point
out that as of last month Microsoft had more than 160,000 employees around the
world. Earlier this year, nearly 87% of our global workforce participated in our
conﬁdential employee engagement survey, which we call MS Poll. A few highlights
include 95% said they are proud to work for Microsoft, 92% said they'd recommend
it as a great place to work and 93% report having a positive working relationship with
their manager.
The Board engages in understanding and providing oversight of workplace culture
and employee experience through many mechanisms, including considering
comprehensive poll data from MS Poll. As a result, the Board does not believe that
the steps called for in this proposal are the best way to meet its important
responsibility. The discussion of the matters for shareholder consideration is now
closed and the polls also are now closed.
Now I'll share with you the preliminary voting tabulation. First, all 12 director
nominees on the ballot are elected with over 98% of votes cast. They'll serve until the
next Annual Shareholders Meeting and until their successors are elected and
qualiﬁed. Proposal to the advisory vote on executive compensation has been
approved by more than 94% of votes cast. Proposal threem ratiﬁcation of the
company's auditor Deloitte & Touche has been approved by over 96% of votes cast.
Finally, the shareholder proposal on employee representation on the Board of
Directors was not approved, receiving less than 6% votes cast. We expect to post the
details of the ﬁnal voting results on all of these matters on our Investor Relations
website later today. We'll also report the results in a Form 8-K that will be ﬁled with
the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days. With that, we've
completed the formal portion of the meeting and the meeting is now adjourned.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thank you, Dev. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As John
mentioned, the past ﬁscal year was unprecedented, transforming the way our
employees, customers, partners and communities live and work. In a challenging
environment, we were able to deliver record results with consistent execution, strong
customer demand and our ability to address our customers' evolving business
needs. Revenue grew 14% to over $143 billion, operating income grew 23% and
earnings per share grew 21%. Even in these changing times, our focus has remained
on strategically positioning the company for the future, with decisions optimized for
delivering greater customer value and long-term growth and proﬁtability.
To further enhance our talent and capabilities and strategic growth areas, we
completed 15 acquisitions in FY '20. Our acquisition of aﬃrmed networks alongside
our FY '21 purchase of Metaswitch enables us to further extend Azure to the network
edge, expanding our oﬀerings for telecom partners as they move to 5G. We
strengthened our security and compliance portfolio with three acquisitions including
CyberX, which will help secure customers IoT deployments. And we added to our
robotic process automation oﬀerings with the purchase of stock motive. As we
continue to invest in M&A and organic growth in FY '20, we also maintained our
commitment to capital return, which included total cash return of over $35 billion. In
September, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend and we
continue to execute against our current $40 billion buyback authorization.
Now, let me share a few highlights from last ﬁscal year. As customers accelerated
their digital transformations, we saw strong demand for diﬀerentiated cloud and
hybrid solutions, resulting in increased customer commitment to our platform and
higher usage. Our commercial cloud business surpassed $50 billion in revenue,
growing 36% year-over-year. Even at the scale, we saw strong growth across our key
services. Oﬃce 365 grew 24%, Azure grew 56% and Dynamics 365 grew 42%.
Importantly, we also continue to deliver on our commitment to make signiﬁcant
improvement in the commercial cloud gross margin percentage, which expanded 4
points year-over-year to 67%. Throughout the sustained eﬀorts of our engineering,
sales and marketing teams, we were able to drive expansion even with the revenue
mix shift to Azure, and increased usage to support our customers remote work
scenarios. Our server products and cloud services business reached over $41 billion,
up 27% with strong customer demand for our trusted, diﬀerentiated, hybrid
oﬀerings. From both the technology and licensing perspective, we continue to
address our customers need for ﬂexible and high-value solutions as they digitally
transform.
Now let's turn to progress across Microsoft 365. Throughout the year users continue
to realize the mission critical nature of the PC, driving demand for Windows and our
productivity apps. Windows 10 surpassed 1 billion monthly active devices. Our oﬃce
business saw double-digit revenue growth, even as we helped more commercial and
consumer users around the world to be more productive, collaborative and secure.
And as service, revenue grew to over $6 billion as we innovated across our existingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Page 7 of 18Satya Nadellaportfolio, with the latest Surface Pro, Laptop, Go, and Book devices, as well as the
new Surface Duo, dual screen device, adding to our family of category-creating
devices.
In LinkedIn, revenue exceeded $8 billion and grew 20% and in a challenging job
market, platform engagement continued to increase as members turn to the network
to connect and learn. In gaming, revenue exceeded $11 billion as we continue to
expand our opportunity to reach the world's 3 billion gamers. We saw record levels
of engagement and monetization across the platform and strong momentum in our
Game Pass subscription services, as new fans took advantage of content for over 100
studios.
Now a few comments on the current ﬁscal year. First, we announced our plans to
acquire ZeniMax Media, the parent company of the Bethesda Softworks. One of the
largest privately-held game developers and publishers in the world. This addition,
which we expect to close in the second half of this ﬁscal year will further bolster our
ﬁrst-party content and fast growing subscription services. Second, we are oﬀ to a
strong start in the ﬁrst quarter of FY '21, highlighted by commercial cloud revenue
growing 31% to over $15 billion, reﬂecting consistent execution by our sales teams
and partners and continued investment in strategic growth areas and even in this
challenging and competitive environment, we expect another year of double-digit
revenue growth in our commercial segments. These results would not be possible
without the contributions of more than a 160,000 Microsoft employees around the
world. Looking forward, we believe the highest shareholder value comes from
investing for the future and creating diﬀerentiated high value solutions for every
organization and person to achieve more. With that we remain committed to
investing with signiﬁcant ambition across strategic growth -- high-growth
opportunities.
We will continue to aggressively expand our cloud infrastructure to support growing
usage and demand across our cloud oﬀerings and we will continue to deepen our
engagement with customers and partners. Given our strong ﬁnancial position and
free cash ﬂow generation, we will do all of this while supporting our commitment to
capital return. Microsoft does well when our customers do well, and our increasing
competitive diﬀerentiation and ability to consistently execute, position us for
continued growth as we remain focused on our customer's success.
With that please join me in welcoming our Chief Executive Oﬃcer, Satya Nadella.

Page 8 of 18I want to extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who is working tirelessly to get us
through especially those in the front lines across healthcare, education, public sector,
critical manufacturing, grocery and retail. Amid this disruption, I'm proud of how our
ecosystem has stepped up to help people and organizations apply technology to
build resilience and transform.
To share just a few examples, in Italy, the University of Bologna moved courses for
80,000 students online in just three days with Teams, our ﬁrst in the schools 900
plus year history. In healthcare, Dr. Amanda Randles at Duke University used Azure to
conduct hundreds of millions of simulations to help more patients have access to
ventilators. And the NBA and the NFL have used our technology to reimagine the
game experiences for fans. As Amy mentioned amidst this rapid change, we have
delivered strong results. And as we look ahead, our opportunity has never been
greater. The next decade of economic performance for every business will be
deﬁned by the speed of their digital transformation. Across our technology stack, we
are accelerating our innovation to help our customers improve time to value,
increase agility and reduce costs. More than ever organizations are relying on Azure
to stay up and running and support critical workloads from healthcare triage with the
AI assist bots to digital twins in manufacturing to e-commerce and retail. We are
building Azure as the worlds computer to support them with 67 datacenter regions,
more than any other cloud provider.
Azure is the only cloud that extends to the edge, enabling us to meet the customers'
needs, wherever they are. At the data layer, Azure brings together limitless data and
unmatched analytics so companies can manage. discover and gain insights from day
data in real time. And in AI we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools,
frameworks and infrastructure enabling organizations to build applications that see,
hear, speak, search, understand and accelerate decision-making.
Developers are critical to value creation in every industry and their productivity is key
to business performance. We have the most used and loved tools to help
developers to go from idea to code and code to cloud from Visual Studio to GitHub,
which now has more than 50 million users. We are empowering domain experts so
that they can increase the rate of digitization in their organizations.
More than 10 million citizen developers and business decision makers now use
Power Platform to create apps, build Virtual agents, automate workﬂows and analyze
data. With Dynamics 365, we are helping organizations in every industry go from
reactive to proactive and make every part of their operations remote, from
manufacturing to supply chain management to sales and customer service, including
new scenarios such as contactless shopping. And with LinkedIn more than 722
million professionals can connect, learn and plan for the future. There is no question
that the way we work, learn and experience events has changed dramatically over
the last year.
With Microsoft 365 and Teams we are empowering people and organizations to be
more productive and secure as they adapt to new ways of working and learning. The

Teams now has more than a 115 million daily active users. Teams is the only solution
with meetings, calls, chat, content collaboration with Oﬃce, as well as business
process workﬂows, and we are accelerating our innovation shipping more than 100
new Teams capabilities in the last six months. Identity, security, management and
compliance underlie our entire stack, more than ever this is a strategic priority for
every organization and we are the only company that oﬀers the end-to- end
capabilities to protect and manage data, devices, identities and infrastructure
enabling a zero trust architecture.
Finally, people everywhere are turning to gaming to sustain human connection,
while practicing social distancing. Xbox Game Pass now has over 15 million
subscribers. Our pending acquisition of ZeniMax will add iconic franchises to more
than 100 games already available. And our new consoles are the most powerful and
aﬀordable ones available. Along with our expanding opportunity, we recognize our
responsibility to help solve the world's challenges, not create new ones. We view this
as four interconnected pillars. First, we must ensure economic growth is inclusive.
This requires that we keep everyone with the opportunity to pursue the jobs of a
changing economy. That's why we are helping 25 million jobseekers gain skills for in
demand roles.
Second, we unequivocally support the fundamental rights of all people from
defending democracy to addressing systemic racial injustice and inequity for the
Black and African-American community in the United States and for vulnerable
communities globally. Third, we must protect the planet by working towards a more
sustainable future. We have set ambitious goals to be carbon negative, zero waste
and water positive by 2030. And we have created a $1 billion fund to accelerate the
development of carbon reduction and renewable technologies. Finally, we are
committed to building trust in technology and its use spanning privacy, security and
responsible use of AI and transparency.
In closing, over the next decade, technology spending as a percentage of GDP is
projected to double and we are uniquely positioned to not only participate in that
growth, but drive it by expanding our impact in building technologies that empower
every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Thank you all
very much.

Relations here at Microsoft. I'm joined today by Satya, Amy and John, as well as

A - Brad Smithafter meeting with responses on our Investor Relations website. As we reviewed the
submissions, there were several questions asked on similar topics, so we've selected
a representative question from those submitted to answer today. So with that, let's
go ahead and get started.
Satya, Our ﬁrst question is from Samuel J and one that has been on everybody's
mind this year, is remote work and learning the future?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
First of all thank you all for joining today's meeting. Mike you're absolutely right, I
mean 2020 has been unlike any other year, any of us have seen. And the constrains
the pandemic is put on us being together as families or in the workplace are severe
and yet in spite of that, the fact that we been able to sustain the level of economic
activity in connectedness is pretty stunning to me. In fact, thanks to I think the current
generation of digital infrastructure that has been put in place in particular cloud
technologies, that has been allowing us to do what we are doing, whether it's
remote education or remote everything, right, whether its sales or your ongoing
operations have all been able to sustain a level of productivity that's pretty
unprecedented.
But to your question, I think we deﬁnitely are going to have real structural change.
So, when we remove the pandemic constraints, I don't think we just go back to
where things were in the beginning of 2020 or late 2019, what that diﬀerence is
going to be is going to be diﬀerent by geography, by function, by business type and
industry. But one thing is certain digital technology is going to be key to any
company dealing with even future tail events are both from a resilience perspective
and the agility with which you adapt to change is going to be driven by digital
technology. And so that's I think perhaps the bigger awakening coming out of even
this particular crisis.
{BIO 20838577 <GO>}
Thanks Satya. We received over 20 questions on issues relating to diversity and racial
injustice and a shareholder asks, how does focusing on racial injustice increased
shareholder value? Brad, why don't you start?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Well, we fundamentally believe that the work we're going to address racial injustice
serves Microsoft well and serves our shareholders well. We're doing three things.
We're focused on building the diversity of African-American and black individuals in
our workforce and then we're working externally as well. And there is a couple of
things that I think are really important to think about. We have long not just believed,
but known that we do our best work when we have an employee population that
reﬂects the diversity of the customers that we need to serve. And in the United States
today 14.6% of the people who live here are black or African-American. We're
nowhere near close to that inside Microsoft.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 18A - Mike Spencer
A - Satya Nadella
A - Mike SpencerSo we have important work to do and we believe that this is the kind of work that will
enable us to better serve a very large and important group of customers. Think
about this, there are 48 million black citizens in the United States, that's more people
live in Australia or in Canada or in Spain, and those are large and important markets
for Microsoft. As we become more diverse inside the company, we will do a better
job of serving these customers. And then there's the other aspects of our work with
our business ecosystem, in our communities where we're working to help address
the fundamental systemic racial structures that continue to hold back black
Americans.
This is fundamentally important to us as a company we believe because we cannot
be successful company unless we live in healthy communities and healthy country.
We can't do it all, no company can, but we do believe we can make a diﬀerence. Just
to give you one example, every data point today shows that if you're growing up as a
black students in the United States, you are far less likely to even have the
opportunity to study computer science in school. And with our (inaudible) Program,
technology education and literacy in schools, we will bring computer science to over
500 schools -- high schools in the United States in the next ﬁve years that
predominantly serve black and African-American students, that is the kind of area
where we believe we can do what we do best. We can contribute to helping address
an important problem and we can contribute to a more healthy country that will
beneﬁt us as a more successful company.
{BIO 20838577 <GO>}
Thanks, Brad. Our next question is for Satya and a shareholder asks, what is being
done to set Xbox apart from the PS-5 to win the console war? And can you provide
an overview of our gaming strategy, Satya?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Sure. First thing, we are very excited about the new console launches in the market.
We always have sort of focused on ensuring that our gamer community that count
on us to produce the best consoles has a new generation of consoles, which are
powerful and really great for game play and we are supporting it with the best
content, with the best community. But the broader vision we have is to ensure that
the 3 billion gamers out there are able to play their games, anywhere they want with
all the content they want and with whom they want to, and that's really what we are
building our strategy around. You've seen us double our content portfolio with
ZeniMax acquisition, you see us make advances in our community eﬀorts and our
subscription oﬀers with Game Pass and that's what you can expect from us. We are
absolutely very, very much focused on gaming and ensuring that all the 3 billion
gamers around the world get the best content, best community and the best cloud
services to power their gaming experiences going forward.

Well, from a strategic perspective, we're focused on a couple of things, one is on
growing diverse representation on many diﬀerent in this year, not just in the US, but
around the world, and fundamentally by focusing on recruiting, retaining,
developing and promoting people as they rise through the ranks. And we have a
host of tactical and programmatic aspects that support all of these things. One
example is in our recruiting, we really strive to ensure that way we interview
candidates, we have a diverse slate, diverse by gender, diverse by race and the like.
We then really focus on fostering a more inclusive workplace because after all we
get this enormous beneﬁt of having people who can think creatively and diﬀerently,
but we only maximize that beneﬁt when we learn from each other, when we listen to
each other. So we have a variety of programs led by the HR in the whole company
that helps us do that. And then ﬁnally, I would say if there is one thing we've learned,
is that this is the type of exercise that requires a determined, sustained, persistent
approach over time. This is not a goal that one realizes in one or two years, but we
do know this. When we stick to it year-after-year and get better and better, we will
make major strides and that's what we're determined to do.

Thanks, Brad. Satya, we've got a question asking about augmented reality, virtual
reality and edge computing. Could you talk about our strategy on cloud and edge
computing and what we're seeing as new patterns of growth for the cloud?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Sure. One of the most exciting things that's happening in technology is how
computing is getting embedded in the real world. And that's what we mean when
we talk about the cloud and the edge as the distributed computing fabric that really
is now part and parcel of every factory, every hospital, every retail space, all
connected to the cloud, creating this opportunity for us to create amazing new
experiences and applications.
In fact, HoloLens is one such. When you think about augmented reality, what you're
really doing is you're taking, what you see and super impose in it, augmented
objects or holograms. And that means reconstructing that reality and making it
digital and virtual. And HoloLens essentially is an edge device for Azure, and that
notion of distributed computing has been something that we've been focused on.
We have always led with hybrid computing as a core diﬀerentiator for Azure. And
you see it today with whether with HoloLens or Azure Stack or even Azure Sphere,
which is there in every Starbucks coﬀee machine today. So that's really our vision,
which is to be able to ensure that Azure as distributed across the cloud and the
edge, and truly powerful experiences such as HoloLens and augmented reality and
mixed reality is something that customers can use for training too, even gaming.

Amy?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Mike. As I talked about in my comments a bit earlier, which we're proud and
consistent, balanced and comprehensive approach we've taken to capital return
over the past few years. And in fact, we really think about it having four priorities. The
ﬁrst and the most important is to invest in ourselves for innovation, for product
diﬀerentiation and to create value in long-term growth, including funding many of
the things you've heard Satya and Brad talk about earlier.
Second, our most important -- our second priority is really constructing inorganic
opportunities, like ZeniMax, GitHub, LinkedIn that we've talked about to help us
accelerate or expand our addressable markets. And then ﬁnally, we think about the
other two key distributions as part of capital return, dividends and share buyback.
And as we have over the years, we remain committed to supporting long-term
shareholder return to the inclusion of all four of these priorities.
{BIO 20838577 <GO>}
Thanks, Amy. We have another question here for Satya. We received 14 questions
relating the product innovation and our diﬀerentiated strategy. And a shareholder
asked, any plans to increase your security compliance and identity footprint, Satya?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Absolutely. In fact, this has been a breakout year for our security and compliance
portfolio, especially in a pandemic this has become a top priority for our customers
and we are seeing increased adoption across the entire portfolio. And really we have
most comprehensive view on what it takes to have both the security infrastructure
and the operational security posture. Starting with identity, with endpoint in devices,
application security and infrastructure security and the ability for any organization
out there, whether they're in the private sector or in the public sector, irrespective of
their size, they can count on our services to help them implement what -- the world
talks about a zero trust architecture.
And to me we have made tremendous progress, we have a fantastic roadmap, but
you can absolutely count on us to ensure that the power of the security and
compliance solutions is something that we truly democratize in terms of access. No
matter what devices you're using, what applications you're using or even what cloud
infrastructure you're using, you can count on Microsoft to be there, providing you the
right services for security and compliance.

Thanks, Satya. I'm going to turn to Brad for this next one. And we have received
several questions related to privacy, including one from the shareholder who asked,
what more can be done to protect consumers privacy, Brad?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 14 of 18A - Brad Smith
A - Mike Spencer{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Well, I think it's a great question and it's such evident importance to so many
customers and shareholders around the world. I would start with the tenant that
really guides everything we do, when it comes to privacy. That when our customers
store their data with us, it's still belongs to them. It's your data not ours. It's our
responsibility to act as a steward, who really protects the privacy and the security of
the information you entrust with us.
I think it's a great question, because it's sort of certain challenges us. The question is
what more can we be doing? And I would point to three things. First, we constantly
need as a company to keep adding more technology tools and protections that will
enable people to not just safeguard, but actually manage their personal information
the way people want and we've been very focused on doing this. If you use our
services and if you are a shareholder, I hope you do, go to
account.microsoft.com/privacy. And what you can do is entering your account name,
your password and what you'll see is a variety of very easy to use, but very powerful
and robust tools. So you can see the data that you've entrusted with Microsoft and
you can control how the privacy of that data is managed. And you'll see us continue
to take new steps that add new privacy controls and features, but I think that as you
can see, we need to create them, but they're going to be eﬀective only if you as a
shareholder or a customer decides to use them. It's a little bit like a safety belt or a
seat belt in your car, you need to buckle up if you want to be safe.
Now the second thing we're focused on is not just our technology, but our business
practices and the other steps that we can take and we're taking more all the time.
One of the things we appreciate is, how important the privacy issue is. There are
many people in Europe today. It's important to everywhere, but I'd say it is of even
greater attention there. And that's what led us just a couple of weeks ago to take
some additional steps to protect the privacy of our enterprise and public sector
customers in Europe. We plan to step, we would undertake eﬀorts to go to court if
need be, whenever we have a lawful basis to do so, to defend the data that belongs
to these customers from being obtained by a foreign government without their
knowledge and approval.
So you're going to see us take more steps in this category as well and then there's a
ﬁnal area, I think it's an area of importance for all of us. We need good laws, modern
laws that protect people's privacy. And this is probably the most important in the
United States for a very simple reason. There are 110 countries around the world that
have a National Comprehensive Privacy Law, but the United States is not one of
them. So we have been working very closely with Republican and Democratic
leaders alike in the Senate, where there is a major eﬀort to pursue privacy legislation
and we're hopeful that 2021 will be the year when we see it in active. I think you put
those things together, what really underscores is this need for us to be thinking
broadly and acting comprehensively, you can see, that's what we're striving to do.

A - Brad SmithThanks, Brad. Our next question is about LinkedIn, it comes from Fritz Eikelberg [ph].
He asks, with the aging population, what are the plans for LinkedIn to maintain a
robust platform of younger professionals entering the workforce? Satya, can you
take that one?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Sure, absolutely. LinkedIn, and our core mission with LinkedIn is to make sure that
everybody, irrespective of their age is able to ﬁnd economic opportunity and realize
their economic potential. With the strength of the social network, they build on
LinkedIn and beyond that's really the core for us, because as population ages, we do
need to make sure that both the younger population as well as the older population
can both ﬁnd the economic opportunity that's really the pressing need of our times
and we are very focused on that. Speciﬁcally for some of the younger folks who are
joining our LinkedIn, we're making sure, for example, the engagement tools like the
news feed have new modalities. Story is something we just launched this fall. We're
very excited about that, but the key purpose of LinkedIn is to help you build that
social network, that professional network, that can mentor you to help you grow the
skills and the credentials to ﬁnd your economic opportunity.
So that's at the core of LinkedIn and skilling. If you think about what even coming out
of this pandemic, one of the most important things is, how are you able to
continuously get the new skills, the new credentials that will lead to your next
economic opportunity. So we are very much focused on LinkedIn Learning, LinkedIn
social engagement to build those mentor networks and the professional networks
that really help you realize your economic opportunity.
{BIO 20838577 <GO>}
Thanks Satya. Our next question is for Brad. A shareholder asked, how does
Microsoft envision public-private partnerships for better cyber security to protect
against hacker attacks?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Well, I think that we live in a time where the only way to protect customers from
these kinds of cyber attacks is in fact to have a strong partnership between the
public and private sectors. We need governments to move with strong laws. We
need international collaboration between governments. So they're sharing
information with each other, that they are doing the kinds of things that only
governments can do including holding other nations accountable, when we see
nation state cyber attacks. As we are this year, for example, with the unfortunate,
almost tragic increase in the kinds of cyber attacks, we're seeing against a wide
variety of public health organizations and even hospitals.
But this is in the area where the private sector has a large role to play. It's diﬀerent
from I think a lot of other national security or public safety issues for a very simple
reason. So much of our digital infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector,
whether it's the cables that go underneath the ocean or data centers or servers and
in many ways that even extends to individuals and enterprises because after all, we
all have devices that we carry around with us that are connected all the time. So whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 16 of 18A - Mike Spencer
A - Brad Smithwe've been focused on doing is taking more steps, not just individually, but as an
industry to increase what we're doing.
At Microsoft, we sponsored and really help champion two years ago, what's called
the Tech Accord [ph], it now has a 147 signatories from roughly 25 countries around
the world, where we work together as an industry to strengthen cyber security
defenses and then partner with governments by sharing information and
coordinating our responses. So the last thing I'll say is, this continues to be an area
where we need new kinds of institutions to play a signiﬁcant role. That's why one of
the things we're excited about as a company is the role we have the opportunity to
play and helping along with lots of others create a new non-governmental
organization, the cyber peace Institute, which is now headquarter in Geneva,
Switzerland and it is the kind of organization that can help bring both the public and
private sectors together because it has experts, they enable the sharing of data to
identify the kinds of changes in the cyber security landscape that are important.
They're sharing best practices to harden our defenses really on a global basis and
they are helping the public and private sectors come together to really advance
stronger international laws, which we have also long championed in this space. So
we really do believe that this not only remains one of the critical issues of our time,
but it is the kind of issue that calls almost uniquely for this kind of public and private
sector collaboration.
{BIO 20838577 <GO>}
Thanks, Brad. Our last question is one of four received on the topic of environmental
sustainability and governance and it comes from Robin R, who asks what is Microsoft
plan to become carbon-neutral, not by investing in oﬀsets, but truly becoming
carbon-neutral, thereby setting the example for the entire industry? Brad, do you
want to take this one?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Sure. It's a great question, because I think it really asks us to think about two things.
One is what is the level of ambition we need to pursue. And then second, frankly,
what is the conversation we need to have in order to achieve it. Now, when it comes
to our ambition, it is not Microsoft's goal simply to be carbon-neutral. We put a huge
stake in the ground when this year began. Satya Amy, and I have the opportunity to
stand up together. The entire Board of Directors really stood behind us and we said
that as a company, Microsoft will be carbon negative by the end of this decade.
What that means is that we want to remove from the environment every year
beginning by 2030, more carbon then we emit. We won't be on that, we then said
goodbye 2050 we would remove from the environment, all of the carbon that
Microsoft has emitted since the company was founded in 1975.
And that continues as we approach the end of the year to be I think the kind of
brand goal, the world needs and it's a goal that we're still hoping other companies
will step forward and match. I think it's worth thinking about what does it mean to be
carbon negative, well in part, it really requires that we reduce our own carbon
emissions so that we're emitting less. And this is where Amy part of the company hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 17 of 18A - Mike Spencerreally led the way in my view with a host of operational improvements. We have an
internal carbon tax that now applies to all of the various carbon emissions, we have
not just directly, but indirectly from our supply chain and from the use of our
products. We've rolled out new reporting expectations for everybody in our supply
chain. We have new initiatives to work with our suppliers to help them reduce their
emissions and we've created a new coalition to net zero, where we're partnering with
customers to really champion work [ph] from each other's best practices, that's how
we reduce emissions. But the removal piece is also really important and this is a key
part, I think of this question, which is why I think it's interesting. In the past, say 2015,
Microsoft was a typical company that was active in this space.
We spent money on what we've called oﬀsets. What's an oﬀset? Well, a lot of times it
means that you're paying say somebody with trees, not to cut them down. That's a
good thing, but when you think about it, what are you really paying somebody to do.
You're paying them to do nothing and when we think about the magnitude of the
climate crisis the world needs to address, it's just so clear, this is not a problem that
we will solve by doing nothing. That's why when we rolled out our new initiative in
January, we said we won't pay for those kinds of oﬀsets anymore. We will only paid
for the active removal of carbon from the environment and that can be nature based
techniques, which can be paying somebody to do something by planting trees, that
would otherwise not be planted. And really sort of the future what it means is using
new technology to remove carbon, whether it's from (inaudible) is manufactured or
from the air or from the water, this is where the billion dollar Climate Innovation Fund
will help spur the kinds of innovations that will then make use of as a company to
pay for the removal of carbon.
And this July in some ways, I think quite possibly, we took the single most important
step over the last 12 months. We issued in our faster proposal as a company to
purchase the removal of a million metric tons of carbon, not in the next decade, but
in the next year. And already, we're seeing that this is having a pretty dramatic eﬀect
in the marketplace around the world. It's sending a signal, if you will, that where we
go, others will go. There is a demand for services to remove carbon from the
environment and I think that's the kind of thing that the private sector across the
board can continue to help spur. So it's not about neutrality. Neutrality, as we set to
ourselves is not enough. It is about becoming carbon negative as a company and
ultimately becoming net zero as a planet by the middle of this century meeting that
what we're removing globally as a planet matches what we're emitting every year. So
we're excited about it. It was a big step in January. You'll see us give you an update
next month, next year in January when we have another report on what we're doing.
