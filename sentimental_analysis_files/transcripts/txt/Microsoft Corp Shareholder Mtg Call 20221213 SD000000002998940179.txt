The other of the proxy materials were mailed by Broadbridge, beginning October 27
2022, and went to all shareholders of record as of October 12, 2022. As a result, the
meeting is being held pursuant to proper notice. Based on the shareholders proxies
received Broadbridge reports that a quorum of shareholders is present to conduct
this meeting.
Today, we have three management proposals and six shareholder proposals for you
to consider. They're all described in the proxy statement for this year's meeting. The
ﬁrst item is the election of directors. The following 12 individuals have been properly
nominated by the board: Reid Hoﬀman, Hugh Johnston, Teri List, Satya Nadella,
Sandra Peterson, Penny Pritzker, Carlos Rodriguez, Charles Scharf, John Stanton,
John W. Thompson, Emma Walmsley, and Padmasree Warrior.
The board recommends that those (inaudible) for each nominee. Our board
nominees are attending today's meeting via Microsoft Teams. The second item is an
advisory vote to approve executive compensation as disclosed in the company's
proxy statement. The board recommends a vote for this proposal.
For the third item we ask that you ratify the selection of the company's independent
auditor, Deloitte and Touche for ﬁscal year 2023. The board recommends a vote for
this proposal. The next six items are shareholder proposals. These are set forth in the
proxy statement along with the proponents supporting statements and Microsoft's
opposition statements. First is a shareholder proposal submitted by RidgelineFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

{BIO 2113489 <GO>}
Good morning shareholders and board members. My name is William Flaig founder
and CEO of Ridgeline Research. The investment advisor to the American
conservative values ETF. On behalf of the shareholders, I move for shareholder
proposal number one, requesting that Microsoft issue a public report detailing a cost
beneﬁt analysis of the global diversity and inclusion eﬀorts. A summary of the results
should subsequently be included in the next annual update of Microsoft's Global
Diversity and Inclusion report.
This is a pro shareholder proposal. We view all corporations as being organized to
provide the best quality goods and services to their customers, while maximizing
return to the investors who fund the company. And shareholders, we feel Microsoft's
current global diversity inclusion report lacks a quantiﬁed net beneﬁt to
shareholders and is thus incomplete.
Shareholders recommend that the report evaluate any risks, beneﬁts and costs
associated with Microsoft's global diversity inclusion program presented in an
objective quantiﬁable manner which will allow a quantitative cost beneﬁt analysis.
We feel management's statement and opposition misses the point. Their position
that justiﬁcation undercuts what they know to be true belittles our legitimate right as
shareholders to question their truth. We have no insight into the results of the
request or report. Our request gives Microsoft the freedom to take initiative setting
the terms and framework of the calculation.
Management also hasn't raised any objections to the practicality of calculating the
cost beneﬁt. This proposal is an opportunity for our company to take a leadership
role on the issue of diversity inclusion, going beyond blind faith by demonstrating its
value to the bottom line. I encourage all shareholders to vote for shareholder
proposal number one, requesting a cost beneﬁt analysis of Microsoft's global
diversity and inclusion eﬀorts. Thank you.
Our leadership and board believes diversity and inclusion is fundamental to
Microsoft's long-term success. We provide more information on our diversity and
inclusion programs and policies in our annual Global Diversity and Inclusion report.
To single out diversity and inclusion initiatives as requiring a public justiﬁcation of
costs and beneﬁts would undercut the importance of these initiatives to Microsoft
and our shareholders, particularly when we believe this request is motivated by
skepticism of those beneﬁts. As a result, the board recommends a vote against this
proposal.
Next is a shareholder proposal submitted by Northstar Asset Management
requesting that Microsoft report on our hiring of those with arrest and incarcerationFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

{BIO 22858310 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Tenzing Tashishar, of Northstar asset management, a
socially responsible investment ﬁrm, and shareholder of Microsoft common stock.
Today, I am presenting shareholder resolution number two, proxy item number ﬁve.
Microsoft made a commitment to fair chance employment practices when
management signed the fair chance business pledge in 2015, and joined the Second
Chance business coalition. Although we commend these actions, the company's
hiring process falls short of exhibiting best practices in hiring from this pool of talent.
Fair Chance employers are not blind to criminal records. Hiring Managers still
perform background checks and consider suitability. Given the disproportionately
high incarceration rates of black and brown people in the US, the company is
ignoring an opportunity to combine our commitment to the Fair Chance pledge, and
our publicly stated commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. According to the
NAACP, white men with a criminal record are more likely to get an interview than
black men with no criminal record. And studies have shown that black American men
with criminal records experience a 65% reduction in Job callbacks.
Getting a job once you have a criminal record is compounded by racial
discrimination. Our proposal is about fair chance employment, the recruitment of
people with criminal records that may help solve critical labor shortages, and
improve the US economy long term. However, any consideration of policies related
to the US criminal justice system needs to be analyzed with an eye towards rounding
out racial inequity. While Microsoft management has made commitments to advance
fair chance hiring practices and a diverse workforce, insuﬃcient tracking, analysis,
and concrete measures of success towards accomplishing these dual, yet
intersectional goals may lead to failure, and worse, to costly accusations of
discrimination.
Let's make sure we are successful in our commitments. We believe it's clear that
oﬀering a fair chance of employment to people with arrest or incarceration records
must be developed in tandem with an examination of racial equity. Otherwise, it's
entirely possible that company practices may be unknowingly perpetuating racial
inequity. We know that's not what Microsoft wants. While we appreciate the steps the
companies taking on this issue, we urge Microsoft to take the next steps towards
best practices in Fair Chance employment. Shareholders, we urge you to vote for
shareholder proposal number two, item number ﬁve on proxy. Thank you.
Microsoft has a demonstrated history of providing an inclusive workplace free of
unnecessary barriers to those with criminal records. This includes data we have
previously publicly reported that for the last two years and overwhelming 98% of the
time, we proceeded with a higher oﬀer after a candidate was ﬂagged with a criminal
background during the hiring process. We're also investing in new partnerships toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

these reasons which we detail in the proxy.
The board recommends a vote against the proposal. As you saw and its co-ﬁlers
submitted the next shareholder proposal, requesting a report on investment of
retirement funds and companies contributing to climate change. Please play the
video introducing the proposal.
Hello, I'm Maren Costa. I'm a Microsoft employee. And today I'm representing as you
saw, on proposal number three on the proxy statement. This proposal asks Microsoft
to report on how the company is managing the growing systemic risks created by
investing retirement plan funds in companies that contribute signiﬁcantly to climate
change. Recognizing the growing risks of climate change to the company's bottom
line, Microsoft has adopted ambitious operational climate goals, including a
commitment to become carbon negative by 2030, as well as a goal to reach 100%
renewable energy by 2025.
Microsoft has also backed up its climate goals with action, like creating a $1 billion
climate Innovation Fund. Yet, the company is investing over $2 billion of our
employee 401k savings into oil, oil ﬁred utilities and agribusinesses involved in
deforestation. This creates cognitive dissonance that undermines our favorable
reputation as the industry leader on climate, as well as ﬁnancial risk for the company
and long-term risk for employees retirement savings.
As climate change drives the world to rapidly transition away from an extractive
economy, investments in fossil fuels will experience unpredictable diminishing
returns. A report from the carbon disclosure project indicates that 215 of the largest
global companies report almost $1 trillion at risk from climate impacts. With many of
those losses projected to happen within the next ﬁve years. Climate Safe Investing
reduces climate risk, reduces ﬁnancial risk and generates strong returns.
Key ﬁndings from a recent Morgan Stanley study of nearly 11,000 mutual funds
demonstrate that there's no ﬁnancial trade oﬀ in the returns of sustainable funds and
traditional funds. Furthermore, what this study doesn't measure is the future beneﬁts
of climate safe investments to our employees to the economy and to our future
businesses. Employees investments and 401k plans generally represent a signiﬁcant
portion of their life savings. Microsoft has a duty to address the growing risks that
climate change poses to pension fund assets now and in the future.
Our savings are exposed to this climate related ﬁnancial risk, and currently, Microsoft
does not oﬀer any climate safe investment options inside of our retirement plan.
While we do have access to a brokerage window that allows employees to go
outside of the plan to ﬁnd sustainable funds on the open market, this option is not
easy to use for the average investor. And more importantly, it outsources investment
risk to the employees.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 22Hussein Salama
Lauren CompereGiven the threat that climate change poses to employees’ life savings, Microsoft
should demonstrate that it is safeguarding employee ﬁnancial security over time, by
mitigating climate change related ﬁnancial and economic risks as part of a prudently
constructed lineup of easily accessed sustainable options inside of the plan.
I know that Microsoft means well by its employees. Now it's time for Microsoft to step
up and actually do well for those employees. By taking climate risk into account in
our 401K plan, Microsoft can lead its peers to help build a better future into which
employees will retire. This is not a diﬃcult change to implement. It really takes the
board and management to agree that oﬀering employees easy access to a climate
safe retirement is in everyone's best interest. We urge a yes vote on proposal
number three. Thank you for the opportunity to present on this important issue.
We appreciate Maren's perspective. Over the past several years, we've addressed
feedback from employees and made it much easier for participants in the Microsoft
401 K plan to access hundreds of climate-friendly and ESG investments. To clarify an
important point, the 401 K plan is participant-directed, meaning Microsoft does not
itself invest participants 401 K funds.
Rather, the plans governing committee follows a set of strict federal requirements
and considers a wide range of factors to make sure participants have a menu of
prudent and diverse investment options to choose from. And the committee
continues to evaluate legal requirements and investment options as they evolve. We
will continue engaging with employees like Maren to understand how to serve them
best.
Given this and the other points we share in the proxy, the board recommends a vote
against the proposal. The next shareholder proposal was submitted by Boston
Common Asset Management and impact investors and request an independent
report on government use of Microsoft technology, including defense contracts.
Please play the video introducing the proposal.

human right. Microsoft demands the same ethics and its supply chain. Well,
Microsoft has established principles for responsible use of AI.
These do not cover all products and services related to military contracts. Boston

company on a variety of issues. We support the steps Microsoft recently has taken to
commission an independent human rights assessment report. We understand theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

Unidentiﬁed Speakerreport is intended to identify, understand, assess and address actual or potential
human rights impacts of Microsoft's products and services and business
relationships and rights holders. However, what was not clear at the time we
withdrew the 2021 shareholder proposal was that military contractors were not in
scope.
Further while there's been some discussion of commissioning a separate
assessment, Microsoft has not been willing to commit to a for when this might
happen. As long-term investors in Microsoft we have increasing concerns over the
human and civil rights implications of the use of some of Microsoft's technology by
military and the use of surveillance. We believe that human rights due diligence and
impact assessment should be embedded from the product design to the end user
application. Not doing so leads to reputation and (inaudible) for Microsoft.
The resolution makes the case that the company's standing as a staﬀ socially
responsible corporate stockholding could be jeopardized by the company's lacking
a human rights policy covering military contracts. This concern comes after Microsoft
recently won a large contract with the US Army for its HoloLens product which just
moved from a prototype to a 21 billion integrated visual Augmentation System, IVAS
production contract for a military version to enable Enhanced Vision using AI
powered technology. The resolution calls for the company's board to commission
An independent report to assess whether governmental customer use of Microsoft's
technology including Defense Contract use, does or can contribute to violations of
privacy, civil and human rights and conﬂicts with the policies and principles set forth
in Microsoft's public disclosures. We are shareholders in Microsoft to vote in favor of
shareholder proposal four Thank you.
Microsoft has worked with the US Department of Defense for four decades. As
Microsoft bid on some signiﬁcant new military contracts over the past several years,
our senior leadership team deliberated and aﬃrm to the principle that we should not
withhold technology from defense institutions that protect the freedoms we enjoy.
You can read more about our principles in the proxy.
With this in mind, the board recommends a vote against the proposal. Harrington
investments submitted a similar shareholder proposal requesting your report on
Microsoft's development of products for the military. Please play the video

investors fear our company has lost its heart to war games that play a major part.
But as important is our company's lack of soul. What is truly needed is a return to a
ﬁduciary mold, which consists of all the company product and service is bound to a
higher moral duty that is sound. I have a question for a board of directors. Aren't
there always alternative decisions that can be intended and can be morally and
legally defended.
That will not result in death and destruction but lead to additional life and positive
construction? This last appeal for a sensible solution might actually indeed create a
real revolution. Fiduciary Duty is rooted in theological teachings based upon an
agent's moral duty to serve others. Please vote yes and proposal ﬁve. I move this
resolution.
As I shared responding to the previous proposed proposal, at Microsoft we have
taken a serious and principled approach to our work helping democracies advance
their range of government roles including defense. Thus, the board recommends a
vote against the proposal. Finally, Academica pension and several co ﬁlers submitted
a proposal requesting tax transparency reporting. Please play the video introducing

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 22Hussein SalamaOur proposal calls on Microsoft to align with other leading multinational companies
and use the Global Reporting Initiative, GRI tech standard. The GRI is the most widely
used sustainability standard worldwide, and is the only comprehensive global tax
reporting standard today. The transition to the GRI standard will not require a drastic
transformation for our company. Microsoft already submits country by country
reporting to OECD tax authorities privately, any burdens to our company should be
minimum.
If your rights extender provides transparency of our company's approach to taxes,
tax governance controls and risk management, stakeholder engagement related to
taxes and perhaps most importantly, public country by country tax reporting. In a
world faced by multiple crises, the scrutiny of corporate tax payments is likely to
increase year on year. If investors fail to make informed assessments of Microsoft
SEC strategy and the company's tax risks, we need accurate, accessible and
transparent data on a country-by-country basis.
We have taken note of the opposition statement for management. Indeed, peers do
not provide tax transparency at the moment. We think this is likely to change in
coming years, however, and that front runner companies stand to beneﬁt from
staying ahead of the curve. We encourage the board to demonstrate leadership and
embrace tax transparency. And we urge fellow shareholders to consider voting for
shareholder proposals six, thank you.
Microsoft already provides many tax disclosures in the jurisdictions around the
world. We expect to comply with additional reporting requirements from the
European Union in the next few years. We're also supporting eﬀorts by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD to facilitate
new tax reform and transparency requirements which are expected to come into
force in 2024. We believe it makes sense to begin additional reporting in line with
these well-established approaches, rather than making new Voluntary Disclosures
right before they come into eﬀect. For these reasons, the board recommends a vote
against the proposal.

September, we announced the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. We
completed our prior $40 billion buyback authorization in November 2021 and are
now executing against the current $60 billion buyback authorization. Now, I'll share

Thank you very much, Amy. And thanks to everyone joining us today for your
continued investment in Microsoft. We are living through a period of historic
economic, societal and geopolitical change. But for all the uncertainty in the world,
one thing is clear. People and organizations in every industry are increasingly looking
to digital technology to overcome today's challenges and emerge stronger.
And no company is better positioned than Microsoft to help customers deliver on
their digital imperative to do more with less. As Amy mentioned, amid this dynamic
environment, we delivered record results in ﬁscal year '22 having reported $198
billion in revenue and $83 billion in operating income, and the Microsoft Cloud
surpassed $100 billion in annualized revenue for the ﬁrst time, and is taking share

categories that will drive long term secular trend where digital technology as a
percentage of the world's GDP will continue to increase.
Second, we will prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of their
digital spends so that they can do more with less. And ﬁnally, we will be disciplined
in managing our cost structure. Now I'll highlight examples of our innovation of the

When it comes to data and AI. Our new Microsoft intelligent data platform provides
a complete data fabric from the operational stores to the analytics engine to data
governance, so customers can spend more time creating value and less time
integrating and managing that data estate. In AI, we are seeing a paradigm shift as
the world's large AI models become platforms themselves. We're helping
organizations apply these models to a variety of use cases with our Azure Cognitive
Services, as well as our new Azure open AI service.
Turning to developers, we have the most popular developer tools for any cloud on
any platform to help organizations modernize existing apps and build new ones. This
year, we introduced Github co-pilot the ﬁrst of its kind AI pair programmer, to help
developers write better code faster, and organizations are increasingly turning to
Visual Studio and our Azure past services to streamline development and create

We are focused on increasing our share and engagement across our browser,
Microsoft Edge, our search engine, Microsoft Bing, and our personalized content
feed Microsoft star. And with our acquisition, Xander, we now power one of the
largest marketplaces for premium advertising.
In gaming, we oﬀer the best value in the industry. We sold more Xbox series S and
series X console life to date than any previous generation of Xbox. And with cloud
gaming, we're bringing our games to entirely new endpoints. Xbox game paths now
includes access to hundreds of games, including more games from third party
publishers than ever before. As our opportunity expands, so does our responsibility
to the world around us. To help people and organizations everywhere achieve more,
we're focused on four interconnected pillars.
First, we need to ensure the economic growth we drive is inclusive and reaches
every person and organization, community and country. Second, we need to protect
the fundamental rights of all people from defending democracy, to protecting
human rights to addressing racial injustice and inequity. And third, we must protect
our most ﬁnite resource the planet.
And ﬁnally, we must earn trust both trust in business model alignment, and trust in
technology spanning privacy, security, digital safety, and responsible use of AI and
transparency. Our culture is the foundation on which our mission and strategy stand.
We're always working to close the gap between our espoused culture and the lived
experience of our employees.
Essential to this is our commitment to continually exercise our growth mindset and
confront our ﬁxed mindset. With the recognition that while none of us will ever be
perfect, we can always be better than we are today. It sustains our everyday practice
of customer obsession. It helps us care for our colleagues and collaborate more
eﬀectively across the company as one Microsoft. It deeply informs our long-standing
commitment to diversity and inclusion.
In short, the opportunity to apply technology to make a real diﬀerence to every
customer, community and country has never been greater. And I truly believe if we
continue to live our mission, embrace our responsibility and grasp that opportunity.
There is no limit to what we can achieve for the world in the year ahead and beyond.

time. Previously, we've been more dependent on collecting data very manually. But
now this project has taken a new step, we have initiated a new digital form of self-
registration. And from the very ﬁrst contact, we start to collect data about the missing
families. All this information or highly sensitive and conﬁdential. So, the solution built
with Alka was based on data privacy by design.
We chose the Microsoft platform because of his scalability and security, and on top
of it. So for apps portal for beneﬁciaries, the mobile's Canvas app for the
caseworkers, and all the process is managed with Microsoft 365 into the Swiss
Cloud. This solution is really helping to reunify families

Questions And Answers
Hello, and welcome to the Q&A portion of the meeting. I'm Brett Iverson, head of
Investor Relations at Microsoft. I'm joined by Satya, Amy and Brad Smith, Microsoft
Vice Chair and President. We want to thank you for all the questions you submitted in
advance.
We'll try to get to as many as we can. As we reviewed the submissions, there were
several questions on similar topics. So, we've selected a representative question
from those submitted to answer today. So, let's go ahead and get started.
Satya, in conversations with investors, they asked a lot about the macroeconomic
environment, and what Microsoft has seen from our customers. You talk about doing
more with less? Can you share what this means for customers? And the challenges
and opportunities this presents?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
No, absolutely. Brett, thank you so much for the question. Yes, I mean, this is
deﬁnitely front and center for all of our customers right now. And it comes in two
forms. One is what you said, which is, in an environment of demand, uncertainty and
high inﬂation, how can we do more with less? And also, there is a long range
question, which is how can we be more competitive even coming out of this cycle?
How can we drive long term productivity, and I think, in both these contexts, digital
technology is the most malleable resource we have to help overcome these
constraints. So on the ﬁrst one, for example, in terms of doing more with less, takeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

A - Amy Hoodeven demand uncertainty, the best way, for any retailer or any packaged goods
company or any company for that matter, moving to the cloud is the most capital
eﬃcient way to deal with demand uncertainty.
In fact, it's the most energy eﬃcient way at a time when energy prices are going up.
So I think up and down the stack, whether it's more workﬂow automation, or how
you manage the cyber risk with the best to suite approach, doing more with less, is I
think, one of the most critical things that any customer can be doing to just take their
current budgets or even reduced budgets and making sure that those budgets are
performing for their company in their competitiveness in the short term.
In the long run. I would also say that, again, digital technology, right? If you think
about it, ﬁve years from now, will any retailer be competitive if they're not best in
class in omni channel, or when any manufacturer who is not using digital twins to
optimize energy usage and reduce waste and water be competitive in the
manufacturing output?
So, I don't think so. So therefore, again, every company needs to invest both in the
ability to overcome the short-term challenge of doing more with less, but come out
of the cycle, with long run competitiveness and productivity. And that's where the
Microsoft Cloud, we've designed it speciﬁcally to be able to address those needs.
Thanks for taking us oﬀ. And that's a good segue to the next question. Amy,
investors are also interested now the company balances investments in strategic
growth, while managing costs and an uncertain economic environment. Can you
share how your approach striking this bounce?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
This is something we've actually done for over a decade now, and particular, as you
think about what makes Microsoft special, we have a diverse business model, diverse
end markets and diverse customer segments, both in terms of how big a business is,
individuals, right and well around the globe.
And so, we've always had, I think, some pretty good practice, and investing across
technology transitions, investing with an understanding of every geography around
the world currently is experiencing the recession the same way. Some are really
thriving, some have diﬀerent pressures, some consumers are behaving diﬀerently.
And so the art form, I think, for the management team, all of us at Microsoft is really
about investing in where we're going to create the most strategic value over the long
term.
And so, while that can, of course, bring some short term cost pressure, right,
because you always want to make sure you're investing both in the right thing. And
doing it smartly for the short term and understanding what the current revenue
growth is in. And I think we've done a nice job of that making sure we're investing in
AI making sure we're investing in some of the digital transformation ideas that SatyaFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

A - Satya Nadellatalked about making sure we're investing in making windows 11 a great experience,
investing in security, investing the technologies, frankly, that our customers are
expecting us to deliver. And that requires a consistency, especially in engineering.
In terms of having a commitment to the roadmap we've talked about with our
customers, and on the sales and marketing side. We've always been careful to make
sure we're investing in a way that revenue grows. And so, I think sometimes people
view this as an are you investing or are you managing costs? And really, it's about
doing both making sure you're pivoting your resources all the time in a dynamic way.
Technology moves quickly. We're a company that wants to move quickly. Our
customers expect us to move quickly. And so, we need to move our resourcing in
that same way to make sure we've got it in the right spots, and that's what we're
doing.
Balance is super critical. Thanks for that, Amy. The next one is for Satya. Can you talk
about some of the initiatives Microsoft is working on an AI and the opportunities
they present?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, no, absolutely. In fact, picking up on even Amy's last answer. I mean, in a tech
company, I think the key is to be able to ride the current wave, and do that super
well, in terms of both competitiveness, both on revenue growth and the operating
expense, and catch the next wave. That's sort of the crux of what a tech business is all
about. And so speaking of that, the next wave is really right upon us, which is
deﬁnitely AI, we're very, very well structured to capitalize on this wave.
Because if you think about the opportunities this AI way brings, the ﬁrst one is
infrastructure. When I think about Azure, one of the things that we have done, in fact,
in the context of even chat GPT, which today is one of the more popular AI
applications out there, guess what it was all trained on the Azure supercomputer.
Over the last couple of years, we've built the best infrastructure by bringing
computing network together to train these large language models. Whether it's GPT,
or dolly, and our cognitive services, and we have become the destination, if you look
at and check with any elite AI team out there, they will tell you that the best
infrastructure for doing anything AI is Azure.
And then the next point is we now have in Azure Cognitive Services. In fact, in Azure
open AI service, the best LLM so these language models, which I think are going to
be used broadly across the board. And then in our own applications, right design
over dolly or power apps with GPT to do natural language automation. We're
incorporating AI in across all of our-in fact, Nuance with DAX, I mean, think about
sort of reducing physician burden using these large models. So, I think we've got an
exciting portfolio of our own applications. We've got exciting(inaudible)real
capabilities for developers, I forgot to mention GitHub copilot my favorite sort of AI
tool that's changed my life.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

Page 16 of 22A - Brett Iverson
A - Bradford Lee SmithSo, I think where there is infrastructure layer, where there is Cognitive Services layer,
or the application layer, we are deﬁnitely leading I would. When it comes to AI,
obviously, it's just the beginning of a new wave. We are well structured. This is one of
the things again, to Amy's point, companies in tech are really thriving long term only
when they know how to catch the new wave and lead the new wave. And so, I feel
from a Microsoft perspective, very, very good about that. Yes, exciting space.
Brad, increasingly, shareholders are concerned about carbon output, and the eﬀects
on business operations. What steps is Microsoft taking to address these concerns?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Well, Brett, as you know, this is a big issue for Microsoft, it's actually a big issue. I
think for almost every company in the business community worldwide. We
committed the three of us actually committed, it will be three years ago, as we get to
January, when we said that by 2030, the end of the decade will be carbon negative
as a company, that means we'll be removing more carbon each year than we emit. It
means that we'll cut our carbon emissions by 55%, from 2020 to 2030.
We're doing a lot to reduce our emissions. And it's fascinating to me to see the role
that innovation is playing, including innovation that's based on our own use of AI
and data and digital technology. The thing to think about when it comes to carbon
emissions is it all comes down to three categories (inaudible)regardless of whether
you're an individual at home, or you're a big business The ﬁrst is called scope one.
That's the carbon that we all emit directly if we drive a car that's powered by
gasoline, if we're cooking with natural gas. So, we're really being very resolute in
basically eliminating all of those sources of emissions.
We're shifting to the electric cooking, so that we're no longer using natural gas.
We're electrifying our ﬂeet of shuttles and buses. We're even on a quest to replace
our diesel generators outside our data centers, with hydrogen fuel cells and other
things. The second thing everybody has to worry about is what's called scope two
this is the carbon that's emitted for the electricity we use. So, if your electricity is
coming from a plant that's running on natural gas, that's scope two emissions. We
are a huge user of electricity through our data centers around the world.
So, a big part of our eﬀort is to within two years from now have 100% of all of our
electricity for all of our data centers in the world coming from renewable sources.
What that means is that last year, our teams went out and they procured 5.7
gigawatts of renewable energy. That's enough renewable energy, almost all of it was
wind or solar, to power more than ﬁve million homes. It's a lot. And then the biggest
challenge we have the biggest challenge that every company has, is what's called
scope three emissions.
This is what comes from your supply chain or from the use of your products. And for
us, Amy and I are spending a lot of time on this working with our teams, it really does
come down to our suppliers. 80% of the carbon emitted by our suppliers comes
from 20 companies. So, we're working with those 20 companies we'll have to workFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

A - Bradford Lee Smithwith them in some cases to help them locate in places where they have access to
renewable energy, it means we're also focused on building more energy eﬃcient
devices. It even means that when we're building data centers or new buildings, we're
buying greener concrete, greener steel.
So, all of these things have really become, I would say, infused in every part of
Microsoft. And I'm extremely optimistic that we're not only paving the way that is
going to deliver on our commitments. But along the way, we're bringing along our
supply chain and ﬁnding new innovations that we're sharing with all of our
customers, including with our cloud for sustainability, the Microsoft Cloud, we're, I
think, in an extraordinary position to not only do right for ourselves, but to really help
our customers across the board.
Have of all the diﬀerent things that company's done. The sustainability commitment
is the one my daughter's get most excited to talk about at home. It's super
important.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
She'll be living with this longer than you and I will we better do a good job.
Absolutely. We have another question for you, Brad. Some shareholders question
whether Microsoft is taking onto many social and environmental commitments and
should just focus on proﬁts? Can you talk about how Microsoft leadership decides
when and how to address these topics?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
I think this is a great question, especially for a shareholder meeting. You heard Satya
just before we started talking, describe our mission and the four pillars. And
fundamentally, as you heard, our mission is about creating technology that helps
other people achieve more. So, we're very grounded in serving other people. And
fundamentally, when you think about how one considers this question, the thing that
I think sometimes people miss is that we have this wonderful opportunity to do well
for ourselves and do good for the world at the same time.
And that's where we really focus a lot of our energy, we probably spend more of our
energy on standing up for the needs and rights of our customers than any other
thing we do. protecting their cybersecurity not just individuals at home and
companies, but look at Ukraine and the entire country, protecting people's privacy
rights around the world. Think about what it means for us to get involved in
protecting say that child safety online. That's great for children. But it's also a
fantastic thing for our exports business because it makes parents more conﬁdent in
the use of our services.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

A - Bradford Lee Smith
A - Amy HoodWell, thinking about what Satya was just describing AI in the future and ensuring it's
responsible. So, we really focus on what will help customers, what will help
employees, and what will help grow our business. And the truth is when we do those
things, well, we do good things for others. And we actually help fuel ongoing growth
in the value of this company.
Absolutely. Absolutely. Amy anything you want to add on this one?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
No. But I do think it's especially important. I think when people get asked when
things are harder, is there a diﬀerent trade? Is this too much to be doing? And that's
the nature of the shareholder question, and I think Brad is right, it's a great question
to ask. But to Brad's point, when you get sort of asked what are your priorities. If it's
mission aligned, it helps customers, and it creates opportunity for Microsoft to build
its own success, that's still at the top of what we should be prioritizing, and many of
the things Brad just talked about will continue to be because they're durable. And
they're durable beneﬁts across all the sort of pillars Brad outlined.
And if they're durable across our customers, no matter if that's an individual, or a
government, or the largest enterprises, whether that's our employees around the
world, or whether it's our shareholders as the other pillar. What beneﬁts one tends to
beneﬁt all it is mission focus for us.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Do you mean (inaudible) I like this deﬁnition that Colin Mayer has right of this, the
social purpose of a corporation is to ﬁnd proﬁtable solutions to the challenges of
people and planet. The ﬁrst key word is proﬁtable. We are grounded on it, which is
we ultimately are accountable to our shareholders to run a company that is really at
the core allocating its capital to drive proﬁt. And we-and I think shareholders should
hold us accountable for that. But also, shareholders should hold us accountable for
solving the social problems and real challenges of the people in Planet.
Because if we don't, we lose long-term permission to be in business. And so that
feedback cycle between the world giving us permission to operate as a company,
and our investors giving us permission to operate are both sort of the same, in my
mind, and so that's what we're trying to balance out.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
I do think the thing that is so interesting about that is, at the end of the day, almost
every shareholder meeting for every public company in America is grounded
increasingly in this conversation.

What's the proper role of a corporation? And one of the things I do feel good about
is we have real clarity. It came in 2014, when Satya deﬁned a new mission for us. It
actually is the way we think about these and we answer these questions. And I think
we've done more in the last seven, eight years, to do good for the world and grow
shareholder value. And it's because the two are linked.
Yes. The end that you all mentioned is super critical. Thanks for that. Satya, we
regularly get questions about future growth engines for the company. While the
current business environment is challenging for advertising, our ad business has
continued to grow over time. Can you talk about the role advertising plays in
Microsoft's consumer business portfolio?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, ﬁrst of all, I'm very excited about Microsoft's opportunity. We have an ad scale,
Vad business today, the combination of what we do with our search and news and
LinkedIn, we've been growing. In the last couple of years signiﬁcantly, both for
example, Edge share has been going up Bing share has been going u, our newsfeed
impressions have been going up. And obviously LinkedIn engagement has really
increased in the last multiple years as well.
And so, through that our advertising businesses that scale, that Netﬂix deal that we
did recently gives us even an ad network scale business, which we are excited about.
But again, going back to the previous question, if I think about advertising.
Advertising is fundamentally driven by some of the key core capabilities of AI.
And so, when I look at the all up Microsoft investment in our infrastructure, our AI
capabilities, and our both ad network as well as on our own supply of inventory. I
think I'm very, very bullish about sort of our long-term prospects around advertising.
And we are deﬁnitely going to each day come to work to make sure that we are
growing our share and relevance for advertisers.
And I also think it's very needed, right? Competition is needed because it's a highly
concentrated market, as everybody knows. And Microsoft making progress means
advertisers beneﬁt, publishers beneﬁt and this is super important for-I think,
everyone in the marketplace.
Yes, large team and strong growth. That's a good combination. Brad, this one's for
you. So how is Microsoft responding to the FTC decision to sue Microsoft over plans
to acquire Activision Blizzard? And are you concerned that deal won't go through?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 20 of 22I believe-I think we all believe that our acquisition of Activision Blizzard is
fundamentally good for gamers, good for consumers, good for game developers
and good for competition. And that's the case that will have the opportunity. It's the
case we'll need to go present to an administrative law judge now that the FTC is
sued to block the case. I think there's three dimensions of the FTC's case that an
administrative law judge is certainly going to focus on. And we'll need to think hard
about.
The FTCs case is really based on a market that they've identiﬁed- that they say has
two companies and two products, Sony, PlayStation, and Microsoft Xbox. And if you
look at the global market, Sony has 70% of that market, and we have 30%. So, the
ﬁrst thing a judge is going to have to decide is whether the FTC is lawsuit is a case
that will promote competition, or is it really instead of case that will protect their
largest competitor from competition. After all, the whole reason we've pursued this
acquisition is because it will add to our ﬁrst party game library. And we think that will
make us as the smaller competitor in this market more competitive.
Now, of course, the judge then needs to think about the second question. What
about this actually poses a danger to Sony, the only company that they're focused
on? Well, in reality, the FTC's case is all about one exclusive game. Not even
exclusive because it's not today, so just say one game, Call of Duty. Now the reality is
in the console market, every company wants to have some titles that are exclusive
because that's how you build loyalty. Today. Sony has 286 exclusive titles. Xbox has
59.
So, it administrative law judge is going to have to decide whether going from 59 to
60 is such a danger to competition, that he should stop this from moving forward.
And then there's the third dimension that this judge will need to think about. It's the
fact that we have said explicitly and in a variety of ways, we won't make Call of Duty
exclusive to Xbox.
We've oﬀered to Sony to continue to make it available in a legally binding contract
for ten years, we've reached an agreement with Nintendo to bring it to the Nintendo
Switch where it's not even available today. And we oﬀered last week, before the FTC
commissioners met with us, before the FTC voted that we would submit to a legally
binding consent decree with the FTC, that would make clear that we would have to
provide Call of Duty to Sony and others for a decade.
And the thing that probably disappoints me is not that we will have to present this
case to a judge in a court. Because this is a case in which I have great conﬁdence. I'm
disappointed that the FTC didn't give us the opportunity to even sit down with the
staﬀ to even talk about our proposal to even see if there was a solution there.
Because I do think that if there's one thing we all know, whether you're a
government or a business or a parent talking to your children, you will never solve a
problem if you don't try.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13

A - Satya NadellaAnd we are committed to addressing every regulator’s concerns, to oﬀering
constructive steps to address them. And what I'm optimistic even conﬁdent about is
that we have a case that will take to an administrative law judge in the United States.
And we'll continue to meet with regulators elsewhere around the world. We'll meet
with Sony anytime they want to meet, because we're all about ﬁnding solutions.
Lawyers are ﬁne. They'll make some great arguments. But at the end of the day,
we're here to solve problems.
Helpful context Brad. Thanks for that. A topic that comes up a lot security
shareholders ask, how does the company look at both the risks and opportunities of
cybersecurity? Satya, can you share some of the innovations around security?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
No, absolutely. In fact, Brad referenced even the work that we did in the context of
Ukraine. It's sort of-I think the report that was put out is, I think phenomenal reading
to just even understand, perhaps the cybersecurity innovation and capability we as a
company have, and in support of our customers and even countries. When I think
about security, there are two sides to it, right? One is really ensuring that the security
products that we build, come together as one integrated whole.
Because one of the challenges of having multiple security products that just don't
come together to help with the cyber defense means you have in fact, a bigger
threat surface area. So, your identity, your solution, your endpoint protection, your
application, security, and your infrastructure security and your network security all
need to compose one control plane, one management plane, a set of policies that
sort of transmit throughout.
That's, I think, the core of what we have done with the security products of Microsoft.
And that's the reason why they become in the last even multiple years, much more
competitive in the marketplace. And that's what's driving even our ﬁnancial results.
But then the second aspect of it is security IS intelligence came out a signal's game.
So, the data that we have, the trillions of events we see, we just don't just sort of
process them analyze them, we actually translate that intelligence into active
protection, right?
So, when there's a new ransomware signature, somewhere zero shot, are we able to
recognize it. I always say that in this game, you may have one victim of anything new
and novel. And that's it, you have to stop it as soon as you see it. And that's about
really around tripping the data and the signals to protection. And so, a lot of
innovation in there. We're very committed to ﬁrst and foremost ensuring the digital
estates of our customers are secure by design.
And then making sure that we also recognize that customers have heterogeneous
environments and that we are going to go beyond even just our product set to make
sure that everything that's happening in this landscape is something that we are
actively protecting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-13
