Good morning. Welcome to day 2 of Citi Global TMT Conference. My name is Atif
Malik. I cover semiconductor and equipment stocks here at Citi. With us today are
Colette Kress, CFO, NVIDIA. We also have Simona Jankowski from IR and Shawn
Simmons from IR. It's a ﬁreside chat format. I'll kick it oﬀ with my questions. And then
we'll open it up to your questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Colette, I'm going to start with gaming. I thought it was a great idea to focus on
gaming at CES this year. And you guys killed it. NVIDIA announced next-generation
graphics RTX with DLSS using deep learning, new shading technology and more.
The company announced 40-plus new models with GeForce RTX notebooks, with 17
new Max-Q models available in January. Price to performance on 2060 is super
compelling versus 1060 and initial reviews are positive. It clearly shows the
company's leaps and bounds ahead of competition. I have 2 questions on gaming.
First is more of a near to midterm question. How does the launch of new products
impact the 1060 channel inventory situation that the company faced last quarter?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So thanks for the introduction. It was a great overview of some of the things
that we announced at our keynote on Sunday night. Yes. We used this time to focus
just on gaming at our keynote. However, if you do go to the convention center and
to our booth as well as there has been several blogs and discussions that we've had
with our partners, our Tier 1s on the overall convention center regarding automotive.
So the entire booth is focused in terms of automotive. But yes, we focused the
keynote to talk about where we are in terms of our next-generation Turing and our
next-generation bringing ray tracing. It was an opportunity that we were onstageFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-01-09

Page 2 of 11Q - Atif Malik
A - Colette M. Kressreally demonstrating since the time that we have launched overall ray tracing back at
gamescom to see the overall developments that we have done using ray tracing
within the overall ecosystem, with many of the games that are coming out, to show
the true life of how to bring ray tracing to these games and the overall improvement
that we'll get. So it was an opportunity to showcase the games, showcase the
progress we've made. But also to announce the RTX 2060. So your statement was
how does this relate in terms of our overall 1060, which we referred to at the end of
Q3, there's a little bit of excess inventory in the channel related to our 1060. Our
1060 excess inventory at the time that we had announced our Q4 guidance, we
indicated that it would probably take us about 1 quarter to 2 quarters to work
through. At this time, we do believe we are on track to working through that overall
inventory. It's essentially a ﬁnite amount that we just have to move through. And what
we have seen over this period is the normalization of the overall pricing. There has
been many promotions throughout this ﬁrst part of the holiday season. So we do
believe we're overall on track. Now when you compare that to the overall 2060, the
2060 has an opportunity for it to look as an upgrade to several of our installed base
types of cards. Looking all the way even to our overall Maxwell line, because it's very
common that people are overall upgrading maybe over a 3; to 4-year period of time.
So you can go and look at a 960 install base, a 970 install base and move to even the
1060 or 1070 Ti. The overall improvement matches in terms of what you probably
saw in terms of the 1070, 1070 Ti, however, at a substantially lower price. The 1070
was probably around the $450. We're looking now at better performance even now
at about $350 for the 2060. So it's really not a direct competitor. And nothing to
really do with the overall 1060 excess inventory that we have. We still feel that is on
track to be worked through.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Great. Then longer term, we had Logitech CEO present here at TMT Conference
yesterday. And he sounded very bullish on eSports adoption and underlying gaming
hardware peripheral demand for them. In fact, he drew a diagram behind us where
he tried to explain in the upper half are all the older folks that do not get eSports
and the bottom half are all the teenagers. And Colette has 2 sons that are big-time
gaming fans there in the bottom half. So I think that the dynamics are such that the
younger population are more latching on to this eSports trend than some of the
older crowd than in this room. So my question is that Micro-Star overnight talked
about a 10% type annual unit growth rate for this year. And they've become the #1
notebook gaming computer maker. How does the kind of crypto hangover change
your long-term view on the gaming market? The unit expectations are kind of in line
with your CAGR that you have shared in your prior analyst events. But just trying to
understand what does the crypto hangover mean for the long-term health of the
gaming market?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So let's go back to the statement in terms of the peripherals and the eSports
and a lot of what we're seeing in terms of the overall notebooks. I think that's also a
very important theme coming into CES here. We took this opportunity to also
announce that we brought Turing to overall notebooks. And the notebooks will be
available at the end of this month, more than 40 diﬀerent conﬁgurations from many,
many diﬀerent vendors. When you go and look at what the overall notebooks areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-01-09

Page 3 of 11Q - Atif Malik
A - Colette M. Kressnow accomplishing, they're accomplishing the generation that is extremely focused
on thin and light and also extremely focused on providing overall top-end
performance with no desire to give on either one of those. So we had worked for
quite some time. We had done this with the overall Pascal as our ﬁrst trip to the
overall OEMs, helping them redesign the underlying boards. So that they could
accomplish a high-performance overall chip along with the overall thin and light.
This is a very major theme that is happening. People want to play their game on their
desktop. They want to continue in a mobile form and have the parties where they're
able to bring their overall laptops with them and that they can continue the same
game, they can continue moving with it. So we're really excited to also take Turing to
the notebooks. If you recall from our Q3 earnings, we announced that our overall
notebook business was growing probably close to 50%. (Can beat) almost near
doubled the overall growth rate in terms of our overall gaming. So it's an important
piece, not necessarily a peripheral. But what you see is a lot of things being added
on to the overall gaming piece. So 2018, the calendar year is behind us. 2018 started
in quite a unique position. That is when we were facing a signiﬁcant spike in terms of
the overall cryptocurrency. We had a cryptocurrency board-speciﬁc. But again, we
had supply issues where sometimes that ran into our overall gaming. Now when we
got to the end of 2018, it ended a little diﬀerent than we had expected, as we had to
balance that out in terms of what we had seen at the very beginning that we had to
work through in terms of the 1060. We tend to sit there and think that in totality, 2018
is probably, as a whole, a good number from total overall gaming. As we look
forward and we think about the overall industry, whether that be eSports, whether
that be overall gaming notebooks, as we think about bringing overall ray tracing, we
know that the overall gaming industry is still a very important part of entertainment, a
very important part of social. It is a social platform for many of those teenagers, many
of the upcoming. And we have people that are gaming longer. So all those things
are intact. We believe our overall strategy of addressing this market. We just had a
couple of bumps that we had to work through in terms of 2018.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Great. And we had semiconductor companies talk about consumer and industrial
spending being weak in China at this conference. What percentage is China of your
total and gaming sales? And have you seen any impact from China demand on
gaming ban of sorts?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So our China business, in terms of around the world, in terms of global --
globally, when we think about our overall gaming business, we think about it
probably in about a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 piece, meaning the end customer, the end gamer,
we've got about 1/3 of them here in North America. We've got about 1/3 of them in
Europe. And we probably have another 1/3 in the Asia Pac and China area. However,
China as a part of the overall Asia Pac is quite signiﬁcant in terms of that area. So
over the overall holidays, leading even before the holidays, the overall China
regulatory was still trying to ﬁnd its feet and get some traction in terms of how they
were going to redo the overall regulatory. During the overall holidays, we heard
more in terms of them moving a little bit faster in terms of the regulatory aspects of
games. And we do believe they were probably on a much better track to look at
these games and decide how they would want them put into market to meet theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-01-09

A - Colette M. Kressdesires in terms of in China. So we do believe that overall, bringing forth the desire
to move faster on that and get -- and make some traction will overall help the overall
gaming industry as a whole. Before though, it's not necessarily that we saw any direct
impact from that potential slowdown, because that really is more on the software
side and the GPU platform being inside the overall computing platform wasn't
necessarily aﬀected.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Great. And moving on to just the data center part of your business that accompanies
the T4, GPUs delivered 40x faster inference than CPUs. How has Turing been
received by hyperscalers and the cloud customers so far?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Real interesting with our Turing architecture, as we do with all of our
architectures, we bring it to each and every single one of the markets that we
participate on. So when we brought Turing architecture, starting oﬀ with the
workstation, moving to overall gaming, we also came forth with what we refer to as
our T4, which is essentially our inferencing board that we can now fully address a
very, very important market in the data center. Probably one of the most important
size of markets that we are seeing in terms of our data center opportunity. We put
together the T4, it can be an overall form factor, about the size of an overall candy
bar, that can easily slot into existing slots currently in many of the diﬀerent servers. It
brings an opportunity to address a market which has essentially been an x86 CPU
overall market, in terms of doing that inference with the hyperscales as well as in
terms with overall enterprises. So we're excited in terms of the awareness of the T4,
the initial excitement over there. We also had Google to be one of the very ﬁrst ones
to move to provide it within their cloud. So we are gaining some tremendous
traction. We had traction just with inference, even with our Pascal line. Then the T4
allows us to continue with more focus in terms of on the Tensor Cores and on the
software layer to address this very important market for us.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Great. Then we've heard about data center demand slowing down in some areas in
semiconductors like storage due to the memory oversupply. Have you seen any
impact to AI-driven growth? And longer term, how do you think serverless
computing services, such as AWS Lambda, impact your data center demand?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So I think 2018, a signiﬁcant amount of buildout around the world and a focus in
terms of the additional compute that they think is necessary for so many diﬀerent
types of applications, as well as a focus in terms of on AI. As they work in terms of
optimizing, we spent a lot of time with them to say what have they learned over that
period of time, how do they think about the new conﬁgurations that they may want
to do. We don't have any ability to see the overall world insight on what that's going
to be looking into 2019. But what we can do is we have worked extremely hard to
expand our overall TAM, our opportunity and our priorities for where we think that
things will grow in terms of the overall data center. As you've seen us bring togetherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-01-09

Page 5 of 11Q - Atif Malik
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Atif Malikoverall to the data center, we started way back with overall high-performance
computing. But we know with the slowdown of Moore's Law, there has been even
more focus in terms of using acceleration in supercomputing, use acceleration in
high-performance computing, as they need that additional throughput for the work
that they are doing. Even in supercomputing back in the fall, of the TOP500
supercomputers, brand-new ones being brought to that list, we were in 56% of
them. So a very signiﬁcant portion are now moving to the overall acceleration, a very
important expanded market. AI is probably another one. You saw the hyperscales
move quite quickly. Deep learning, we are very well-known to be probably the
leading provider of all deep learning overall compute that's there. That has moved
to the focus in terms of inference, as we've also expanded our market to deal with, I
have trained my overall data, what do I want to do in terms of that inferencing stage?
And we're right there expanding the market to address those as well, both from a
hardware and software. In this latest last quarter, you saw us bring to market our
focus in terms of machine learning. Machine learning is diﬀerent in terms of the
overall AI. We're talking about a signiﬁcant amount of big data. You have a lot of
data scientists that are working on very speciﬁc applications, open-source types of
applications, in order to mine the massive amounts of data that enterprises have.
Things that we do to help forecast by using the overall data to come together with
that. We believe we now have a great oﬀering for them with RAPIDS to, again, now
expand into that market for the enterprise. So no matter how you want to think about
the overall data center, the goal is to say for each and every important workload that
will be there in the data center, can we overall fuel with the overall work that we have
done? That's the best we can do in terms of lining up for the priorities of 2019.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Great. And switching over to auto, over the past few years at CES, you have
announced signiﬁcant partnerships in the auto space. Can you talk about the new
partnerships and opportunities with Level 2+ DRIVE AutoPilot that you announced
this week?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So DRIVE AutoPilot really takes beyond the ADAS and really at certain times,
you can go into an autopilot mode. What we had announced previously was that
Volvo has chosen us for that autonomous vehicle. And will come out with their full
ﬂeet using our underlying platform. We are also on the ﬂoor of the convention
center with many of our partners, Conti, ZF, that are also locking into our overall
underlying compute platform to build these types of systems as we go forward. We
announced also with Daimler, a focus not only for AI within the cockpit. But they will
also use our underlying compute platform for the future of AI with their cars as well.
So these are some of the great things that we'll see. We'll likely see these passenger
cars start to hit in about 2020. But equally, at this time, we'll probably see robo-taxis
continue to be built alongside, bringing that AutoPilot. And those might be here at
the end of '19, of the current year.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Great. Citi is very bullish on the total opportunity for the car of the future, with our
lead auto analyst expecting to see a steeper curve in the post-2021 adoption rate ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-01-09

A - Colette M. Kressautonomous cars than consensus thinks and perhaps more in line with Jen-Hsun's
$60 billion TAM by 2035. Can you just talk about how NVIDIA ﬁts into the equation
of enabling these cars of the future? And when should we expect signiﬁcant revenue
growth in the auto business?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So when you think about what we are going through in terms of a
transformation in the overall automotive industry, it's a lot diﬀerent than the days
when we were initially putting infotainment systems and digitalizing our overall
cockpits. We are thinking about the overall transportation system as a whole that has
the ability to not only improve safety. But the overall collective servicing that is done
through the overall transportation. So yes, passenger cars are important. But we can
think about everything from the overall trucking system. We can think about the
overall delivery system. And we can also think about what we would want to do in
terms of shuttles, taxis and all of that. It is a major transformation for that. Right now,
we see safety being very, very important, to make sure they have that right as we go
into the cars. But we think about all of the challenges in terms of delivery, delivery of
goods, how that can free up, if we actually did it by autonomous, because it's very
diﬃcult, given everything has now moved from brick-and-mortar to potentially, in
terms of purchases online. So there's a lot of additional transformation that will
happen. But what is key in every single aspect of that is it is a signiﬁcant hard
computing problem. It is a signiﬁcantly hard computing problem that essentially
takes AI to infer what the either best route is or the perception of what you see in
terms of out there. We are, in terms of a leading platform, a platform that we have
today from end-to-end that starts with the underlying hardware but moves to an
overall programmable ability level, all the way up to many of these OEMs and
manufacturers in terms of their software application. So we feel very good, ahead of
the curve. And essentially, many of the partners that you will see at the convention
center here deﬁnitely will say their work is here and working with NVIDIA.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
And how do you expect your auto ASPs to grow over time from Level 2+ opportunity
next year to driverless taxi by 2021? Do ASPs vary by type of vehicle, truck versus
car? Or is the main variance in the level of autonomy?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So it is going to depend on every single one of the OEMs and/or the startups. But
you're correct. Sometimes, when you're going to full autonomy, you are looking for a
solution that helps you secure any of the overall passengers and/or the goods that
would be there. What that means is if there is not a driver, it can't be autopilot and
then go back to the driver. If there is no driver, you need multiple systems to be
assured that, that will drive in all diﬀerent types of scenarios, thus, additional amount
of hardware, a tremendous amount of additional backup overall software that
provides that. That's what drives an overall higher ASP as we move to the overall
higher autonomous capabilities. So we will have diﬀerent ranges. We also don't have
a set overall conﬁgurations for any of this. Many of this is working with the overall
OEMs on their strategies and how they want to do this. So what we'll see probably
over the next couple of years, you will see a lot of the development work if theyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-01-09

A - Colette M. Kresswould like a car to be on the road in 2020, 2021, they're probably going to need to
decide those partnerships that they need to make fairly soon in order to meet the
driving time of 2021 for the cars to be on the road. We work with them sometimes on
the platform. We will work in many diﬀerent degrees in terms of the software that is
needed to do that autonomous driving.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Okay. And on the competitive front, the growth potential in this market is attracting
more and more competitors. Can you help us understand what your secret sauce is
versus Intel, Mobileye, Xilinx, Renesas and NXPI and all these newcomers?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Honestly, there's a lot of diﬀerent processors inside of a car. For years, it has
been a growing population of overall processors. But not all processors are the
same. So there are many that are helping with diﬀerent parts of the overall
digitalizing of the overall car, or many other diﬀerent types of features that may be
there. But what we bring to that is not just to land and say we actually have a
processor. We have worked feverishly on taking what we have learned from the data
center, what we have learned in terms of our work on AI, to bring that to the car and
bring AI to the car. We are probably the only one standing that can take the
signiﬁcant amount of data that needs to be processed, the high-deﬁnition maps,
bring that into a single, overall module today to be able to calculate that types of
compute. There is a signiﬁcant amount of processing that needs to go around the
car, a signiﬁcant amount of sensors, radar, backup systems. So that in any type of
scenario, the car would be able to drive. That's a lot of data input. We have that
overall processing power today. That is the secret. So those that often refer to
thinking about that in a couple of years, they're going to miss a very important time
right now that says they have the desire to bring this autonomous capabilities in the
next couple of years. They need something to test and develop on today. And that's
what we're working through.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Great. I'll pause here and see if there are any questions in the audience. If you have a
question, please press the push button in front of you. Questions? Yes.
(inaudible) earlier. But can you just talk a little bit about your relationships with video
game publishers? Obviously, you guys are pretty close with EA. But is there anything
you can share, anything you guys do about you guys driving adoption for ray tracing
technologies into the video game developers' process?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So a great question. When we refer to our ecosystem of gaming and probably a
very large diﬀerentiator that we had done many years ago is to say gaming starts
either with the hardware or with the software, a chicken and an egg type of piece of
it. But they are an integral part in terms of the overall gaming experience and our
relationships with them are very, very deep and very, very long. Probably every singleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-01-09

A - Colette M. Kressone of the overall gaming developers and software developers out there work with
us. We have a signiﬁcant market share of overall PC gaming using our underlying
overall platform. So the goal of when they launch an overall software game, they
want a seamless view in terms of how the overall gamer feels in terms of that
experience. And we have worked often months or years before they've actually
launched the overall game to bring it to market. So when we launched overall ray
tracing and announced, we announced ﬁrst to the ecosystem and the software
developers that we were bringing ray tracing to gaming before we actually even
launched the overall hardware. We excited them on day 1 of just saying, wow, you
are now bringing something which is essentially the Holy Grail of overall graphics at
this time. Probably something that they didn't think would be available for more than
10 years out. But now with the advancement in terms of the overall processing
capabilities, they can bring that market today. So as we showed here at the keynote
in terms of demos, as we will continue to show, it is that work with the overall gaming
population of software development and showing the work that they have done to
incorporate ray tracing as well as our work to help incorporate DLSS also in terms of
those games. So those relationships are deep. People ask a lot of times that says,
"Well why now? Why not a large set of overall games available for the market right
now?" Well it is a little bit of a chicken and egg. We have to demonstrate the overall
hardware capabilities, we have to available the overall engine for them to overall
write the overall games. But I think we're on an absolutely great path to bring a new
set of games to the market.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Questions?
Can you talk a little bit about the rationale behind the promotion with app and
gaming and the 2060, how that impacts the burn down of the 1060 inventory going
forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So we're sitting here, everyone believes that the holidays are over. And we're
getting ready for a new year. But the reality is we're in the middle of the holidays.
And what I mean by that is there is still a signiﬁcant holiday in the Asia Pac China
area as they get ready for the overall Chinese New Year. This is a great opportunity.
And we like to do it with our overall gaming developers, to launch with our overall
GPUs and often with brand-new games that are coming. We thought this was a great
opportunity to put those together ahead of some of these great holiday times and
really showcase a lot of the ray tracing and the DLSS that would be available.
This morning, AMD announced their new 7-nanometer gaming cards for consumer
applications. Can you comment on what you think your timing is for a 7-nanometer
consumer?

A - Colette M. KressWell we just announced Turing. And we're really excited about Turing. And we don't
tend to announce new products long before they're available. So we're here to
announce really our next piece of overall Turing. Again, we have a diﬀerent way of
overall coming to market than some of our peers do. We do like to excite our
gamers with what we bring to market and really showcase it. It's here today, you can
try it overall today. The Turing architecture is so phenomenal, both performance
increase over Pascal and then with the addressing overall ray tracing for the future,
we are really talking about a next-gen and really a massive step-up in terms of what
that overall gaming experience has been over the last 20 years and what it's going
to look like now for the next 20 years to go. That's really what ray tracing is. So it's a
little bit more than just the chip, it is about the overall technology that we're going to
enable in there.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Questions?
(inaudible)
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's hard to hear.
(inaudible)
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So I think I heard a portion of this. So let me -- I think I hear ProVis. I think I hear
RTX bring into that and what does it do to that market. I think it's a really great
question that we, I haven't gotten the opportunity to explain. A very important
market that we also expanded with our overall Turing architecture is what we
brought in terms of overall the pro visualization business. That is our business that
we refer to as our enterprise graphics business. So bringing ray tracing to that
overall business is a huge undertaking and very, very well received from a very
important part of those that build ﬁlms, special eﬀects, build catalogs, photo editing,
all of these diﬀerent things really have massively now been able to improve with the
overall capability of overall ray tracing. Additionally, what we are doing is expanding
the market to do -- to address an important part of that overall process and the
process of overall rendering. Rendering the frames of overall special-eﬀects is a
signiﬁcant time consuming as well as a signiﬁcant amount of processing power to do
that. Generally, right now, there is about 1.5 million x86 CPU servers that do this
overall rendering in terms of rendering farms. What you'll ﬁnd in this industry is they
will often build their layers of frames that they have done in terms of special eﬀects, 1
inch by 1 inch. And then hope overnight that, that will render by the time they come
back in the morning. Then they will go and work in terms of ﬁxing and adjusting in
terms of what they did. Not an overly eﬃcient process as they have wasted a lot of
time waiting for render and wanting to do a lot of that on-the-ﬂy. So this is an
expansion of our overall market that we can now address with these render farms byFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-01-09

with our Turing architecture, moving towards ProVis to not only focus in terms of just
the design work on the workstations. But also what we can do in terms of the
rendering farms.
{BIO 15866921 <GO>}
Collette, on the ﬁnancial model, gross margins, you guys have natural tailwinds from
auto and data center, which are higher than corporate average in terms of
proﬁtability. In gaming, strength factor last year, maybe you guys beneﬁted in ﬁrst
half from crypto cards. And how should we think about this year, the gross margin
trajectory with gaming and the inventory situation with 1060 and the launch of the
2060 comps?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So our business model and our focus has been over the last 3 and ﬁve years,
when we think about our overall gross margin, is continue to build bigger, better
overall value-added platforms. That means even from a gaming perspective to our
ProVis, to our overall data center as well as what you discussed in terms of our
automotive. And so what you have seen over that period of time is a massive
increase in our overall gross margins. Probably ﬁve years ago, down in the high 30s
and 40s. And we're now sitting around the low 60% in terms of overall gross
margins. Last year, a continuation of that. Although the ﬁrst part of the year, yes,
inﬂuenced by overall -- the wide need to supply for overall cryptocurrency and
restock that allowed us to raise our overall gross margins. Our gaming gross margins
sit about at the company average. They sit about as the company average. It makes
sense because gaming is probably a very good percentage of our overall company
revenue. We are enabling, with the overall software in our pro visualization and our
data center as well as our future automotive platforms to increase gross margin
because we can leverage that overall software, which is essentially the work of our
R&D folks, when we look at our overall gross margins. It's still early to say because

investment, we do look at M&A. And M&A as overall possibilities of where we can
tuck in sometimes technology teams or where we can add key features to the very
deﬁned overall market segments that we have done. It's not been ever a very large
portion of our overall investment in terms of the M&A. But that doesn't mean we
aren't always looking for opportunities that might be a great mix.

Great. And time is winding down. So Colette, thanks for coming to the Citi
