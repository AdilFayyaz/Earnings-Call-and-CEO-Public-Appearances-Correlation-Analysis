Great. Hi, everybody. Welcome back. I'm Brad Zelnick, Software Equity Research
Analyst here at Deutsche Bank. And I'm really delighted for this session to be joined
by Alysa Taylor, Microsoft Corporate Vice President, Industry, Apps, and Data
Marketing. Alysa, welcome, and thanks for joining us.
Thanks, Brad. Thank you so much for having me today.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
For certain. So the format of this session is a ﬁreside chat. And I believe you can
submit questions in your browser and if time permits, we'll try to work those into the
conversation.
But with that, let's just dive right in. For starters, Alysa, your role touches on a lot of
exciting things happening at Microsoft. Can you help us understand what exactly
you're responsible for, the rationale for bringing all of these things together and
where you spend your time?
Questions And Answers
Absolutely. So if you know Microsoft, we are functionally aligned. So we have
engineering leadership, sales leadership, product marketing leadership, ﬁnance
leadership, that really is organized by our commercial solution areas. And so, I have
the pleasure of being responsible for product -- global product marketing for three
of our business units.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

A - Alysa TaylorSo our data and AI business, our business applications division, as well as our global
industry. And we'll talk a little bit more about, I know, speciﬁcally about business
applications. But if you think about the world in which we live in today with so much
of everything that we do becoming a very data-centric culture and then the data
ﬂowing into business applications in unique ways and enabling organizations to do
new interesting things with -- across their business, and then having that in a very
vertical component. That's why those business units make sense to have one leader
across all three. The synergies really are what we're seeing in the marketplace today.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Thank you for that context. And just to jump right into Dynamics 365, today is now
north of a $3 billion run rate business growing over 40%, which is really impressive
considering it's less than ﬁve years old. And if we were to come back in, let's say,
another three or ﬁve years and it's still compounding at a similar rate, what needed
to have happened to sustain this level of success? And maybe asked diﬀerently, can
you share what makes you optimistic for the future and the ability to take market
share on a sustained basis and how will you measure that?
Absolutely. And so we've been on this journey we announced Dynamics 365. It will
be ﬁve years this fall and we started with the vision of the Microsoft Cloud. I mean it's
very akin to what I just talked about around why the business units that I manage are
closely related. But if you start with what is the Microsoft Cloud and what's the vision
we've been building as a company, it's really to make sure that we have the world --
the world's largest and most comprehensive and trusted cloud, starting with our
hyperscale global infrastructure, Microsoft Azure, our data in AI services, the ability at
the developer layer to extend all of those experiences to take the data, to be able to
analyze it, create new experiences to automate it.
And then having an application layer that is both extensible and is supported by that
global hyperscale platform, and that application layer in the Microsoft Cloud is
Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365. And so that has always been the vision to build the
world's most trusted and comprehensive cloud and doing that, we knew how
important the business application layer was.
And so if I rewind to ﬁve years ago, we had a set of on-prime assets in the ERP and
CRM space, and we knew that we had to completely re-imagine how we thought
about applications and we started by eﬀectively breaking down the big monolithic
silos of ERP and CRM, creating modular services that were built on Microsoft Azure
and threaded throughout with the integration into Teams and into Outlook and
extensibility through our developer platform. And we then set out on a journey to
really create all of the business functions all the way from marketing, sales, service,
ﬁnance, operations, supply chain that an organization needs to run their business.
And so that's the intentional journey that we've been on, and we've grown from,
back in the day, we were a single-digit largely on-prem business to now we are
predominantly cloud with consecutive growth quarter-over-quarter and we just
announced last quarter 49% cloud growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

(Multiple Speakers) great [ph]. It's been an amazing journey in just about ﬁve years,
and we look forward to great things ahead. And as we think maybe more broadly,
I've been a student of the industry for many years. Long ago, applications and
analytics were two separate disciplines, and I think today, the world seems to be
evolving in a direction where apps are so much more intelligent more often have
embedded analytics and decisioning.
So take CRM, for example, seems to be evolving from a sales management system of
record to proactively helping sellers sell. So with this explosion of data and maturing
AI capabilities, we're seeing many high growth innovators bolting on to systems of
record to drive engagement productivity and optimizing outcomes. Can you talk
about where we are in the evolution of business apps and maybe the value or
importance of data-driven applications, and what more can we expect in the future
as these stats come together?
Absolutely. Yes, you asked what is our journey and what are we most excited about.
And you've just articulated the enthusiasm we have for the future business
applications because it's fundamentally changing. When I talk about we started to
build a comprehensive set of services, it's really those services now are moving from
what are very reactive systems where you sort of input data in and that data is static
and is very sort of user-driven to this world where you can actually aggregate data
and your business application becomes a analytical system, that you can then apply
intelligence to and you move it from a reactive state to a proactive state. And that's
the beauty of what we are building with Dynamics 365 and the Power Platform, is
that ability to aggregate data from all kinds of disparate sources, analyze that data
within the system, be able to automate and act on that data, all within the construct
of a business application.
So to your example, it no longer becomes a salesperson inputting in their
opportunities, but using that system to tell them what leads should they prioritize,
what for -- what parts of their forecast are at risk, even being able to embed
cognitive services, so we're -- so, you can actually analyze your interactions with your
customers and know what's at risk or where you'd want to do diﬀerent cross-sell,
upsell, where you may have other people that you want to network within. So it really
becomes less of this sort of system of record and this tool that empowers individuals
in a very proactive way to do their jobs every day.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
That makes a lot of sense, Alysa. And as investors and analysts, we like to follow the
business cycle and understand the spending patterns and a common investor
debate this past year has been around the relative priority of front oﬃce versus back
oﬃce application investments and you're in a great position to see what customers
are doing. So, what are you seeing across the Dynamics portfolio in that regard? And
maybe can you speak about why it's so important that Microsoft has an integratedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10A - Alysa Taylor
Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Alysa Taylorvalue proposition that spans from both? And I know you touched on that a little bit
already, but I'd love to hear more.
Yeah, that's -- you're absolutely right. The lines between front oﬃce and back oﬃce
have blurred, and they're doing that -- that blurring is happening because it really,
again if I go back to sort of the historical traditional CRM and ERP, those systems
really never talk to one another. But if you think about where -- how quickly every
industry is evolving, if you even just take retail and you zoom into retail and you look
at curbside pick-up as a service now that every retailer has to oﬀer in this world
today, you can't do that with just front oﬃce systems and back oﬃce systems, right,
because you have to be able to understand real-time inventory visibility, you have to
be able to do alerts to those that are on the frontlines servicing the customers and
the world of digital and physical has completely emerged. And so you have to know
your customer in a virtual environment and be able to bring that into the physical
environment.
And customer expectations are that there is -- I'm a customer and no matter if I
interact with you online or interact with you in-store, that you know me, and you can
have two discrete disparate systems servicing that. And so that's why we've moved
very much into a functional model and I will say the key in the secret to Dynamics
365 is we have individual services by function. Like I said sales, service, marketing,
ﬁnance, supply chain, operations and commerce. But there is a common data service
that threads throughout, which is what we call data verse and that common data
service allows you to be able to have your supply chain visibility seamlessly ﬂow in
through your commerce systems, into your sales and into your service applications.
So there is no more silos between those functions and that's through the core value
prop of ours is breaking down those traditional silos and enabling a data-ﬁrst AI-ﬁrst
set of applications that serve every business need.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
I think it's intuitive why that would resonate still well with customers and prospects.
Maybe as we kind of round out the value proposition and as we think about
Dynamics and extend into Power Platform, you've talked about the app gap in the
past and the demand for apps outstripping the world supply of software developers
in it. It sounds like Power Apps have a lot of momentum right now. How should we
think about the population of citizen developers in the world and perhaps
Microsoft's role in expanding that population?
Yeah, there is two fundamental things that are happening in the industry right now.
The app gap is one, which is every organization has a unique set of needs and you
start with the base functions. But the reality is to run a business every day, you have
very speciﬁc applications that you need to run that business. And the rate in which all
industries are evolving and the market is evolving, you don't have years to build
enterprise applications anymore. It's just too -- the landscape changes too quickly.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 10Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Alysa TaylorAnd so, plus there is the scarcity of resources in terms of the number of developers.
And so what you see is this term citizen developer but though it's really those that
are closest to the problem, how do you empower them with the tools to be able to
solve the challenges and (inaudible). And that's actually, you touched on Power
Apps, but we have a portfolio called the Power Platform, which is Power Apps allows
you to build unique applications very quickly in a low-code no-code way, leveraging
connectors to data sources, bringing that data into data verse and being able to very
quickly stand up applications.
But the other services that are in the power Platform allow you to take that same data
and be able to automate it as well as analyze it with Power Automate and Power BI.
So it's an entire system of low-code no-code tools to enable the citizens of the world
to be able to take care of the challenges ahead of them. And the reason we're
investing so much in this area is because we want to make sure that people can
rapidly respond to what's in front of them and empower everyone in an organization
to be able to have that -- those tools to give them the services they need. And it's
just -- it's all in pursuit of making sure organizations have all the services they need to
be successful.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Makes a lot of sense. Alysa, as we, maybe, dig a little bit further into Power Platform
and some of the other aspects of it, I think RPA, you've got some really strong
technology there. But how might we think about Microsoft's aspirations in the RPA
space and how would you characterize the market's maturity and ultimately, the size
of the market opportunity? Because I think some might debate that and maybe just
as to how big beyond might be some of the more obvious examples, like accounts
payable or accounts receivable, which I have often heard a lot of success, whether
it'd be Microsoft or other RPA providers. I mean, can we really ultimately automate
away the role of the typical knowledge worker? Am I going to wake up and -- what is
automation going to mean for me?
Well, I think it's about -- our goal is to empower individuals, deﬁnitely not to
automate them away. But if you think about what organizations need to do is, it's
actually about freeing up people to do higher-value tasks. And there is so much in
the system that is -- that can be automated to give people the ability to focus on
those higher-value tasks, so they're more productive. And so that's really what --
when you think about RPA what that enables people to do and it's not just about
accounts receivable or paper-based process. It's really about any function across any
organization when there are highly manual repeatable tasks being able to automate
those.
It also helps with legacy-based systems. So how do you actually sort of automate
tasks that where you have systems that were -- it's very diﬃcult to be able to extract
that data out of those systems. And so we think RPA and a Power Automate, which is
our Microsoft Cloud service, just has huge potential to make individuals more
productive and also help organizations win, back to the comment I made about the
scarcity of resources really being able to help organizations adapt where they mightFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Q - Brad Zelnick
A - Alysa Taylornot have frontline workers to be able to take on some of those tasks. And so it's just -
- it's a really nice way for organizations to become more eﬃcient and to become
more productive.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
That makes a lot of sense. And Alysa maybe if I could, I'd like to talk a little bit about
the go-to-market approach. Microsoft has a vertical oriented approach to the market,
but in fairness, I think that's common across the industry. What makes your approach
diﬀerent? And is it more about product? Is it go-to-market or perhaps even unique
partnerships that you have in speciﬁc verticals?
Well, I think it's -- I would say that it's all of the above. We've talked a lot today and
hear about product and what we've been investing in on the product side and the
product strategy. But conversely, on the go-to-market side, we've both at Microsoft
really re-imagined our product strategy hand-in-hand with our go-to-market strategy.
And if we think about how we want to service our customers. It's about being able to
start with the time of need, whether that be how an organization is rethinking and
making their sales force more proactive as we talked about or building the digital
contact center of the future and rethinking their customer experience, starting with
customer service, all the way to how they get supply chain visibility and modern
commerce systems.
So really being able to start with an organization at the time of need because that's
the other -- if we go back to this notion of where we were 5, 10 years ago with CRM
and ERP, those were, as I mentioned, big monolithic systems that took years to
implement. And we, again, we're trying to get to the fastest time to value for our
customers. And so having these modular applications allows an organization at the
time of need to be able to adopt.
And then as they -- and if they choose to expand into other functions, we've built
them in a way that allows you to start with an application, very easily add the next
service, the data as I talked about data verse connects those applications and we
have a go-to-market that's all around making sure that organizations are able to
realize value from that application and then add additional workloads as they see ﬁt.
And so to do this, we've invested very heavily in our sales ﬁeld. Year-over-year, we've
added incremental -- signiﬁcantly added incremental sales. We have built out an
ecosystem that we think is world-class and continuing to invest very heavily in our
ISPs to be able to bring in that complementary both vertical and micro-vertical
expertise to round out the portfolio.
And then also investing in our customer success and making sure that our -- the
organizations, all the way that we serve, all the way from pre-sales to post-sales feel
very supported by Microsoft in our ecosystem. So there is just -- there has been
equal investment on the engineering side and building out the product strategy asFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

A - Alysa Taylorthere has been on the go-to-market side to make sure that we're serving our
customers in the best way possible.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
All key ingredients in making it all work and the ecosystem, mind you, a very
impressive set of partners. I don't want to say second to none because I'll be
oﬀending other companies out there, but clearly a distinction from Microsoft for
sure.
Alysa, I'd love to ask you a bit just about future trends as we look to the future, we
continue to hear about COVID accelerating digital transformation and investors have
been trying to distinguish changes in behavior that are more enduring versus those
which might be more short-lived and I get that the pandemic is by no means behind
us, but what are you seeing along these lines in terms of customer behavior and
intent? And how do you expect it to translate to end [ph] demand?
Yeah, I think COVID, in many ways, accelerated organizations' need to build a strong
digital foundation because it's just so many of the -- we talked curbside pickup,
contactless shopping, the disruptions we've seen in the supply chain market, like
those organizations that had a strong cloud digital foundation are the ones that have
weathered the storm, the best.
Great example that I was talking about is Patagonia. Patagonia shut down both their
stores and their factories to be -- to make sure that their employees, both in-store
and in their factories were safe. And then they reopened with a very modern
distribution center and they were able to do that in a very short period of time. We
worked very closely with them on their supply chain system as well as their
commerce system and their in-store point of sale to be able to bring employees
back in a very safe way, and also serve their customers in a safe way, and use their
retail stores as the fulﬁllment centers versus having factories with large amounts of
people working very closely together using the smaller footprint of the store to be
able to dropship.
So I think COVID has very unique circumstances like what Patagonia had to face. But
I think pervasively, every organization has come to realize that to be future proof or
whatever is next, it's really incumbent on them to build a digital foundation that
allows them to react very quickly. And so I think things that we will see that will go
into the future is how do we make sure that the physical and digital worlds are
seamless because I think the -- a bunch of the digital capabilities that have been
stood up are here to stay. I think we'll always be mindful of physical environments
and spacing and footfall traﬃc and how do you monitor those physical spaces. We
talked about automation and making sure that employees are as productive and as
eﬃcient as they possibly can be. And so I think the investments in automation will
persist.
And then how quickly supply chains were disrupted and continue to be disrupted,
and so we are making sure that you have a supply -- you have supply chain visibility,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

A - Alysa Tayloryou have very responsive commerce systems. These are all things that we continue
to see organizations invest in because it's just -- I don't think we go back to the world
that we were two years ago and so organizations are having to adopt and having to
continue to make sure they're anticipating what's next.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
I think there's no doubt, experiences will continue to be more digital, more mixed
reality. I think the future is bright and exciting, and it's great to see how Microsoft is
able to help customers in delivering those types of experiences.
I had a couple of questions, maybe along those lines. I was surprised when I saw you
have responsibility for mixed reality but realize some of the use cases are pretty cool.
How are customers like Kroger or I noticed Mercedes-Benz or even Chevron using
HoloLens with Dynamics to drive better business outcomes?
Yeah, now I use two of those examples because I think they're good contrast of kind
of organizations investing for the future and then organizations that had to react to
COVID and will build into the future. Chevron was -- Chevron, if you think about the
need to service oil -- the oil mines that are in the ﬁelds, how you do that, it's very
diﬃcult to ﬂy in people to be able to do onsite service. And so they invested pre-
COVID in being able to use HoloLens and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to be able to
do remote service and allowing their technicians to collaboratively work on servicing
their oil rigs and in very, very remote, I mean like, when you talk about remote, very
remote places. And so that -- Chevron is -- was sort of ahead of the curve of how do
we make sure that we can be as eﬃcient as possible and react very quickly because
obviously when there is issues with an oil rig in -- it does, fairly timely, it becomes
disastrous, right?
So their response time is incredibly critical and so using mixed reality to be able to
do that. And then if you look at what Mercedes-Benz did, that was in response to
COVID-19, which is they were not able to have technicians ﬂy into service vehicles.
And so, using again HoloLens and Dynamics 365 mixed reality applications, both
Remote Assist and guides which is our training platform to be able to bring together
technicians to service vehicles and to be able to communicate with the vehicle
owner. And so this is just a really unique way of evolving their service capabilities.
And I think we will again see that persist into the future because what it does is that
allows people to real-time -- have real-time collaboration, be able to knowledge
share and communicate with customers wherever they are.
And so that's a value add that Mercedes has now that they will continue to invest in
and I think we saw the shutdown of the service plans and people not being able to
get on a plane to help really accelerate that. And so the mixed reality portfolio in
Dynamics is just another way for us to do, we talked about data-ﬁrst. Using all forms
of data, whether that be operational data, transactional data, observational data,
bring all of that data together to be able to create those -- create an understanding
of your customers, of your supply chain, of your employees and really using that data
in a way to be able to analyze it and then garner insights from it. And so it's all formsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-09

A - Alysa Taylorof data and that's why mixed reality is part of -- a very strategic part of our portfolio,
and one that helps us serve customers like Mercedes-Benz, Kroger and Chevron in
very unique ways.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Yeah, that's very cool. I actually had the privilege of seeing some of Mercedes' new
EV lineup just the other day here in New York, it was very interesting to see how they
do in the EV market against the dominant player there. Maybe just one last one,
we've talked about data, data, data, and I believe you've mentioned this data verse
and the single data model. Is there anything more to understand how much of that is
just the underlying fabric upon which everything you're doing relies and makes
everything possible and bringing this overall platform solution available and for
customers? Is there anything more that you can tell us about? And is it something
that maybe one day can be productized and monetized on its own?
Well, I'll give you a little preview of where we're headed on that -- on our data cloud
services because if you think about the data needs of every organization, it's about
having an analytical data store that takes unstructured data and then is able to
combine that unstructured data using a common data model for you to be able to
analyze it.
And our analytical data service is Azure Synapse -- Microsoft Azure Synapse. If you
then think about what is the operational data services that are a -- that comprise and
convert -- bringing that operational data both structured and unstructured. One of
our operational data services is data verse and that is our low-code no-code. So it's a
very -- think about it as a managed service that allows you in a very controlled
aligned entity way to be able to easily build new applications with Power Apps, be
able to automate the data with Power Automate, be able to combine data across
services like Dynamics 365.
And then you have obviously our Azure SQL as our hero enterprise operational data
service and then Cosmos DB to be able to build cloud-native applications. So if you
think about the analytical data services and Synapse, the operational data services
and having the right operational data services and then wrappering [ph] that with all
the compliance and governance that we have with Microsoft Purview. And so that's
really the kind of the construct of our data cloud that you'll hear us talk more and
more about of how they all comprised to the -- what we believe is the most
comprehensive set of data services and how organizations can garner value by
having a common data model that allows that data to either be in an operational
structured form, but then also be able to have unstructured data in Synapse and
have this data kind of all be part of the Microsoft Cloud data services.

I think we didn't touch on industry. I think that's something you'll see us more and
more. We've introduced our ﬁrst set of industry clouds. But when we talk about the
Microsoft Cloud being able to make sure that the Microsoft Cloud is relevant for
every industry is an area that we will continue to invest in as well.
