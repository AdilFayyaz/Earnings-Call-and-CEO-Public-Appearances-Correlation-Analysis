(Starts Abruptly) Key reason why I'm here as well. We're excited to host this ﬁreside
chat with Denise Incandela and Denise and Jeﬀ [ph] are long-lost friends as well
from Lehman Brothers days.
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Yes, we work together.
We did.
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Many moons ago, we won't date [ph] ourselves.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Denise is a legend in the industry. She is an EVP of the apparel division and private
brands for Walmart US. As many of you know, Walmart is the largest retailer in the
world with over 10,000 store locations in 20 countries, and apparel accounts for
about 30% of sales. Denise and I go way back, she was formerly at McKinsey Saks
Fifth Avenue the Wharton School and she taught in my school at Colombia. So
thanks a lot, Denise.
And so, yeah, so Oliver already mentioned that we worked together, another lifetime
ago but -- and we're friends on LinkedIn, we're connected on LinkedIn.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Thats important.
So, walking in today, the two of us having to walk in together and we're like asking
downstairs, like where's the conference? And then in literally. I think we probably
tried to catch up on several decades of history since last time we saw each other in
like ﬁve minutes before we are running to (Multiple Speakers) up the escalator.
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
I think we accomplished it.
We did, but so, I just was saying, I've been a fan of what you've done. So I have
followed you in some of the disruption that you've done and you've been able to do
some really interesting things certainly post your McKinsey career as an innovator
and I think it will be really helpful to for folks to hear when you're coming into an
organization whether Saks or Walmart or in the course of your career as you come in,
as a known disruptor innovator. How are you managing those kinds of things? So
walk-through kind of the arc of your career, and how you think about your coming
into organizations to usher in change and while you're still being respectful of the
folks that have been doing what they've been doing?
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Yeah, so. I have been instructed by our attorneys that I need to show you a slide then
I'm trying to make happen before I start talking, there we go. So...
Pull out your glasses
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
If you could take a moment and read through this exactly -- okay, but -- if we could
take a moment and look at the slide, that would be fantastic, make the attorneys
happy, okay, I'm good. And then I'll just leave it up here while I answer your question
which is a higher level.
I would say, yes I'm passionate about transformation, disruption, innovation. I've
always chased those opportunities, whether it was joining Saks in 2000 when people
thought luxury apparel would never sell online or whether it's joining Walmart to
make it a credible fashion destination. And you will always have to be respectful ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Page 3 of 13Q - Oliver Chen
A - Denise Incandelathe incredible success that existed before you joined. And I said I've learned a lot of
lessons on the way, I'm not sure when I ﬁrst joined Saks. I really understood the critic
-- how critical it is to bridge what the company has done up until now to what we
think the company should do going forward.
But now that I've -- I'm a seasoned disruptor or transformation leader, I would say the
key things are; one, understand the successes of the past and understand what
components of the company are really important to continue because you can't just
wholesale anything out that doesn't make sense and you need to really understand
your customers and which are the customers, you want to protect and retain and
which you want to grow and what is with the key initiatives are needed in order to do
both of those things because you can't alienate the core.
I think understanding the talent that you have in the organization and who can take
the business to the next level and is able to pivot to do that and who might not be
able to do that and bringing in leadership, who can get the organization excited
about the future because the one thing we know about retail and Doug McMillon
says this all the time is the only constant is change. And so for those who are not
excited about change, Walmart is probably not the home for them. And so with that
foundation of our leader constantly saying that over and over again, you are
delivering on a vision, that's already been set at the highest levels by painting a clear
vision being fact base, making sure you're testing. And so you're not risking billions
of dollars by making dumb decisions that haven't been tested and bringing in
people who are excited about that vision and making sure that the team sees it and
wants to go there. But it's hard. It's the balance of respect for what took you to where
you are and the clear vision of where you're going.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Denise, what are three things you're most focused on at Walmart? And how do you
envision these initiatives changing Walmart and retail, and you're wearing one of the
brands today too?
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
I am. I am wearing Scoop. So the big three things that we're focused on, and it is a
huge transformation on the apparel side. The ﬁrst is the assortment itself. And so
democratizing fashion, we'll call it democratizing fashion. And what I will say, and I'll
show you a chart here, and the numbers aren't here. So it's a little bit harder to
understand.
But what I'm showing here is that if you look at the column that says Walmart FY '23
and if you look at the rows, it's opening price point, good, better, best average unit
retails. And if you look at the customer -- the Walmart customer spend within
Walmart the vast majority, as you can see, is an opening price point. But when that
same customer leaves Walmart and they shop in the rest of the market, the vast
majority is in higher average unit retails.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 13Q - Oliver Chen
A - Denise Incandela
Q - Oliver ChenAnd this was the aha fact base that made us understand that 80% of our customers'
closet -- our Walmart customers' closet was in higher average unit retails, and we
weren't serving them because we had opening price point only. And so we've been
on the journey over the last three years on the assortment side of building with
national brands. And you can see the national brand on the right-hand side of the
chart, growing quite dramatically. We brought in Reebok and Justice and Chaps and
Celebrity Pink and Steve Madden. And the customer has loved it.
So building in national brands, building better private brands, our opening price
point brands with better style and quality and then building up, what we call,
elevated brands, and we've created partnerships with celebrities like a brand in
Maxwell, who's a well-known women's wear designer or Soﬁa Vergara, who I'm sure
you know who she is, and others and building out these elevated brands at slightly
higher price points. So think instead of the 15 to 50 -- all the way up to 50, like this
dress, the Scoop dress I'm wearing, we bought the IP, it's $36. And that's where, on
the assortment side, we can serve more of her closet and her wearing occasion. So
that's a little bit of a long story on the ﬁrst bucket.
The second bucket is the shopping experience. So creating a credible fashion
shopping experience, both in-store and online, we are in the process of rolling out
our store of the future. We are testing it in 30 doors right now. And I'll get to it in a
minute, actually. Really exciting. We are overhauling our e-commerce business in
shopping experience in a big way. And then the third big bucket is marketing, which
is broadening our appeal and changing the perception of Walmart. And so those are
the big tenants, the assortment, the experience and then the marketing.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
One more question before I turn it back to Jeﬀ. We're asking all of the C-suite this.
How would you rate the health of the consumer on a scale of 1 to 10? And any
thoughts between diﬀerent income cohorts? Walmart has been getting a higher
income customer.
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Yeah. So the health of the consumer is diﬀerent depending on their household
income. I would say that $50k and under household is very stressed right now.
They're spending their money on groceries and they're not spending their money on
disposable income categories. And so that health of the consumer, I would say,
would be the under 5.
We, at Walmart, have been attracting more $100k-plus household income overall in
the chain and within apparel too, we're up quite dramatically over last year alone. I
think because people, one, are trading down, but also, I think, our strategy is
resonating on the apparel side, in particular, because we, as we said, are going
beyond opening price point to creating clothes that are -- serve more for wearing
occasions in those higher household income.

Page 5 of 13A - Denise Incandela
Q - Oliver Chen
A - Denise IncandelaThank you for that. Yeah, interesting. So I just was listening to how you're positioning.
Again, I think about from our own experience at Cowen and thinking about how
we're going to build our brand over the last decade, and I've said over and over
again, our primary clients, some of who are sitting in the audience here, they want a
Tiﬀany's product at a Walmart price. I've said that over and over again. Like, they
want high-quality product. They just can't aﬀord to pay what they used to pay for it.
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
And so it's interesting to hear how you balance that. And ultimately, at the end of the
day, people are willing to pay up for the product. They just -- they may not have
been in a position where their disposable income or, in this particular case, wallet
was actually able to aﬀord it.
When you talk about how to position that in the brand message, it'd be interesting
to hear how you're actually drilling down on apparel assortment and mix. And do
you look at things, like -- do you look at sort of the basket mix on a consumer basis, if
you think about that? How do you think about sort of being able to shepherd the
high-end brands like you've laid out here, the elevated brands, your private brands
and your national brands?
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Yeah. So from an assortment point of view, I talked about the three big areas, right,
like bringing in these big national brands, which historically haven't been a huge
part of our assortment, but we know our customers want to buy these brands. And
so bringing them in has been a signiﬁcant part of the strategy and is working very
well.
And then overhauling our own private brands with style and being on trend and
better quality. And so we have 6 billion-plus private brands, four of which are $2
billion-plus. So we have massive private brands. But I think we've been more in the
private label business than the branding business. And so building proper brands
and with all the marketing that goes with that and building out the DNA and thinking
about the price architecture and, of course, making sure that the style and the quality
is there, it's been a huge focus for us in number two on the slide. And then this
elevated brands, and that's where I was talking about the celebrity partnerships, et
cetera.
So all of this with the goal of democratizing fashion, to your point, she doesn't have
as much to spend. But just because she doesn't have as much to spend doesn't
mean she shouldn't look beautiful. And I do think I spent 15 years at Saks and three
years at Ralph Lauren, like I don't care whether it's a $1,000 dress or a $15 dress, it
should be beautiful. And it should have the right colors, the right prints, the right
silhouettes, et cetera. And that's where we've been dogmatic and really passionate
about getting the products right so that she can look great at whatever price pointFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Denise Incandelashe can spend. And these elevated brands, which are new, they're all within three or
four years, are really bringing a new dimension to our customer when she's in a
store.
And think about we're a grocery store layering on the style categories, right? And
we've been in all these businesses for a long time, but more foundational on the
apparel side, then style and dresses and more denim and shorts and tees and
dresses and being able to capture the tens and tens of millions of people who are in
our store every week grocery shopping and oﬀering her an apparel assortment that
serves more for wearing occasions at extraordinary price points. Everything we do,
we look at having at least a mid-teen price gap to the competition, whether it's the
$36 dress that anywhere else would be $60 or it's the $4.99 tee that would be $7
somewhere, like maniacal about providing extraordinary value.
Can I just ask one follow-up before I turn it back to OC. So it's just interesting to hear
you talk about it from your own perspective. Can you talk a little bit about how you
bring your own gender experience to the development of that? Like, just listening to
the way you talk about it, it's -- you can relate to the consumer.
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Yeah.
But is that something that was diﬀerent at Walmart when you got there? And so
you're bringing a fresh or diﬀerent perspective based on your own experiences --
individual experiences?
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Well, I think that my background is focused on taste level and luxury and branding.
And so bringing that taste level to the masses, right, the 99%. Like my career has
been focused on the top 1%. I'm super energized about focusing on the 99% and
making an impact on their lives and bringing them beautiful clothes, which everyone
should have access to. You shouldn't have to be aﬄuent to have access to beautiful
clothes has been a passion of the whole team of mine and the whole team. And so
that's where we feel like giving our customer the opportunity to save money and live
better, that's the living better part of it that we're like crazy focused on delivering
now in ways that we haven't in the past by bringing that taste level and focused on
product because we all love product and I think that this customer has been
underserved in the past with product that hasn't been as beautiful as it can be.
I don't know if that's a gender answer, but that is my background to what we're
doing and not just mine, but I have -- we have an extraordinary team who's
passionate about delivering, there is many who have come from anywhere from
Neiman Marcus to Coles to Macy's to -- from Target to Saks Fifth Avenue, like we
have really experienced fashion team who very are equally as passionate about the
vision of democratizing fashion and building it on this grocery store that has theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Magic and logic.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
So, what about digital, Denise? In terms of key digital, we believe in bricks plus clicks
plus portals and then you're a big enthusiast for physical stores, just like me too.
Could you brief us on those two points of innovation and how they are
interconnected?
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
I think -- yeah, so this is an image of our store of the future. I'll start with the store
because that's the slide order if that's okay.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Sounds good.
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Okay. So the store of the future, really excited, we got 30 of them. There is four main
focus areas. How many of you have been in a Walmart before?
Well, a lot. Great. How many of you have been in one of our store of the futures?
Okay, a few of you. So hopefully these points will resonate with you, but there is four
main things that we're working to accomplish in the store of the future.
One, we have all these new brands, we have these elevated celebrity brands and we
think that the apparel pad is now the halo for the store because it really looks good,
and I hope you agree as you go to these stores of the future and it lifts the whole
store. And so we have premium shops all along the front, typically right behind the
registers that showcase these national brands and elevated brands at extraordinary
price points, great quality close.
That's the ﬁrst point, these premium shops. The second point is creating a more
inspiring, discovery shopping experience that lends [ph] to outﬁtting which has not
necessarily been our DNA in the past because it's more of an item-focused, right, we
can sell 2 million of these items a week, but now it's about -- more about outﬁtting.
So you see the mannequins, for the ﬁrst time. For the ﬁrst time, we are oﬀeringFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 13mannequins better ﬁxtures, video displays, all of this with the goal of creating
outﬁtting and inspiration of shopping.
And then the third point is removing the clutter and making the product the hero.
The product should be the hero. We're spending all this time creating beautiful
product democratizing fashion, but if you can't see it because our stores are so
cluttered, it doesn't -- we don't win.
And so we removed 10% of the merchandise, 10% of the racks, we took price signs
oﬀ the front of the shop which we've always had these huge price tags, (Multiple
Speakers) oh, yes, it's still on the opening price point part in the back of -- in the
middle and the back of the store but upfront, we want to make the product the hero
and so widen the aisles.
And it's been an extraordinary success and it's amazing to think that you can pull out
10% of the inventory and sales will go up, but that's exactly what we've experienced.
And then the fourth and ﬁnal part is like really claiming authority where we are the
biggest retailers.
So we are the biggest Denim retailer in the country. We need to look like the biggest
Denim retailer in the country and so we created a Denim shop where. I think the
power of our positioning in Denim is more clear and even opening price point like
when we have the T [ph] and we sell 2 million of them a week. And we have, as I said
a mid-teens gap to the nearest competition like we need to stand with authority on
that.
And so that's been the goal with the store of the future, really happy about the
consumer reception and all of our insights have shown that the consumers are --
happiness is through the roof, they're saying, it looks like a better department store,
but at extraordinary value which we're trying to create a calm, wonderful shopping
experience, again where the product is the hero. And then on top of it, back to the
household income 100K [ph] household income, we have signiﬁcantly more 100K
[ph] household income this year versus last year which I think this is starting to drive.
So Halo for the store and excited to see that and we rolled out 30 this year so far,
another 300 coming, and then we have 4,000 doors altogether, so we will be on a
rollout schedule after this. But I think this is going to transform the way you think
about Walmart in total. And then also similar on the e-commerce side, which is
making sure that our brand pages and our learning [ph] pages have the right
models, the right creative that we look like we're credible in fashion, improving
photography, improving our ability to search, so using artiﬁcial intelligence, so when
I'm looking for a long sleeve black dress, I actually get a long sleeve black dress,
complete the look and then Zeekit which is a big initiative for us, which is used
leveraging AI where you can be the model and so. I think this is the future of
shopping.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Q - Oliver ChenFrankly. I think in three to ﬁve years, people only want to see themselves when they
are shopping online. And everyone wants their 15 minutes of fame in social media
like this is like a new way of shopping and so we bought this company two years ago
called Zeekit, it's quite extraordinary because it uses mapping technology.
So it's not a paper doll, but it actually maps the garment on you in a way that shows
shadows and things that other technology we've seen doesn't do. And so this is
super exciting. We're in early stages, we're oﬀering, choose your own model. We
have 150 models to choose from so that you can ﬁnd someone that your height, your
ethnicity, your weight. And so, if you're really six foot tall, really tall, dress is going to
fall on you diﬀerent than if you're super short like me 5.3, and so understanding how
it will look on you, you can choose your own model and now we're rolling, be your
own model. So there's some really exciting developments there that I think are going
to change the way people shop.
So those are some of the things that are happening on the experience, which again
you get the product right, but the shopping experience has to be right too.
And can you talk about some of the stuﬀ you're doing on the sustainability front and
how important is that as part of your...
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
I mean, we are committed to be a regenerative company, Doug MacMillan, our CEO,
talks about that all the time within the apparel part, as you know, anyone who works
in apparel knows that we are one of the biggest defenders [ph] when it comes to
water and other things. And so we have -- almost everything we do, we work with our
suppliers in terms of reducing water, moving to more sustainable fabrics, moving to -
- making sure that working conditions and women's organizations even made in
America, we've just -- we have partnered with -- this is not sustainable, but still within
kind of our round.
(inaudible)
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Yeah. Working with the supplier, we've opened up a factory in California, so which is
kind of like every aspect of that, we don't beat our chest about it, we do it as --
because it's the right thing to do. And frankly, when you're as big as we are, we feel
the obligation to do it and the responsibility to do it, because when we do it, the
country moves and so. I will say it's like -- it's part of our conversation all the time.

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantOne sneak in, like we are excited about Walmart as an ecosystem breiﬂy on the
marketplace, maybe this is a lightning round marketplace, so fulﬁllment. Speak to
those little bit in terms of how they interplay with what you're doing.
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
Yeah, so. I've talked a lot about, I guess what I would call like one (inaudible) we buy
it or we make it but marketplace, if you think about the head, the torso, the tail of the
assortment, we're focused mostly on the head and part of the torso, but in terms of
making it or buying it but there is a whole marketplace endless aisle opportunity
because the goal of course is to be the number one destination for apparel in the
country and marketplace is where we get at the endless aisle. And so our
marketplace partners are critical to our success in oﬀering her more than the items
that are in stores as well as online that we bought.
And that's massive strategic focus for us as a company because we think that
business is going to be multiplying by a factor of 7 to 10 within apparel alone within
the next four to ﬁve years. And the goal, of course, is to provide the customer every
variation of what she wants online. So really excited about the potential there.
And then on the fulﬁllment side, the goal is to provide the customer this endless
aisle of merchandise, however she wants to shop, whenever she wants to shop. And
so that, of course, means if you want to buy it in store, you buy it in a store. If you
want to buy it online and you want to have it shipped to you, we can ship it from our
stores, we can ship it from a fulﬁllment center. If you want to buy it online and you
want to pick it up, you can do that. And so leveraging our 4,000 doors as fulﬁllment
centers is a unique aspect of our strategy, enables us to get to the customer faster
and leverages our inventory across the chain. So these omnichannel services are, I
think, are important diﬀerentiator for Walmart.
We talk about that all the time also in our business, right? 80% of things people want
are pretty much the same, but it's all in how you handle the last 20% of the
deliverable and we want...
{BIO 3308484 <GO>}
And you have to be proﬁtable, right? So that's where thinking through, do you put it
in your however many FCs we have supporting apparel? Or do you put it in x
amount of doors? And what's that algorithm that optimizes the customer experience
and the SG&A?
And your ability to proﬁtably -- alright. So lightning round, a couple of things. So ﬁrst
of all, one or two areas that you think investors should be focused on with Walmart
that they're not?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Well, I think I've just talked a lot about it. I think we're in the midst of a fairly
signiﬁcant transformation, and bringing in a range of brands and a range of goods
that maybe Walmart historically hasn't been known for. I think that in this macro
environment, which is super challenging, the nice thing about Walmart is we tend to
win, whether it's in a diﬃcult environment or whether it's a good environment
because people trade down. I will say that we are a grocery store. And so the
foundation of that, especially now, is -- helps Walmart and puts Walmart in a unique
position. I would say, layering on the style categories in a credible way is the unlock
for Walmart that we are hyper-focused on, that I don't know that we nailed in the
past, but there's huge opportunity.
