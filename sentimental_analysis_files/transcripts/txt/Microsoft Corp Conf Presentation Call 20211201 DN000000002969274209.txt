Hey, there. Good morning, again. Thanks everyone for joining us for day two of the
Wells Fargo's TMT Summit. I'm Michael Turrin, Software Analyst here at Wells. I'm
very excited for our next session. I have the privilege of rolling coverage out on
Microsoft here recently and joining us today from the largest software company on
the planet. I think it's been neck and neck for largest company, but haven't had a
chance to check lately, Charles Lamanna, CVP of Business Apps and Platform from
Microsoft.
I'll start oﬀ with some questions. I have a list in front of me. But if anyone does have
something, they'd like to type in, you can shoot me an email at
michael.turrin@wellsfargo.com. I'll do my best to add those to the conversation as
well. Charles, thank you for joining us today. Certainly appreciate the time.
Yeah. Thanks for having me, Michael. I'm super excited for the discussion. I think, we
have a lot of good topics of Microsoft to share.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
I agree. So I mean, maybe in just framing the conversation to start with, we obviously
admire just how many end markets, the company has presence. And within these
days, maybe just you could help just add some context around your role,
responsibilities, key product areas of focus, just to help steer the conversation. And
we can just dive in from there.
Absolutely. Sounds good. So I head up what we call the business applications and
platform team, which basically maps to Dynamics 365 and Power Platform as our set
of products. I lead the product management, as well as the engineering component.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Charles LamannaSo basically all from design to implementation to servicing of all of those diﬀerent
Cloud oﬀerings. I've been on -- in this area for about 4 years. Before that I worked in
Azure for 4 years. And I joined Azure in 2013, when a company I founded was
acquired by Microsoft. So I'd say, I slowly moved up stack from infrastructure to PaaS
and to now SaaS, with (inaudible) platform.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
So directly sell our software companies to head eventually. I mean, it's great if you
can start as an Azure, no question. And the time you started at Azure was pretty darn
good too. I have to say, so congrats on that. Let's start with just the evolution of
business applications at Microsoft. I mean, Dynamics has been around for some time,
but Dynamics became 365 in a more recent period of time. The growth trajectory of
Dynamics 365 has really stood out, particularly of late. So can you talk just some
more around the evolution of what you're doing with Dynamics? And maybe what's
driving some of the recent strengths?
Absolutely. Certainly, as you mentioned Dynamics has been around for a long time
at Microsoft. But we went through a bit of a, I'd say, a rapid evolution about sorry, 5
years ago. And that's where we really started with this idea of Dynamics 365 in the
future of business applications at Microsoft. The ﬁrst and biggest piece of that was
really just moving our businesses to the Cloud. To be Cloud ﬁrst and really make it so
that these are businesses which are delivered as SaaS products, with easy sign up,
easy trials and easier go-to-market compared to say some legacy on premise very
heavy CRM and ERP oﬀerings. So that was the ﬁrst and most important piece. And
we're done with that for quite some time now.
The second big thing we did is, we started to reimagine what business applications
mean, kind of for the future. So not go build this apps of 2005 or 2010. But the Biz
apps of 2020, 2025, 2030. And we thought that really required us to focus on three
main themes, which fundamentally change how you adopt and use business
applications. First thing being data ﬁrst. And it's this idea that every single company
has this massive amount of data coming from everything, whether it's their e-
commerce websites, mobile applications, IoT, you name it. There's just a massive
amount of data, which is just diﬀerent from how Biz apps were in the past, where
most data was just entered by humans ﬁlling out forms. So there's this idea of large
amounts of data and leveraging it in a business application.
Second thing is that once you have all this data, you of course want to go make
predictions and use intelligence and AI and natural language understanding, NLU, to
get value from that data. And this idea of automation helps with things like reducing
costs for delivering customer support by 20% or 25% or improving targeting or
upsell or cross-sell in your e-commerce website by 5%, really top line and bottom
line moving outcomes for AI, which is very diﬀerent than just a pure AI platform. It's
very tied to the business process.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 12And the third piece is around collaboration. And it's this idea that in the past, I say,
Biz app data and Biz app users kind of lived in little islands throughout the company.
But a big push we want to go do is how do we reimagine a world where data is
shared across the company and people can work together. So just like you don't
want silos of data and silos of lines of business. How can you start to reimagine
whether that silos or people either, people can come together and work with the
right data in the right place at the right time. So we move to the Cloud. We focus on
data, AI and collaboration. And then of course, the third piece which was critical was
we built a product portfolio that was easy to adopt and this required us to break
down our monolithic CRM and ERP oﬀerings.
So -- gone are the days that people will remember where we had Dynamics, CRM
and Dynamics (inaudible) Dynamics AX, two big apps and that did everything in one
and was very diﬃcult to implement on premise. In the Cloud, we reimagine that to
actually have a bunch of individually adoptable applications, which really span
across ﬁve main areas for our customers.
Area number one is around customer support. How can we help our customers
deliver world-class customer support and we do that with things like Dynamics 365
customer service, Power Virtual Agent, AI Builder, as well as some of our new omni-
channel digital voice capabilities. Item number two is around supply chain. And we
have core supply chain execution, we have supply chain insights, we have supply
chain sustainability capabilities, all is individually adaptable modules, where you
don't have to go replace your existing ERP system.
Item number three is around revenue generation. So sales and marketing and
commerce oﬀerings. So how do we help our customers generate more revenue,
whether it's through digital sales and direct selling, or having a dedicated sales
force. Next one is around service centric operations, which is helping our customers
move to this new way of doing work and providing services as opposed to just
products.
And the last pillar number ﬁve is the Power Platform, which really is all about
enabling full company digital transformation. So those are really the ﬁve main areas,
where we decompose CRM and ERP to ﬁt into. And then provided a bunch of little
adoptable components, which can replace your core apps or can provide value on
top of those core apps.
And that last bit is why we've been able to really accelerate the growth, because
gone are the days of having to go to customers and convince them to rip and
replace stuﬀ. But instead, we can provide value right in place. And the data really
bears it out as being eﬀective, like we shared very recently, Dynamics 365 revenue
grew 48% year-over-year, 45% in constant currency, over 70% of that revenue is now
in the Cloud. And we have new areas like Power Apps, which are growing at right
around 200% year-over-year growth. So a lot of new exciting and rapidly growing
products, kind of embracing this idea in the Cloud and embracing this idea of data,
AI and collaboration. Maybe a little bit longer answer than you wanted, but I think
that's a good left to right view we're having in our Microsoft.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Charles Lamanna{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Now, it sets the stage for planning. And we've heard the intelligent applications in
Power Platform mantra quite a bit. So it's good to get some -- you know some more
context behind it as well. I want to just go through some of the key pillars that you
laid out and start with data in particular. We're hearing a lot around data right now
on changing standards, focused on ﬁrst party data, voice of the customer. Microsoft
has customer insights, a position in and around CDP. But can you just talk more
around just customer data and what you're doing from the application side there?
Absolutely. I think, like this is an area, which is really interesting right now for so many
of our customers, because we have things like IDFA changes on Apple, as well as the
move to like the cookie less future in browsers, which is just basically requiring
everybody to rethink and replan how you can track and know your customer and
how they engage with your digital service areas.
The good news is, basically every company is in some degree of digital
transformation. So they actually have a lot of digital touchpoints directly with their
customers. And that's where the value is, because that's where the data comes from.
So if you have an e-commerce website or mobile app or IoT from your Keurig
machine or something like that, that's all information that you can use to start to
understand how your customers are using your products, as well as what the next
best product to oﬀer to them or next best service to oﬀer to them. As well as I can
start to do direct marketing through various diﬀerent channels like email, message,
text messaging or just inside your own product.
So anyway, so I say that's kind of the landscape we are in. And what's great is, with
Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, we have a customer data platform or CDP, that our
customers can leverage to understand their customers by drawing from all the
diﬀerent data sources they have inside of basically their IT landscape and their
customer facing landscape. And the way customer insights works is they can connect
to over 50 diﬀerent systems out of the box, you can very rapidly and easily ingest
data, whether it's from your marketing system or say, web analytics or your back end
ERP. We can pull all of that data together in real-time to create dedicated proﬁles of
your individual customers.
And these proﬁles can then we used to change behavior, in terms of how you
engage your customer and also can be used across all your diﬀerent marketing
campaigns. And what's great is, it's the data that our customers own. It's not data
that is owned by an aggregator or gatekeeper in some form and kept locked behind
an advertising infrastructure. It's actually data that our customers owning to manage
themselves.
So it gives them some degree of independence, which is going to be more and
more important as we go through all of these fundamental changes and how you
can track and what can be provided in the browser or on mobile devices. And if youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Page 5 of 12Michael Turrin

Michael Turrin
Charles Lamannadon't do this, you're not going to be eﬀective. And we can see the impact already. I
know, over the last couple of quarters, there's been a lot in the news about the
impact of the IDFA changes, in particular, when it comes to B2C companies, as well
as companies that provide advertising.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
That's great. The other area that you mentioned was automation. And I want to touch
on that too. But maybe to start, you can level set with all the Power Platform
encompasses. We hear a lot about it. It seems like there are a number of
permutations that you can take. So maybe you can just set the stage with where
Power Platform currently ﬁts and what the functionality of the platform encompasses
today?
Yeah, absolutely. And I like to always start by talking about the Power Platform, by
kind of like explaining why it's so important for our customers. Because, if -- there's a
lot of great stats out there from IDC and Gartner. They're talking about things like
over the next 5 years, there are 500 million new apps they need to be built. And
that's more than all the apps built in the last 40 years. Longer than I've been alive.
That's a huge volume of apps that need to be built.
Additionally, something like 50% of oﬃce work could be automated today, with
current technology and tools, if there were just somebody to do it. Or 85% of
organizations can't understand their unstructured data. So, basically, what all that
means is there's this huge unmet need to go to build solutions to help our
customers usually transform.
And of course, the way you would normally solve that is by going and hiring an army
of developers. But there's also been a study saying there's a 4 million professional
developer shortfall over the next few years, who's going to make that impossible.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Pretty expensive.
But look at what that means in terms of supply and demand and cost (inaudible)
There's just a lot of challenges that are going to happen. And I'd say over the last 20
years, this has been this -- I'd say a little bit naive view that we can solve these
challenges. This huge demand and insuﬃcient supply by going and teaching
everybody how to write code. Go teach just random people how to write code, go
teach people who work in ﬁnance to write code, and we've tried that. And it has not
been successful at scale. I mean, it hasn't. I mean, it gets worse. Like literally, I used to
have that stat that there's a million developers shortfall.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Now we got to update, there's a 4 million developer shortfall. So it grows every year.
We think though that there is a way to go solve this. And that's through what we call
low code development. Low code development is just a idea that in a visual
interactive way, much like how you use Excel and PowerPoint, you can go develop
solutions that actually get the job done, that you can go knock out a huge chunk of
those 500 million new apps or that 50% of automation.
And our oﬀering in the low-code no-code space is something called the Power
Platform. And Power Platform has four main products. Power BI for low-code data
exploration, visualization and reporting. Power Apps for low code web and mobile
application development. Power Automate for low code workﬂow automation and
robotic process automation. And Power Virtual Agent for low code conversational
agents and chatbots.
All four products kind of serve diﬀerent needs, whether it's analyzing your data
acting on it or automating it. But the core idea is the same. Super easy to get started
and it can be used by everybody in the company. Business users can leverage it. IT
professionals can leverage it. And professional developers can leverage it to either
start developing for the ﬁrst time or start to actually go to code and develop
solutions faster than ever.
And if you look at this space, we have nearly 20 million monthly active users on
Power Platform today. And it's something that we really started to go big on over the
last 3 years or so. Most of the Power Platform didn't even exist 5 years ago. And we
think this opportunity is massive. We think basically, everybody on earth could
ultimately be a Power Platform user, just like everybody on earth could be a Excel
user or Outlook user. And that's kind of how big we think it can really go. And what's
exciting for us, if we go look across the Power Platform areas, because we've been in
this space for a while. We really have strong credibility. Power BI is far and away the
leader, basically on every access and the Gartner Magic Quadrant, when it comes to
self service BI.
On Power Apps, Gartner has come out and said, it's the number one low code app
development platform. And we just announced that it's over 10 million monthly
active users on Power Apps alone. So very big market leading oﬀerings that we have,
that we think are going to continue to grow at a very aggressive pace. And like I
mentioned earlier, Power Apps is growing at right around 200% year-over-year from
a revenue generation perspective as well. And this kind of all complements and
extends, what we have insight Dynamics 365. So you can go buy one of our apps if
we have it. And if you want to do something that, that doesn't go out of the box can
easily build in the Power platform. That is a winning combo.
And that's actually why Dynamics and Power Platform are together inside of
Microsoft, because we think they go so closely and so well, when you leverage both
because it's all about business process transformation, about business value,
business outcomes. In some cases, an app is great for oﬀ the shelf. Sometimes there
is no app for that, you got to build it yourself, drop into power platform. Tons ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Charles Lamannaenergy there. And that's something that I'd say deﬁnitely worth tracking over the
next couple of years, is how those kind of that vision continues to accelerate for us.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
It makes a lot of sense. One of the areas that I think investors have become more
conscious of is RPA. And Power Automate has a great story around automating
repetitive tasks as well. And so I'm wondering, if you can help characterize where
Power Automate ﬁts in that discussion? Is the right way to think about that more
Microsoft-centric use cases? Or is it broader than that? And I'm just wondering, you
could just help level set the vision around what you're doing with Automate?
Yeah, I'd say, our view is that Power Automate today is a broad based automation
platform. And that today, we're a market leader from feature capability and adoption
perspective. And of course, we're going to have great integration with other
Microsoft products, like that's true. That's what's really exciting about being
Microsoft, we can build these amazingly.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Easy for you to do, yeah.
Yeah. Right, it's a lot easier. People are down the hall or across the street to go build
those integrations. But absolutely, connectivity to all kinds of systems is key. In fact,
Power Automate has over 550 data connectors available out of the box to sales
force, service now, workday, SAP, you name it. We probably can connect to it for
typical enterprise capability.
We also recently did an integration of a company and even go accelerate that further
in the case of Power Automate for more deeper enterprise data connectivity. And
also we have Power Automate desktop, which supports UI based automation. The
classical RPA, right on Windows. It's included in Windows 11 and it supports all
applications on Windows. And there's lots of ways that we do that with accessibility
handles and computer vision and AI, but it supports any type of App. And SAP is I
think the most used -- SAP UI is probably the most used Power Automate desktop UI
automation stuck today.
So deﬁnitely, it's a broad based RPA product. And this is a place where we think we
really have something unique at Microsoft. And the reason I think that uniqueness is
important is because RPA is going through a little bit of a change. Like internally, we
call it the move from like RPA to Cloud RPA or RPA to RPA 2.0 or Gartner calls a
hyper automation, is this idea of automation just being UI macros, is kind of a gross
simpliﬁcation of what you really want to do on the go deliver business value.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 12Michael Turrin
Charles LamannaAnd instead when we talk about Cloud RPA, it's API connectivity. It's deep and
integrated AI capabilities. It's the ability to also do UI automation, but also to even go
run manage VMs in the Cloud for unintended bots. So people are deep in RPA.
That's a key component. We have recently announced Azure Virtual Desktop
integration. So you can basically run everything elastically in a scale, with no
infrastructure and nothing deployed locally, with Power Automate. We're the only
ones in the market that do that today.
We have the most connectors via API of anyone in the market today. So that Cloud
RPAs in API space is super key. And that's really what's unlocked. The growth
numbers we've seen. We have hundreds of thousands of organizations.
Organizations, not people, a lot more people. But hundreds of thousands of
organizations using Power Automate today, doing billions of automation actions
every month today.
And the reason is because the Cloud RPA delivery mechanism is so easy to get
started. That's why we could put Power Automate desktop inside of Windows 11.
That's why people anywhere in the world can walk up with the powerautomate.com
and build a bot in less than 60 seconds, no infrastructure required. That is really
compelling, fast time to value and it's not just on the low edge case, it's at the high
end. We have great case studies with companies like Coca-Cola, where they have
used our Power Automate to simplify 11 step processes, which costs 10s of millions of
dollars and to really replace emails and spreadsheets and phone calls and that type
of thing.
And they actually have over 4,000 solutions already deployed to Coca-Cola. So you
can really go broad, it's low code so it's accessible. And it scales all the way up to the
complex. And we absolutely think that we're going to be a major player there. And
look, the most recent Gartner MQ, we show up as a strong leader in RPA as well. And
there is a few case studies I saw like JPMorgan, put one out where we're -- I think
taught to consideration for RPA vendors as well today. So a lot of great data out
there about how Power Automate can be used broadly, as well as narrowly at a lot of
our customers.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Another great stats. A couple of questions have come in from the audience. I want to
throw those in. And the ﬁrst one is actually one that I was -- I think intending to ask,
too. I mean, you mentioned, I think service and support very early in terms of the
number of things that you laid out for us at the start. You talked about virtual agent
we've seen. I mean, we've seen that proliferation of where teams has gotten to. And
so the question is, do you have goals in around the contact center? Is that an area
that you could see Microsoft investing in more heavily in the future? Or how do you
think about contact center, especially next to something like teams?
Yeah. Absolutely. So I'd say, absolutely, that's an area that we look at. And I'd say, like
contact center is a way that you implement customer support, as well as how youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 12implement things even like revenue generation, like a lot of companies have contact
centers just for sales purposes. So, but I'd say, contact center is super exciting for us
for a few reasons. Number one, we have a lot of great assets in that space already.
Dynamics 365 customer service is an app module. It has a lot of market share out
there, and it's growing quickly. And it's something that the support agents in a
contact center use each and every day to work cases.
Similarly, we also have Power Virtual Agent for automating conversational agents
across web chat, as well as social channels and very recently voice. And then we also
have a lot of other contact center AI capabilities, which also go help basically our
customers automate tasks by their coaching and assisting to support agents,
whereby automating and driving self service for the customer themselves. And
what's exciting about all this is, it's a 40 plus billion dollar a year TAM, if you go look
across customer CEC, CCARs and CCAI, so three big categories over $40 billion
TAM.
And it has two major disruptions happening right now. The ﬁrst being, it's been a
Cloud laggard for a while. And but not anymore, I mean, everybody now has to get
this stock to the Cloud. On the last I saw it and it's the majority this is, like from an
analyst, the majority of folks still deploy their core contact center infrastructure on
premise. That's all going to go to the Cloud, just like everything is. And that's where
Teams are super valuable, because we built this amazing call routing, call distribution
points of presence around the globe inside of Teams infrastructure. And we're able
to build on top of that, as we go think about moving that to the Cloud. So Cloud is a
major disruptive item.
Second one is AI. Like AI is a buzzword, if you hear all the time. Inside the contact
center, it's probably one of the best places where you can map AI back to business
value. Because if you can say automate 20% of customer support requests, that can
be a $0.5 billion return on investment over 5 years for large B2C companies. And it's
rare where you ﬁnd places, where there's such clear yield. One more point of
deﬂection or self service through AI. And like -- an example that would be you call
up an airline to change your ﬂight. Instead of having to talk to an agent, you can
actually just do it by talking to a bot saying, hey, I want to change my ﬂight, here's my
ﬂight number I want you to change to this. If you can, one point can be $10 million
for our large customers.
And every time you make AI better, it's another points and other points and other
point. So I would say that is a really exciting focus for us, because you don't usually
get those opportunities when it comes to business applications. Usually it's a little
more amorphous right. Move to us for your customer support agent experience and
it will be better. Well, how do you measure it? What's the return? Here it's very
simple. Use our contact center AI capabilities and we can reduce your costs, and we
can prove it because your case volume that goes to agents will drop.
That is a very, very exciting challenge for us. And at Microsoft, we have such strong AI
assets across what we already built inside of Oﬃce, inside of Teams, inside of Azure,
as introducing Dynamics that we really can deliver on this promise in a meaningfulFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Charles Lamannaway for our customers. So super bullish in there. And Power Virtual Agent is one of
the most important examples of the AI automation capabilities that our customers
can do. Because, it's a Power Virtual Agent bot, which is going to go service a
customer as opposed to a human. So that's kind of where we think the future is
going very much in that space.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Great. And it's amazing how many things you have in your overview. There's another
question that came in. It's more just classiﬁcation or characterization within Dynamics
365 growth. And the question is, is there a way to think about how much of that
could be coming from just replacement of on-prem Dynamics? Maybe you can just
help us understand where you are in the journey of the transition from, like you said
the two products set to 365? Is that mostly complete, or just add some more
characterization on the growth?
Yeah. So I think that the data -- the stat that we shared to really highlight. (Technical
Diﬃculty) The ﬁrst thing, I'd say is the growth is predominantly coming from net new
workloads deployed by our customers, not by just migrating on premise workloads.
And you can see that really with the two stats that we shared. Number one, over 70%
of Dynamics 365 revenue comes from the Cloud. Overall Dynamics comes from the
Cloud. So that's a super important stat.
The base is now too small on-prem to really be meaningful to actually go drive the
other growth number. Second, being just shy of 50% year-over-year growth. We also
can't really do that just by converting our existing customer installed base. And so I'd
say the -- really, it's the migration phase is largely over. I'd say, it's much more about
to keep this growth up and the growth that we've done over the last 12 months really
requires us to be landing Cloud workloads that are new with our customers across
those ﬁve pillars, I talked about earlier. And those are really the ﬁve areas we focus
on. And there's a lot of Cloud only workloads there to like Power Platform, Cloud
only. if you go look at a lot of our supply chain assets, Cloud only. So I'd say
deﬁnitely it's Cloud, Cloud, Cloud all day and that's where our big focus is for sure.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
How do you -- I'm just curious how do you prioritize internally given there are so
many directions your applications business can evolve towards? We've talked about
some of the most signiﬁcant technology trends out there. And there's probably a
long list of things that are underneath that, that you could explore too. So how --
what is the decision process that informs what makes it to the top versus what might
fall further down? Is it customer feedback? Is it just some of the data that you're able
to analyze? Maybe you can just give us a sense, because like it's amazing and I can't
imagine what it looks like from your perspective?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Page 11 of 12Michael Turrin
Charles Lamanna
Michael Turrin
Charles LamannaYeah, I would say like, ﬁrst and foremost, we live and breathe the customer both
quantitatively and qualitatively. We have a fairly large I'd say, like a surprisingly large
installed base, where talked about really it's hundreds of thousands across Power
Platform and Dynamics 365 of organizations. So we can do some interesting
quantitative analysis based on that population to understand what features are being
used, where deep customer has to happen that type of thing.
Also on the engineering team side, we work very close with customers. We have
things like a Customer advisory Board, a Partner Advisory Council. We have things
like power champions in our digital community. So a lot of ways where it's very one
to one. So customer is always at the center and has always been informed that we go
build.
There's another piece, which is we choose kind of strategically where we want to go.
What's the ﬁeld look like. And those ﬁve pillars I'd say we chose those ﬁve pillars
around customer support, supply chain, service centric operations, revenue
generation in Power Platform. Because those are areas where we already have assets
at Microsoft, where we think there is a lot of disruption happening in those markets. I
was able to talk about contact center, customer support a bit. But if we have a same
type of viewpoint across all ﬁve pillars, certain disruptions happening. And then item
number three is something that we think accrues into the broader Microsoft Cloud
story. Because at the end the day like Biz App, we love Biz Apps. But the most
important thing is the Microsoft Cloud, the commercial Cloud as we position it. And
you can kind of see that a lot of our announcements and a lot of our positions. But
we also always are carefully factoring in and how do we contribute back to the
overall Microsoft Cloud story. So, those are three main levers we used to choose the
ﬁve investment areas. Then within those areas, we focus on the customer feedback.
