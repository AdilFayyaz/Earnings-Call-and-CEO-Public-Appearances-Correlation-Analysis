{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Perfect. Un-muted and we're live. Welcome back everybody. Again, I'm Brad Zelnick,
software analyst here at Credit Suisse. And this is day two of the 24th Annual Credit
Suisse Tech conference normally in sunny Scottsdale, Arizona, but virtually just as
many things aren't here in 2020. For this session, truly delighted to be joined by
Jared Spataro of Microsoft. Jared is Corporate Vice President at Microsoft,
responsible for Modern Work, which includes the entire Microsoft 365 business.
Jared welcome and thanks for being here.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
So great to be here with you, Brad. Thanks. Thanks very much for having me.

(Question And Answer)
Awesome. Well, look forward to a productive conversation. There's lots to talk about.
The format of this presentation is meant to be a ﬁreside chat. I've got a lot of topics
to go through, and maybe if we just dive right in. So Jared, maybe if we could start
oﬀ with Microsoft 365. You've positioned Microsoft 365 as the world's productivity
cloud, bringing together productivity, collaboration, communications, and analytics
capabilities, all on one integrated platform, which I think is unique. Can you just help
us frame that in the context of Microsoft's larger vision and mission statement to
empower everyone and every organization to achieve more?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
You bet. Yes. Microsoft 365 for us is a key pillar of the overall Microsoft strategy. As
you indicated, world's productivity cloud is the way that we've talked about it and itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

Page 2 of 13Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jared Spatarois this comprehensive solution, in so many ways, we've taken a diﬀerent tact than a
lot of the market and we have tried to bring in what we would call workloads,
diﬀerent services and integrate them together to essentially provide a platform for
the digital workforce.
And that little phrase, I think we're going to come back to a couple of times since the
idea of a platform for a digital workforce. The design principle behind all there, Brad,
really has been people-centered, what we had seen so much of historically in
technology had been this idea of kind of building an app for this or an app for that.
Microsoft 365 is meant to be centered on the people. It's meant to really create a
workspace in the cloud for a particular person, and for that person to work on their
own and to work with other people both inside and outside their organization, and
to really create a brand-new digital environment for them to conduct business in a
commercial sense. So it provides us very broad kind of conceptual platform for us.
As you indicated, we brought a whole bunch of diﬀerent workloads into that
collaboration, communication, particularly with Teams, I hope we'll have a chance to
talk a little bit -- a lot about Teams today. We bring together content management.
We bring together process automation. It is underpinned by security and
compliance and work that we're doing, that allows people to use all of these things
across devices, across platforms. So there's a lot of breadth and depth to it.
The last thing I'll say is, a lot of times people have compared and contrasted what we
have done with this digital platform with kind of a best-of-breed approach, may be
bringing a Slack and a Zoom and a Dropbox together to assemble a similar type of
oﬀering. When we think about what we're trying to do, we're really trying to create a
no compromise solution. We're looking for both breadth of workloads, so
completeness of workloads, but we want to be able to compete head-to-head on
each workload and win and beat and have depth and be very deep in those
workloads as well. And I hope we get to that as well, but that no compromises
approach is really important to us.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
I like the way you put that with no compromises. And in doing so especially over this
past year, very unique year that it is, Microsoft and what -- everything that you're
doing has been very helpful to enabling today's workforce. And I guess along those
lines, how much of the change that we're seeing in the workforce today in your
opinion is transitory versus truly changing how work gets done? And how, if at all,
does it impact your own strategy and prioritization within Microsoft 365 and Teams?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
What (inaudible) year, I don't think I have to be that millionth person to say that, but
it's just -- it is (inaudible) to think, what a year, we're like 30 days away from the end
of the year and it has been an incredible 12 months, that's for sure. We kind of see it
this way, and Satya has used this framing and we used it very early on when the
pandemic kind of sent everybody home in the March time frame (inaudible), we
talked about respond, recover and reimagine. What we meant by that is that we
anticipate and this is the way it largely played out that there'd be such a big shock toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jared Spataro
Q - Brad Alan Zelnickthe system as everything went digital, that the ﬁrst thing that our customers would
want to do is to just to respond, to essentially scramble and say, we've got to keep
operations going. Then once they kind of had gotten to that point, they had a little
bit of operations running, they were going to need to look at the recovery. I mean,
how do we get back to kind of where we were in terms of being able to conduct all
the business that we were doing, but now in a diﬀerent way.
And then the ﬁnal part of that -- respond, recover, the third part is reimagine, and we
anticipated that people would say, huh, what are we learning here as we have moved
so much of our processes, so many processes digital online, are there things that we
could do diﬀerently, because we found that in the early parts of the pandemic,
people were just trying to repeat what they had done in the old world kind of in this
new digital world. And there was this opportunity to reimagine that we think that.
What we think will happen to answer your question in terms of what will persist is
that the reimagining will largely persist. We think that people will say, huh, that's
really interesting. I'll give you a very speciﬁc example from Microsoft. We run an
annual conference for our customers that we call, Ignite, it's very large. We typically
get somewhere around 30,000 people in a city. We're excited about it. And we have
a great time. In 2019, that was what it looked like for us. In 2020, we ran that event
virtually, it cost a fraction of what it normally does.
We reached 275,000 people, just that order of magnitude much greater than we had
gotten before. We will deﬁnitely get back together we think for events as an
example, but we'll never do them in the same way. We think that they'll have a digital
component going forward. So a lot of what we think will persist will be the learning
of what digital capabilities can do to augment how we get business done and we're
going to keep a lot of that. Just in The Wall Street Journal today, there's an article
about travel perhaps being down for a long time as much as kind of 36%, 39% or so.
We think people will travel again, but we think what they're learning right now is how
to use video communications to do business in a way that they didn't know how to
do it before the pandemic. So those things we think will persist.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Makes a ton of sense. Maybe just, Jared, as we think about the overall market
opportunity and in trying to understand the TAM that you're serving with Microsoft
365 and then with Teams in particular, how does that help you execute against this
opportunity?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes. Let me take a step back actually and try and parse out the way we are seeing the
demand signals and then go into that TAM question.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Sure.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jared Spataro{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Of course, right now, the immediate demand signal that has been strongest most in
our phase [ph] has been video conference. We think that that -- that's been very
clear. I think this week is a really interesting week because already in the investor
community we're starting to see people ask, wow, what happens post pandemic,
what happens when the conditions changed a little bit? We see it this way. Video
conferencing was that immediate signal, but the long-term opportunity is not video
conferencing, the long-term opportunity really is this platform for work, life and
learning. This digital platform for work, life and learning.
So when we think about the TAM, we historically have thought about the TAM for my
business what we would call, Modern Work, as essentially knowledge workers. And
knowledge workers in developed nations in fact. But what is happening with this
opportunity that's opening up for a digital platform for a digital workforce going
forward is that we see two really big ways for the TAM to expand. First is in socket
expansion where we can move well beyond knowledge workers into ﬁrst line
workers, SMB, education, industry type scenarios.
And the second is TAM expansion as we're able to move well outside the traditional
core oﬃce suite and move into things like security, compliance, collaboration, well
into these areas that we are seeing Teams be able to take us. So that original market
opportunity we saw is kind of $200 billion to $300 billion. We're starting to see that
open up in very signiﬁcant ways, just adding the security TAM, as an example, is well
over $100 billion of extra TAM. So lots of TAM. And then when we look at the actual
sockets, the number of people by 2023 with this new kind of inﬂux of digital
transformation. Gartner estimates that there will be over a billion knowledge workers
and we see roughly two billion ﬁrst line workers out there. Teams allows us in
particular to get at all of that new TAM and again both in terms of monetization
dollars and in terms of sockets. So we see just so much opportunity that this digital
platforms opening.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
It's clearly tremendous and connecting front line workers back in with knowledge
workers and everybody else and along all these diﬀerent dimensions sockets
everything you talk about, very, very exciting. Maybe just to move on to innovation
within Microsoft 365. What can you share about the foundational investments in
capabilities like AI for example? How can these investments further contribute to the
value of having an integrated solution?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes, for this one, I'm particularly excited because there's a bit I don't get to talk about
very often that for this audience I think will be appealing. The --a lot of the innovation
that we're doing, and the reason we're so excited is, as everything moves digital. We
have this opportunity to stop this escape of the digital exhaust, if you will. Everything
that you do digitally, it kind of creates signal is the way that we talk about it. That
signal can be as rich as a document that I write, but it can also just be simply the fact
that you and I meeting together one time, two times, three times over time. ThatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Q - Brad Alan Zelnicksignal is incredibly valuable. And today, most of that signal really does dissipate out
into the ether.
So the basis for a lot of our innovation is this idea that we should stop letting that
signal escape and start capturing and aggregating that signal, then reason over that
signal, and provide value in two ways. Value back to the end user in the form of
services that can help them really get work done, and value back to the organization
in the form of kind of insights that help them understand what work is getting done,
how they can get work done more eﬃciently.
So to make that really speciﬁc at an end user well, we talk about this idea of really
creating ﬁrst in graph, and we don't talk about it externally a whole lot but we call it
the Microsoft Graph. This graph is the aggregation of signal. It is done on a per
customer or what we would say as a per tenant basis. So it's speciﬁc to the customer,
the tenant. And then it's even speciﬁc at the graph level to an individual user. So for
instance, at an individual user level, we can hand back things, like, a designer in the
cloud that manifest itself on PowerPoint. We've been doing this now for a couple of
years. We have billions of slides kept as we now suggest slide designs for people. In
fact, a quarter of all the slides are kept, that's a pretty high keep rate, 25% of the
slides we're presenting these days were kept.
We've got this great set of new services we've been integrating into Excel as an
example. And this allows us to reason over data models, it even allows us to use
natural language queries to create pivot charts. On pivot tables, imagine, back in the
day when you and I were learning that stuﬀ, if you could say, oh, you just talk to it
now and that's what my kids will know, and so again, a really powerful service. And
the services go on and on. We have Editor in Word, which uses neural net-powered
assistance, all of that is based on signal. Within Teams, automatic transcription and
translation, speaker identiﬁcation, search, all of that is based on these signals and
processing of the signals. And as we move to the organization, we can even kind of
expand the way we use that. We have something called Project Cortex, which creates
a knowledge graph of an organization. This ends up becoming the most important
database, I think, for optimizing productivity because it can help the organization
know what it knows and help people to tap into that knowledge.
And we're even using all of this signal for security with Microsoft Intelligent Security.
We read over eight trillion of those signals that I just referenced a day across
products and helping with remediation and proactive identiﬁcation security threats
as well. So that's kind of how we think about the innovation is we see this wonderful
opportunity not just to create the platform as we talked about a few minutes ago, but
then to make sure we're using the platform to capture, aggregate, process and
create real value from that signal. That's where you're to see a lot of the innovation
coming from.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Very helpful, and really helps to better appreciate the underlying foundation of
innovation that's driving so much, which we, as a knowledge worker, sitting in front
of a computer look forward to taking more and more advantage of and hopefullyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

A - Jared Spatarobeing able to get my pivot tables. I'm usually relying on people on my team these
days. But in any case, can we -- Jared, can we dive a little bit deeper into Teams.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Would love to.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
I got several questions for you. So, maybe for starters, you've rolled out over
hundred new features for Teams in the last year. What are you most excited about
and what are you hearing from customers?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes, I'll start ﬁrst with the very ﬁrst feature that we conceived up, produced and rolled
out during the pandemic, we call that Together Mode. The -- when I tell the story of
Together Mode, I like to talk about the reaction that people ﬁrst had when they ﬁrst
saw the graphical user interface from Xerox PARC years and years ago. It was
rudimentary. It looked a little cartoony. People weren't sure if it was going to work.
But if you had some vision, you realize when you saw that gooey, you were seeing
the future. We feel that same way about Together Mode. Just to ground everyone,
Together Mode was really based oﬀ of customer demand. What we were seeing is
that there was ﬁrst this real fatigue in using video conferencing products that it
literally was making people tired and they didn't know why. We went and did some
work and started to realize that it put a tax on the brain that wasn't there when they
were in person with each other and we didn't quite know why. And then the second
thing is we found that people had a hard time connecting with each other when they
were kind of in this Brady Bunch Square view.
So based on that, we pulled in some experts, looked at what we had learned from
virtual reality and realize that we could use AI to kind of cut people out of their own
background and place them into a shared background. We do this now in all sorts of
diﬀerent shared backgrounds. You can have a meeting room, an auditorium, even a
coﬀee shop. You can all be there lined up next to each other. The science, when
we've gone back in and done it, the science actually tells us the brain is taxed less.
So because we've removed that extraneous background information, it is much
easier for your brain to process, and it does create more of a connection between
people as well.
And I think we're kind of seeing the future there of digital transformation, kind of
digital innovation is starting to be focused on people connecting as opposed to just
getting some sort of like mechanical task done. So Together Mode is by far one of
my favorites. We actually use that same tech by the way to power the NBA, National
Basketball Association. We had 60,000 fans that attended more 170 NBA games
together, including Shaq and President Obama, and we were just proud as could be
to see that tech used in that way to connect people.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

Page 7 of 13Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jared SpataroBut from there, what I would say is in addition to those types of things, we've seen
whiteboard as an example, and the integration of a whiteboard into Teams where
people could do creative work really be a diﬀerentiator for us, that is becoming
increasingly important as people are really having to get back to being creative and
they're not able to be in the same physical space. Breakout rooms have been
something that it has been a part of the industry. We used it here today Brad you
and I. We didn't have it in Teams. It was something that we needed to catch up on.
We quickly caught up on that. Same thing was true for what we call 7x7 gallery view,
so this is the ability just stack a lot of people into the space, but we're even
innovating beyond that as we think about the ﬂow of work. From our perspective,
video conferencing is just one workload in the experience that Teams oﬀers. So we
do things like meeting prep, meeting recaps, transcriptions of meetings. I tell my
team the best meeting is the meeting I didn't have to attend and I can read up on
later and that's what I love. We're really working to ensure that a meeting is just one
component of how works gets done and that allows us to take advantage of all the
capabilities of Team from chat to meet to call to ﬁnally kind of collaborate on
content. So lots there, I'm happy to go into any more detail. I've got a lot of energy
for Teams right now.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
No, it's awesome and I look forward to Together Mode. I haven't used it. And to me it
sounds like it would be one step closer to the metaverse, and it's certainly
something if it will help to reduce my blood pressure and be less taxing. It's
something I look forward to using at some point. Maybe just to pivot from there,
within Teams, I wanted to talk about the telephony opportunity. Just to get a sense --
from your perspective, how do you size it? How big is the actual opportunity? And
how does your strategy here diﬀer from competitors like a RingCentral which I think
is fairly well known? And would you say at this point that Microsoft is all-in when it
comes to the UCaaS space?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
You bet. We're really proud of our standing in the Gartner Magic Quadrant they just
release here recently where we are a leader, a leader in that. And a leader in the
UCaaS Magic Quadrant as well, so a leader in the Meetings Magic Quadrant. We are
deﬁnitely all-in. In a moment, I hope we get a chance to talk a little bit more broadly
about Teams monetization, but phone system and the ability to kind of help
customers move from using Teams as maybe a chat platform or a meetings platform
up to telephony, super-important for us.
Depends on how you look at the market, but we certainly look at as being as big as
hundreds of billions of dollars of TAM. And I guess what I would say is, I would quote
one of the customers I met with most recently, I was asking them how they were
changing as a result of the pandemic, what they thought stick with them. This
customer said to me, you know what, we've realized that work is no longer just a
place you go, it's a set of activities that we need you to do no matter where you are.
And I thought that that was a great way to kind of frame up this telephony
opportunity for us. When we are all-in to telephony, we don't think of it as just a
single workload, we think of telephony integrated into that ﬂow of work that I just
brieﬂy mentioned. We think work gets done through several activities that weaveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jared Spataro[ph] through one-on-one interactions, personal focus time, meetings, phone calls,
recorded events, all sorts of diﬀerent types of work. And Teams is built to support
that.
The telephony components are integrated deeply into what we're doing with that
whole idea of the ﬂow of work. And just this week, we had a really good moment
where we went out to the market and just re-emphasize kind of some of the
innovations that we have. With the ﬂow of work, we've got some really great stuﬀ out
there as we think about what we have to oﬀer. The ﬁrst is [ph] really streamline
calling experience is integrated right into the Teams' experience itself. We can save
call recordings into OneDrive and SharePoint. We even do things like identify spam
and do spam ideas, people are calling your number, you can easily transfer calls
between mobile and desktop. We have -- for end users, things like call merge and
low data mode. So, they can use calling at diﬀerent types of situations, enhanced
reverse number lookup. And then we provide really powerful call control and API
capabilities for organizations. And we see them using this to integrate, for instance,
Teams directly into their call center application so that their call center agents can
use the telephony components of Teams.
So again, our diﬀerentiator for this is that we are looking to be that platform to
support the work as it ﬂows through diﬀerent activities. And telephony, it's just one
component of that. We think it's important sometimes in census of groups of people
meeting together, sometimes in very specialized applications like a call center and
just always there, the dial tone that's available for you. So we see an awesome
opportunity as we continue to walk customers up the stack, if you will.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Awesome. And earlier, you talked about not compromising across all the diﬀerent
activities and functions within the broader umbrella of what Teams can oﬀer. But
when it comes to a customer who perhaps already has a Zoom or a Slack, for
example. How are those customer conversations diﬀerent? And what exactly is your
value proposition there?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes, I'll start by saying, we deﬁnitely see dual usage. This is the place where we have
to earn our customers' business every day and we actually have to earn it down at
the individual user level. They have to be satisﬁed with the experience, even if, for
instance a centralized IT (inaudible) out. However, what we see kind of thematically is
that dual usage plays to our strengths over time. It does so at the end user level
because of the integration where Teams oﬀers in a single app, things that other
competitors don't. It does oﬀer you that ability to chat, to call, to meet, to content
collaborating the work together, even to integrate into process automation, the work
that we're doing with power platform all on a single app.
So users deﬁnitely feel drawn in that because of the simpliﬁcation for them of their
own workﬂow. So that's one thing. And then as we start to talk with decision makers
within an organization, I think we have a great value prop. Cost savings immediately
comes up from our perspective. There is a gravitational pull to a platform. We thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 13Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jared Spatarothere's a lot of economic value in that platform, and we can oﬀer that combination of
calling and meeting and chat for a much cheaper price than you could if you're
going to try and go out and assemble those things by pulling together these other
separate players and putting them.
In addition to that, there's still cost savings beyond just the per user per month type
saving you can do because typically you're going to have to do some integration of
identity across diﬀerent service providers. You're also going to have to look carefully
at things like security compliance, all of that is built in. So, the conversations are
good. We think dual use, again, plays to our favor. We love it when we can get in the
door with whatever workload customers are ready for, sometimes that's meeting,
sometimes it's chat, sometimes it's just content collab. Once we get in the door,
we're very conﬁdent in our ability to have end users discover the power and then we
can have a really good discussion with the decision maker. So, that general idea of
kind of landing and expanding as the industry we talk about kind of characterizes
our business model with Teams and our breadth there, and then the depth in the
workloads allows us to compete really well.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
That makes perfect sense to me, Jared. But maybe if I could ask from a competitive
standpoint, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge. There are rumors in the
market talking about Slack potentially being acquired and becoming part of a
broader application platform and I'm not looking for you to comment or speculate
on rumors. But more broadly, I think that this can validate or this does or would
validate Microsoft's approach to collaboration in line with everything you've just said
and comments we've heard from Satya recently about moving beyond transactional
meetings and staying in the ﬂow of work and maintaining business process context.
And I'd just be curious, if you'd agree with that view or any other thoughts that you
might have?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes. Sure. Well, of course, I won't comment on the speciﬁc rumors about a
transaction, but in terms of what's happening right now, we think that there are a lot
of signals perhaps even these rumors as examples that would really validate this idea
that platform -- and digital platform is starting to emerge. I kind of think about this
way when I talk to those customers, they say, when you think back and how diﬀerent
platforms emerge, one of the ones in my life time I remember very well is the days
when I carry that ﬂip phone, a PalmPilot and an MP3 player. Those are awesome.
They're fantastic technologies. But there was a platform gravitational pull that meant
that they were going to be subsumed into a smartphone. Because once you put
those things together, you could do amazing things, they created a platform on
which you could not only do those three things, but other people could build, and n
that particular case apps that, we're able to take advantage of the capabilities of the
platform.
We think the same thing is happening right here right now and we think Teams is the
greatest example we have of it. We think of it as a scaﬀolding. We think of it as a
platform. We certainly love what we would call those built-in ﬁrst-party workloads ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

Page 10 of 13Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jared Spatarochat, meet, collaborate, call. But we're even more excited as people continue to use
it as a platform and use things like Power Platform to build process automation, their
own customized apps, do some really interesting things. So yes, I think we're going
to continue to see this basic form of consolidation happen in the industry. We're
excited because we feel like we've got a jump on it and we're just trying to make
sure that we can stay very focus on customer needs right now, because that is the
place to be, it's changing every day. Like I'm on the phone every day with customers
just trying to understand, how are you guys thinking about this? What are you doing
with real estate? How are you thinking about events? How you think about spend on
people in these areas, and we're trying to use that to inform your investment
strategy.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Got it. I want to be mindful of the time. This is such a great conversation, but I think
we've only got ﬁve or so minutes left at least on this end. Maybe I'll bounce around
here a bit and again so much to talk about. Maybe on -- just on oﬃce 365. Can you
talk a little bit about the free trials you started oﬀering earlier this year? And how the
conversion rate has been relative to expectations? And then speciﬁc to SMBs, are
you seeing signs of recovery? And do you expect to see free trials in the SMB space
convert at the same pace as enterprise customers?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
You bet. Let me talk a little bit about those trials just quickly to ground everybody.
We oﬀered three types of trials just as the pandemic starting in March going April,
May, June, and they essentially were trials to large enterprises, trials to small and
medium-sized businesses through our partner channel and trials to SMBs through
direct. It was a bit of a leap of faith because most of our sales model had been
oriented in a diﬀerent way. We didn't typically give things away for free and then sell
later. We are just starting to see those trials come to fruition. Now most of them were
six months long and the early signals are very good. In SMB, as an example, we are
starting to see in both the partner trials and direct that the conversion rate is
excellent. I've been very pleased with it and I wasn't quite sure how it would end up
for enterprise, but we're seeing that the trials have been -- had been well-received
there and also are converting very well.
So I'm pleased with what's happening. In fact, so pleased that we really see this as an
opportunity for us to really kind of transform our own sales motion. In SMBs in
particular to talk about are we seeing signs of recovery, SMBs are typically that place
that we're going to see the immediate signal of what's actually happening in the
economy. So in our Q?? the SMBs are really strong, and we started to see that in our
demand signal. We did see some solid recovery in Q1. We're continuing mostly to
see those signals go on. But of course, my ﬁngers are crossed just given what's
happening in across the world right now, particularly in the United States and
Europe with this wave of COVID kind of moving through. So in general, if I recap, I
just feel like trials have been very good for us, we're pleased with the early signal
that we're seeing on those trial conversions but a lot of that will come to fruition this
quarter and even into next quarter and we're looking at using it more broadly as we
think about how to transform our own sales motion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

Cool. I think we got time for maybe a couple more. Maybe just on security,
something you touched on earlier. How do you think about Teams and really the
overall shift to more distributed work and a more distributed workforce? How is that
impacting security postures of your customers? And what can you oﬀer from
Microsoft or even in partnership to help resolve and address these pain points?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes, what an opportunity security has really been for us. (inaudible) like this, the
move to almost everything being digital means that there's more data, more devices
to protect. It also means the companies who have long held beliefs about what
security meant to them often bound, for instance, to the workplace, the physical
workspace, they've had to change overnight. We have taken a posture for a long
time that in the industry has been called zero trust. It literally is. You have zero trust
for the people, the devices, et cetera, people have to verify it, every device has to be
veriﬁed, that has been proven to be I think the right stance to take.
As all of a sudden, companies have realized that your own home oﬃce has to be as
secure as the campus oﬃce was. So it's just a brand new day for so many people. We
have a lot to use Teams to lead us into that security discussion, three in particular,
Data Loss Prevention, where we can use DLP, data loss prevention within Teams to
really secure the communications, and Teams what we call Advanced Threat
Protection where customers can protect users from malicious software both
proactively and with automated remediation. And ﬁnally Cloud App Security where
we certainly secure Teams, but then we allow people to use that same security
service to secure other apps in their portfolio.
Teams has helped us to really explain the value, I think, of all three of those things in
nice way. But more broadly taking that step back on Microsoft security, man, what an
opportunity. We really diﬀerentiate from the competition in three ways, we have
built-in security experiences. So in other words, we secure our own stuﬀ as you
would expect us to with really best-in-class security, but we also integrate with other
solutions and secure other components of a customer's estate something that's little
known. And ﬁnally, we have all those signals we talked about to apply AI and
automation to what we're doing with security and this just puts us into a really nice
space, in particular with all the complexity associated with security. We're able to go
in and have a conversation about consolidation of vendors, of the consolidation of
kind of diﬀerent services. And that's playing very well for us right now. So Teams is
kind of the front end of the spear force. It opens up a broad discussion on security
broadly.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Yes, in our investor conversations we're amazed and it's sometimes
underappreciated how much Microsoft is investing and just the amount of
technology and value that you're able to oﬀer to customers. I always like stat that as
we've done the comparison, Microsoft is spending over 2x the R&D that you see
from some of the best-known security pure plays out there in the market. Maybe oneFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01

Q - Brad Alan Zelnickﬁnal question, if I could, Jared, Teams is obviously emerged as a really strong winner
in the shift to more distributed work. But where do you go from here? How do you
continue to diﬀerentiate? I mean, there's so much more to do, there's all these
capabilities, platform wise, that we've talked about. But what can you tell us about
the roadmap?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes, man, I can talk for an hour on this one (inaudible). The immediate opportunity
continues to be meetings and collab that is that immediate signal we talked about at
the beginning of our conversations. We've got work to do there. We're going to
continue to invest in a major way. But let me talk about a couple others I'm very
excited about. We got the opportunity to use Teams as this platform for healthcare
for ﬁrst-line, other industry speciﬁc scenarios we're starting to really see that pop. I
tend to think of it this way, take Zoom combine it with WhatsApp and create a
platform for it and you have got an awesome visual platform for businesses to use,
that's the conceptual idea I think that represents an opportunity for Teams, you'll see
us really go hard after that.
Mission critical process has been integrating the Teams, so kind of process
automation and this idea of creating custom apps, particularly using Power Apps,
that's going to be a very big investment area for us. We just made some investments
over the last couple of weeks there, watch that space. Learning is interesting to us.
We do think corporate learning is going to change in very dynamic ways. It's going
to stop being such a sleepy area and start being a real we think dynamic growth
engine for corporations as they're trying to help people get up to speed as their jobs
change and the dynamics of the marketplace mean that we're working in a very
volatile environment. Well-being, helping with employee well-being we actually think
is really interesting. We've got some really interesting work we're doing with Teams
here, including partnerships with people like Headspace. There really is such a thing
as meeting fatigue and taking care of your employees. We're starting to see it
becoming a real priority for companies around the world.
And then one ﬁnal place that I'll just say watch this space, Teams -- people think of
Teams largely as a commercial oﬀering for businesses and governments. It surely
has. We've got great success there. We have launched the very little fanfare
capabilities both in the mobile product and the desktop product just over the last
couple of months, allow us to expand well out of the commercial scenarios into life.
We are really excited about this Formula 1 app that does more than any other app in
the marketplace applying also to people's lives, to their families, to sports clubs, to
opportunities out there that are more consumer oriented. We also think that creates
a very interesting virtuous ﬂywheel as we see work, life and learning reinforce each
other. So, please watch that space. Again, as we think about a digital platform, we're
not just thinking about commercial opportunities but about opportunities across
someone's whole life, and there'll be some great things coming.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Awesome. Well, Jared, with that, we are at a time. This is really been fantastic. I think
we've got -- we compressed a lot into about the last half hour or so. And I thank youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-01
