Presentation
Okay. I think we're going to get started. I'm very delighted to have Colette Kress,
who's the CFO of NVIDIA, for a ﬁreside chat. I'm going to have some -- I have a set of
questions for her. And we also have the tablet. So if anybody has any burning
questions, please feel free to send them through the Meetoo app. So welcome,
Colette.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you.
So I think maybe we'll start oﬀ. You recently had -- Jensen was in Computex last
week. And you hosted GTC in Taiwan. And perhaps, you start out summarizing the
highlights of those events.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So we are in the process of going through what we call our international GTCs.
Normally, we hold our GTC, which stands for our GPU Technology Conference, ﬁrst
in the U.S. in California and then we go on a world tour. This is an opportunity for us
to connect with our developers worldwide. So our ﬁrst stop was in GTC Taiwan,
building upon some of the great announcements that we made at GTC in the U.S.,
where we were focusing on our next set of products for the data center, focusing on
our V100, Volta 100. And moving to 16 GB to 32 GB availability, a tremendous
increase in terms of overall performance and also available for a lot diﬀerent
workloads now that you move to 32 GB.
Additionally, we had announced our DGX-2, which was our second version of our full
containerized version system, able to essentially just be plugged in, a full stackFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-12

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantincorporating versus our DGX-1, which was 8 GPUs. DGX-2 incorporates 16 diﬀerent
GPUs.
We also, because of the additional amount of GPUs, incorporated our own
NVSwitch, which serves in terms of a key part of that overall connection between a
lot of the overall GPUs. So therefore, moving to our GTX Taiwan, we announced our
reference platform, what we refer to as our HGX, HGX-2, which allows us to provide
that same reference architecture that we incorporate in our DGX as well as many in
terms of our ODMs and OEMs as they put in terms of in their overall server
conﬁgurations as well as often in terms of what we see in terms of the CSPs.
So providing that overall reference architecture allows them the simplicity of learning
from all of our diﬀerent design and building upon that design that they can easily go
to market with our new products and our introductions. Many are extremely excited
about this reference architecture now being available. And we're working in terms of
that availability soon.
That moves us, therefore, to Computex. Computex was a great opportunity for -- to
us showcase some of the greatest things that we had in terms of Max-Q. Max-Q, if
you recall, is our ability, both also with the reference architecture and also landing
still on the thin and light, which is so important for our either gaming and/or in terms
of our enterprise, incorporating a super high-end GPU inside the overall thin and
light.
We had worked with many of the diﬀerent OEM manufacturers in terms of a
reference architecture that you'd be able to incorporate that. We have now
showcased more than 28 diﬀerent notebooks, for example, high-end gaming
notebooks for the mobility of gaming and put those onto display in terms of at
Computex.
Now that we've headed back, we also had a great event in Tennessee, one of the
greatest states in the U.S., where we actually demonstrated -- which is now complete,
the key overall supercomputer or what we refer to as the fastest supercomputer in
the world, which is leveraging NVIDIA's architecture along with IBM.
That's a lot. So thank you for that summary.
Questions And Answers
So I think also at Computex. And I'm not sure if it was -- but I read a quote that
Jensen said that -- he was quoted as saying that ray tracing is the biggest thing that
has happened to gaming in 15 years. And for a business that's been growing in the
over 20% range, I think that's a big statement. So what is ray tracing? And why is it
important?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-12

So ray tracing is really some of the underlying key components which allows overall
graphics. For essentially the last 20 years, we have simulated ray tracing by overall
the availability of light. Light is essentially what brings together what you see as a 2-
dimensional picture, what you see in terms of in ﬁlm, in terms of the use of overall
lighting, which brings things to light. What we have now enabled versus simulating
after all of these years with the overall GPUs, with the overall performance and
research over the last 10 years to enable ray tracing now in realtime, which is a huge
development and what people look at sometimes as called the Holy Grail of overall
graphics in that capability. So after those 10 years' worth of development in terms of
research, we're bringing that to market. It is currently now in the hands of software
developers worldwide focused on gaming but also focused in terms of our
enterprise applications and the needs for overall graphics. So yes, we're extremely
excited about this, as excited as the overall software development community is in
terms of that.
And where is it in the deployment cycle? Are you deploying it in the professional
market or the gaming market right now? Can you give us some idea of how to think
about how this comes into the market?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So outside of what you see in terms of the software developers, they're working.
It's a little bit of a chicken and egg that you need content as well as also naming the
overall boards to support it, the overall hardware to support it. So right now, it's in
the hands of many of the overall software developers. And they're busy working in
terms of the content. But we've also enabled it for Quadro and our Quadro V100,
which will, therefore, incorporate the use of ray tracing inside of it.
And how about on the gaming side? Is it in your gaming GPUs now? Do you -- when
do you expect to have it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. It is not incorporated in our current gaming GPUs in terms of our Pascal. And
that will be sometime in the future.
Okay. Fair enough. So on the topic of gaming, Fortnite has swept the gaming
industry by storm. And one concern we've heard expressed by investors is that since
the graphics on Fortnite seem to be less intense, there's a concern that perhaps
there's a new era of gaming that requires less-intensive graphics. Is that a legitimate
concern in your view? How do you think about that as a risk (of business)?

Page 4 of 10Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. KressYes. So an interesting discussion in terms of a new genre of games that have recently
developed. Every couple of years there's just yet another way that people think
about overall playing games. As you know, the transformation of gaming over the
last 5 to 10 years has grown astronomically in terms of the inﬂuence of the social
platform that gaming enables. And it really allows the bringing together of a social
community, both for super, super high-end games or in sometimes sports game or
in the case of others that may not be overly graphically intensive. But the important
parts of it is the overall growth of gaming overall and bringing more and more now
into the inﬂuence of games and socializing. In many of these games, you can have
more than 100 of your friends or 100 diﬀerent players at one time all working in
terms of that end key type of prize. So with one game every once in a while not
necessarily being highly graphic intensive, it still increases the overall focus in terms
of gaming as an entertainment sport. In the same manner, there's other types in the
same arena, such as PUBG, which are extremely graphic-intensive and requiring
some of our mid; and/or even higher overall gaming platforms to play that at the
right overall speed. So we do believe these continue to help drive the overall
gaming market even though every once in a while they may not be graphic-
intensive.
And Epic Games, who's the maker of Fortnite, recently gave a demo of realtime ray
tracing. Did you work with them on that? And can you share with us how many
games are being worked on with -- for ray tracing?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So essentially, when a new game comes to market and if it is geared up to be a
generally popular game, we have tremendous amounts of engineers working every
single day with them in terms of helping them in terms of the features that they want
to put into their games and ﬁne-tuning. So those things can really come to life as
they vision them to do. So yes, those availability of ray tracing, we're aware. I think
we're in the early stages of seeing how many diﬀerent games are going to be
coming since our most recent announcement. So stay tuned. We'll talk about more
in terms of the games when they're here.
Okay, we will. Let's shift gears to the data center side. So that business has grown
remarkably recent -- more recently about $100 million per quarter for the last 4
quarters. It's now running between $2.5 billion, $3 billion of annual run rate. To what
extent has the growth recently been driven by the supers and the hyperscale players
versus HPC versus enterprises building their own data centers?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So over this time that we've seen our overall business grow, I think it was -- it feels
like just yesterday when we were talking about a business that was about $25 million
a quarter. So it's grown astronomically. And that doesn't grow from just one thing. I
think it's always key to understand the overall breadth and the depth of now what we
are accomplishing in terms of the data center. You can focus in terms of the keyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 10Q - Unidentiﬁed Participanttypes of workloads that we see happening in terms of the data center. It's focused
primarily on accelerated computing. That is absolutely front and center. But I think
there's many diﬀerent forms of accelerated computing and what is occurring in
terms of the data center. Number one, the focus in terms of high-performance
computing. Probably one of our ﬁrst areas of focus more than 10 years ago is
accelerating some of the largest supercomputers in the world. As we've discussed
now having the largest supercomputer based on NVIDIA's overall architecture,
there's still a phenomenal amount of growth with supercomputers that we both see
today and we'll likely see going forward. Those are supercomputers that are in that
top 500 but also those that are extremely important out in terms of the industry.
Mathematical computations that are necessary with extremely large datasets and
speed of accomplishing those jobs are extremely important. And that continues to
grow widely within our overall data center business. But then we can focus in terms
of the breadth and the depth that we have seen in terms of data centers that are
moving from just CPU conﬁgurations to overall conﬁgurations that leverages an
overall GPU. In this case, probably some of the most important workloads that we
are seeing are focused in terms of artiﬁcial intelligence or focusing in terms of deep
learning, deep learning training and even moving in terms of the area of inference.
And I think it's important to see this vast and wide growing area, not only along the
overall hyperscales or what we refer to often as CSPs but also a wide area in terms of
the industry, which just focuses then on the next area of growth that we've seen,
which is the overall cloud instances that have developed over the last couple years.
The cloud became a very important linkage between the need in terms of AI. But the
ability to get to our overall enterprises, our start-ups as well as also in terms of our
research labs that we see around the world. It's an easy ability for them to get started
versus thinking about building the complexity of those infrastructures inside their
own overall network. So the cloud instances have popped up all over the world as
well and are being very widely used in terms of the use cases in terms of AI. So
we've now expanded to almost each and every hyperscale around the world, at least
all of the large and major ones. We're moving to what we refer to as the consumer
internet companies, which is essentially that tier down from the hyperscales, those
that are broad and rich in terms of their overall applications for consumers that are
necessary to incorporate AI to be competitive in their overall monetization of how
they do. And now you are seeing them use the overall GPUs for their work as well. So
what we've seen is just a tremendous broadening from an overall customer set but
then also adeptness in terms of where they've incorporated in their infrastructures.
You have it where they may be purchasing our Volta architecture in the overall Tesla
boards alone. They may be purchasing overall for cloud instances. They may be
repurchasing our DGXs, which is a full end-to-end system that they are allowed to
just plug in and stream together a whole linkage of them together. But you can also
be using our overall infrastructure for virtualized instances and using GPUs in the
cloud as well.
The kind of growth you have seen in that market does not go unnoticed. And it
seems you can't turn around without bumping into a new parallel processor
company with a new architecture. But so far, it seems like your market share is
extremely high. What are you seeing in the competitive landscape in the data
center? And why -- can you help us understand why we haven't seen success from
some of these new architectures?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-12

Page 6 of 10A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So the overall growth that we've seen in the data center was fueled by a couple
things that had reached the overall market. One, an understanding that the
slowdown of Moore's Law is in front of us or is actually here today. The slowdown of
Moore's Law puts in a question in terms of how am I going to get additional
throughput and compute capacity out of the overall conﬁgurations I have today
versus what I had seen in the past. The use of acceleration, therefore, is front and
center. Then number two, the overall processing capability of the GPU put us in a
unique position to be well-engineered for many of the AI workloads or the modern
AI that we see today. Because of that overall availability, you now see many people
also interested in terms of what we have built. We all know that artiﬁcial intelligence
will probably be with us more than a decade, probably close to 20 years, spanning in
terms of those building upon the overall capabilities of AI. Thus, others come in to
say I would love to be a part of that. We're not confused that, sure, there's always
going to be multiple players in terms of a lot of these diﬀerent markets. But some of
the work that we have been working on, not work in terms of this year. But essentially
the work over the last 10 years, have enabled us to be in the position that we are,
enabling more than 10 years ago, the overall software development platform on top
of each and every single one of our GPUs, moved to the ability to even the birth of
overall modern AI because people found a use case of the use of the overall GPUs in
those instances. So when we think about the overall competition, I think there's
always that thought that it's something quick and easy that is easily to solve without
fully understanding that we have a company of more than 8,000 hardware and
software engineers focused on one thing, overall -- GPUs for the overall diﬀerent
markets that we have. And that's a hard thing to kind of keep up with given the pace
that we're able to bring product to market, the complexity of the overall processors
themselves and our ability to not just focus on a piece of hardware but focus on the
full software stack that it is. So yes, we see a lot of interest in terms of people wanting
to get into the market. But at this time, we see our platform being used quite broadly
because of its ability to be used everywhere, not being particularly interested in any
one network, any one operating system, any one AI framework. We'll support all of
those. And that's, I think, what has diﬀerentiated us a lot from where we see in terms
of competition.
We've -- at Jeﬀeries, we've hosted about half a dozen AI conferences, where we have
5 to 10 AI start-ups come in and talk about what they're doing for the new business
models and disruptions. And when we ask them what hardware you're using, they
say the reason we can do this is NVIDIA and CUDA, which was a lightbulb for me
because it told me that this is not just hardware solution. It's a software solution, too.
So can you maybe -- maybe we just go back to the beginning. What is CUDA?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So CUDA is our software development platform. 10 years ago, started working
on it. We're on version #9. That is now available across every single one of our overall
GPUs. With CUDA and all of our overall developers that we have out there, we have
close to 850,000 developers focused on NVIDIA overall platforms. That's multiple
years of us both teaching the overall capabilities of CUDA, how to leverage anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 10Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. Kressoverall GPU as well as them coming to us in terms of sharing some of their use cases
so that we can continue to build and support them in that area. CUDA doesn't stop
just there. There's a tremendous amount of speciﬁc libraries that are customized for
certain parts of our industries, industries focused in terms of whether that be
gaming, whether that be for automotive as well as the broad area in terms of what
we're seeing in terms of neural nets and deep learning and focusing in terms of AI.
Our focus in terms of CUDA is optimizing many of the diﬀerent AI frameworks that
are out there. There are AI frameworks that are evolving every single day, evolving in
the standpoint of what is popular today, changes and revises in as little as overall
three months. Anything from TensorFlow, Caﬀe2, PaddlePaddle as well as some of
the ones from Microsoft and others are extremely important frameworks. And what
CUDA is capable of doing is continuing to optimize for the ﬂuidness from the GPU to
the overall application. We're essentially responsible for stitching that all together,
stitching that completely, completely end to end. We have a new and important role
in terms of enabling many of these overall workloads in terms of their eﬀectiveness
in terms of the applications. And CUDA is that underlying point that allows them to.
Whether it be available in the framework or whether it be a new area to move to,
CUDA is there for additional coding, additional changes, additional algorithms that
you may need to make your overall application work.
And that starts to talk to the next question that I had. And it may be redundant. But I
want to cover it again because this is the biggest question we get on you guys and
your competitive position. So the other concern we hear is that since the deep
learning frameworks are where most of the parallel processing or the AI, deep neural
networks are coded at, CUDA and NVIDIA sits underneath those. Is it -- so the
concern is that you could, therefore, be easily replaced because you're not directly
seen by somebody working in Caﬀe or TensorFlow. I think you -- you were answering
the question. But I would like to go through it just simply one more time. Why is that?
What is that? How do you manage that risk of being not at the deep learning
framework level but one layer underneath that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, there's this thought that says I'm a developer and I'm working in my
framework. I may be not familiar with line 100 of CUDA. What does it do? I think
that's the great aspect or the great point of it, that it is seamless in some cases to the
overall developer. But seamless doesn't mean that it can, therefore, be removed. It's
an important stage in terms of the compiling of the overall code together, the overall
middleware and so many diﬀerent other functions that it does to optimize many of
these frameworks rather than it just being a additional layer. The overall ability to ﬁnd
what you need in terms of the AI framework may be there. But often, many of them
in terms of the new capabilities are jumping into CUDA often to develop that next
layer of programming and so many of it that is seen. Our teams of engineers
focusing on CUDA, focusing on the frameworks, are hearing from the AI frameworks
all the time that says, can you build, can you help us in terms of incorporate this
within CUDA. It is surely a factor, no matter what the framework is, that they know
that CUDA is behind it. And we have a role in completing that full stack. And we'll
always be there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-12

A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. KressOkay, that's helpful. So we're 25 minutes into the conversation. I'm speaking with the
CFO. We haven't talked about any accounting questions or ﬁnancial statement
questions. So your product gross margins have expanded by 900 basis points over
the last two years. What are the biggest drivers?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So our overall driver of our overall gross margin and growth is really about our
platform and what that means. It is not about being an important chip. It's about the
full platform. When we talk about the full platform, there's a tremendous amount of
value that we incorporate in everything that we sell from the overall software
capabilities to the overall ecosystem and working with software developers to build
on top of our platform. All of that work that you see us doing is essentially not in
gross margin; essentially, it's in OpEx. It's essentially with our overall engineers every
single day. That allows us in terms of the gross margins that we see and to leverage
that work that we see in engineering to advance our overall gross margins long term.
We've seen growth in terms of our margins in gaming. We've seen growth in terms
of our margins in terms of overall data center being a larger position of our overall
company. And that has risen our overall gross margins as a whole. Those are some of
the main overall drivers that our customers see the value of our platform in terms of
both saving them time, saving them money and the overall consistency of the
platform serving their overall needs.
And on that topic of adding value, when you look at the growth of the data center
business or the gaming business, to what extent is that capturing more with a higher
ASP or versus a unit growth over time?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So when you think about whether it be -- we can start with our overall gaming
business, there has been the drivers of both. Just an increase in the overall market
growth in terms of gaming has inﬂuenced more and more gamers to come onboard.
They essentially come onboard 2 by 2 because you bring your friends because it's
such a social overall sport. At the same time, we have seen an average overall price
point increase. Now that's diﬀerent from saying that our prices have increased
because if you were familiar with our overall stack for gaming, we've got a gaming
card that you can have a great experience at $100. You can even have a outstanding
experience at $1,000. So we have a full stack of diﬀerent products for the overall
market. And what we've seen is people continue to gravitate, whether they're
coming back for a refresh or coming in for the ﬁrst time and buying some of our
higher-end cards. That has moved the overall average ASP higher. But we tend to
consistently always provide a price point so anybody coming into the market can
appreciate these overall products. Additionally, when you think about our market in
terms of data center, we have many diﬀerent types of price points for the diﬀerent
types of workloads that you want. We have those that are speciﬁc for inference. We
have those that are speciﬁc in terms of training. And as you know, we have diﬀerent
price points in terms of our DGX, which are full end-to-end systems. So we have bothFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-12

A - Colette M. Kressa combination for almost each and every one of our businesses of a growth in terms
of units as well as a growth in terms of average ASPs.
Okay, fair enough. The -- we recently published an in-depth study of free cash ﬂow
and capital return. And if I look at NVIDIA over the past four years, your sales are up
150%. Your free cash ﬂow has grown 400%. But your dividends and stock buybacks
have only grown 18%. And you have a net cash position of $5.3 billion. So what's the
plan for the $5.3 billion? And under what circumstances would you consider to
materially increase the capital return?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So when we think about our overall free cash that we have in terms of overall
available, there is a part of that, that you have seen in terms of our investment back
into the business as that's probably been our most focused area to be at, whether
that be hiring great engineers, whether that be a focus in terms of the day-to-day
things that they need to work on. But we are also not much diﬀerent in terms of what
we're seeing in terms of our major customers. You've seen a massive growth in terms
of the overall need for capital expenditures, focused a lot of it in terms of on the data
center. That's going to be a key area of our focus as well. You also (inaudible) see us
focused in terms of with the overall growth that we have in terms of the engineers,
focused on these large opportunities in front of us. We have to think about the
overall facilities and the houses that we need to overall house our overall engineers
to work. That's a good use of our overall free cash ﬂow, may not be in our current
P&L. But in terms of long terms, in terms of those types of capital expenditures, in
terms of what we've done. We'll also look in terms of possibly small; and medium-
sized M&A types of transactions where we ﬁnd great teams around the world that
can bolt on to some of the great markets that we're focusing on. The verticalization in
some cases that we have, that expertise is essential to us. But it's not that we see
extremely large companies out there in terms of consolidation because there's not
exactly large AI companies at this point on that piece. Then comes our focus in terms
of our capital return program. It has always been a long-term existence. We'll
continue to use that going forward. We continue to make existing growth in terms of
our dividends every single year and a focus in terms of repurchasing our stock. So
nothing's overall changed in terms of there. And we'll continue to see that growth.
Fair enough. And I think we're -- we've run out of time. So that will have to be the last
word. Colette, thanks for coming to London to chat with us.
