Thanks, Tim. A decade ago, we set out to transform the GPU into a powerful
computing platform. It has since opened a ﬂoodgate of innovation. From gaming
and VR to AI and self-driving cars, we're at the center of the most promising trends in
our lifetimes.
Gaming is a $100 billion industry. And PC gaming is driving its growth. The mass
majority of e-sports, the evolution of gaming into a social medium. And the advance
of new technologies like 4K and HDR will fuel its further growth.
We're in the early days of the next computing era, AI. Sparked and fueled by GPU
computing, AI has revolutionized every industry. Health care, transportation,
manufacturing and robotics, AI will automate intelligence and spur a wave of social
progress unmatched since the Industrial Revolution. We work with the major systemsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 8Colette M. Kresscompanies and every major cloud service provider to make NVIDIA GPUs available
in data centers and in the cloud. We advance fundamental research, foster
universities and start-ups and bring our full capabilities to industries where we can
have the greatest impact. The automotive industry is one of the biggest. Self-driving
cars will transform not just our transportation system but the design of our cities. Our
DRIVE PX AI car platform spans the range of autonomous vehicles from auto-piloted
cars to driverless shuttles. NVIDIA is one of the very few companies on the planet
that can innovate across the entire computing stack, from the most advanced GPUs
to innovative systems, from graphics to AI, from device to cloud, to serve the most
exciting growth opportunities of our time.
We're ﬁring on all cylinders. In FY '17, revenue was up 38% to reach a record $6.9
billion. Operating margins expanded over 1,300 basis points to a record 28%. GAAP
earnings per diluted share were $2.57, up 138%. And we returned $1 billion to
shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
Our ﬁnancial success continued in Q1. Overall, quarterly revenue reached $1.94
billion, up 48% from a year earlier as we grew across our markets. Gaming revenue
increased 49% to more than $1 billion, fueled by Pascal-based GPUs and gaming
notebooks. Pro Vis revenue grew to over $200 million due to ongoing demand for
high-end real-time rendering.
Our Datacenter business nearly tripled to a record revenue of over 8 -- of over $400
million.
Last, our automotive business grew to a record $140 million, up 24% year-over-year.
Since our DRIVE PX 2 AI car platform began shipping just one year ago, more than
225 car makers, truck makers, suppliers, research organizations and start-ups have
begun developing with it. And earlier this month, at GTC, our annual developer
conference, we revealed the latest developments in GPU computing. We launched
Volta, the world's most powerful GPU computing architecture. We launched a new
lineup of DGX AI supercomputers. Our GPUs have the support of every single cloud
computing partner in the world. Amazon and Microsoft joined us on-stage at GTC to
share their plans for Volta.
Toyota announced that they're working with us for their next-generation and future
autonomous vehicles. And we introduced Isaac, a physics-based VR simulator, to
train AI robots. It was a watershed event -- moment for NVIDIA, more than 7,100
attendees, 260 press and analysts, 570 technical sections. The world's top 15 tech
companies and top 10 automakers were in attendance, along with more than 100
start-ups focused on AI and VR. At GTC 2017, it was clearer than ever that GPU
computing has arrived. Thank you.

Thanks, Jensen. We will now move to Q&A. First, we'll address all question and
comments that have come through our stockholder forum. And then we will answer
any questions that come through the virtual meeting portal. We created the forum soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)

meeting, allowing for a more eﬀective communication.
Jensen, I will turn it over to you to answer the initial questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
A stockholder commented that I suspect stockholder recommendation is ignored.
The current situation perpetuates or increases pay almost every time.
We have a history of listening to our stockholders regarding executive compensation
or other matters. We engage our large shareholders annually to get their feedback
on our corporate governance and executive compensation. And our Compensation
Committee considers the result of the say-on-pay vote when it determines future
executive compensation.
The next question is, the people listed for board, are they on board now or are they
new?
Yes, each of the 12 nominees of the board is a current director of NVIDIA previously
elected by our stockholders.
Next question. When I vote for executive compensation, does that aﬀect the
outcome of my investment?
The outcome of your investment is tied to your stock price and when you purchase
and hold. We have structured our executive compensation to motivate our
executives to provide returns to our stockholders. And we think our recent stock
performance is strong. Therefore, your vote on executive compensation indicates
whether you agree we are properly compensating our executive team for the results
they have delivered.
The next question is, what is the range of compensation for directors? What does
CEO and CFO collect annually in salary? I see a need for more women on your
board.
Our nonemployee directors receive a mix of cash and equity awards with an
approximate annual value of $300,000. This value is set approximately to the
average of total annual compensation paid by our peer companies. We do not pay
additional fees for serving as a chairman or member of board committees or for
meeting attendance. In ﬁscal year 2017, my salary was $1 million. And our CFO's
salary was $775,000. Ensuring that our Board of Directors is composed of leaders
who exhibit a variety of skills, professional experience and backgrounds, as well as
bringing diverse viewpoints and perspectives, is a priority of our board and for me.
Two of our 4 recent added board members, Dawn Hudson and Persis Drell, areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 8women. We are committed to ensuring that women are included in our pool of
board candidates in the future.
The next question is, if Toyota were to bring mass-producing AD cars this fall, how
much money, gross and/or net, would NVIDIA get per vehicle? Since NVIDIA is now
open source -- is now an open-source software company, how will NVIDIA earn
proﬁts in the future. And how will those proﬁts be sized?
NVIDIA is proud and honored to have been selected to work with Toyota. The terms
of Toyota's plans and road map are not public. Regarding the second part of your
question, we announced at GTC that Xavier's hardware accelerator, we call it the DLA
-- the -- will be open source hardware design. By the way, DLA stands for deep
learning accelerator. It's a hardware design that is intended to handle inferencing
locally on SOCs, bringing AI to IoT devices. Open-sourcing the DLA hardware design
will accelerate the adoption of deep learning inferencing in IoT devices through
both industry and academia, which will help promote the demand for NVIDIA's
platforms and solutions. While we're excited to be making the DLA hardware
accelerator available royalty-free as open source hardware, Xavier includes a lot
more tech. And the entire software stack of our DRIVE PX platform will not be open
sourced.
We'll turn now to any questions received during the meeting. So if you have a
question, please enter it into the online portal now.
What is your assessment of upcoming competing AI products from Intel and
Google?
We haven't seen -- ﬁrst, I guess, we haven't seen products from Intel. And recently, at
the Google I/O several days after our GTC announcement, Google announced their
second-generation TPU. NVIDIA announced several days earlier that we -- that Volta
is in volume production. Volta is our -- is the world's most advanced GPU. It's a giant
leap forward in deep learning and produces 120 teraﬂops, a trillion operations per
second. What Google announced was their second-generation TPU. And it delivers
45 trillion teraﬂops and is dedicated to just the application of deep learning. As you
know, NVIDIA's GPU does general-purpose parallel computing in addition to deep
learning. So I think it's fair to say that Volta is now not only the world's most
advanced GPU, it's also the world's most advanced TPU. But I think that the story is
larger than that. I think, ﬁrst of all, AI computing is going to be the most powerful
technology force that we've ever seen. And it's going to revolutionize every industry.
The fact that the 2 leading innovators, us and Google, are racing to advance AI
computing is fantastic for the whole industry. Our strategy is to continue just to
partner very closely with Google as we improve TensorFlow together and make it as
fast as possible and as productive as possible on our GPUs. We work very closely
with Google to put the NVIDIA CUDA GPU into the Google Cloud so that we can
make it available to more developers and users. But our AI strategy is really to
accelerate every framework, from TensorFlow to Caﬀe to Hi Forge and MXNet and
CNTK. It's so that we can partner with every single cloud provider and make our
GPUs available on every single cloud. And I think it's clear now that with theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 8adoption by Google and Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook and Baidu, Alibaba and
Tencent, NVIDIA's GPU is the only deep learning platform and standard -- de facto
standard that's available literally everywhere in the world. And so our strategy is
really about democratizing AI, making it available for every company, every industry,
every country.
How does the NVIDIA GPU Cloud complement with other cloud oﬀerings by
Amazon, Microsoft and others?
That's a good question. We're actually not oﬀering a cloud infrastructure. What we've
done is this, the software stack for deep learning is really complex. And there are so
many diﬀerent frameworks. The layer of software is unseen anywhere in computing
before. You have an accelerating computing processor called GPU with an
architecture on top we call CUDA. It has systems software operating system, the
virtualization stack, CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT. And that all integrates into all the
frameworks in the world. As I mentioned some of them earlier, TensorFlow and Caﬀe
(High Torch) and MXN and CNTK and Chainer and even Watson. And these
frameworks are really, really complicated. And so what we've done is that we've
taken -- we've created a technology called NVIDIA docker as a way of containerizing
or packaging all of this complex software that we've tested and tuned and that we're
going to continue to maintain. We've containerized it so that it could be run on
everybody's cloud. And it would run on everybody's cloud with exactly the same
software stack without having to -- the developer having to ﬁgure out how to
integrate all this complicated stack. The other thing that's really, really great about --
and so our cloud is a cloud platform that's a storage, what is called a registry, of
prepackaged, containerized software that could be run on anybody's cloud. Okay.
So our cloud service is really about running software on all of our partners' clouds.
The thing that's really great, in addition to that, is that many developers and
researchers start developing their neural networks on their PCs with NVIDIA GPUs, or
they could be running on a brand-new DGX station that we just announced, a
workstation for deep learning, or they could be using their own data center, running
our DGX servers. And so when they need to access to a lot more GPUs that are in the
cloud, they can burst into the cloud. And using the NVIDIA GPU cloud registry, the
software that they run on their PC, on their server, on their DGX station and in
anybody's cloud is identical. And so the ease of being able to move and migrate
their workload from diﬀerent computing platforms and all the way into the cloud as
they burst into the cloud for more capacity is made a ton more simply. And so, I
think, it's a very, very diﬀerent thing what Amazon and Microsoft and all of our cloud
partners provide. And it complements the work that they do. And they're all super
excited about it because it brings customers to them and it brings demand to them.
The next question is, my brain wants to make analogies between AI and the
alternating current and between NVIDIA and Nikola Tesla. How is NVIDIA's
management getting advice to ensure NVIDIA's shareholders will not die paupers?
And so I'm not exactly sure how to answer that question, except for this, AI and the
work that we're doing in GPU computing is one of the most important works that
we've ever done. And there's little question now that AI has the ability by virtue ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-23
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 8the fact that it essentially automates automation just as in the previous Industrial
Revolution, we automated power and before that, we automated the growth of food
through farming. Now we have the ability to automate automation. And we can
automate things that are dangerous to do, things that are repetitive to do. And that
automation capability can augment us in many tasks that we do today in making it --
essentially making us superhuman. And so I'm super excited about the impact of AI.
And in all of the industries that we serve, whether it's in transportation so that we can
create cars that simply don't cause accidents to AI systems that help doctors do a
better job predicting and diagnosing a disease, to manufacturing so that we can
build things that are not just more cost-eﬀective and increasing the productivity of
society, we could manufacture things that weren't possible before at scales that
weren't possible before. And so AI has the real potential to make a contribution to
society like we've never seen before. And NVIDIA is right in the middle of that. And
as shareholders, I'm -- as I am one also. And a very large one at that, there's no
question in my mind that this is going to have tremendous beneﬁts to society as well
as our shareholders.
Okay. I see no further questions. Our annual -- our 2017 Annual Meeting is now
closed. Thank you for attending and for your continued support of NVIDIA.
