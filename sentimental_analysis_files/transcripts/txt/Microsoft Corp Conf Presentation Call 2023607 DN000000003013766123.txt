{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah, it's great to see everybody. Good morning. Yeah, in Microsoft the role I play is, I
run essentially product marketing, product management for most all of the
consumer products at the Company that includes Windows, our surface device
portfolio, Microsoft 365 Consumer and then, most notably, of late, Bing and Edge
and all of our AI, consumer AI eﬀorts.
Wonderful. And why don't we just start high-level when we think of Microsoft, we
think of the enterprise. So maybe if you could just touch on kind of the state of the
Microsoft brand with the consumer and where the key focus area is.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Sure. As a whole with Microsoft, we are fortunate to have a very strong brand on a
worldwide basis. We have great strength in the enterprise as you know, and that
translates over into the consumer space, because people are people as we say. So
they use our software at work and at home. And we have excellence in certain
categories of productivity and creativity, we're well-known, and then and now we're
coming in new areas obviously with Windows we've got strength, and then with Bing
and Edge.
Wonderful. Great. And we saw the launch of the new Bing early this year, and I
thought the demo was impressive. And wanted to just get your thoughts on what
was the motivation behind that? What are the use cases you're going after with Bing
and Search?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Sure. Well, you know, the big opportunity that we saw with the launch of the new
Bing is that, there are roughly about 10 billion search queries that happen every day,
and at least a half of those by our account go unanswered. So people aren't getting
the answers to the questions they want. These are things like longer travel queries,
more sophisticated research. And so, we saw an opportunity to marry the power of
AI with Bing and create a new interface to go after that, and start to solve some of
those problems for customers. And we're seeing some good success already early
on with that.
Wonderful. Wonderful. And we'd love to get your -- your comments on the OpenAI
partnership and the integration there with Bing, and in general across Microsoft, if
you could.

{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
You know, as many of you may know, we have a very tight relationship with OpenAI
that dates back now multiple years to about 2019. We've worked together with them
to start from the foundation. So we've helped [ph] provide the cloud power behind
the phenomenal work that they've done in AI through large language models with
Azure. We've built the supercomputer that powers all of that training and the
inferencing. These are very high end, sophisticated computers. There were special
work done for that, we did that work.
And then, more recently now with Bing, we've worked together, we've built a
proprietary technology inside of Microsoft that we call, code name, Prometheus. This
is a proprietary way that we have to access the large language model, access the AI,
and get the most out of it. So essentially, think about taking the power of the Web
Index, our understanding of the Internet and of web pages which is only essentially
two companies that really have that kind of power. And we can now more
intelligently call, access the AI, reﬁne the answers and get that back. And we've
worked together with OpenAI in a number of ways on that. From ChatGPT, we made
an announcement on our Developer Conference last week that we are now going to
enable with them the ability to use search within ChatGPT, just like we have with
Bing. Today with Bing we have a very diﬀerentiated oﬀering, which is you can only
access the AI to answer questions, but we can call [ph] the Internet. That means we
can reference things, it means we have more timely data.
And so, those are our real strengths, and that we're continuing to partner with
ChatGPT. And then the ﬁnal thing is, we announced with them a common plug-in
architecture. So, as third-parties want that, they'll come in right on this new emerging
platform, when people right -- developers got to plug-in, they'll run on Bing and on
ChatGPT and for that matter on all of our co-pilots at the Company.
Wonderful. And at the time of the launch for the new Bing, you referred to the next-
generation LLM from OpenAI that was coming, that's more tailored for search.
Would love to get any more color on that please, if you could elaborate.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Sure, yeah. At the time we were essentially were running on an early version of GPT-
4. So, if you already -- its recent memories, but we were -- at the time GPT-3 was out,
we had more advanced results and people were asking why your result is so great.
It's because we had been working on an early version. So that's what we were
referring to, OpenAI conﬁrmed that about a month or so later after they announced
it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

you've had this integration with OpenAI?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah.
Please.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
So, yeah, since the -- since the -- and it's only been about 4.5 months. But since the
launch, we've had a bunch of great progress and milestones on that. First-oﬀ, and
just from in terms of usage, Bing has now surpassed the 100 million daily active
users, which by all accounts of any kind of product in the Internet is a super
impressive number. In the world of the Internet search, it's not that much. We're still
single-digit -- single-digit player, which means we have a lot of upside. But 100
million daily active is pretty impressive. We've seen our mobile traﬃc, increased
forex, and we've seen a lot of pickup now in usage of it.
We're seeing new users come. I think back, early on, we had millions of new users
come and try Bing that hadn't before. So it's really, I think in our minds started a new
day in search and the new round of competition.
Wonderful. Thank you. And, there were some enhancements to the Prometheus
model as part of this Bing overhaul earlier this year. Could you elaborate on what
Prometheus is and what were some of those changes?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. Prometheus is a little bit of some of what I was mentioning earlier, it's our
proprietary method for accessing the Bing search index. We've used it eﬀectively to
do a couple of things, one is to get better answers in search. So what will happen is
you -- let's say today you call an AI and -- ChatGPT or something else, you get back
an answer that gets created from the AI. We're able to check that against the search
index to understand, hey is that -- is that really something from there? We can -- we
can use search data to make the answer, help the answer get more relevant, and we
can footnote it.
The other thing we've done is, we've actually used AI in the converse, and we've
applied it to our search ranker. And for those of you who follow Search closely,
improvements in search ranking is very tough, it's been 20 years for us and Google.
The largest increase I think in at least a decade if not longer came after we applied
the AI sort of techniques to the search ranker. And so, now our results, I would say
rival Google's results in terms of relevancy.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

Page 5 of 17Q - Bradley Sills
A - Yusuf Mehdi
Q - Bradley Sills
A - Yusuf MehdiInteresting. Okay. Great. And you demoed some new use cases when you rolled-out
the new Bing. Are there any use cases that have surprised you that you've seen more
that perhaps maybe you didn't expect. And, just any commentary you can make on
how some of these new use cases for search are coming in with Bing.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Sure. Yeah, couple of diﬀerent things like we said, ﬁrst-oﬀ, I said about half of the
queries that we see in Search today go unanswered. And those were things like
travel, like more sophisticated travel planning, deeper shopping research, sort of
advanced kind of research. Those things we're seeing now in the early data. The
people are in fact doing better queries. And so, I think it's kind of nuance. So like
when you're in Search, people might say, search [ph] for foundry bikes, when people
are in a chat -- in a chat interface, they might say hey, help me plan a trip to Kenya,
two-week trip to Kenya. So it's diﬀerent questions, diﬀerent answers. So we're seeing
people do more sophisticated travel analysis and planning as one example.
We've seen a lot of people do much more research, historical discovery of
information and content that they hadn't done before because it's the ease-of-use is
now there. So, we've seen some changes in those things. The big takeaway though
is, in the chat, when we see people chat, the vast majority of what they're trying to do
is search speciﬁc stuﬀ. So, if there was a question before we launched about whether
the new AI and the new chat would revolutionize search, that has proven out at least
in our data.
Wonderful. Okay, great. And when you think about the advantages Microsoft has
here in Search, the dataset that you're leveraging, if you could provide a little bit of
color as to what that is, and -- from your seat, yeah.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Sure, yeah. The -- so we have a -- I would say we have a couple of really clear
advantages. One is the OpenAI, AI foundation model. It's very clear. That is by far the
best most advanced model that's out there. And we've seen that through various
testing. So, number one, we're getting to leverage the most advanced AI
foundational model.
Second thing is, because of our Bing web index, and like I said there is really only
two big search web indexes out there, we have a unique opportunity to be able to
marry sort of daily crawling, up-to-date information, deep search understanding with
the AI. That's a very unique thing that we can do.
And then thirdly, we -- because we're more of a challenger or if you will, we have
smaller share, we're very focused on the new emerging customer needs and we can
take more, we can take more steps to be innovative. So, the user experience that
we've done with chat, what we're doing with Search on the search page itself, andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

A - Yusuf Mehdithen the integration that we're doing with that like we've announced Windows
Copilot, we've put Bing on the Windows task bar, so 0.5 billion people now can get
access to -- one click access to chat. Those are some unique strengths that we can
bring to help people with their searches.
Wonderful. Thanks, Yusuf. And at the time of the launch you referenced the
convergence of the browser, chat and search. If you could elaborate on on that and
how you see that direction?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. One of the things that we see is most people don't distinguish between their
browser and their search engine. They think of it as one concept, right? And
obviously when you go in, I'm sure as you all use the Internet, you go into the URL
address bar and you type in. What we're doing is, we're doing really deep
integration of that search and chat capability in Edge, so that -- so that you get what
we think of as your copilot for the web. Which means that, as you go anywhere on
the Internet, not just on Bing.com or some other site.com, but anywhere on the web,
if I would say, do you want to apply AI to the page you're looking at, so for example,
you go to page you say, hey tell me what this page is, summarize a long PDF or, tell
me the ingredients for this recipe, with one click on Bing, we can now read that page
with the power of AI. And if you want, you can then go outside the Internet and
access additional information. So for example, you can say, hey, read this third
quarter report or ﬁnancial earnings from company X, give me this key takeaways,
compare their earnings in the last quarter against another company and put it in a
table for me. And you can do -- you can literally do that all anywhere on the web on
any type of content. That's an incredible merger. And we're very unique in doing that
right now.
Wonderful. Thank you. And what kind of impact have you seen from the new Bing
and Edge on search volumes and engagement?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah.
Please.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
So couple of things. Like I said, our daily active users now have surpassed 100
million. We were sort of on that -- we were on a path of growth, but that has certainly
picked up since we launched the new Bing. Likewise, our Edge browser has been
growing share for the last eight quarters in a row, that's continued. If anything, we
see when people use the new Edge with chat, they spend more minutes on it, and
they use it even more.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

Q - Bradley SillsSo, all of the early signals -- and this is still early data, but all of the early signals are
very positive. And particularly when we see people use chat, we see them search
more, we see them come back more frequently. And so, the early signals are good,
and now as we start -- are starting to scale more broadly, we'll see how that, you
know, expands out.
Great. Thank you. Thank you. And, when you think about Microsoft's advantage --
and we're all -- lot of focus this week on AI and LLMs, what is Microsoft's advantage
in training LLMs, your own internal LLMs?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. So again, we use OpenAI a lot for the LLM. So they do a lot of the training. We
work with them a bit as we said on the Azure infrastructure, the super computers. We
do a lot with our Responsible AI. So, there's a lot of techniques we've done. We have
an incredible Responsible AI at the group, at the company, across many dimensions
from emphasis to researchers to scientists to user experience designers, we
collaborate with OpenAI on some of that as well.
Yeah. Sure.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
And then of course, we have the web index and the search index. And so a lot of the
learnings we have there, we're able to work with OpenAI on the training of LLMs.
Great. And if you could comment on some of the challenges when -- faced when
training LLMs, data quality bias, user privacy, how do you see those challenges, and
how is Microsoft and your partnership with Open AI, how are you addressing that?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. So, both us and OpenAI are really committed to having a super quality oﬀering
in the content, in the AI. And so all -- in all of the training, there's a lot of thought and
care that has been put into making sure that quality content is essentially clearly in
there. Content that is of suspicious then gets ranked appropriately. And then again,
we do a lot of training to protect against sort of bad actors. We don't want people to
use the AI to cause harm, self harm and harm in otherwise sort of bias against
people.
So, there's a lot of work that has been put in between ourselves and OpenAI to make
sure we have really an inclusive and equitable solution.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

A - Yusuf MehdiWonderful. Great. And how does Bing -- how do you approach the balance between
personalization and privacy with Search through Bing?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Well, we think privacy is a very personal thing. And so, for us, privacy is built-in by
design in all of our products. And we've put that work into the way we designed the
service, how we gather data, how we store data, so all of that is in there. I think ﬁrst
and foremost privacy is of the utmost thing for us. And so, we protect against that.
Within that constraint, then we can start to build a real personal experience for
people.
Wonderful. Great. Thank you. And ten years ago you had the launch of Cortana.
Curious to get your perspective on how Cortana ﬁts in here with ChatGPT and the
Microsoft AI portfolio.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. You know, I think Cortana and other sort of like agents were early forerunners
of diﬀerent interfaces to try and access content. Where we are today with the new
Bing and in partnership with ChatGPT is, we have really now a much more advanced
powerful system that can in fact answer questions or in the case of some of the work
we're doing now with even Windows and with Microsoft Edge can take action on
your behalf. And so, the tech there is really much, much more advanced. And I think
is sort of the future where I -- we see things going.
Great. And maybe if you could talk about the Bing Image Creator, which is powered
by OpenAI. What are some of the possible monetization opportunities there?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah.
Please.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
So, yeah, I think two diﬀerent things probably we could take in turn. There is Bing
Image Creator. For those of you who don't know, Bing Image Creator is a service
where you can essentially create images, just by typing in words. So you can say like
for example I've used this, I'm doing a home remodel design, so I've said, help me
design a mid-century modern living room that has brass and wood and whatever,
and it will come back with a picture. And then I could say, oh hey, make that
rounded, and let's change the color from black to white, and they can do that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

Page 9 of 17Q - Bradley Sills
A - Yusuf Mehdi
Q - Bradley SillsIt's an incredible thing. Since we've launched that, we've had hundreds of millions of
people -- images now created, and it's probably one of the most exciting features
that we've seen. So, we've put that in chat. So the ability to iterate, so if you guys
haven't at all tried it, bing.com, go up there now and go into chat in creative mode,
although we've just launched in all the modes, and try it, and say create an image of
xyz, and you can see the power of it. Then -- and that's a great feature.
Then separately, I think the question you're probably after, right, is like a broader
thing, what's going on with monetization, what are the opportunities there? We -- it's
obviously super early days. Two, I think of monetization sort of innovation happening
in two sort of segments. There is what happens on the classic search page, where in
there we're seeing as we get more relevant answers, we're able to kind of use
traditional search advertising, and that's doing really well. Then there is the chat
interface where obviously it's a diﬀerent user experience. It's cleaner, you know
there's more chat. And so, it doesn't make sense to have a lot of answers there with a
lot of advertisements.
And obviously one of the things people are liking about chat is that you don't have
all the blue links that you can get right to the answer you want and then go ﬁnd. So,
we are right now experimenting a lot with our content publisher partners and with
advertisers on what is the ad opportunity within the chat window. And we're ﬁnding
good things. So we're ﬁnding the ability to, for example have links to more content,
that's one thing that's been very unique with what we've done with Bing, unlike any
other services, we put citations and footnotes. We're also having richer answers in
some cases, we're testing. And we're testing the ability to potentially have right ads
on to page, and we're ﬂighting all that now.
As you can imagine, advertiser demand is very high for this, because they know this
is where there's a lot of action. And it's still very early to say how it will play out. But
my guess is that -- my sense is a couple of things. One, you will see fewer ads, but
they'll be much more relevant. And they'll have much higher click-through rate. And I
think it will be a very disruptive experience to traditional search, which for us is all
goodness, because again we're -- earlier we're happy to engage with a new and
improved search experience, but we're in the -- we're in the beginnings of that
process.
Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you, Yusuf. And why don't we shift gears to Windows
and the PC business? What are some of the key focus areas for consumer in the
roadmap for Windows?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. Windows broadly?

A - Yusuf Mehdi{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. So, couple of diﬀerent things, so I'll just start and just kind of give an update on
Windows. We are now at an all-time high in terms of Windows usage and
engagement. You know, I think where over a 1.4 billion people use it monthly, a huge
majority of that uses it daily. We've seen usage of Windows go up, we've seen use
cases since the pandemic go up. The pandemic had many bad things, but one small
silver lining is we saw people return to use the PC, and they rediscovered the value
of the PC.
Previously, all of us live a lot on our phones. People started to use the PC for things
like video conferencing, not just for work, but for home-use, right, we're seeing [ph]
digital family, online shopping went up, telemedicine went up, I mean the grocery
delivery. And so people since the pandemic has sort of subsided, people have
continued to do those use cases because of that. And so that -- the value of the PC
probably has never been higher. And that has been one of the great things that
we've seen.
More recently with Windows 11, we've made great strides to make that much more
Cloud-powered, and now as we're starting to talk about AI-powered. So, a couple of
things. On the cloud-powered side, it's hard to believe but Windows 10 did not
require a log or sign in. But imagine using your iPhone and not signing in with an ID,
you couldn't imagine it right? I think the phone wouldn't make any sense. Maybe you
can make a phone call, but that would be about it.
But Windows, until Windows 11 by 1.5 year ago, we didn't require that. Now that we
do, we're seeing the use of Windows change dramatically. People are now -- and we
have a very high log in, sign in rate. Now we can give you a personalized news feed.
We have Widgets now, which is a new platform for people that do development,
that's much more personalized. People are able to back up their content. They can
run their ﬁles. All these things that you take for granted on your phone, we've
brought to the PC, and so the value of the PC has gone up quite a bit.
So that's been one thing we've done, much more Cloud-powered, much more
service-enabled with Windows. We're also then most recently-announced that we're
now enabling you to be able to send messages from your phone, be it either on
Android or an iPhone. So if you've always wanted to have your text messages come
in to your PC, you can now do that. That's a huge thing that I've always wanted. We
still have more work to do, you can't necessarily do group messages, but you can do
the individual messaging.
That's great.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
And then most recently the AI has now come in. And so, we announced at Build two
weeks ago, Windows Copilot. Windows Copilot is essentially powered by Bing, soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

now within Windows, and so, just like I referenced with the Edge example, you can
use your PC experience and ask a questions to -- about what's going on things on
your desktop to take advantage. And you can take what we call actions, like you can
do in Edge.
So, now with your Windows, if you've -- if you've ever sort of say, hey, how do I put
this thing in dark mode, you can just pull up Windows Copilot and say put my PC in
dark mode, put me into Focus mode, because I have to work now, and it will arrange
your Windows, dial-in your playlist. And so, everyone who didn't know how to use
Windows is now going to be a power user of Windows, because you now have the
Windows Copilot which you can just talk to, and it will take action on your behalf.

Yeah. And why don't we -- if we could talk about the interplay with Xbox Game Pass
in Windows and what's on the roadmap there for the convergence of those two?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Sure. Yeah. One of the things that's been great as we look at our Xbox business as
we've seen a lot of obviously great success on the console and gaming and online
gaming, we're seeing a lot of success now with gaming on the PC. PC has always
been a home to obviously gaming, it's the platform for games. But now with Xbox,
we're starting to really see some progress there. We've brought our Game Pass
subscription service that lets you play games across console and PC.
In fact, we almost doubled the total number of countries now that have Game Pass
on the PC. We've seen that tick-up quite a bit. We've got some great experiences
there with an Xbox app on Windows, so you can keep track of your friends, your
gamer proﬁle, all of your gamers stats, and so that has all come together. So, we're
seeing -- we're seeing really good progress there on the PC.
Great. Great. And why don't we shift to devices? Surface tablet, laptop, where is the
focus on the product line? Anything on the roadmap there as well, yeah, please?

can replace your laptop. So you have a full tablet, you have an incredible screen with
pen, you have access to all of Windows on that. That is a big focus for us. We'll
continue to improve on that. Performance has gotten better, we've had 5G
capabilities on it now. So you can move around. And now with Windows 11, you can
take advantage of it. It is by far the best devices for mobile professionals and for
creatives.
On the laptop, we've continued to do a lot of work to build more and more powerful
laptops that again give you that real incredible computing experience with Windows.
And so, that's really been the big focus. And yeah, we're -- the innovation trend
continues. I can't talk about things that are coming in the future, but, suﬃce it to say
that if you're a Surface fan, there's a few Surfaces out there, you're going to want to
continue to use it.
That's great. Thank you. And on the Q3 earnings call you called out some elevated
inventory levels there. If you could elaborate on that, please.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Sure.
Yeah.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
So, you know, what happened because of the pandemic there has been sort of ebbs
and ﬂows on PC purchases, how the PC market has gone. One of the things that's --
one of the things that happened is, people bought a lot of PCs, I think in advance of
they were thinking of return. And so we saw elevated inventory channel levels. Sell-
through has continued. So sell-through has continued sort of steady. But obviously
what's happening is we're seeing retailers want to work down the inventory levels.
And so the way that, that impacts us is, short-term there is less sell-in, the sell-
through continues, and it's working its way through.
Great, great. I think you're also -- you have responsibility [ph] for Skype.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yes.
Okay. Great. And there's clearly an investment being made there. Any commentary
on where those key investment areas are for Skype, and how does that ﬁt into the
broader consumer portfolio?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

Yeah. I think the way to think about it, and I'm going to take a step back from that,
like, in terms of communications, consumer communications, we really have a couple
of diﬀerent assets. We have Teams that you use a lot for work, but we now have
Teams for consumer, and that has been growing nicely in terms of monthly active
users; it's still early. We have Skype as you referenced, which is something we've had
for traditional that still has a very loyal fan base.
And then we have this product called GroupMe, don't know if you have GroupMe,
but if you have kids, they all use GroupMe because it's a huge hit in college. Those
three products, what we're just looking at doing is, increasingly bringing them
together on a common platform and architecture, while still respecting the user
experience that people love on each of these things, right? So with GroupMe,
people, college kids love the simplicity of it. With Skype, people love the ability to
call friends and family from across international lines. And Teams consumer now is
really becoming a great place for communities, where people come together with
communities.
We have brought a lot of the new Bing and AI into those products. So, getting to
Skype speciﬁcally which you asked about, we've -- one of the things we've done with
Bing and AI is we've put essentially a chatbot in Skype. And so, if you are talking with
your family, for example, and you're planning a night-out or a trip, you can call the
Bing Chatbot and say, hey, Bing, tell me great places to travel. And Bing will put that
together and drop it in the chat window. So while you're chatting with your family,
you can actually call the chatbot to help you. It's like having an intelligent assistant or
a concierge or a butler help you while you're conversing. And, we see that
expanding as we add the capabilities.
Okay, wonderful. And, how does Microsoft think about some of the overlap between
Skype and Teams, or is it truly complementary as you're describing there?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. I think we see it as a complementary on the core infrastructure right, so the
communications, the idea of having one contact list. We think of the user
experiences being unique and distinct for those. And like I said, Teams is focused
increasingly more on some communities work, getting groups of people to do that,
Skype is more sort of point-to-point family, much more for international expansion.
Wonderful. And maybe just a higher-level question. When you think about the
Microsoft brands, again, a lot of enterprise association, how does that beneﬁt
Microsoft in the consumer with Windows PCs and some of the other oﬀerings you
talked about?

A - Yusuf MehdiYeah. Well, so -- our strength in enterprise and network is that we are the tools and
the devices, the software, the devices that people use every day for their work that --
that becomes a real reason that people then want to come and use it in their home
life. And so that provides a nice virtuous cycle. And conversely, when we sell our
service devices in particular that people love, they come and they want to bring
those into work.
Right.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
I see that -- I see it with my kids who are now working, and they'll have a laptop that
they got from work, I won't say from where, and then of course I'll buy them the
Surface for their birthday, and they're like, dad, this is awesome, and like, we'll take
that into work.
Right.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Like what we're not allowed to, in some cases, I'm not allowed to, we have a -- I
would [ph] be thinking like gosh, I wish I could use my Surface. And so -- and then
vice-versa, I've had people who have a computer at home and then they love the
Surface they got at work. So that ﬂywheel for us of consumer to commercial is a very
unique thing. And again, like all of us, we have jobs and we have personal lives.
Being able to use a single device, being able to use a single productivity suite, an
email, a browser, that virtuous cycle of work to consumer and back really beneﬁts us
in terms of being able to better meet customer needs.
Got it. Got it. And maybe shifting to Xbox a little bit. The strategy has always been,
you can play games from anywhere on any device, it's less console-centric strategy. If
you could just comment on how you see the convergence of the Game Pass with the
PC, and how that ﬁts in with that overall strategy.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, I think you said it well for -- we believe that the future of gaming -- well,
right now, there's three diﬀerent gaming silos. There's games on your phone, games
on your PC, and games on the console. Historically those have been three diﬀerent
worlds, and frankly diﬀerent audiences. We -- our vision for Xbox is that you should
be able to play the games you want, with the people you want, on the devices you
want. And so what we've done is, we've built much more of a cloud gaming solution
that can now work across all those devices.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

Q - Bradley SillsAnd so, and we're taking all of the steps, so like I mentioned earlier, having Game
Pass give you the ability to play games on the PC and the console. So you buy them
once and you can run them across both those platforms. And so, we're building that
capability. We're bringing the Xbox app out to all those platforms.
Wonderful. Great. And, when you think about Microsoft Studios, what are some of
the things you're excited about that you can talk about here that might be coming?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean there's a lot of -- there's a lot of great games coming. There is a big one
that's coming up. I don't how much we've talked about it, so I probably won't
mention it. But it's coming up shortly. And the team has been playing that game a
lot, and we're pretty excited about it. I think it's -- it will be a sort of a great look
forward in terms of what gaming can do.
Great.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
You know, as a whole, the Studios team does a really fantastic job building next-
generation content. It is the fastest form of growing entertainment, and we think that
the ability to expand upon that with AI will improve quite a bit.
Great. And how do you see the convergence of gaming with the Metaverse and the
enterprise, potentially? I think with the talent base that you have there, engineering
talent you could see, you could apply a lot of that, you could deploy some of those
resources towards the Metaverse. So, curious to get your perspective on how you
see that playing out. And where is the talent base for the Metaverse within Microsoft?
And is there overlap between the gaming franchises in those applications?
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, I think from a technology perspective, there is a lot of -- a lot of games,
not all the games, but a lot of games are about world development, character
development. So, the techniques in terms of how you do the programming, how you
do the design of that software to develop, that is applicable in the Metaverse. And
then of course, we have all of our own work that we've done in the enterprise space,
to build sort of digital twins, if you will. And so, yeah, I think there's a lot of relevance
there.
Wonderful. We're running short on time here. But, any other comments Yusuf that
you'd want to make, any kind of closing comments on kind of the state of the
Microsoft consumer brand across multiple franchises?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-07

Yeah. I think what I would say is that, one of the thing -- we've probably been at the
best place we've been in our consumer business in a while because of the -- we see
of opportunity of AI to really transform everything we've done. We talked about
Windows and how Windows Copilot, it will be the operating system that I think will
lead the way with AI and assistance in a way that you haven't seen before. And that's
because, some of our competition either doesn't have that capability in-house or it's
not in their interest to disrupt their own current search model.
The second thing is with Microsoft 365 we didn't talk a lot about that, but that's our
Productivity Suite, that's not just Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, and we're going to
bring Microsoft 365 Copilot to that, so that you can talk to Excel and have it do
things on your behalf. But we're also now using things like designer, which is, I think
of it as sort of equivalent to a canvas, but with more powerful capabilities for design
and creatives. We're early in the testing of that, but that's already we've already
crossed a lot of users on that as well. So, we see that coming.
And then with the new Bing and Microsoft Edge, that is really the big thing, that's the
big opportunity. It's a huge market, it's a huge TAM. We have ﬁrst-mover. We don't
have any of the innovator's dilemma, and we're excited to meet customer needs and
to go out and get some of those things. So I would say broadly across Windows, our
devices, what we're seeing with Microsoft 365, it is super early days in the Internet,
super early days with the development of AI, and we're quite excited about what
we're going to be able to do with it.
It's very exciting, Yusuf. Thank you so much for joining us at the conference.
