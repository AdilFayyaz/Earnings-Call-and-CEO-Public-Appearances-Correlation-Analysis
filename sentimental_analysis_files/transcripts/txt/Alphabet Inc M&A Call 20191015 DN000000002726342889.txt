[Video Presentation]
Good morning. Good morning. Thanks so much for joining us here in New York City.
And for those on the live stream for joining us around the world, thanks so much.
We're going to spend the next hour talking about the problems we're working to
solve for our users and the ways we're delivering help for -- the way people need it,
when they need it. We'll also take you into our labs with writer and cultural
commentator Baratunde Thurston to hear from the folks at Google who personally
develop, design, and bring these products to life.
Now if you look across all of Google's products, from search to maps, Gmail to
photos, our mission is to bring a more helpful Google for you. Creating tools that
help you increase your knowledge, success, health and happiness. Now, when we
apply that mission to hardware and services, it means creating product like these.
New Pixel phones, wearables, laptop and Nest devices for the home. Each one is
thoughtfully and responsibly designed to help you in your everyday without
intruding on your life. Now, in the mobile era, smartphones change the world. It's
super useful to have a powerful computer everywhere you are, but it's even more
useful when computing is anywhere you need it always available to help.
Now you've heard me talk about this idea with Baratunde that helpful computing can
be all around you, ambient computing. Your devices work together with services and
AI. So help is anywhere you want it and it's ﬂuid. The technology just fades into the
background when you don't need it. So the devices aren't the center of the system,
you are. That's our vision for ambient computing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 2 of 17The Google Assistant plays a critical role here. It pulls everything together and gives
you a familiar natural way to get the help you need. Our users tell us they ﬁnd the
Google Assistant to be smart, user friendly, and reliable and that's so important for
ambient technology; interactions have to feel natural and intuitive.
Here is an example. If you want to listen to music, the experience should be the
same whether you're in the kitchen, you're driving in your car or hanging out with
friends. No matter what you're doing, you should just be able to say the name of a
song and the music just plays without you having to pull out a phone and tap on
screens or push buttons.
So think about how this vision plays out in the home where ambient technology can
make life so much easier. When you wake up in the morning, your home knows what
you need to start your day. You can get your commute, ﬁnd out when your ﬁrst
meeting starts, maybe play some music on whatever speaker or screen is nearby.
And when you leave your house, your lights, thermostat, door locks, security
cameras, they all just know what to do. And your devices go silent and turn oﬀ
notiﬁcations at night when you want to relax without technology interrupting or
distracting you. So, throughout your home, technology works as a single system,
instead of a bunch of devices doing their own thing.
Now we can bring this ambient computing vision to gaming as well. With Stadia, our
new generation cloud gaming platform, we're aiming to deliver the best games ever
made to almost any screen in your life. So, I'm excited to share an update with you
all. Stadia will be available on November 19. So you'll be able to play games
wherever you want, on your TV, your laptop, even your Pixel, which will be the ﬁrst
phone to support Stadia when it launches.
We're also creating a few areas to create more human interactions with technology
like motion sense and the new Google Assistant for Pixel 4. So instead of being
glued to your phone, you can use quick gestures and voice commands and then get
back to your day. That push for quicker, more natural interactions is leading us in
new hardware directions too, extending the phone's capabilities in new ways. Let's
take a look.
[Video Presentation]
All right, that was a sneak peek at the all-new Google Pixel Buds. So you can start to
get an idea of what ambient computing feels like. With Pixel Buds, help is there
when you want it and the experience just comes to you, even when your phone is
not in your hands. For instance, you can get hands-free access to the Assistant. So
instead of turning to your phone for quick tasks, you can just say, Hey Google and
ask the Assistant for whatever you need; resume your podcast, send a quick text, get
directions or even understand another language with Google Translate.
Pixel Buds even have a long-range Bluetooth connection, which keeps you
connected even when your phone isn't by your side. So you can wear them in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 17yard when your phone might be charging inside or leave your phone in a locker if
you're working out in a gym. Indoors, Pixel Buds will stay connected up to three
rooms away and outside, they work across an entire football ﬁeld.
Of course Pixel Buds won't be truly helpful unless there are also great headphones.
They have to have excellent sound quality, they've got to be comfortable to wear all
the time, and they need to last long enough to be useful. That's a lot to ask of a pair
of headphones, especially because they also need to be unobtrusive too. So we did
some intricate origami with Pixel Buds to make sure everything ﬁt; custom speakers,
sensors, custom battery. That's usually what makes these wireless earbuds stick so far
out of your ears.
But Pixel Buds gives you plenty of battery life. You'll have ﬁve hours of continuous
listening time on a single charge and up to 24 hours when you're using a wireless
charging case. Now, even with all those components and long battery life, you can
see Pixel Buds ﬁts almost ﬂush with the ear. They are so small and light, it's easy to
forget you're wearing them.
At the same time, Pixel Buds deliver excellent sound quality. Now, you typically have
to choose between great sound and awareness of the world around you, but Pixel
Buds gives you both with a unique hybrid design. The earbuds gently seal the ear for
rich bass and clear highs, and the spatial vent underneath reduces that plugged ear
feeling and let's through just the right amount of environmental sound.
On the software side, Pixel Buds respond to your surroundings with the new
adaptive sound. The volume dynamically adjusts as you move from the quiet of your
home to a subway or a noisy cafe and you don't have to constantly raise or lower the
volume. When you're on a call, beamforming mics focus on your voice, while voice
accelerometers detect speech through your jawbone. So a loud restaurant or a
windy day won't get in the way of your conversation. Pixel Buds will be available in
the spring of next year and we'll share more details in the coming months, including
a few of the helpful experiences that make good use of the on-device machine
learning chips.
So, as you can see, this ambient computing era is going to bring all kinds of new
interfaces, services and devices, but it's also introducing new challenges. When
computing is always available, designing for security and privacy becomes more
important than ever. You need to know that your data is safe. Protecting your data
and respecting your privacy are at the core of everything we do. We've designed
strong protections across our hardware family, like the Titan Security Chip in our
phones and laptops. Titan protects your most personal on device information, your
OS data, passwords, even information in third-party apps. And we know that privacy
is personal, which is why you have the controls, so that you can choose the settings
you want that are right for you. We make it easy to access simple on-oﬀ controls,
including turning cameras and mics on your Nest devices oﬀ. And you can now
delete Assistant data just by asking. Everything is designed with your privacy in mind
and you'll see examples of that throughout today's presentation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15

Page 4 of 17Ivy RossNow, we're also going to talk today about our work to create more sustainable
products and processes. Developing sustainable solutions to mass production and
consumption is one of the biggest challenges we face today as an industry. It
impacts all of us and it will for generations to come. Now, we believe Google has
both the ability and the responsibility to create systemic change. As a Company,
we've been focused on sustainability for a long time.
Google's operations have been carbon-neutral since 2007. And for the past two
years we've matched all of Google's energy consumption with a 100% renewable
energy. Now, we're continuing to expand access to clean energy to more people,
including our suppliers and the communities where our products are made. So
today, we're announcing that Google is committing to invest another $150 million in
renewable energy projects in key manufacturing regions.
Our investment alongside ﬁnancial and manufacturing partners aims to catalyze $1.5
billion of capital. Now, this will generate approximately same amount of renewable
energy as the electricity used to manufacture made by Google products. So when
you choose to buy hardware products from Google, you're contributing to bringing
renewable energy to communities around the world. Sustainable, secure and private,
and of course, helpful; that's the Google way to make hardware and services. Now,
we're excited to share with you how we build these principles into our products.
And here is Ivy Ross, who leads our design team, who is going to talk about some of
our recent work in responsible manufacturing and design.
{BIO 6144292 <GO>}
Thanks, Rick. I'm happy to be back in New York to discuss our design philosophy at
Google and tell you about a few things that we've been working on. I grew up not
too far from here in the Bronx. And my dad was a designer, industrial designer too,
and he worked for the legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy on
automobiles and a lot of other consumer goods. When I was little, he even made me
my own little Roadster. I can remember spending hours in his studio as a kid
tinkering with diﬀerent tools and materials.
And something I learned early on is, at its core, design is about solving problems for
people. Whether you're designing a building, an automobile, packaging, or even a
phone, the goal is to create unique solutions to the world's challenges. And
sustainability is one of the fundamental challenges of our generation. When you look
at how most things are made today, it just doesn't make sense. In all too many cases,
devices are manufactured with dirty energy from precious minerals and materials
that are rapidly depleted and with technology that becomes obsolete in a short time
and then thrown away. Right now, we're truly looking at sustainability from every
angle.
For years, we've been pushing what's possible in design, manufacturing, and new
materials. We've been able to include recycled plastics in products like Chromecast
and the new Stadia controller. And today, I'm happy to share that all of our NestFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 17products launching in 2019 include recycled plastics. Instead of these materials
ending up in the ocean or in landﬁll, we're giving them a new life. We've designed
and engineered the fabric on our Nest mini speaker, so it's made from a 100%
recycled plastic bottles. A single half liter bottle produces enough textiles to cover
more than 2 Nest minis and we didn't compromise on aesthetics or function. We
created beautiful recycled fabrics and colors that blend into your home, while hitting
the same rigorous technical and acoustical requirements.
We continue to focus on products that empower people to reduce their own
environmental impact as well. Our Nest team has been at the forefront of these
eﬀorts since 2011 and as of this month, Nest Thermostats have helped consumers
save more than 41 billion kilowatts hours of energy, enough to power all of Denver's
electricity needs for six years.
Rick just ﬁlled you in on our new renewable energy investment. And as of last month,
Google is oﬀsetting a 100% of the carbon generated by our shipping partners for all
customer orders. We have so much more to do, but by working with our suppliers,
manufacturers on these initiatives, our goal is to clear the way for the entire industry
and our planet to beneﬁt. Another sustainability goal is simply reducing the amount
of hardware you need to buy in the ﬁrst place.
What if you didn't need to upgrade a bulky new game console every few years? With
Stadia, we're actually consolidating devices, so the only hardware you need is a
controller and a screen to play your games anywhere, anytime. To give people a
great gaming experience, we designed the ﬁrst cloud-based controller. Great design
isn't just about how something looks. It's also about how it feels and subtle design
diﬀerences can have a profound eﬀect and we wanted the controller to be
comfortable in the hands of all gamers. We found design inspiration in some unlikely
places
[Video Presentation]
We worked with thousands of people playing hours and hours of games to test our
controller against all of its limits. It needs to feel right for as many people as possible.
Putting people at the center of our design is integral to our process and our
principles, whether it's hardware or software, creating truly helpful products for
people starts with empathy. One of our earliest projects we tackled within hardware
team was designing a new kind of laptop that could deliver performance and
versatility in a truly beautiful form. We wanted to physically embody the speed and
simplicity that people love about Chrome OS.
The result was the original Pixelbook. The response was great. People really loved
the award-winning design, the keyboard, and the speed. So, over the past couple of
years, we've been working really hard to bring that kind of experience to even more
people at a more aﬀordable price. I actually believe that you can be more creative
when designing within constraints.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 17Rishi ChandraSo once again, we started with our users' needs, especially portability and battery
life. We wanted to create a thin and light laptop that was really fast and also have it
last all day. And of course, we wanted it to look and feel beautiful. We landed on
Pixelbook Go. The design is so distinctive with an incredibly light magnesium that
lets us create a very smooth matte ﬁnish in great colors. Pixelbook Go comes in just
black and not pink, one of the iconic colors we introduced on Pixel 3.
And we created a new rippled wavy bottom that's easy to grip. Pixelbook Go is
lighter than Pixelbook, but we still managed to add a battery that is 15% larger,
making it easier to keep working all day. We also spent a lot of time making sure the
keyboard is comfortable and quiet. We took all of our learnings from the original
Pixelbook and really reﬁned the design.
We ended up with keys that feel great to use and are even quieter than the original.
And with Chrome OS, Pixelbook Go is always fast, secure, and all your devices stay in
sync with each other. Everything about Pixelbook Go is designed to address real
user needs for an aﬀordable price. You can preorder it now in Just Black with Not
Pink coming soon.
Next up, my colleague Rishi Chandra will tell you about the work we've been doing
to make life at home a little easier. Thank you.
{BIO 17056644 <GO>}
Hey, everyone. I'm excited to give an update on Google Nest and our mission to
create the Helpful Home. So last month, we launched Nest Hub Max, which is a great
example of the power of ambient computing. See your photos come to life with a
screen that automatically adjusts to your lighting conditions, pause your music and
videos with a simple hand gesture, and it automatically adjusts the information and
controls based on your proximity to the device.
At Nest, we want to put people ﬁrst and build technology around their needs.
Diﬀerence between just being smart and being truly helpful. So while the rest of the
industry is focused on standalone devices, our focus is on building Whole Home
solutions that bring together technology to provide real help for real homes and the
most important place to get this right is privacy. It's your home, the most personal
private space in your life.
So in May, we published a clear set of privacy commitments, which helps you
understand how our technology works. Today, we want to share how these
commitments extend beyond Google to our third-party ecosystem of partners. So
we're announcing an update to our Works With Google Assistant program. We're
working with partners to migrate their existing works with Nest integrations that
people know and love, but doing it built on a foundation of privacy and security.
For example, we're acquiring partners to pass a security review before they can even
request access to your Nest devices. You should have conﬁdence in how Google and
its partners are protecting your home data. And then, you can focus on, instead, theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 17great beneﬁts of the Helpful Home. For example, let's talk about home Audio. It used
to cost thousands of dollars and a professional installation if you want a seamless
audio throughout your home.
Well, Google changed all that with the Whole Home audio solution that is simple,
aﬀordable, and sounds great. It started several years ago with the launch of
Chromecast, making it easy to use your phone or your voice to play content on your
favorite devices. And with Google Home Mini, home audio got even more
aﬀordable, with a great sounding speaker with multi-room support.
And with Nest Hub Max, you now have a Home Media Control Center right on your
smart display and it all works seamlessly together with screen transfer, where you can
naturally move content around your home. So, for example, I can start a playlist or
watch a show on my Nest Hub Max in the kitchen. And when I'm done cooking, just
say Hey Google, move this to the living room TV, and it will pick up right where I left
oﬀ. It's really easy.
Now, for a lot of people, Google Home Mini was a perfect starter kit for your audio
system. And today, we're introducing the next generation Nest Mini. It's even more
capable with the same aﬀordable price point and the same iconic design. So let's
start with the design. Colors really help Mini blend naturally into your home and you
now have a new color option called Sky. And as Ivy mentioned, all of our fabric is
made from a 100% recycled plastic bottles.
Now, we also heard from you, you want a little more ﬂexibility of where to place mini,
so we added a simple wall mount. It really looks great anywhere in your home. Now,
the original mini was designed to pack in great sound in a really small form. And with
Nest Mini, you get even better quality sound, 2x stronger bass and even more clear
and natural sound. And for those times when you home gets loud, like it does in
mine, we added a third mic to hear you better in noisy environments.
Nest Mini also got a really cool new superpower. There is a dedicated machine
learning chip with up to one TeraOPS of compute. So for the ﬁrst time, core
experiences of the Google Assistant can come from the data center and be moved
instead to run locally on your device. Simply put, things are going to get a lot faster
as it learns your family's more frequent commands. Finally, Nest Mini also powers an
amazing home communication system; a home intercom, so you can talk room to
room; a home alert system, telling you who is at the front door; a home phone,
allowing you to call anyone in the world for free, using Google Duo.
I can even use my phone to call my Nest devices. It works great for those times I'm
leaving work and I want to ask the family what they want for dinner. So that's the new
Nest Mini, our next step in bringing seamless audio and communication to more
homes around the world.
Okay, now let's talk about home awareness. One of our core products is Nest Aware,
which combined with our Nest Cams provides intelligent alerts and camera history.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 17Now lots of our users have multiple cameras and we've heard from you that our Nest
Aware pricing can get a little expensive and complicated. So today, we're
announcing a new whole home pricing model.
For one monthly rate, you get Nest Aware support across all your Nest devices in
your home. So whether you have two cameras, you have 10 cameras, you pay the
same monthly rate. And you can choose between two diﬀerent pricing plans
depending on your needs. We even added more video history. The new Nest Aware
will be rolling out early next year and it will be easy to switch over your existing plan.
Now, as part of the new Nest Aware subscription, we're also unlocking the power of
speakers and displays to be part of your home awareness system, so devices like
Nest Mini or Nest Hub can be your ears when you're on the road or on vacation. We
use on-device AI, sound detection AI, to pick up critical sounds like barking dogs or
smoking carbon monoxide alarms and we send alerts to your phone. So now in one
go even those basic smoke alarms become smart smoke alarms. And when you get
an alert, you have the option to hear the alert or listen live to conﬁrm the alarm. Now,
if it is an emergency, the Home app can see -- the Home app can directly connect
you to the 911 call center closest to you, regardless of where in the world you are.
So in those critical moments, the last thing you want to do is scramble to ﬁnd a local
emergency dispatcher. Now, these notiﬁcations will be part of the new Home app,
which actually includes a new feature called the Home Feed. It brings together all
the notiﬁcations and snippets from your devices, organizes them and highlights the
important stuﬀ, so you can quickly see priority items or you get a general recap of
the day. So that's the new Nest Aware; more aﬀordable with more features and
support for more devices.
Okay. Finally, let's talk about home connectivity. You can have the best home setup
in the world, but it's nothing without great Wi-Fi coverage. That's why we launched
Google Wi-Fi three years ago. And since launch, it has been the number one selling
mesh Wi-Fi system on the market. And in 2019, it is the top-selling router of any kind.
And it's a router that actually gets better over time with automatic updates to add
parental controls, improved performance and enable Google's latest security
features.
Well, today, we're also updating the hardware with Nest Wi-Fi. Now, the Nest Wi-Fi
system is actually two devices, the router plugs into your modem and creates a
powerful home network. The point expands your coverage. Now, working together,
they create a single strong Wi-Fi connection throughout your entire home and our
updated hardware and software deliveries up to 2x speed and up to 25% better
coverage. So now the Nest Wi-Fi system only needs one router and one point to
cover around 85% of homes in the US.
Now we're also solving a common probably you ﬁnd with routers today. Most of
them get hidden in a closet or cabinet, because truthfully they are pretty ugly which
reduces their signal intention by 50%. Nest Wi-Fi is designed to be out in the openFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 17Sabrina Elliswhere it performs at its best, with the range of colors that will naturally blend into
your home. And of course, it's really simple to use. With the Google Home app, you
can set up your Nest Wi-Fi network in minutes and once you're set up, it's easy to
share your Wi-Fi password, manage your network, set a schedule for the kids or
create a guest network. Nest Wi-Fi also provides a foundation for your Smart Home
connectivity.
We're working with a growing list of partners to enable seamless set up in the Home
app. And with support for BLE and thread, we can talk to smart home devices locally,
so you don't have to buy a separate hub. Stay tuned for even more partner
announcements over the next few months. Lastly, we added a Google Assistant
smart speaker to the Nest Wi-Fi point, so it does everything the Nest Mini does; plays
your music with great sound, provides answers to your questions and lets you
control smart devices with just your voice.
So now you can broadcast a message to your kids that it's time for dinner. And if that
doesn't work, try saying, Hey Google pause Wi-Fi for kids' devices. Pretty sure that
will work. So that's the new Nest Wi-Fi; better coverage, smart home support and
that Google Assistant. It will be available starting on November 4. With new
aﬀordable home solutions for audio, awareness, and connectivity, everyone now can
start building their own Helpful Home. Thank you.

{BIO 17541752 <GO>}
Hi, I'm Sabrina from the Pixel team. Now let's talk about how Google's ambient
computing vision comes to life when you're on the go. Pixel 4 introduces entirely
new helpful experiences with more natural interactions. It's completely redesigned,
with a new look, a new color and a beautiful new ﬁnish. And Pixel 4 includes camera
features and sensors that you're not going to ﬁnd on any other phone.
Let's start there. Five years ago, our Advanced Technologies team began Project Soli
to investigate radar capabilities. Radar has been around for a long time and it's still
one of the best ways to sense motion. It's precise, low power, and it's fast. There
were lots of exciting possibilities. But here is what our ﬁrst sensor looked like when
we started working on Soli.
Radar sensors have always been way too big to ﬁt in a phone. So we shrunk it down
into a tiny chip, but that still wasn't small enough. So we have to shrink it down even
more. Pixel 4 is the ﬁrst smartphone with a radar sensor. It powers the Motion Sense
capabilities for more human interactions with your phone. For instance, Pixel 4 has
the fastest secure face unlock on a smartphone, because the process starts before
you've even picked up your phone.
Motion Sense prepares the camera when you reach for your Pixel 4, so you don't
need to tap the screen. It's so much faster and smoother. Motion Sense can power
down your phone when you walk away and turn it back on when you approach yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 17phone. It also lets you control your Pixel with simple gestures; swipe to skip a song,
silence a call, wave hello to Pikachu. Again, a wide range of helpful new features
from gaming to personal wellness. Here's a quick look.
[Video Presentation]
Since the Soli sensor can detect the environment around Pixel 4, privacy had to be
built in from the start. You can turn Motion Sense on or oﬀ at any time, and when it's
on, all of the sensor's data is processed right on your Pixel. It's never saved or shared
with other Google services. And Motion Sense isn't the only way we're making your
phone interactions faster and more natural. The Google Assistant is now deeply
integrated into Pixel 4's OS and across your apps. You can quickly open apps, search
across your phone, share what's on your screen and a lot more.
The Assistant can simplify multi-tasking too with a clean new interface. Check this
out. Just give Pixel 4 a quick squeeze. Show me Maggie Rogers on Twitter. What are
her concert dates? Share this with Vivian. Reply, let's go see her. Open
Ticketmaster.com. Search for Maggie Rogers' events. A key way we're making the
Assistant this fast is with an on-device version of our language models that run in our
data center. So they can run locally right on your Pixel 4.
This means the new Assistant uses a hybrid model. It can respond to many day to
day requests on-device like starting a timer or connecting for request like, is my ﬂight
on time? You also have new ways to manage your data. Choose a time limit for how
long you want your activity data to be saved in your Google account or just tell the
Assistant to delete everything you said to it today or this week, and it will. You're in
control and you can ask, get more details by asking, "Hey Google, how do you keep
my data safe?"
We're taking the same care to protect your on-device data too. With Titan M and
other security features, last year's Pixel 3 scored the highest for built-in security for a
smartphone according to Gartner. We've built Titan M into Pixel 4 as well to protect
your most sensitive on-device data, like your passwords, your OS data and now your
face unlock model. Your phone has some of your most personal, private information,
and we have a responsibility to keep it safe and secure.
Now, how many of you have tried a voice recorder app? I know I've tried a few
thinking I'll be able to get organized by recording notes to myself, interesting
lectures, important events, but then I end up with a bunch of untitled audio clips that
I really don't know what to do with. So we created a new kind of audio recorder that
taps into our speech recognition and AI. Let's see it in action.
We've had a Pixel 4 recording this show for the past few minutes. As you can see,
with one tap, I can get recorder transcribing my words in real time as I'm saying
them. Now, to show this is live, it is now 10:44 and it's pretty accurate. This means you
can transcribe meetings, lectures, interviews or anything you want to save.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 17Marc LevoyEric, back stage, is going to save this recording and now I can go into the search bar
and ﬁnd whatever I'm looking for. I can search for sounds, words, phrases, let's see,
all the times I've mentioned Pixel across my entire library of recordings. The places
where the word Pixel are said are highlighted in yellow in the playback bar. So you
can dive into the exact part of the recording you're looking for. It's pretty cool. And
you'll notice this phone is actually in airplane mode. All this recorded functionality
happened on device.
Now, I want to take a minute to talk about Pixel 4's OLED display. DisplayMate has
awarded Pixel 4 XL their highest score, an A plus rating, together with the best
smartphone display award. In ﬁve key areas like color accuracy and image contrast,
DisplayMate classiﬁed Pixel 4 XL's display as visually indistinguishable from perfect.
Pixel 4 is also our ﬁrst smartphone with a 90 hertz refresh rate. And we've added
some smarts. The refresh rate adjusts on its own depending on what you are doing.
So you get a great visual experience while still preserving battery life.
Pixel 4 brings together so many helpful new technologies and capabilities and you'll
get the best Android experience with Android 10 and you're the ﬁrst in line to get
the latest OS updates and features. We also want to make sure you get the best
experience out of the box. So Pixel 4 comes with three months of Google One for
new eligible members. You get lots of premium features including processions, for
one on one virtual help. So if you have a question about your settings or want a few
tips for the camera, we are there for you.
The new Pixel comes in three colors, Just Black, Clearly White and a limited edition
called, Oh So Orange. It also comes in two sizes both with the same features and
both available for pre-order, starting today. Shipping starts on October 24 and we're
excited that people will be able to ﬁnd Pixel in even more places. We're expanding
our carrier partnerships. So Pixel 4 is now available through every major US carrier.
Now, we didn't forget about the camera. For the past three years, Pixel set the
standard for smartphone cameras with incredible capabilities like HDR plus, Super
Res Zoom, top shot, and of course Night Sight. With Pixel 4, we're raising that bar yet
again, and it all starts with this little square, basically a miniaturized camera rig right
on the back of your phone.
You can see the rear wide and telephoto cameras, a hyper spectral sensor, a mic for
your videos and Instagram stories and a ﬂash that we hope you'll use mostly as a
ﬂash light, but it's there just in case. But the hardware isn't what makes our cameras
so much better, the special sauce that makes our Pixel camera unique is our
computational photography.
And who better to talk about it than Professor Marc LaVoy from Google Research.
{BIO 3440416 <GO>}
Thanks, Sabrina. It's great to be here. There is a saying among photographers that
what's important to taking a great picture is in order; subject, lighting, lens and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15

Page 12 of 17camera body. It's their way of saying that it doesn't matter which SLR body you use,
unless you get the ﬁrst three elements right. Well, here's a slightly diﬀerent take on
this list; subject, lighting, lens, software. So, by software, I mean computational
photography. So what does that mean?
It means doing less with hardwired circuitry and more with code. I'd like to call it a
software-deﬁned camera. It typically means capturing and combining multiple
pictures to make a single better picture. One version of this is HDR+. The technology
we've used for taking photos on every Pixel phone. When you tap the shutter button,
we capture burst of up to nine pictures. These pictures are deliberately
underexposed to avoid blowing out highlights. We align them using software and
average them which reduces noise in the shadows. This lets us brighten the
shadows, giving you detail in both the highlights and the shadows.
In fact, there is a simple formula. Noise goes down as the square root of the number
of images you average together. So if you use nine images, you get one-third as
much noise. This isn't mad science, it's just simple physics. By the way, on the left is
our raw output if you enable that in the app. There's something else about this list. It
says the lens is important. Without quibbling about the order on the list, some
subjects are farther away than you'd like. So it does help telephoto shots to have a
telephoto lens.
So Pixel 4 has a roughly 2x telephoto lens plus our super res zoom technology. In
other words, a hybrid of optical and digital zoom which we use on both the main
and telephoto lenses, so you get sharp imagery throughout the zoom range. Here is
an example. You probably we think this is a 1x photo. It's not, it is a zoom, taken from
way back here. By the way, super res zoom is real multi-frame super resolution,
meaning that pinch zooming before you take the shot, gives you a sharper photo
than cropping afterwards. So don't crop like this, compose the shot you want by
pinch zooming. Also, by the way, most popular SLR lenses do magnify scenes, not
shrink them. So while wide angle can be fun, we think telephoto is more important.
So what new computational photography features are we launching with Pixel 4?
Four of them. First, Live HDR+. Everyone here is familiar with HDR+'s signature look
and its ability to capture extreme brights and darks in a way that looks crisp and
natural. But even phones with good HDR solutions can't compute them in real time.
So the viewﬁnder often looks diﬀerent from the ﬁnal image.
In this example, the window is blown out on the viewﬁnder which might tempt you
into ﬁddling with the exposure. This year, we're using machine learning to
approximate HDR+in the viewﬁnder, so you get our signature look while you
compose your shot. We call this feature live HDR+. So, the industry's most successful
HDR solution is now real-time and WYSIWYG, what you see is what you get.
Now, if we have an intrinsically HDR camera, we should have HDR controls for it. So
Pixel 4 has dual exposure controls. Here is an example. This is a nice HDR+ shot, but
maybe you would like to try it as a silhouette. So you tap on the screen and lower theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 13 of 17brightness slider a bit. That mainly changes the capture exposure. Then you lower
the shadows slider a lot. That mainly changes the tone mapping, and voila, you get a
diﬀerent artistic vision. Try doing that with any other cellphone. So separate sliders
for brightness and shadows while you compose your shot. It's a diﬀerent way of
thinking about controlling exposure in a camera.
Second, white-balancing in photography is a hard problem. Mathematicians call it an
ill-posed problem. Is this snow blue the way this SLR originally captured it or is it
white snow illuminated by a blue sky. We know that snow is white. With enough
training, so can the camera. We've been using learning-based white balancing in
Night Sight since Pixel 3. In Pixel 4 we're using it in all photo modes. So you get truer
colors, especially in tricky lighting. Here is a tough case, an ice cave. It's blue light
but not a blue person and here's what it looks like with Pixel 4's white balancing.
Third, we've continued to improve portrait mode. With our dual Pixel or split Pixel
technology, we've always been good at portraits and at macro shots. This year we're
computing depth, again using machine learning, from both dual pixels and dual
cameras which gives us accurate depth farther from the camera. This extends portrait
mode to large objects and stand further back portraits. We also have a luscious new
SLR like bokeh; that's the shape of the blur. Look at the lights on either side of her
head. We're doing better on hair and dog fur which are hard and of course we still
do great selﬁe portraits.
Fourth and last, we have continued to improve Night Sight in many ways and
extended it to a use case that has always been sort of a holy grail for me. You could
have taken this dusk shot using Pixel 3 last year. Using Pixel 4, you can take this night
time picture from the same viewpoint.
In the year since we launched it, Night Sight has been called everything from fake to
sorcery, well, it's neither. Think back to the mathematics that I explained at the
beginning. Astrophotography is about taking longer exposures and more of them;
up to 16 seconds times 15 exposures; that's four minutes. But it's a single shutter
press and it's fully automatic. By the way, you can't do this with a single long
exposure. In four minutes, the stars do move and trees wave in the wind. So you
need robust alignment and merging of multiple pictures. And for a four minute
exposure, we do recommend a tripod or you can prop your phone on a rock.
Is there machine learning? Yes, we use it for white balancing, as I mentioned. We also
use semantic segmentation in all our photo modes and have for years to brighten
faces in HDR+, a feature we call synthetic ﬁll ﬂash to separate foregrounds from
backgrounds in portrait shots and to darken and de-noise skies in Night Sight.
Is there computational photography? There is lots of that too. Digital sensors are
prone to hot pixels that are stuck at red, green or blue. The longer the exposure, the
more hot pixels. Our exposures are pretty long. So we need some clever algorithms
to remove those hot pixels. By the way, that's our Astrophotography ﬁeld testing
team and, yes, they sat still for a long time for this shot.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-10-15

Lily LinSo where does this game stop? What can't we capture using Pixel 4? Well, we can
capture the moon, which by the way, required some ﬁddling with those dual
exposure controls I told you about, and we can capture a moonlit landscape. This is
not daytime. It's the middle of the night, and the landscape is illuminated only by the
moon; see the stars. But what we can't do, including on Pixel 4 today, is capture both
at once in the same picture. The problem here is that the moon is blown out and the
Marin Headlands at the bottom are just a silhouette. The dynamic range, the
diﬀerence in brightness between a full moon and a moon light landscape is 19 at
stops. That's 19 doubling about 0.5 million times brighter, way beyond the range of
any consumer camera, even an SLR. So is this scene forever impossible with a cell
phone? Remember what I said at the beginning about software deﬁned camera,
Pixel is committed to making its cameras better with software updates, so stay tuned
on this one.
So to sum up, four new computational photography features; Live HDR+, with dual
exposure controls; learning based white balancing; wider range portrait mode with
an SLR Bokeh; and Night Sight with astrophotography. And remember, you can use
Night Sight for many things besides stars; many things. So go out there and be
creative with Pixel 4.
Now, it's my honor to introduce one of my favorite artist, who has spent her career
creating some of the most memorable photographs over the last 50 years. 12
months ago, we gave her a Pixel and she has taken it all over the country to build a
new collection of portraits. She also gives us suggestions and candid feedback,
which we've taken to heart in the tuning of the Pixel 4 camera.
So please welcome my friend, Annie Leibovitz, along with our own Lily Lin.

Hi, Annie. Thank you for joining us today.
{BIO 2091061 <GO>}
Thank you, Marc. Thank you, Marc. Thank you, Marc. This is an extraordinary
opportunity that Google gave me and I've always been interested in the camera
phone and what it could do and what it's potential was and Google came to me and
said, we'd like to support you in some sort of artistic endeavor and we thought of
this project. And I mean it's obviously what's interesting about a camera phone, I
mean it is -- is you can carry in your pocket, for example. Go ahead, I'm sorry.

Lily LinNo, no, it's great. I know that you've been using the camera for over a year now to
shoot a collection of photographs some of which we are seeing the behind the
scenes here. Can you tell us more about the project?
{BIO 2091061 <GO>}
Well, we started really with the Pixel 3 and I was very suspicious and very careful with
it and it really became an exercise in light and composition and content. And then,
when the Pixel 4 came along, I was kind of very impressed about how I relaxed with
it and just glided with it, and used it and really just enjoyed taking pictures. I've
really, towards the end of -- I mean, we're going to be doing more work, but towards
the end of the work that we were doing, I felt like I was just beginning to sort of get it
and I just let the camera do the work, quite honestly, and really enjoyed myself.
But the project, the people...
{BIO 21241959 <GO>}
Yeah, yeah, some of which we have today, Noor and Chase and Idris.
{BIO 2091061 <GO>}
This is Noor and Chase and Idris. I mean, the people -- I mean, the people made that
made the project, I mean made -- we really turned to people who care and people
who matter and people who are doing things that give us hope and across the
board, and every single person that we photographed is doing something that they
care about what they're doing and they represent great parts of us who are getting
on with it.
{BIO 21241959 <GO>}
Right, change makers, I think, is what I've heard you call them, true change makers
around the country. So you've been traveling -- been traveling across the country
shooting these amazing subjects.
{BIO 2091061 <GO>}
When Google ﬁrst came to me with this, they sort of totally seduced me by saying,
would you like to drive across the country and then and that turned into, of course,
going back to people. So I don't know if it is -- if you see, what I did was, I decided to
take two photographs to create a portrait and because it's hard to say what you want
to say about a person especially these extraordinary people in one picture, and so I
made it a diptych, and took two photographs. For example, it was Sarah Zorn from
the Citadel. There is a photograph of her almost on graduation day in her uniform,
but next to her is a photograph of the boots she wore for four years every single day.

Annie LeibovitzWell, I -- so I have to ask, I'm so curious because you have access to the world's best
camera equipment. So how is it diﬀerent with this project just having what you have
in your pocket now? What was that experience like?
{BIO 2091061 <GO>}
Well, I've been using, like everyone else, camera phones for a while and the whole
idea was can you use it to go out and do -- work as a photographer. And I was dying
for this opportunity -- to be given this opportunity by Google to sort of develop the
camera phone for a photographer and how to use it. And as I said before, it was a
little bit of a rough start and then I just relaxed and I really totally enjoyed myself.
One of the last shoots with Meg, the soccer player, it really felt like we were just
ﬂoating. I mean, she was really a beautiful -- anyway, she was just a beautiful muse
and I took these photographs that I wasn't really thinking about the camera or
thinking -- just really composing and the light was beautiful and she had that red
shock of hair and it just feels great.
{BIO 21241959 <GO>}
That's great. Well, so before we go, since I have you, I have to ask, what pro tips do
you have for all of us here who want to take beautiful images like this with the phone
in your pocket?
{BIO 2091061 <GO>}
Oh, it's all inside you. I mean, you just go out and you do. It is all there. I think what's
great about the camera phone, I mean, my children use this phone, use this camera
and I mean, we all are using this camera and it's a brand new language and if you
want to do something more speciﬁc, then you may fall into another category and
you're a photographer, but it's just really great that this is available for everyone to
use.
{BIO 21241959 <GO>}
Yeah, the democratization of photography is what I've heard you call it, so...
{BIO 2091061 <GO>}
I think it's great.
{BIO 21241959 <GO>}
So, thank you so much. And thank you. I wish we had more time, but I know you and
as well as Nora, Chase, Idris are going to be sticking around. So thank you for that.
Thanks for joining us on stage, and guys, Annie Leibovitz.
