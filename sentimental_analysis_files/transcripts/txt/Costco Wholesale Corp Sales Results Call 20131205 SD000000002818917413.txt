which started on Monday, November 4 and ended on Sunday, December 1.
For comparable sales results, this four-week period is compared to the same four-

of a little more than negative 0.5% on November comp sales.
Weakening foreign currencies year over year relative to the US dollar resulted in a
detriment to our reported November comp sales by a little more than minus 1.25%.
Total international comps for the four-week period came in at plus 6% in local
currencies. But resulted in a reported comp of plus 1% when converted to US dollars.
The average transaction was down a little over minus 2% year over year, which
includes about 2% for the combined negative impact of foreign exchange and
gasoline price deﬂation.

positive traﬃc of 4.25%. Cannibalization for the month of November had a negative
