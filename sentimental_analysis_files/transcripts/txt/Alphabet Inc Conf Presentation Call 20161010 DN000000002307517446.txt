Good morning, everyone. My name is Mandeep Singh. I'm the Software Analyst at
Bloomberg Intelligence. With me today are IDC Analysts, Mickey North Rizza and
Robert Mahowald. And we'll be talking about a theme on Cloud M&A.
A couple of housekeeping notes. Today's presentation will be recorded and
available for playback. At the bottom of the slide window, you will notice that you
can adjust volume and maximize your screen. Feel free to ask a question by
submitting one to the right of the slides, we will address questions at the conclusion
of the presentation.
A little bit about Bloomberg Intelligence. It provides in-depth analysis and data sets
on industries, companies, government, ESG, credit, economic, and litigation that can
impact business decisions. It's backed by 300 plus third-party data providers and is
delivered with no buy or sell recommendations. Our analyst team averages 20 plus
years of buy- and sell-side research experience. BI is exclusively provided to clients
who subscribe to the Bloomberg Professional Service and can be accessed at BI GO.
So without further ado, I'll hand it over to Mickey and Robert for a presentation, that
will be followed by questions. Mickey?

Thanks, Mandeep; and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. So, today we
want to talk to you about the cloud and where we see everything going. Myself and
Robert work together to help bring this information to our clients at IDC. So, the ﬁrst
thing I'd like you to understand is, we see the cloud as part of what we call The Third
Platform, and it's also tied into mobility, the social side of the business in the Data
and the Analytics. And I think the important part here for you to understand is, cloud
is the new baseline of what you need to actually bring change and where you're
going from an overall perspective.
When we look at what I cover the areas of enterprise applications, we ﬁnd that, you
know, the operating model has really shifted from on-premises and license and
maintenance support over to the cloud in a subscription standpoint. And as you canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 2 of 20Robert Mahowaldsee, we expect that trend to continue, but we also see that the reason that you're
going to need that cloud and what you're going to do with it, it's changing as well.
We really see that the information and what comes from the data sets and the
information that's out in the external world, the IoT, the Internet of Things, Artiﬁcial
Intelligence, Cognitive, there's a whole host of things, they're all driving the ability
for cloud to even do more than it has in the past.
So as we talk about this, I'd like you to think about the cloud as your baseline to get
you to that next step and you're going to see a lot of change that's already occurred,
but you're going to see it continuing on this path at even a quicker pace than we've
seen already.
Robert, I'm going to move to the next slide here.
{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
Yes. So as Mickey said, cloud is the -- is deﬁnitely the -- and so products that are
operationalized to be sold as cloud services are deﬁnitely the fast growers in
software. So, if we look at the, you know, worldwide software market from 2015, the
growth was about 4.75%.
I think the growth, you know, maintenance plus subscription -- plus license over the
next ﬁve years is expected to have a CAGR of just a little bit over that, just a little over
5.25%, largely driven by a staying power among the ability of SAP and Oracle and
others to keep companies on maintenance and on enterprise user license
agreements. So that's kind of what's sort of driving the high-end of software.
The remainder is our SaaS services and cloud services. So anything as a software that
can be operationalized to be delivered as a service, we will call cloud software
broadly. And depending on capability and market that it's sold into, the growth rates
there over the next ﬁve years are anywhere from 90% [ph] to about 85%, so, really
signiﬁcant. I would say on the low-end our very slow growth areas like -- maybe
ﬁnancial planning or some manufacturing apps, and on the high-end data
management analytics are suiting the fast growers.
This is a slide that we use to characterize the cloud economy. So this is the ways in
which -- these are the ways in which vendors, anybody who wants to interact with the
cloud economy can make money. On the left side is kind of what we all know and
think of is, core cloud services. So I've built something, I've serviced and
operationalized it, how I do so is part of my cost of goods sold.
And I'm selling an all-in subscription cloud service, and there are many, many forms
of this from those that are metered by the gigabit or by the minute or even by the
second. In the case it's in [ph] like AWS Lambda, all the way up to software,
application software I should say, which is really to most customers looks -- doesn't
feel so much, but it looks a lot like packaged software, because here, in a way that it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 20paid for, because it's (Technical Diﬃculty) you're paying for perhaps a year upfront,
and you might be paying for more than that and then you might be paying a year at
a time.
So nothing like -- quite like the granular metered services that we think about when
we think about cloud more broadly. The application providers have really sort of
engineered a system that works for them. And I would say that, that also it becomes
very true when you're talking about companies like SAP or Oracle, who have been
using things like Subscription Credit in the place of payment from customers who've
got residual maintenance due on their contracts and those companies who want to
switch them over to their SaaS version of whatever software it is. Maybe it's E-
Business Suite and they want to maintain them on the same kind of ﬁxed schedule.
And that beneﬁts both, you know, buyer and seller in some degrees equally,
because it provides a lot of predictability for the buyer. So, that's IT cloud services in
the left side and all the things that you think about when you think about cloud
services are there.
The cloud components in the middle is the slide is what we call the arms dealer
equation. And it's been looking at all of the markets that (inaudible) and are --
familiar with IDC are Black Books, and it's clearly everything that we cover all across
the information technology and communications world, and thinking about how are
these products being made to work well in a cloud (Technical Diﬃculty). So, whether
they're open from all the tenancy, you know, whether they're hosted, you know,
whether they're designed for Grid Compute (inaudible), or if they are IT service
management products, for example, they're really, really important in this multi-
cloud world.
Do they have the ability to tap (Technical Diﬃculty) heterogeneous assets and do
things like CMDB and (Technical Diﬃculty) change management and governance of
assets that live in diﬀerent places? So, IDC is looking at the world of hardware,
software and services sold into enterprises as they build out enterprise private cloud
and into service providers and into ISVs of all types, and saying, you know, what is it?
Is there something functionally diﬀerent about this product, no matter what the sort
of the market structure is and what the vendor says it is that makes it right, and
customers are buying it with the intention of deploying it and what we would call a
cloud, perhaps a private cloud as an enterprise that has got, you know, virtualization
and automation and scripting, et cetera.
And that is -- that's what we think of as a private cloud is the product being used in
that way. So that's a huge -- that's a huge market, and I would say sort of a little bit
diﬀerent from the IT cloud services market, where you're going to have both lift and
shift, you're going to have a lot of customers saying, you know, we want to move to
something that's very much the same as what we were doing before.
There's a lot of lift as well when you've got diﬀerent categories of software that are
brought together by one provider and being sold as a service to a customer and thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 20customer is getting more than they probably would have gotten otherwise if they
had bought those pieces separately, and of course they're paying more for it, and so
there's more -- more lifts there.
In the cloud components world, it's really kind of a pie that's slowly turning from one
slice into two slices, and/or probably staying at kind of a big two-slice world for a
long time as we've got a set of components that are serving traditional, what we
would call ﬁrst and second platform businesses and parts of businesses. And we've
got some that are being sold for cloud delivery and, you know, cloud instantiation.
So that's the middle segment of the cloud economy slide.
On the right, we've got management professional services, so there is everything
there from network consulting, business consulting, systems integration, more like
[ph] across the board, domain-based and technology-based. So, everything that you
do, you need to do to either get your customers on the road to cloud, or if you're an
ISV, for example, or you're a big SI or just to help your customers to continue to use
and optimize their consumption of public and virtual hosted private cloud services.
So, for example, there is a lot of -- as we all know, there's a lot of day one, what I
would call, day one systems integration stuﬀ that has to be done to get a company
to ﬁgure out, rationalize the portfolio, ﬁgure out what provides value to the company,
what continues to provide value based on utilization, what provides value to run
locally and what might -- if it doesn't provide value to run locally, what might still
provide value if I ran it some places also, if I ran it as a provider.
And going through that equation, that kind of day one road to cloud stuﬀ is really in
this -- is in this space, but also more and more to a greater extent, especially the
global SIs have ﬁgured out that the real opportunity is helping customers with
ongoing integration and optimization of their consumption of cloud services. We're
moving to a world where even at the infrastructure level, I guess probably
predominantly mostly at the infrastructure level, but somewhere in the middle tier as
well, it's -- we're going to be able to do more operational arbitrage around cost and
function in -- among providers.
There are enough providers of basic core capabilities coming into the market and
there are a handful of engines that are coming up that are making that arbitrage
possible, that kind of stuﬀ, that arbitrage and the optimization is being heavily
leveraged by the big SIs, who are helping their mid-size and large companies ﬁgure
out how to use the cloud and consume things well and work well. We call those
maturing cloud services, because they've been around for a while, they are
becoming more well- understood and people who kind of get how to make money
out of them.
I would say on the emerging side, the Industry Cloud Services, Industry Cloud is a
topic that IDC has been covering for about two years. We're putting a lot of time and
eﬀort into this -- into it this year. I'd just brieﬂy say that it's -- it's centered around real
center of gravity players in their industries. And if you look at some of the names
here, you'll see that some of these companies are either early into certain nicheFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 20Mickey North Rizzamarkets or else they're industry leaders in their markets whether it's, you know,
pharma, manufacturing, automotive, raw materials, you know, biotech, et cetera.
And the notion here is that -- is that, an industry cloud is not only a place to do what
you would do in a platform-as-a-service, everything from hosting data, doing
analytics and doing transactions, but it's also a place that can provide the industry-
speciﬁc regulatory compliance, the governance, and even in some cases like AWS
GovCloud, the indemniﬁcation. So, essentially the assurance behind saying, we will
ensure that to the limits of our SLA, you -- you will not be sued or you will not be
found as default, or you will not be made open to a damaging audit for the technical
assets that we're providing for you. So, it's really over and above, typically what you'd
get from any of the providers of IT cloud services and even from the Professional
Managed Services to some degree. So Industry Cloud is something that we think is
really a big deal.
I'd say the second big aspect of Industry Cloud, that we've spent too much time on it
is that, that is the platform that these companies have built for their customers and
others, even the industry peers as well, to be able to build new custom code,
durable code to be sold, to be consumed.
So it also is becoming more of a marketplace for like-minded companies that -- they
understand that the most important thing to them is not the technology that's kind of
the table stakes. The most important thing to them is being in compliance and
having very unique set software assets that they can access, but they know work
alongside the -- that, you know, the core products they are using, and that's kind of
the way Industry Cloud takes us there.
So next slide, please. Okay, Mickey?
{BIO 17644459 <GO>}
So, on this slide -- yes, on this slide, we're looking at the number of acquisitions in
cloud software. So, if you look at this from an overall perspective, you can see it's
grown very rapidly. Something to consider here is that the cloud acquisitions have
been two to three to one depending upon what area you're looking at from on-
premises software. And I think that Robert did a great job about describing that
earlier on what the market looks like and how more and more companies are going
into that cloud.
So, you know, if I look at it and I look at some of the top companies in the cloud just
in 2016 Salesforce, which was eight, is now nine with their acquisition of Krux
yesterday, the announcement of that on data management side. You'll also see
Oracle with seven, Accenture and Google with six, Microsoft with six, Cisco with ﬁve,
IBM with ﬁve, the Amazon with four, and Apple with four.
So, you know, if I just pick on, you know, a few out of the top 20 there. If I really look
at this, what you're seeing when you look at the trends here, there's an awful lot of
the cloud purchases, you see a lot into AI, data sets, anything from the digitalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 20Robert Mahowaldtransformation world that's taking on beyond that Third Platform, because they've
got the cloud basic or they are adding more cloud infrastructure in there, but now,
they're getting to the next standpoint to say what are the information pieces we
need and the other platform pieces we need to round out our oﬀering. And if I think
about that, you know, Robert did a great job on that last slide talking about the cloud
services and how that whole emerging area is coming up.
I think if somebody like Ford and Microsoft, who invested in Pivotal. And basically,
you know, Pivotal is a connected drivers organization and they're bringing in
automation aspect and they represent the cloud as well. So you're starting to see
companies come together you may not have thought about in the past to really
make a diﬀerence in their end products that they're selling and bring more to the
consumer market from an overall aspect. So, just from a quick snapshot, the
acquisitions in the cloud are becoming greater and greater and you can see that by
this chart here.
Let's see here. Next slide, Robert?
{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
Okay, great. And this might be hard to see, because it was meant to be a build over
other slide, but essentially this is -- the notion here was just talk about some of the
reasons why companies acquire what they acquire. And clearly, in our experience
and looking at software broadly, the acquirees have sort of focused on a mix of both
traditional packaged software and SaaS/cloud services. But I would say that in the
last couple of years particularly -- and what drives that is simply the desire to buy
capability, net new capability.
And if you're buying non-cloud capability and you understand how the software
works very well, then you can get it for cheaper, the multiple is going to be far less
than a fully operationalized cloud service with a run rate of subscribers under its
wings. And so, you know, cost -- cost and capability are pretty much the key drivers
for what decides -- what kind of company they buy, you know, for business
relationships, partnerships, and lots of things there, but really that's it.
I would note that in the last two or so years, and I think our data bear this out. The
desire to buy a company that has some what we call cloud shops is much stronger. I
think the sense of urgency has come to especially some of our larger vendors like
Oracle and Microsoft, IBM and SAP particularly as they understand that really the
opportunity in a big way is, when we think about the -- and sort of on the left side of
that -- that chart I had previously.
If I want to be a complete cloud company, then what that means is, I've got to
operationalize a set of services. I've got a consumer hardware and software, I've got
to sort of orient my professional services operation, and I've got to have a full range
of developer services, application services, and self-service infrastructure services,
network compute and storage.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 20And to do that, I need to -- I'm not going to have necessarily a lot of diﬀerentiators
by having that, but I need to get to that level of the ability to compete at that total
cloud level, because, you know, IDC believes that there is a great sense of urgency
from these customers, and also from these vendors I should say and also from their
customers to rationalize the portfolio and move a lot of stuﬀ to cloud properties as
quickly as possible.
Certainly, we've seen from Amazon the desire to -- if they cut the prices on things like
their Amazon Snowball, three times in the last 18 months trying to get customers to
over massive volumes of data to the cloud. They've also made free in many cases
their data streaming products, so you can move certain amount of data on a, you
know, on a given day to their cloud for operational analysis or what have you or for
long-term storage.
So, the desire to get customers to move is, there's a lot of urgency right now. I think
the desire to buy and acquire software capability to be able to have that total cloud
is very strong, because I think there's going to be a point where, you know,
depending on how some of these big customers feel about of our strategic safety
around focusing all (inaudible) on one vendor and there are some risks there for
sure. The opportunity to get more and more of that IT spend pie, I think is larger, if
you can, one, get your customers to navigate that transition to cloud, say they are
customers of, say, core SAP applications, take care of that.
And then, also get those customers to start building on the platform, putting data on
the platform, start using adjacent partner applications on the platform, and what you
ﬁnd is there's tremendous amount of gravity around that customer activity in the
platform and so buying the right kind of capability becomes so much more
important.
So, when we say here key messages, you know, it's round out the functional portfolio
and run the business cloud app. So things that are really important to customers
make sure that you need to ideally build something with, you know, with functional
parity to what your customers' experience is in packaged applications and that's
often very, very diﬃcult.
And two, to ﬁgure out what do we need to do to complete a set of workﬂows that
are important to our customers. If we only sell this one thing before, so say it was,
you know, say it was, you know, talent management, do we need to do the things like
review management, social sourcing of new capability, all those other pieces, and
those are the -- it's kind of those small point pieces that we see really being bought
that are most important right now.
Normalize the balance sheet is also super important, when we report on Oracle's
quarter -- last quarter 80% growth in the SaaS portfolio, but the organic growth
around the Fusion portfolio is really below 40%. So, you know, really less than half
the growth there, and even more than that, when you consider the pipeline.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 20Mickey North Rizza
Robert MahowaldAnd the message there is that, Oracle ﬁgured out, you know, early on that they
needed to have -- they need to have Taleo and Eloqua and RightNow, and all the
other companies that they've bought that had a substantial customer stream that
help to normalize the balance sheet as they make a big transition and allows them to
put a good face on an otherwise poor quarter where hardware lost 12% and software
licenses were, I think a 0.5% under par and maintenance was about 9%. So, it allows
them to lead with SaaS and normalize the balance sheet by having some of these
folks.
I would just say, you know, that the point this slide was written, this slide is a little of a
year old. This is -- there are 45 plus SaaS pure-plays with 25 million -- we're all
potential targets. I would say with the level of M&A that Mickey went through and
that we track all the time, the number is actually quite a bit more. It's probably, you
know, we track at IDC, you know, a product we call CloudShare. We track about
2,400 as-a-service vendors around the world. There are about 400 that made a little
more than $20 million in 2015. But the big SaaS properties, independent SaaS
properties with the exception of Workday and a couple of others have all been
snapped up heretofore.
And so, I think, again, it's sort of been -- but the next wave of M&A will be going very
much down market into what we would call the long tail of SaaS, we're going to talk
about that in a minute, investigating, you know, what's there by functional capability,
by geography, you know, the management team, the partners, et cetera, and kicking
the tires and really looking at companies that will be bought for a lower multiple and
are not big names yet, for sure.
So Mickey, do you want to take a slide or do you want me to --
{BIO 17644459 <GO>}
Nope, go ahead. You are on a roll here, and I moved over to it so you could see the
long tail and you can start focusing in on that, because you really talked about most
of the markets.
{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
Sure, yes, absolutely. So, you know, typically in software markets, we ﬁnd, you know,
competitors one, two and three in that pecking order and then another, right? And
so depending on how mature the market is that other, you know, can be 20% or it
can be 60%. I think here we're looking at another here that is about 40% or so.
It's for a -- it's for a market with a lot of variability. We've got some mature segments
of cloud software and some immature segments of cloud software and so that makes
a lot of sense. So cloud software for IDC is Software-as-a-Service, so that is -- that
includes applications and system infrastructure software, so things like storage
software, archiving IT service management, security, et cetera, that's all part of SaaS.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 20And you see because -- if you kind of look at the middle of the slide, applications-as-
a-service, SIS as a service and also included in cloud software for IDC is platform-as-
a-service, and so the platform-as-a-service piece is there. And you can see the
growth over time and in particular see the importance to these key incumbent
vendors. These are, you know, these are -- this is a key set of incumbent vendors.
And I think you could probably take into it out of this picture a little bit because with
the exception of QuickBase, they're pretty much all in the ﬁnancial management
application space, and they're, you know, they're about (Technical Diﬃculty) sales to
consumers.
So just think about everybody else here and think about the rush and the urgency
they have to all of a sudden serve more and more diﬀerent kinds of functional pieces
of their customers' technical capability needs. So, you know, for a company like
Salesforce, of course, or even more to the point, Microsoft, of course, applications
are big, for Oracle, applications have been a huge thing for them these past 10 or so
years. But pushing into other markets like for Oracle, you know, operationalizing
their Enterprise Business Suite, so their ITSM set of products. As a Cloud Business
Suite, it's something that allows their customers (Technical Diﬃculty) multi-cloud
resource management and governance, that's really big for them.
Obviously that, you know, the Java Developer Cloud, building out a fully ﬂedged as
they just announced at the last OpenWorld, a fully ﬂedged infrastructure-as-a-
service where customers can take granular bites on a self-service basis from a
computing storage set of products.
That kind of stuﬀ -- so that kind of -- the desire to show the slide is to show over time,
how this really ﬂushes out in the diversity some of the big players, desire to have and
we think will have is that we go forward in time to take out -- to get more and more
of that kind of functional diversity.
If you look at the long tail deﬁned by change, so we, you know, we do a lot of work,
modeling work around how many ISVs are there in the world. So, an ISV just deﬁned
as a -- in this case, it's a cloud ISV, right? So there are about 25,000 ISVs, you know,
very broadly, about -- probably about 5,500 of them are as-a-service ISV. So they
make some of their money, some or most or all of their money by delivering a fully
operationalized subscription service to customers.
And when you look at the entry into the market, I mean, there is really a long tail for a
new -- new in start-up. There's also, for sure, some companies that have been, you
know, maybe, stuck in an O&M space or maybe a Third Platform space, where
they're really serving an industry-speciﬁc customer, particularly, you know, so say it,
maybe the point of sales software, they haven't really needed to have any kind of as-
a- service revenue.
And so that -- you know, so now that they have some, but we're going to talk about
what that means for them in the next slide, that's a big deal for them, right, to haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 20that. And if you look at some of these stats here, I mean you all can read as well as I
can, they enter life with market enablers, you know, there are a whole set of start-up
companies who've glommed on universities, glommed onto the big ISVs, and
middleware and database providers, and that isn't a good idea, and they should say,
you know, we want to grow a business and we want to be a SaaS business.
We know that's the cheap way to get access to infrastructure. So that's really the -- so
we do a lot of work on ﬁguring out how does a small business get started? What
kind of business is it functionally? What's the big driving demand? Where do they
get the tools and the assets they need to start the business, in many cases from, you
know, from IBM or Oracle or Microsoft, and even Amazon, it's, you know, we give you
the tools to create and grow your business, and once you get a run rate there's a
proﬁt- sharing kind of model, and then as you get bigger things change.
And so when we look at its splitting itself, the big M&A is in sort of in the middle
when some of these companies start to get. They understand how to do business.
They've got some customers, they've reached a certain run rate and they're looking
around and they have diﬃculty growing to the next level. That's when they start to
either entertain oﬀers, they start to have more conversations, that may start out as
core partnerships with some of these big database middleware distribution vendors,
and then that's kind of where we think the next wave of M&A is going to come from.
There's a lot of -- in the big companies really you've got a very clear intention of
what you're doing. I'm buying a marquee name that has got a set of customers that
hopefully is not completely, you know, replicative of what I've been selling into for a
long time, and you provide a functionality that we, you know, we need time to -- we
need speed to market, we can't really hope to build right now. So, we've got a lot
more work we do around the long tail and software.
And what -- and how the entire software universe changes over time with these net
new smaller companies coming in and diﬀerent degrees of hybrid, and by hybrid
here we're talking speciﬁcally about the kind of revenue that these companies make,
how diverse the revenue stream is, we'll be happy to talk with Bloomberg about and
to share some more there.
Next slide. So this is a slide that we do a lot of work on and update over time. And I
think the key thing to understand is (Technical Diﬃculty) build is, when you look at
cloud software revenue broadly, for vendors with more than 90% cloud, there is a
pretty large growth trajectory.
This is just for the pieces of the portfolio that are delivered as-a-service, right? So
from all vendors (Technical Diﬃculty) below that you see -- you see that it is a little bit
lower, right? And so this is from, you know, this could be from companies or list of
companies who may make only a small amount of their revenue from delivering
cloud services.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 20So as I remind people all the time, a company even with substantial as-a-service
revenues like Microsoft, for example, still probably makes less than 7% of their total
revenue from delivering cloud services. That's just the way it is. And I think it
represents the relatively slow nature of change in our industry.
I think in all of the software markets that Mickey and I look at, even by 2020, we don't
see any of them getting more than 22%, 23% of their revenue coming from buying
subscription services, the rest of it is all from various, what we call, ﬁrst and second
platform services. And there is huge installed bases out there that are slow to churn
and slow to be convinced as a need and requirement, necessity and value of making
that transition, so, that's there.
If you look at packaged software revenue from all vendors, as I mentioned before,
the CAGR through in this seven-year periods, it's about 5.5%. The interesting and
important thing to understand here is that -- is that companies who don't have any
as- a-service revenue stream. So of the, you know, the companies that IDC tracks
more broadly in our software tracker a little over 5,000 companies. When we do the
work to understand what do we think their share of the pie is, the growth pie is? If
they don't have any as-a-service revenue and we project by 2020, it's less than 1%.
So, of the -- basically the growth pie, again, it's diﬀerent by every, you know,
functional market that we're in, whether it's, you know, database or it's hosting or it's,
you know, ERP, or what have you, whatever the growth is in that market, as an
average, those companies who don't make any of their money through as-a-service
delivery have less than 1% -- have a shot at less than 1% of that growth over time.
Now, I share this with a lot of vendor clients, because it's important for them to
understand that, you know, not only either strong and compelling reasons that we're
not going to go through here for their customers to want to move to cloud and not
have to do things like update and have a, you know, single set of capability over the
same time to all of their internal customers et cetera.
It also mean there is also signiﬁcant beneﬁts for the provider. So, you know, they are
signiﬁcant in telling and companies like Oracle that are moving to, you know,
working very, very hard and moving to a higher and higher gross margin on their as-
a- service portfolio, most companies that we look at are around 40%, Oracle is
around 65%, and their goal is to move toward 80% gross margin on their as-a-
service oﬀerings.
Companies that have ﬁgured out how to operationalize their services and get very
eﬃcient about how they deliver, what they deliver, have understood that, one, this
was coming like a fast train; two, we need to get our shops and understand how this
works in our world; and three, our chance to take some of that growth is greatly
diminished if we don't do this now and do the hard work now, whether it's through
merger or whether it's through, you know, through building our own set of services
and walking our customers through the hard steps to get there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06

Robert MahowaldBoards understand this, the C-Suite understands this (Technical Diﬃculty)
understand that. And so, I think it -- there is very few of our vendor customers who
don't understand this message now.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Yes, that's great. I thought that was a fascinating conversation and you know just the
whole aspect of long tail of cloud, I think, it just helps you put things in perspective
as to which way things are going in cloud. I mean, if I recall correctly that this whole
thing started when private equity took out this -- right, they bought Cvent and
Marketo, Vista Equity Partners bought these two companies back early in the year.
And the idea was not very clear at that point of time, you know, which way this M&A
wave is going and why they were making these acquisitions because these
companies didn't have a huge cash ﬂow or -- and then M&A really picked up and we
saw some mega deals this year. Microsoft bought -- buying LinkedIn, Salesforce
buying Demandware and Oracle buying NetSuite. So, I just -- I'm curious what is
driving the deal optimism this year, like, we have seen much bigger deals this year
than we have seen in cloud so far. So what -- do you guys have like any kind of notes
around or reasons around why we are seeing bigger deals this year?
{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
Yes, let me -- I'll give my answer and then Mickey, I'm sure, has got some good
thoughts here too. So, yes, you know, I would say that this is the last opportunity to
snap up a big successful SaaS property, no matter what the multiple is and take out a
set of competition.
I think that, you know, for a long time Oracle, you know, used -- Larry Ellison used the
stage at OpenWorld to make fun of Salesforce, and I don't think anybody is making
fun of Salesforce anymore. They ﬁgured out how to diversify their product set and
how to sell into pretty much all parts of the organization, not just the sales suite. I
think that -- so it's driven by fear and then -- I think fear that somebody else will
simply step in and buy them if they don't.
I know that, for example, when Oracle bought NetSuite, there were several other
bidders who just had to sort of drop out. I think NetSuite was seen as a company that
was successfully managed and it was, you know, it was worth spending, you know,
3.5 billion or whatever was spent on NetSuite, because you know, you got a NetSuite
shareholder a set of big established customers who are gaga for NetSuite. And
NetSuite, by the way, ﬁgured out how to bring partners, you know, like
FinancialForce and Namely who brought other pieces of the pie functionally that
they couldn't bring. That I think instilled some fear in the hearts of the big apps
providers and I think drive some of the pressure to acquire somebody big and
spend a lot of money as you point out.
I don't know, I don't really think other than Workday, I don't know of anybody really
big, real valuable property out there in the core enterprise application space who weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06

Mickey North Rizzacommand now. I would say, of course, Salesforce will, but I think Salesforce has,
maybe reached a point in the stratosphere where an outright buy would be pretty
darn diﬃcult, I think a merger is more likely.
{BIO 17644459 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great.
{BIO 17644459 <GO>}
Yes. And I would agree as well. I'd only add one caveat to that. I think as much as
they're buying the next big thing and trying to beat the competition, I also think they
are trying to add two things. One, the customer side of it and second is that product
side, and they're trying to use that myriad and then bring more innovation into the
marketplace to keep grabbing more and more market share.
So, I really think it's about the shift from just pure operational aspects to bringing
more information and doing a better job and capitalizing on that quicker. You know,
if you think about it in the marketplace, the rate of change based on technology
right now and what it's doing to the software packages and all types of industries in
general is huge and it's much more signiﬁcant than it has been over the last 20, 30
and, let's say, 40 years.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great. So on that topic since you said the companies, the larger guys are looking to
acquire market share, you know, by basically like buying the smaller cloud guys.
What areas in enterprise software do you think are right for consolidation at this
point? And maybe, if you can talk speciﬁcally about speciﬁc segments, you know,
that you see where there is more need for consolidation?
{BIO 17644459 <GO>}
I think ﬁnance is one area. There's still an awful lot of on-prem ﬁnance and there is a
few cloud providers out there. HCM has really taken oﬀ, procurement is one that's
taken oﬀ and has a lot more consolidation to go and it's probably very behind the
times and on the areas that it needs to be in at this point of time, enterprise asset
management, you're going to see that continue, that has already gone through quite
a bit, order management has some, and then I guess CRM is a hot topic obviously
with everything that Salesforce has been doing.
Robert, did you have any other thoughts, supply chain would you want to?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 14 of 20Robert Mahowald{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
Yes. I would say, you know, obviously, we've got some -- we've got a great slide, I
wish I add in here. We've got some, what we call, functional markets, so the most
atomic size market that we have. So, for example, you know, treasury and risk is
inside of ﬁnancial management, which is inside of ERP, which is inside of application.
So, at the most granular level, there are deﬁnitely niche players who provide a piece
of the portfolio that -- that slightly bigger companies like Infor, for example, would --
or Epicor would love to be able to bring to table for the customers, but they have
not been able to aﬀord to build it before, because they haven't had enough
customers in that space.
I think that the thought was a couple or three years ago, well, we just approached
that space through partnership. When a customer ask for this, say for example, they
are doing board operations and we don't have a board operations SaaS service, but
there are lots of little players that have that, who does pick a partner among them.
I think it's been seeing gradually as less interesting for mid-size and large
organizations to do the enterprise application integration and stitch together from
various providers a set of SLAs or maybe a set of data integration or process
integration. I think they're more willing to say you know what? As much as this
partnership is okay and we get the capability we need, we would really like to see
this capability come through one dashboard in one place. And so, we do make a
tactical integration or something along those lines.
And I think with some of the messages that we're hearing is, can you buy somebody
or else build out this capability, so that we can have these all in one place. And I
think even mid-size providers, SaaS providers and ERP more broadly are starting to
say, we need to think about buying this capability that we don't know -- now
understand, because we lo and behold, we started out really small as any SaaS
provider does and we've grown to a size and now we've got more complex mid-
sized and large customers, who've got more complex needs and we need to acquire
this capability.
So some of those niche areas at the functional market level are really big. I would
say, the last piece, I would talk about are in -- our industry applications, that
companies like, you know, Epicor and Oracle and Infor particularly -- and NetSuite
had this as well. I think NetSuite built out a pretty successful oﬀering in retail apparel,
for example, and they made sequels that they had spent the last two years building
out other vertical practices.
I think the desire to get operations, manufacturing, resource, supply chain,
applications that are really in -- that really have a lot of functional domain expertise
and really were designed for particular industry, that's really an under-penetrated
segment in terms of the amount of SaaS revenue that is driven by these guys, and
they sort of started small and they've stayed small, because they're sort of in one
relatively niche space and I think as they desire to get bigger and to the broaderFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06

Mandeep Singhworld, I think a set of vendors that's above them and does, you know, though it does
more broad work is poised to buy more and more of that capability and serve their
industry customers.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
What about security? I mean, we saw one big deal this year is Symantec, Blue Coat,
but that wasn't pure-play cloud deal. Still there are so many point solution providers
in the security space, do you think that we're going to see some activity over there?
{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
You know, it's a really good question. I would say, it's possible, I'll give you a couple
of answers on that. One is, I think, when you ask customers, enterprise customers,
who is responsible for security outside of your ﬁrewall, for example, you know,
network transport, ﬁrewall, and then things like, you know, VPN transporter,
encrypted endpoint to your virtual private cloud.
For example, it sits at a provider, there is a lot of desire to push oﬀ network security
on your big ISP or VPN provider and to push oﬀ cloud security on your -- either your
SaaS provider or your core set of cloud providers, whether it's Rackspace, Google,
Microsoft, Amazon, SoftLayer, IBM.
And so to say, well, this is what happens inside of the ﬁrewall, it's something we got
to add some visibility into it, but it's not really my (Technical Diﬃculty). I think that
that's changing a little bit as companies realize that they live in a multi- cloud world
and the way they watch packets on-site is, it's got to be managed in a uniform way
and the SLAs of their core set of providers outside of the ﬁrewall don't really cover
them where they need to be covered.
So, I think if you look at as a set of, you know, sort of the DSN, I'm sorry, DNS
providers and you know, in core malware providers, I think that, you know, they're
going to be -- there's a lot of capability to buy that, but I think the really big planned
security is around -- is around that -- is around that network transport security and
network visibility of the whole network. So, for players like Akamai and Dyn, for
example, maybe, Layer 9, maybe F5 Networks. Those are the kind of players, I think
that have the kind of broad picture of security that -- just to me, it seems top of mind
to me for companies who are now trying to push into a multi-cloud world and build
the management networks soup to nuts.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Okay. And just a reminder for everyone, you can submit a question through the
webinar link. So please feel free to do that. We still have 10 more minutes. So, I just
want to move on to IT services. What kind of deals should we expect over there,
because Accenture has been very acquisitive in the last one year. So, do you see any
trends in that part?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 16 of 20Robert Mahowald
Mickey North Rizza
Robert Mahowald{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 17644459 <GO>}
So, this is Mickey. So we work with quite a few analysts who look into this space, and
in conversations with them, I think the most important thing here is that the services
guys are buying as much as they can into areas that they need and just bringing on
the workforce that they need.
When you look at some of the numbers, you know, some of the things we have
found is that, you know, Accenture has had the greatest acquisition since 2012 and
the number of acquisitions they've had. But what's really interesting as you look at
Deloitte, and over the past, I guess, 10, 15 months, they've had quite a bit of hit just in
an acquisition phase. But when you really look at it, Accenture seems to be meeting
the list with a long suite of what they've actually been buying.
So, I think you're going to ﬁnd this, it's going to continue, because they need more
and more help to help the companies as they move forward into these new
acquisitions of their technology, not only just bringing that out, but also
understanding how their business processes are going to change and really see this
continue to evolve.
Robert, I don't know if you had any other thoughts on that?
{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
Yes. I think, as all these companies, all the GSIs particularly start to use somebody
else as their back-end. So in the case of Amazon -- or in the case of Accenture with
Amazon, but -- and really -- I should really -- I should say more spread across
providers, because they've parked their assets elsewhere. I think that the focus
changes from people who do operations to developers, some people who've got
domain capability, that the practices that they have in Big Data and DX, for example,
I think to my mind, what they're buying is people who know how to do coding, and
who have got, you know, thought leadership expertise and understand where
markets are moving.
And so to buy a domain expert company is, I think, really -- somebody who
understands or maybe it's a Fed space, maybe it's a manufacturing, maybe it's retail,
really, really well, has some durable code that they can sell and, you know, I think it's
not even so important anymore whether you've got customers or whether, you know,
how you've operationalized, that's not going to matter so much anymore. They don't
need people who really run physical assets anymore.
And so I think that's -- I expect to see the order of magnitude and purchases to be
smaller to buy, just, you know, smaller teams with functional domain experience whoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06

Page 17 of 20Mandeep Singh

Mandeep Singhhave got coding ability and who understand domains really well, kind of like I -- we
talked about a little bit in the software side, what's going to be acquired, I think it's
really the domain and the industry players who are the biggest.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great. So moving on, you mentioned about Industry Clouds and I think there has
been a couple of big success stories, Veeva being one in terms of how they have
clubbed together a functional area with analytics and regulatory compliance and
really they have shown steady growth over the last few years, but in terms of their
addressable market, I mean, they're going to hit a wall at some point. So, how do
you think that Industry Cloud consolidation is going to take place in the near-term
and the long-term?
{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
Yes. To me, I think, we're actually on the other side of the curve, I think we're really at
a growth curve where we're going to see more diversity of players, you know, across
industries start to emerge, I think where the consolidation starts to happen, and it
probably will happen not so much reﬂexively.
But as growth happens, the consolidation will happen and I think players that are not
really center of gravity in their industries will start to edge out and see the wisdom of
glomming onto somebody's else's cloud. That's where that sort of the virtuous cycle
of (Technical Diﬃculty) demand is, that's where developers will want to be, and that's
where a lot of customers will place their bets.
So, I would say the consolidation will come from (Technical Diﬃculty) winnowing out
of among this -- companies that are smaller, but hope to be big and hope to be
more center of gravity in their industry by, you know, by building Industry Cloud, and
we'll see more companies that really have that kind of a, you know, huge place in
their customers' life and huge place in the industry start to sell their Industry Cloud
(Technical Diﬃculty) to not be so much concerned about the technical aspects of the
Industry Cloud, which after all will be sort of table stakes from the past perspective,
but once you understand that that's really where the action is, we always say, you
know, Industry Cloud is in platform-as-a-service, you know, for some companies,
there is really no (inaudible) there. So if you're just, not to name names too much,
but say, if you progress software and you've got a platform-as-a-service, there is
really not a tremendous burning need if you develop or to go there to make money
and there's not a tremendous burning need if you need a software that works with
your progress database environment to really go there. You really have to sort of
create that need, I think the successful entry cloud players who stay and who drive
during this transition will be the ones who create that, that they are there.

We have a question from one of our listeners. He is asking, who is best positioned to
provide cloud services to the Federal government, not only civilian side but
especially on the defense side?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 18 of 20Robert Mahowald
Mandeep Singh
Robert Mahowald{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
Yes. And I would say, this is an area we've got a whole team of government analysts
who looks at this, but don't think [ph] government with, you know, FedRAMP and a
whole host of DFCA and a whole host of other requirements, the notion to become -
- to apply for certiﬁcation or to gain certiﬁcation is a really diﬃcult tactical challenge
and it requires a great degree of physical and digital isolation on your platform, and
essentially, you know, to some degree it breaks the model of public cloud.
And so it requires, for example, Amazon to skate after that business in software and
to go after that business, it requires them to, you know, to build something net new
with the expectation that there will be more, you know, Federal government entity
business to follow, you know, once this is buildup.
So I'd just say that the hurdle is quite high and I wouldn't expect many companies to
go through the steps to become, for example, FedRAMP qualiﬁed, because what
they can always do is, is that, I think is the wise move in a platform economy is to sort
of -- is to leverage the, you know, leverage the high-cost, high capital cost back-end
and provide a set of digital services, transformation services on top of that and I
think that's a successful -- to me, it's a successful formula.
Yes. Again, but I would say that we have four or ﬁve analysts in the Government
Insights business who think about -- think and talk about the stuﬀ all the time who
will be great to talk about that.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Talking about Amazon and we can wrap up after this. Like the hyper-scale guys,
Amazon, Microsoft, Google, what can these guys acquire to, you know, further kind
of enhance their competitive positioning in the cloud, they're already dominated,
but what kind of acquisitions would the hyper-scale guys be looking for at this point?
{BIO 3499020 <GO>}
To me, they're going to be looking three years down the road. It's almost kind of --
it's kind of what they would have put into a moon-shot practice if they really thought
that they could do it or somebody wasn't already doing it pretty well. So, it's certainly
things like IoT, it's things like block-chain and I think it's getting -- it's bringing those
functional capabilities on-board. As I said earlier on, I really think that this is a race to
move a lot of customer stuﬀ to one of the big mega cloud providers and then start
to just absorb more and more of that IT spend pie. And I think understanding that,
you know, what are the complex customer problems that they don't even really know
that they have yet is what they would try to acquire for. I think, you know, I haven't
talked to the folks at Amazon and at Google and at Microsoft, particularly a lot, I think
there's a lot of something verging on hubris in terms of what they think that they can
build.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-06

Robert MahowaldAnd it's -- I think they're probably right from a technical engineering standpoint, the
level of -- I was just saying to somebody the other day (inaudible) -- to Mickey the
other day, we were talking about the team in Amazon that two people whose full
time job it is, is to fully optimize a $246 supply part.
When you get into that level of optimization and using ODM and direct-to-fab on
pretty much everything as you build, it means that you've got a sense that you can
build and create most of the services that you sell. I think that the -- as I said, it's a
two or three-year out stuﬀ that I think that they might be willing to, maybe it's
something like it's governance or message queue on the IoT side, data
rationalization, because they already have, you know, all the data warehouse
functional ﬁle object and block store kinds of pieces they would need for an IoT kind
of oﬀering. So, I think that -- I think Amazon is maybe a somewhat separate case. I
would say, Microsoft is a little bit diﬀerent.
I think Microsoft is, you know, has built up the data center capability to be a mega
scale provider, but I would put them in a slightly diﬀerent provider perspective in
that. They -- I think they can still gain from -- that they're still in the application space
unlike the other ones we've named. And I think they can still gain from buying a
security provider, a desktop virtualization provider, or buying, you know, a
application provider to have a bigger portfolio, for sure. That's what I would say.
Mickey, do you have any more ideas there?
{BIO 17644459 <GO>}
No, I think you are on the right track there. It really is where they are going in the
long-term here and it's -- as we said, it's gain for market share, how quick can we
grab it, how quick can we put it all together and what are the next steps. So, it's really
moving faster than I think even our human minds can fathom from an overall

some of the core applications providers particularly way out of the league that we've
seen from Microsoft and Salesforce and Oracle and SAP, this kind of capability

to have and be able to complete a whole workﬂow for customers around AI and that

That is something that I think is sort of a tier below mega cloud provider, but
particularly in the application space will be a big deal. And I think if you're (Technical
