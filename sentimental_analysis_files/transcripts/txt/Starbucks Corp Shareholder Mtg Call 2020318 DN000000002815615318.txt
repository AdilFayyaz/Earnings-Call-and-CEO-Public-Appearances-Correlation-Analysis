Well, good morning from Seattle, Washington and welcome to Starbucks 28th
Annual Meeting of Shareholders. I'm so pleased to have you join this webcast and I
want to open by thanking the Starbucks Board of Directors, all of whom are joining
us virtually today. And thank you to the Starbucks leadership team and all Starbucks
partners from around the world who have joined us as well.
Now, if you've attended a Starbucks Annual Shareholder Meeting in years past, you'll
notice immediately, today's meeting is a little diﬀerent. Typically, we host 4,000
people who gather together in a concert hall right here in Seattle. And we celebrate
Starbucks partners and highlight our accomplishments from the past year. We
announce exciting new initiatives and wonderful new beverage and food oﬀerings.
We romance all things coﬀee from the farmers who grow the beans, to the baristas
who handcraft the beverages. And we share business by business how we are
bringing the Starbucks brand to life. We celebrate what Starbucks stands for, a
company with a mission grounded in humanity and a purpose that goes far beyond
the pursuit of proﬁt. We put on elaborate stage production that typically includes a
special musical guest.
Well, today, we are all in a very unique moment in time. The world is grappling with a
health issue of enormous scale and great human impact as we navigate COVID-19.
And I'm sure each of you are taking actions in the best interest of your family and
your community. At Starbucks, we are a family. We are always thinking of people, of
each other ﬁrst. It's why we call each other partners and making connections overFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

place is the reason we exist.
So, this year, this week in particular, it was neither appropriate nor even possible to
gather thousands of people together in Seattle. And because we all share in this
global challenge, every person on this planet, this is a diﬀerent kind of shareholder
meeting with a diﬀerent agenda. Now, don't get me wrong. We have much to
celebrate from this past year. It was a year of great progress, a year of many
successes and a year that honored the heritage of this great company. While at the
same time, setting a bold vision for the future of Starbucks. But today, I'm sitting here
at the Starbucks Support Center in Seattle, enjoying a French press of Sumatra coﬀee
and sharing this webcast with you.
And today, I have a diﬀerent agenda. An agenda that speaks to all Starbucks
stakeholders. This includes my Starbucks partners, the hundreds of millions of
Starbucks customers around the world, the thousands of communities we serve and
our loyal shareholders.
For our customers and partners, I want to begin by sharing how we are navigating
this global health challenge in our own unique way, staying true to the Starbucks
mission and values. Navigating this challenge requires Starbucks partners to make
hundreds of real-time decisions each day in 82 markets around the world based on
three simple principles. First, prioritizing the health and well-being of our partners
and the customers we serve. You are our number one priority. Second, partnering
with local health oﬃcials and governments, as they work to contain the virus. We
together can make a diﬀerence. Third, showing up. Showing up in a positive way for
each of the 32,000 communities we are a part of. We are a responsible member of
your community.
We prioritize these three principles over everything else, including any near-term
economic implications. We do this knowing this situation is temporary and Starbucks
is resilient. Let's take China for example. Our response to the COVID-19 virus in
China began in early January. We responded to the outbreak by thoughtfully
adapting operations in our stores to protect our partners and customers. Our team
in China deﬁned elevated cleaning protocols for stores and leveraged new customer
experiences, such as contactless pickup and mobile order for pickup or delivery.
Customer and partner safety is always our priority.
And when we had to make hard decisions like closing 80% of our stores in China, we
did it without hesitation. We did it to ensure the safety of you, our customers and
partners. Our leadership team in China also ensured Starbucks partners had access
to healthcare and were paid sick time when they showed symptoms or suspected
that they had been exposed to the virus. We supported partners who were caring for
sick family members. We provided extra insurance to our partners where needed to
support them through this unprecedented time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 14As the spread of the virus peaked in China and began to show signs of mitigation,
the recovery process began. We thoughtfully reopened stores community by
community with support of local health and government oﬃcials. And as we
reopened these stores in China, we did so with elevated store protocols to ensure
the safety of Starbucks partners and our customers. And as we continue to reopen
our stores, we are helping people in every community heal, as they deal with the
emotional toll this has taken on them. They too are adapting to the realities of what
they have been through.
And today, over 90% of Starbucks stores in China are open under modiﬁed hours
and conditions, all oﬀering some degree of connection and all allowing partners in
China to do what they love, practice their craft and connect with customers over
coﬀee. Partners in China have demonstrated Starbucks resiliency at its best. And I
want to recognize Belinda Wong and Leo Tsoi for their leadership. And I want all of
our partners in China to know how proud you have made me and every Starbucks
partner around the world. You have navigated a challenging and dynamic situation
and you have created a model, a model that all Starbucks markets around the world
are now leveraging as they respond to this virus. Thank you for your leadership.
Each day, I see positive steps forward in China and I celebrate you, it's because of
you we look to the future with great optimism. We are now navigating the challenges
in this country. And Rossann Williams and her team are doing an incredible job as
people throughout North America are dealing with an acceleration in conﬁrmed
cases and adapting their lifestyles to protect their loved ones and mitigate the
spread of this virus. This is why we continue to be transparent with all of our actions. I
want you, our customers, to know that we are making decisions to protect you, your
family and our partners.
In the US and Canada, we implemented elevated cleaning protocols and new
experiences in stores that encourage social distancing through a to go model. We
also have temporarily closed stores and reduced operating hours in communities
with high clusters of COVID-19 cases as well as in high social gathering locations. We
are caring for our partners with ﬁnancial support beyond our sick leave policy for
those who are conﬁrmed or even those who may have been exposed and need to
self quarantine.
My message to our shareholders is this. We are conﬁdent in our approach because it
worked in China. And we have a strong balance sheet, great partners and the resolve
to get through this and come out stronger because of it. I believe in this company.
We take the long-term view and are optimistic about the future. My message to
Starbucks partners and customers is this. We are making decisions, hard decisions
that prioritize your health and well-being. We are making these decisions based on
science and facts. And we are staying true to our mission. A mission grounded in
humanity to inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup, one
neighborhood at a time.
That was three years ago Howard Schultz presented me with his personal key to the
Pike Place store. A key that he had carried in his pocket for decades. A key thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

Page 4 of 14represents my responsibility to honor the heritage of Starbucks, while also boldly re-
imagining our future. When Howard presented me with this key, he shared a very
important piece of wisdom, something that might sound familiar to you.
(Video Presentation)
This is an unprecedented time and we are focused on the right priorities. I know we
aren't always perfect, but I also know that through this journey, we are staying true to
our heritage as a company and we have the best interest of our customers and our
partners in our hearts on every step of this journey together. This ampliﬁes the fact
that we are a resilient company. We have overcome every challenge we have faced
over the past 49 years. And yes, we are just one year away from our 50th anniversary.
Last year, I spoke about what it takes to build an enduring company, the emotional
connection to a mission, a purpose that goes far beyond the pursuit of proﬁt and
resilience. And I want to make one thing very clear. Partners are the heartbeat of
Starbucks. And I believe they are the reason we are an enduring and a resilient
company. So as we look to our 50th anniversary and beyond, with Starbucks
partners at our core, we are pursuing a bold vision that will modernize Starbucks,
while staying true to our heritage and what we stand for.
A people positive company that works to uplift partners, so they in turn uplift our
customers and the communities we serve. A proﬁt positive company that responsibly
grows our business with focus and discipline. We are redeﬁning what it means to be
a commercial enterprise by embracing our role and responsibility in society and
humanity. This is reﬂected in our people positive aspiration. And we stand for being
a planet positive company, as reﬂected in our latest announcement around
environmental sustainability.
A little story for context. It was a year ago in the months following the Annual
Shareholder Meeting, the leadership team and I were reﬂecting on our sustainability
progress over the past year and the past decade, recognizing several
accomplishments and acknowledging several shortcomings. The question before us
was this. Are we really serious about this? And if we are, what will we do diﬀerently in
the future decades?
So we set a bold multi-decade aspiration to become a planet positive company.
When it gives more than we take from the planet and we will use our power of
connecting with and convening others, partners, customers, other companies,
experts in the industry and governments to make a diﬀerence in the world we all
share. So all this together begins to paint our vision for the future. People positive,
proﬁt positive and planet positive, the 3Ps working in harmony with our Starbucks
partners at the center, the heartbeat of Starbucks, creating a diﬀerent kind of
company for the next 50 years.
Now, the next 12 months will be full of adventure and what I call the road to our 50th,
where together we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Starbucks CoﬀeeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

rewarded with excitement and optimism for the future. And we will gather together
for the Annual Meeting and it will be a big show with thousands of people attending,
celebrating all that Starbucks stands for and looking to the future with an attitude of
optimism, knowing that Starbucks is resilient, believing in Starbucks as that enduring
company, that enduring company that stays true to our heritage, while pursuing a
bold vision for the next 50 years.
Now, I have the opportunity to introduce Rachel Gonzalez, my partner and our
General Counsel, to conduct the oﬃcial portion of this meeting, but ﬁrst, I want to
leave you all with this closing thought. We are resilient. And our partners are the
heartbeat of Starbucks. Thank you.

Thank you, Kevin. As a partner, I appreciate your leadership and courage as we
navigate through current times and also look to the future of Starbucks. I'd also like
to thank our partners, our customers and the public health heroes across the globe,
whose dedication, compassion and resilience, during these exceptionally
challenging times, has been nothing short of inspiring. Because of your commitment
to your communities and to each other, I'm conﬁdent that we will return to normalcy
in due course.
Good morning, shareholders and partners. My name is Rachel Gonzalez. I am
Starbucks General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. It's an honor to present the
formal portion of our meeting today.
We have received an aﬃdavit signed by Broadridge Financial Solutions that notice of
this meeting along with related proxy and Annual Report materials was mailed or
made available on January 24, 2020 to Starbucks shareholders of record as of the
close of business on January 10, 2020, our record date. A list of shareholders as of
the record date is available for inspection by shareholders using the registered
shareholder list link found on this webcast page. Based on the aﬃdavit from
Broadridge, this meeting is duly called with timely and proper notice. In addition,
based on the information provided by Broadridge, a quorum of shareholders is

Director of Greater China, Apple Inc.; Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, Executive Chairman,

Corporation; Joshua Cooper Ramo, Co-Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Vice Chairman,
Kissinger Associates; Clara Shih, Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Director, Hearsay
Systems, Inc.; and Javier Teruel, Retired Vice Chairman, Colgate-Palmolive Company.
The Board recommends a vote for each of the nominees.
The second item of business is the approval of an advisory resolution on our
executive compensation. The Board recommends a vote for this proposal. The third
item of business is the ratiﬁcation of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the
company's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for the current ﬁscal year
ending September 27, 2020. The Board recommends a vote for this proposal. The
fourth and last item of business is the shareholder proposal submitted by the
National Center for Public Policy Research regarding equal employment opportunity
policy risk reporting.
We will now connect with Mr. Justin Danhof, a representative of the National Center
for Public Policy Research to hear his statement. Out of respect for the other
shareholders in attendance and to allow ample time for Q&A, we ask you, Mr.
Danhof, to please limit your comments to a period of three minutes. Mr. Danhof,
you're now on the line.
Thanks so much. My name is Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy
Research and I move proposal 4, which seeks to increase diversity within the
Starbucks community. Presently, Starbucks equal employment opportunity policy
states that, quote, all partners and applicants will be treated fairly without regard to
race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, sexual
orientation, marital status, military or veteran status, gender identity and expression,
genetic information or any other factor protected by law.
We ﬁled our proposal and made a very simple request. We ask that you extend that
policy to include protections against viewpoint discrimination. That's because all
across corporate America, the political left is engaged in a ﬁerce cancel culture that
seeks to root out conservatives. As we note in our proposal, companies such as
Facebook and Google routinely ﬁre conservative employees when they speak their
values. At the 2019 Annual Meeting of Apple Shareholders, an audience member
told company CEO, Tim Cook, about her close friend who works at Apple and lives
in fear of retribution every single day because she happens to be a conservative,
what she describes as the textbook deﬁnition of a hostile work environment.
Starbucks has also previously refused request to increase the viewpoint diversity of
its Board of Directors. This signals to employees that viewpoint discrimination is
condoned, if not encouraged. And perhaps the leading cancel culture group, The
Southern Poverty Law Center has made veiled threats against any corporation thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

Page 7 of 14Rachel Gonzalezwould hire former Trump administration oﬃcials. Former Starbucks CEO, Howard
Schultz, once even berated a shareholder for his belief in adherence to traditional
marriage, a view held by billions of Christians, Jews and Muslims worldwide.
When I met with Starbucks executives regarding our proposal, I relayed concerns
that many conservatives and religious-minded Americans have had with the
company over the span of many years. I noted that in light of the company's radical
left-wing stances on environment, immigration and social justice issues, many
conservatives avoid consuming Starbucks. Further, many conservative and religious
Americans would never consider working for Starbucks. This means that the
company's left-wing policy stances are limiting Starbucks potential workforce. Our
proposal oﬀered Starbucks a means to alleviate that concern. By signaling to
conservatives that the company makes employment decisions free from viewpoint
biases, Starbucks would increase the number of Americans willing to both buy
Starbucks products and consider working for the company.
Unfortunately, my concerns and my oﬀer to help the company improve its outreach
to conservatives fell on deaf ears. So we are today calling on Starbucks investors to
do what its leaders wouldn't do. We believe that diverse workforces can think more
critically and deliver greater results for shareholders. That's a win for investors and a
win for true diversity. Please join me in voting yes on proposal 4. I thank you.
{BIO 17980657 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Danhof. A diverse and inclusive environment is critical to Starbucks
business. We seek diversity in its broadest sense in all aspects of our business.
Embracing diversity encourages innovation and allows us to succeed and to grow.
To encourage more meaningful conversations on the topic of diversity and inclusion,
we worked with Arizona State University and developed the To Be Welcoming
curriculum that is available to our partners and to the general public. To Be
Welcoming illustrates how to work through potentially uncomfortable truths of
human experience in a respectful and a thoughtful manner. This academic and
research-based curriculum is intended to help people navigate ways to engage with
diﬃcult topics, including race, gender, religion, political culture, disabilities, sexuality,
nationality and age.
Consistent with Starbucks mission and values, we celebrate diversity and we're
committed to creating an inclusive environment for our partners and for our
customers. Given our ongoing eﬀorts to support a welcoming environment at
Starbucks, our Board of Directors believes a public report detailing the potential
risks associated with omitting viewpoint and ideology diversity from our written
employment opportunity policy is unnecessary and not beneﬁcial to our
shareholders. Accordingly and respectfully for the reasons stated in our proxy
statement, the Board recommends a vote against this proposal.
That concludes the matters to be voted on as outlined in the notice of the Annual
Meeting. In accordance with our bylaws, I hereby declare the polls for voting at our
2020 Annual Meeting closed.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

tabulation, I'm pleased to report that all the director nominees were elected, each of
the management proposals was approved and the shareholder proposal regarding
EEO policy risk reporting was not approved. The ﬁnal voting results of today's
meeting will be reported on a Form 8-K ﬁled within four business days of this
meeting.
That concludes the formal business. And I now declare the meeting adjourned. We
will open the meeting for a Q&A session in a few moments. Please note that we will
answer as many questions from shareholders as time allows.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well, to take questions, I'm joined here by a few of my partners on our leadership
team. Let me introduce them to you. Over here in the far left is Pat Grismer, our Chief
Financial Oﬃcer. Sitting next to me is Rossann Williams. Rossann is President of our
North American business, US and Canada, Rossann. To my right, John Culver is
Group President of our International Channel Development and our Coﬀee -- Global
Coﬀee and Tea business. And to my far right is Rachel Gonzalez, our General
Counsel. Also joining us with audio connection is Roz Brewer, our Chief Operating
Oﬃcer.
So we have questions coming in. And so let's go ahead and take the ﬁrst question. A
number of questions related to COVID-19. I'll read the question here. The question is,
during COVID-19, how are store partners being supported if they've been diagnosed
or feel they have been exposed to coronavirus? Are they being required to come to
work? And are you paying them if you've closed their store or if they can't work?
And I commented a little bit on that in my remarks, but maybe Rossann, I'll ask you to
talk a little bit about how we are navigating this in the United States and Canada.
{BIO 18658634 <GO>}
Thank you, Kevin. We made very, very early decisions to temporarily expand our
catastrophe pay policy that has actually been in place for 20 years. And with that,
anticipating what we might face, we went out very early on to guarantee that every
single partner that was positively diagnosed with COVID-19, believe that they were
exposed to COVID-19 or even have any suspicion that they could have the virus that
we encourage them to please take 14-days of paid time oﬀ to stay home and self-
isolate. We've even extended that to partners that feel ill and not sure if they have
the virus or not that we've encouraged them to stay home for up to three
consecutive days just to make sure they have an opportunity to get tested if in fact
that was something that they wanted to do. And obviously, if we made a decision
and a diﬃcult decision to close a store, we will obviously pay for our partners, there
is -- in no way do we want our partners to have to choose to come to work, whether
they're not feeling well or whether they're afraid that we're not going to support
them in these times because that's what we do, it's we support our partners. And soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

A - Kevin Johnsonevery day, we're learning something new. And every day, we will make the
courageous proactive decisions that we need to make to make sure that our partners
and our customers are the top of safety concerns as a company and we're going to
support them through these next few months to come.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Rossann, it looks like the second question is also one for you. So I'll -- the question
that was submitted was, what are you doing in your stores to help ensure customer
and partner safety?
{BIO 18658634 <GO>}
So we learned very early on from our amazing partners in China a number of
decision logics on how we could progressively continue to increase the safety
standards in our stores. And we've been partnering with the CDC and local health
and government agencies over the past few months to ensure that the standards
that we have in our stores far exceed what the recommendations and guidelines are.
So, currently today in North America, every single Starbucks location has moved to a
to go format, meaning that our drive-throughs are open, mobile order and pay
pickup, delivery and walk-in, order, pick up a beverage and walk out of our cafes are
all being supported to reduce and support the guidelines around social distancing.
So that means if you're a customer today, that you won't see any furniture or not
access to furniture in our stores because we take our responsibility at helping make
sure that we're stopping the spread of the virus as our utmost priority.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thank you, Rossann. As Rossann mentioned, we -- much of what we're applying
around the world are lessons that we learned in China. Because in China, our team in
China began dealing with this early to mid January. And the next question is one
related to China that I'm going to hand to John Culver. The question is, are you
closing 80% of stores in China or are 80% of stores in China already closed? Can you
clarify? John?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yeah. What I would say is that early on when we made the decision as Kevin
expressed in his opening comments, we did close stores rapidly and we had up to
80% of our stores closed. We are now open for business in China. And we now have
reopened and have over 90% of our stores opened and we're committed to having
95% of our stores opened by the end of the quarter. We are welcoming customers
back into those stores and we're excited. Our partners are excited to serve our
customers and to get back into the normal routine of our customers visiting our
stores and we're optimistic on that occurring, which we're seeing.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yeah. And I'll just reinforce. I think it was two weeks ago we communicated publicly
that we anticipated having 95% of our stores opened by the end of March. And
we're well ahead of that objective and we will make that comfortably. So thank you,
John.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

Page 10 of 14A - Rosalind Brewer
A - Kevin JohnsonNext question is related to our environmental sustainability and some of the plant
based. So this question is submitted on behalf of the people for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals regarding the surcharge on non-dairy milk at Starbucks. The
question is, the company has acknowledged that the use of dairy products
constitutes a signiﬁcant portion of its carbon dioxide emissions and said alternative
milks will be a big part of the solution. If Starbucks were serious about helping to
reverse climate change, it would make this eco-responsible option more accessible
to its customers and stop penalizing customers who want to do the right thing by
charging them an extra $0.60 to $0.80 per non-dairy alternative. So my question is,
when will Starbucks put its money where its mouth is and remove the barrier to
customers choosing climate, health and animal-friendly vegan options by dropping
the surcharge on non-dairy milk? Thank you.
I'll just remind you, I touched brieﬂy on the fact that we have announced a very
broad environmentally -- sustainability agenda that we call planet positive, where we
give more than we take from the planet and that's across climate, water and waste.
And I'm going to hand this oﬀ to Roz, our Chief Operating Oﬃcer, to tell you a little
bit more about what we're doing in the menu and plant based alternatives. So Roz, if
you're there, I'll hand this one to you.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you, Kevin. Hopefully, everyone can hear me very well. So let me tell you
ﬁrst about our portfolio. So we currently oﬀer in the US almond milk, soy milk and
coconut milk. We're testing oat milk in the Chicago region, just launched that in
January. And then when you see our spring beverage promotions, you'll see plant
based alternatives within that oﬀering. And we'll continue to innovate on plant based
alternative in beverages. When it comes to beverage -- breakfast sandwiches, earlier
this month, we introduced the new Beyond Meat Cheddar and Egg Sandwich to the
Canadian stores. You will see this come to the US market, a plant based patty for the
US and we'll share more with -- when that comes available.
I do want to mention too that just as with our coﬀee, Starbucks, our goal is for
everything we sell, everything we sell to be produced under high quality and ethical
standards. For the food and the dairy we serve, this means that we have a
commitment to social responsibility standards and animal welfare as our primary
focus. So when it comes to the cost and the charges of alternative milks, the
products we oﬀer our customers and our stores are priced along -- right in line with
the broader industry. So, as you know, alternative milk costs more than dairy. And as
we experienced something very similar to what a customer would experience when
we purchase these products. So while there is no single factor in these pricing
decisions, we expect costs to come down as the supply chain for plant based
options matures and we can pass that on to our customer base, but we are watching
this very carefully.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, Roz. Appreciate that. The next question is a question regarding
some of our airport licensee with HMSHost topics. And the question is, Starbucks has
closed some locations and is moving to a go -- to a to go model at other stores dueFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

Page 11 of 14A - Rosalind Brewer
A - Kevin Johnson
A - John Culverto COVID-19 pandemic. There are airports Starbucks stores operated by Starbucks
partner HMSHost that remain open at this time. A worker at an HMSHost-operated
Starbucks at the Orlando International Airport reported that HMSHost is not
providing hand sanitizer or protective gloves to Starbucks workers. What is Starbucks
doing to make sure that HMSHost keeps workers and the traveling public who
patronize airport Starbucks safe? Roz, I'm going to hand this one to you.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Thank you, Kevin. So HMS has been a long-term partner of ours and they are
exclusive -- had been exclusive to us in our airport locations. We work together to
create our standards of operating for our partners, partners that wear the green
apron on behalf of Starbucks and our licensees. Our standards should be equal in
those stores as well as ours. We share our standards, we teach and train the partners
that you experienced in our stores in our airports and they should be following those
guidelines. As many know that as we do all the work that we do with our partners
and our licensees, we raised the standards and we expect them to operate just as
we're operating in our company-operated stores around the world.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Roz. Next question is related to our Growth at Scale agenda. And it
starts with, is the Growth at Scale agenda still intact? The answer to that is yes. But
the second part of the question gets a little deeper. It says, what was the
consideration behind licensing international markets?
And just to sort of frame this, our Growth at Scale agenda is part of -- it really is our
proﬁt positive strategy for the company and we started this several years ago by
streamlining the company. And part of streamlining the company was recognizing
that some markets outside of the US and China could be managed in a better way
by license partners to accelerate the growth that license partners are in a better
position to accelerate growth in those markets than Starbucks would. So we focus on
two long-term -- our two lead growth markets, US and China. And we're in 82
markets. So US and China, in many ways, we think of them as the -- sort of the
leaders of the Peloton, where all other 80 markets can draft right behind the
innovation that's taking place in the US and China. And so, our Growth at Scale
agenda is still intact. And over this past year, we did have a handful of markets that
transitioned from company-operated to licensed. They transitioned to license
partners that we've been partners with for many, many years.
And John, I'm going to let you comment a bit more on the international strategy.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yeah. I think when you look at the markets that we operate in and outside of the US
and China, there still is a tremendous opportunity to continue to grow the business
and increase the number of stores that we have internationally. And so, we're better
served by doing it with our license partners who have the local infrastructure, the
local knowledge and the capabilities. And a lot of these license partners, we've had
20 plus year partnerships with. And we've worked very closely with them in
expanding the territories in the countries that they're in and they have adopted ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

work very closely with them and we feel that through them, we can continue to scale
and grow at a rapid pace.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thanks, John. The next question is, how do you expect Starbucks will operate
diﬀerently coming out of the crisis based on what we have learned in China?
And as I commented, clearly, Belinda and Leo and the team in China, as they
navigated COVID-19, they developed a range of safety protocols in our stores and
basically created a model that we are now using around the world. And we know
that that model worked because we observed it in China. And I think two weeks ago,
we shared publicly that we are opening more stores in China and China was on the
uptick and that continues. So we know it works. And so we're taking that model and
sharing it both in North America as well as other markets.
So, John, you want to comment a bit more about how that's really shaping the way
we're responding to this on a global basis?
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Yeah. I think our belief as we navigate this crisis is that we will get through this crisis
and we will emerge from it stronger than ever as a company both in China, in the US
and other markets that we operate in around the world. And we are taking a long-
term view by putting our partners ﬁrst at the core of the company, ensuring their
safety and ensuring the safety of our customers, while we serve the communities.
We're working closely with the local government and health oﬃcials across all the
markets and we feel that we're going to be in a great position when the crisis ends
to emerge from this. And we're already seeing signs of that in China.
In addition to this long-term view in China, we just announced today the $130 million
investment in China for our coﬀee, roasting, warehouse and distribution facility,
which further commits us to the long-term success of that market. And we're making
similar types of investments across the company in digital, in product innovation, in
our stores and we will continue to do that to fuel the growth of the company going
forward both in China as well as outside of China.

Thanks, John. There's a question here, I'm going to hand to Pat, has to do with our
buyback strategy and the announcement that was issued today on some approval
for additional buybacks. So, Pat.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you, Kevin. First, let me clarify that this is not a buyback strategy. This is
something that we do in the ordinary course of business every 12 to 18 months. We
request Board approval of a new share repurchase authorization to replenish ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 13 of 14A - Kevin Johnson

A - Kevin Johnsonsupply of shares available to repurchase. It doesn't mean that we are necessarily
activating that new incremental authorization.
I also want to clarify that share repurchases, we view as entirely discretionary. And
depending on where we ﬁnd ourselves at any point in time, we can stop that
program. I further want to reinforce that our announcement of this new authorization
does not signal a change to our shareholder capital return program or to our
leverage policy. We remain very much committed to an investment-grade credit
rating, a BBB credit rating, as well as a leverage cap of 3 times rent adjusted EBITDA.
Now, it's true that the impacts of COVID-19 will cause us to exceed that leverage cap
for a period of time. We view these impacts to be temporary and thus we do expect
our leverage to return below 3 times lease adjusted EBITDA. So our leverage policy
is unchanged. We continue to manage our business very responsibly from a liquidity
perspective and that includes our shareholder capital return. I would also like to
highlight that yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend of
$0.41 per share payable on May 22nd to shareholders of record on May 8th. Thanks,
Kevin.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thanks, Pat. Another question Pat for you. The question is, given how much is still
unknown around COVID-19, do you have additional insights you can share about the
short and long-term ﬁnancial impact of the virus on your business? And is the
balance sheet solid? Pat?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you. There is still much that is unknown about the impact of COVID-19, but I
would say what is known is how it has impacted our China business consistent with
what we disclosed in our 8-K two weeks ago, as well as what we continue to see by
way of a recovery in our China business with each passing week demonstrating
improvements in sales. And this provides us conﬁdence that as COVID-19 impacts
our US business, that it too will have a temporary eﬀect and we will see a recovery
over time, but it's simply too early in the stage of COVID-19 in the US to speculate as
to what that recovery curve will look like.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thank you, Pat. Our last question is, with heavy competition from other local coﬀee
shops, what is Starbucks going to do to maintain its customer base?
And I'll go back to, we had -- we just came oﬀ the strongest holiday quarter in the
history of the company. And in that quarter, we grew same-store comparables, we
grew customer occasions faster than anyone else we saw out there reporting. And
the formula that we've been using to drive this growth is pretty simple. We invest in
our partners, we invest in digital and we focus on the customer experience in our
stores, we focus on beverage innovation that's relevant to our customers and that
inspires our partners and we focus on digital customer relationships. And so we
continue to focus on those three things. Those three things have driven much of ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-18

calendar 2019. And those are the same three things that we're going to continue to
invest in. They diﬀerentiate Starbucks and we know it's working and so we're going
to keep our eye on those three priorities.
So with that, it's an opportunity to just thank all of you for joining us on the ﬁrst
virtual Annual share -- Meeting of Shareholders that we've ever hosted. And I want to
thank my partners on the leadership team, and Roz who has joined us by phone for
sharing in this Q&A session. So, thank you so much for joining us and we appreciate
the opportunity to share this with you today.
