Thank you, everyone, for joining us today for the introduction. And thank you to
Dave O'Hara from Microsoft for joining us. Before we get to the good stuﬀ, please
note that all important disclosures, including personal holdings disclosures and
Morgan Stanley disclosures, here on the Morgan Stanley public website at
www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures or at the registration desk.
And from Microsoft, a safe harbor before we begin. Microsoft may make some
forward-looking statements during this presentation. Be sure to refer to their SEC
ﬁlings for risk factors relating to their business. And that's true whether you're here in
person or listening on the web.
All right, that's out of the way. So Dave, thank you for joining us. Maybe for the
beneﬁt of everyone in the room, can you give us a little bit of an introduction about
sort of who you are, your role at Microsoft, what you have purview over and a little bit
about your sort of history and tenure at Microsoft?
Sure, thanks for having me. CFO for the commercial business in Microsoft. And
commercial business, people are very familiar with what that is. My role is working
with the ﬁeld in terms of ﬁeld ﬁnance and how we expand our ﬁeld footprint as well
as Scott Guthrie on the C&AI side and Harry Shum on the AI side.

Q - Keith WeissGot it. And maybe just before we like get into the product divisions themselves, one
of the things Dave talked about was the fundamentals behind our research. We do a
lot of primary work, a lot of survey work. And one of the things that got me excited
about Microsoft and was part of that $1 trillion is in their CIO surveys over the past
couple of years, really starting three years ago, you saw a real turn in the way that
CIOs are seeing Microsoft. It went from legacy tech to something that people are
increasingly looking to invest in and they're looking to increase the wallet share of
Microsoft in their IT budgets. What do you think happened over that past 3 to four
years that's really changed that perception among CIOs that now Microsoft is a
vendor you want to push more dollars to?
Well one is I think they understand that we have a big focus on the enterprise and
that we do all the things that enterprises are looking for. We provide great security.
We're a trusted provider. I think we have a breadth of software that they're interested
in. And so they look at Microsoft as being more of a one-stop shop. One of the
things we hear from a lot of customers is, "I don't want all these one-oﬀ solutions. I
just want a person I can go to." And I think that Microsoft represents the closest
they're going to get to that. And so we see that. I think that we really started seeing a
pickup in our cloud when we came out with our hybrid strategy and thought it was --
we have all these customers that have big Microsoft footprints plus they also want to
move to the cloud. But they want to do it on their time frame and they want to do it
in a way that works for them. And how do we best help them do that? And that's
when we came out with a hybrid strategy that you can be on-prem, you can be
cloud, you can be a mix of both and you can do it on your timeline. And I think that
just really resonated with a lot of customers.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Then that hybrid strategy is pretty diﬀerentiated from the other big cloud
vendors, like an Amazon or a Google in the cloud...
Yes, I think it's something that Microsoft uniquely can do and others can't make the
same oﬀer. There are companies out there that are partnering together and trying to
come up with sort of a mocked-up hybrid strategy. But I feel like we literally have a
lot of the on-prem footprint and a lot of the cloud footprint. And we can just help
them make a smoother transition. And so that is uniquely a Microsoft value
proposition.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Before we dive into the hybrid side of the equation, I want to start with Azure.
Azure is probably the part of the portfolio I get the most questions about. And the
fundamental question that people are trying to understand is the durability of that
growth in Azure. How long could these really impressive growth rates continue? Now
we're beginning to use really big scales in terms of how big that business is. Can you
talk to us about how you think about the growth trajectory of Azure? And what areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

Page 3 of 16A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'Harasome of the key customer drivers at this point? What's driving more and more
customer demand to that platform?
Sure. And if you start at the meta level, every decision we make generally starts out
with how do we think about total adjustable market? And every year, our total
addressable market for the cloud gets bigger. I remember when we ﬁrst started
doing this, it was -- we had a certain number. And each year, we just keep growing
that number. And from my perspective, the total addressable cloud market is going
to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. And so I look at the opportunity and
say every year, it gets a little bigger. And every year, we seem to be able to expand
our footprint. And so we feel good about the -- having a lot of runway in the cloud
for starters. The one -- the messages that are really resonating, at ﬁrst, it was we
heard a lot of customers say, "Should I go to the cloud? Should I not go to the
cloud?" They're well past that. Every customer needs a cloud strategy. Then they're
saying, "How should I think about the cloud? And what workload should I move
over?" And they're doing some basic things like storage and compute and just trying
to get aligned on how they think about the cloud. And now they're much deeper. We
see them much more interested in things like security. With our EMS oﬀering, we see
them interested in. How do we think about AI? How do I think about IoT? They're just
much more advanced. And I think before, it's safe to say that we were really selling
and encouraging folks to move to the cloud. And now in some ways, they're pulling
us. They have a lot of innovative ideas. And even when you see a lot of the disruption
in the industry, I think some of the newer companies are coming in and disrupting
some of the old players and older players. And so we see them coming to us and
saying, "Help me develop a cloud strategy. Help me get modern and current." And
so I think it's sort of -- I don't know if I can go as far as to say limitless. But there is a
lot of runway. One of the things about the cloud, if you're selling an oﬀering that is
sold per seat, there is eﬀectively a limit on the number of people in the world. And
so there's a sort of, for lack of a better word, a cap on sort of a per seat oﬀering. But
on a cloud oﬀering, there's literally no cap. You can take any workload you want and
move it to the cloud. And so I think it's just really hard for anybody to say how big it's
going to get, other than I'm conﬁdent it's going to get bigger.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Can we dig in a little bit in terms of what workloads are running in Azure right
now? Any kind of visibility you could give us into? Is it net new workloads that
people are building up natively onto Azure? Are people moving on-premise
workloads into the public cloud environment and into the Azure environment? Any
kind of visibility you could give us to what people are doing in that Azure
environment?
Yes. We would divide it into a couple of huge categories. One is just migration,
migration of existing workloads over to the cloud. And we see a lot of people doing
that, again storage, compute but even some of the heavier biz apps moving over
into the cloud. And so a lot of the stuﬀ that they're doing on-prem now, they can run
more eﬃciently in the cloud and get more scale. And so we do see a lot of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'Haramigration work going on. We also see a lot of innovation work on both migration
and innovation. Databases are a big thing. So our Cosmos DB oﬀering, our SQL
database oﬀering, those are pretty popular. So it's both. A lot of times, people just
want to migrate, get going and then start innovating from there. But increasingly,
we're seeing folks saying, "Wait a minute, if I'm going to move all this stuﬀ to the
cloud, that's a great opportunity for me to optimize. And so let's optimize and
migrate at the same time." Then they can innovate from there. So it's both. Those are
the 2 major categories that we see.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And when a customer is going to migrate an existing workload into the public
cloud environment, they're using compute, they're using storage, do you still see the
up-sell of the additional higher-value solutions around that? Or do those workloads
tend to cap out at just compute and storage?
So we deﬁnitely see a lot of up-sell. And one of the things that we're ﬁnding, even in
the sales environment as we transform our ﬁeld, is you need to be able to create that
3-year arc, that story that says, "Here's how you ought to think about moving to the
cloud as a company." And they really want to know, "Give me some sense of what
the end game is." So it's not just moving workloads over and trying to save money.
It's like, "What are we really trying to accomplish? And where are we really trying to
get?" And so we work with them on, "Here are diﬀerent ways you could transform
your business and here's how that could work in the cloud and here's how it could
all be connected and here's how you would get better data and here's how you
could then use that data to serve customers better." And so you need to have that
holistic story and they need to know where they're going. Then I think once they get
a better sense of where they're going, it's easier for them to say, "Okay, now I get it.
Now I have a roadmap and we can start moving that stuﬀ over." And there is an end
state in mind. So for us, it's really important to be able to tell that story and paint that
vision of what the end state could be. Then as I said, I think it's sort of interesting that
we -- before, it was a lot of us doing educating and selling. And now oftentimes, it's
customers pulling us forward and saying, "Hi. how about this? How about if I try
that?" And so they're just being much more innovative, I think so.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So it just looks like a lot of the guys on my side of the fence, when we're thinking
about that sort of where we are in the transition of public cloud. And maybe
oversimplifying it, because we look a lot at sort of percentage of workloads that run
in diﬀerent environments. What percentage are people running on on-premise of
environments? And what percentage are people running on sort of public cloud
environments? And we judge growth by kind of net new workload growth plus the
migration to the public cloud. But it sounds like there's like a third vector we've got
to be thinking about of when those workloads get there, there's additional
monetization of those workloads in the public cloud of sort of -- that have migrated.
There's a functionality vector that we should be thinking about.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

Page 5 of 16Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Keith WeissYes, I think even if you were -- if you're going to pick a category, IoT, for example, I
think IoT is still very undeﬁned and how we think about the Edge and how we think
about all the devices out there that could beneﬁt from being connected to the cloud
is almost literally limitless. I mean, any of the devices in this room are all connected
to the cloud already. But even just devices, if you walk out into any retail outlet, I
think all of those are potential cloud opportunities whereas before, they were just
devices. And all of that, in addition to compute, that can get into data analysis and
how you think about better serving customers. And so it's just really hard to put a
ﬁnger on how big it's going to get because I think there are untapped opportunities
out there that people haven't even thought of yet. So I do think there are additional
monetization opportunities that just haven't been identiﬁed or aren't being
monetized yet.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. You talked a little bit about some of higher-value services, like Cosmos DB on
the data side. You talked about security. Where are we with the sort of AI, machine
learning functionalities? Are those actually being utilized in any big way today? Are
they being sort of woven into sort of new application development or older
applications? Or is it really too early for that to get into real mainstream adoption?
Yes. When I think about something like AI, from my perspective, there's a few
diﬀerent ways you could monetize that. One is you build AI into all the existing apps
that you have and it makes them better. And people are feeling like they're getting
new additional value for the apps that they're already consuming and paying you for.
And so I think there is a piece of that. And we'll see that with a lot of the integration
between the products that we have today. Two is a lot of companies just want to
understand like, "What is possible, what can I do?" And so either through our own
MCS or through a partner organization, you basically get into a consultant contract,
where you're helping them drive the innovation and build out the business. And so I
think there's a big services component because it isn't just the tech, it's also the
thinking around the tech and how do you evolve your business. And so I think for
partners and for us, there's a big services component. And that's going to help drive
some revenue. Then there's just folks who want to consume stuﬀ on a sort of a per
byte basis. And we have services available, where they can just pay as you go and
consume what you want. And that can be a monetization strategy as well. So I think
it's all of those. And all of those just add up to an expanding TAM.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. I think the biggest investor concern when it comes to sort of Azure and in the
public cloud in general is the risk of commoditization, that you have these big
vendors putting a lot of capital to work. Are they going to be able to diﬀerentiate
their solutions over time? Is there going to be a diﬀerentiation that Microsoft brings
to the market in their Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service that can
sustain that price? Or are we going to have a race to the bottom in terms of cheap
compute, cheap storage but just run in the cloud-based environment? How do you
think about diﬀerentiation for Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service
and maintaining those price points for Microsoft longer term?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'HaraYes, I think for us as a company, it's our obligation to keep delivering value on top of
the core storage and compute. And I think we're doing a good job of that. I think AI
is one of the examples. IoT is another example. But even EMS and security, we
continue to expand our security oﬀerings. All of that is both on top of the cloud
dynamics. People are always asking about how do we think about our dynamic
strategy. Oﬃce is a great SaaS oﬀering. And so if we -- I would agree that you ought
to be in more than just the storage and compute business. You have to be adding
value on top of that. And PaaS typically has better margins than IaaS and the SaaS
stuﬀ has much better margins and is really sticky. And so I think it's incumbent on us
to make sure that we're driving that value-added service on top. And I think as long
as we're doing that, people will pay us for it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Then just one last one on Azure. In terms of sort of the gross margin proﬁle,
overall, cloud gross margins have been trending up really nicely over the past
couple of years. Most recent quarter is ahead of our expectations. Amy was here two
years ago. And she talked about sort of Azure gross margin scaling in line with what
we've seen from like AWS at similar scale. Does that still hold true? Do you still think
you could sort of align to sort of what we've seen with AWS over time?
Yes, I think it still holds true that we've already said that we'll have -- we believe we
could have the same gross margin proﬁle as AWS did at that point in time. The
reality is both businesses are getting really big. And I think that you reach a point
where you sort of hit the (chronicle) gross margin number. We don't think we're
there yet. We still think we have some room for improvement. But I do think that
eventually, you get to a point to where you say, "Gross margins are going to start to
at least moderate. The gross margin growth is going to start to moderate." But we
still feel like we have some good runway on that.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Shifting back to the hybrid discussion, how well do you think sort of that
hybrid positioning can help you guys diﬀerentiate against an AWS and a Google?
And are you seeing that diﬀerentiation actually win you guys deals today?
We certainly see the diﬀerentiation and we see the hybrid message landing. I think
for us, the primary beneﬁt for customers -- there's 2 primary beneﬁts for customers.
One is it's cheaper that way because they don't have to pay for stuﬀ twice. And so if
we have the hybrid oﬀering and they're paying on-prem and they want to move to
the cloud, they can move their Windows Server licenses to the cloud and they're
covered. And so it's certainly a cheaper option for them. Two is I think that from their
timeline perspective, it gives them a lot more ﬂexibility. And one of the things that
companies said to us all along is, "Hi. we made this big investment in the current
infrastructure and we don't want to just throw that out and move. How do we thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Keith Weissabout that?" And so I think being able to allow them to continue to run in the current
infrastructure and get a cloud, be able to expand in the cloud is what they really like
about it. But it's on their time frame, not our time frame. And that's the good news
for them.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And I think that ﬂexibility has been expressed -- or at least Satya and Amy
talked to us a lot about it in terms of the Azure hybrid use beneﬁt, which is a
contracting methodology for customers. Can you talk to us about exactly what that
is, how it sort of gives that ﬂexibility to the customer? And any sort of ﬁnancial
impacts we should be thinking about as investors looking at the results on how sort
of the rise of those hybrid use beneﬁts show up on the income statement?
Sure. So basically, hybrid use beneﬁt says if you have licensed Windows Server or
SQL Server and if you're current on your contract, then you can run those licenses in
the cloud. And if they're going run those licenses in AWS, for example, they're going
to -- AWS, they're going to pay us for additional license to run those in an AWS
environment. What we said is, "Look, if you've already paid Microsoft, then you could
run them in Azure for no additional cost." And so that's why it's cheaper. That shows
up in our income statement largely on the on-prem revenue. The question we keep
getting asked a lot is how we should be think about Windows Server growth and
Windows Server on-prem growth? And I think there's a perception that for a while,
that that was going to start decreasing materially. And we have obviously seen
decent growth in our on-prem number. And part of it is because the hybrid oﬀering,
just the way we structured, will show up as on-prem revenue when, in fact, it's tied to
a cloud oﬀering. But we try to stay pretty pure in terms of how we account for it. And
so that stays on the on-prem side for the most part.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So if the customer eventually shifts SQL Server licenses into the cloud, does it still
stay on-prem? Or do you have to shift that revenue?
Right now, the way that we're accounting for those is on-prem revenue. And I think
that's how we would continue to account for them. I'm looking at my IR person to
make sure I don't script that answer. But yes, that would be on-prem revenue.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And you mentioned the concerns that people have around Server & Tools.
Part of it comes from sort of an expectation that sort of on-premise server shipments
are going to be slowing down, go negative. And Windows Server is tied to server
shipments, right? How concerned should we be about sort of declining server
shipments into on-premise environments negatively impacting the broader Server &
Tools business for Microsoft?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'HaraWell our Server & Tools business is very healthy as people have seen in some of the
numbers. We reported a good, solid Q2 and we feel good about the outlook for the
Intelligent Cloud business. And so we're -- we still feel like the demand is there.
We're still conﬁdent that customers are going to continue to purchase those
products. The way that we look at it, going back to the gross margin question for a
second, it's obviously in our former world, gross margin was very high simply
because we were shipping CDs and the cost of that is lower than building a data
center, for example. But we also feel like that's much more than oﬀset by the
expanding cloud opportunity. And so the way that we look at it, yes, gross margin
percentage is important. But really what we also think is at least equally important is
the gross margin dollars that are driven by the business. Because as we continue to
expand in the cloud, the gross margin opportunity from an absolute dollar
perspective is much more material. And so we feel like the gross margin shifts will
settle out and we'll end up with good dollar gross margin growth as well as continue
to drive up the percentage of gross margin in the cloud.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So really asking the question a little bit of a diﬀerent way, like what has been
the drivers? Like you mentioned hybrid cloud. But hybrid use advantages, you guys
started talking about it a lot last year. That business has been growing mid-single
digits for quite some time. What's been the core driver of that on-premise Server &
Tools business?
Yes. Well I think the core driver for on-prem has been the continued build-out of
data centers and how people think about using Windows Server in the data centers.
And one of the things we said all along is that we were continuing to do our own
geographic footprint build-out of data centers. But others have as well. And so
Windows Server is a pretty popular product. And as people license that for the data
centers, you know that's going to continue to drive the growth of the business. The
question we get is how long will that continue? And I don't see the cloud's role
getting any smaller anytime soon. And I do think there is some eﬃciencies to be
gained. But I generally think growth will continue.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Can you talk a little bit about Azure Stack and sort of what's the problem for
the customer that Azure Stack is looking to solve in particular? And what kind of
traction have you guys seen in Azure Stack? I think it really ﬁrst rolled out last year.
What kind of traction have we seen with that solution thus far?
Yes, Azure Stack really is intended for customers that, one, maybe they want a little
bit more control and so they want Azure Stack in their environment, where they have
more control over it. And it has some access to the cloud. But it's sort of intermittent.
The other one is that there are -- the example -- there are examples where folks justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

A - David M. O'Haradon't always connected. So for example, if you take a cruise ship that maybe
connected or not connected, you still need to be able to run that environment,
whether you're connected to the cloud or not. And so what we're trying to do is give
people the comfort that they will both be in control of their environment and they'll
be able to continue to run their environment, whether they're connected or not. And
so for some industries, that means a lot. They need to be able to have those features.
And so it's early days for Azure Stack. We've had good customer demand. If
anything, the one thing we -- the one thing customers like is they have choice. So
they don't feel like they're forced into one decision or another. And so Azure Stack is
just a choice that they can make. A lot of times, they'll look at it and say, "You know
what, I'm comfortable going to the cloud anyhow. And let's just see that." But they
like the fact that they have that option if they want it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Is this something that we should think about in terms of impacting the
ﬁnancials from what we see yet? Or is it still too early days?
I think it's too early to really see any material impact. We just look at it as part of our
broader cloud oﬀering. Plus the important thing is to be able to give customers that
choice across a range of options for the cloud. And Azure Stack is just one of those
choices.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. In terms of just looking at sort of the ﬁnancials, you have the end of support
for SQL Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008. Did those end of supports have a
signiﬁcant impact on -- do you expect another signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnancials?
So I wouldn't say there's a signiﬁcant impact. I just think that for us, the key is to make
that a smooth transition for customers. And so we're working with all of the
customers on that now. And I don't expect to see material ﬁnancial growth from it.
But we do want to make sure that as they transition, that, that's a good experience
for them and they continue the path. So I think it's more about just taking care of
existing customers.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Okay. So it just sounds like -- and you guys talk about a percentage of commercial
revenue coming from recurring sources. It bounces around between like 85% and
90%. Since so much is on recurring. So much is tied up in these over-time contracts
that these individual product life cycles just aren't going to have as much of an
impact on the ﬁnancials. Is that...
Yes, I think that's right. I mean, our recurring number, the last one was pretty close to
90%, plus or minus. And so it's just continuing to migrate customers as they moveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

any of net new.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. I want to talk about the competitive environment in hybrid. We touched on
this a little bit. But it seems like there's been a lot of motion in that over the past year
as I think more and more people are starting to realize that these hybrid
architectures are going to be the mainstay for most large enterprises. So you've seen
responses to sort of Microsoft's strong positioning. AWS came out with their
Outposts oﬀering. Is that anything that you're seeing in the marketplace today? Or is
it too early to see Outposts?
Well we see it in some sales environments. But I would say it's early days for that as
well. I think the beneﬁt for us on the hybrid oﬀer is we have big share and a big
presence in on-prem already. And so as we come out with a new oﬀering, a lot of
times, they're cloud versions of the old oﬀerings. And so the transition is just much
smoother, it's not something anybody needs to ramp up or get going on. And so for
us, having that existing footprint as well as the new footprint and having them, in
many cases, near each other is super helpful because it's just an easier experience
for the customers. Then we come in and add on all the new stuﬀ and so that's a
growth opportunity for us. And I think some of the other cloud vendors just don't
have that existing footprint. And so they're trying to come out with oﬀerings that, in
some way, mimic or mirror that. But we feel like that -- those are our customers
already and they're using our stuﬀ already and so we can make that a better
experience for them.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
But I guess, one could argue that the AWS relationship with VMware is trying to do
that. They've got VMware and your on-premise environments already, something
you're comfortable with. Now you could run VMware in a public cloud environment
on AWS. So you have that kind of a familiar interface, a familiar solution portfolio just
running in a public cloud environment. Is that more of a credible threat for the
hybrid cloud storage from Microsoft?
Well I think AWS is a very -- obviously a very formidable competitor. And we have a
lot of respect for AWS. And that's exactly what that's intended to do. I just think it's
still 2 companies, we're 1.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Okay. So 2 companies that are looking to become 1, IBM plus Red Hat. So a similar --
at least in terms of sort of how they're positioning that acquisition to investors, IBM

As you guys compete with Red Hat a lot on the operating system side of the

Q - Keith Weissthat's really going to change the competitive dynamic for you, seeing that 2 of those
vendors get together?
Well we -- a few years ago, we really started developing a much better relationship
with Red Hat. And right now, half of our VMs are Linux. And so we feel like we do
have a very open source presence. And a lot of customers again want a mixed
environment. They don't -- they want both open source and more of an existing
vendor mix. So we want to continue our relationship with Red Hat. We think it's been
very beneﬁcial. And I think we're conﬁdent that we can continue to make that work
for customers. I think it's in our interest, I think it's in Red Hat and IBM's interest to
continue to work closely together. And so I see that continuing.

Got it. I want to switch back to broader cloud gross margins again. One of the ways
that we think about sort of cloud gross margins is kind of there's a two-step function
that we do in our model of we have this view over how much CapEx investment is in
sort of expanding the footprint, expanding that global footprint now for cloud
(investing). How much is spent on ﬁlling up the data centers? Then within that,
there's a utilization function of how eﬀectively are you utilizing that CapEx within the
data center? Is that a fair kind of framework to think about the cloud gross margin
story?
Yes, I think that's a fair framework. And we did, a point in time, a couple of years ago,
when we were getting a lot more questions about cloud gross margin, we said, "Hi.
we were playing catch-up. We got started in the game a little late. We had to expand
our geographic footprint in a pretty accelerated way." We went and did that. There's
a lot of money that goes into that land and data centers and networking and all the
other things that go into building out a data center. We do feel like we have good
geographic presence now. We feel like we have the best global presence as a cloud
provider. And so I think that's when we started seeing some of the growth in our
cloud gross margins is when we were focused on driving eﬃciencies. Rather than
driving a geographic expansion, we were more focused on, "Okay, we've built out a
lot of the cloud. Now how can we get more eﬃcient at it?" And we started more of
VMs per server and we're doing all kinds of good stuﬀ that was really driving
improvement in gross margins. At the same time, it's a very competitive market. And
AWS and Google are both very -- we're all very focused on delivering the best price
for the customers. So at the same time that prices are coming down, we're driving
eﬃciencies. And the key for us is to make sure that you're driving eﬃciencies faster
than gross margin or faster than prices coming down. So you can still expand gross
margin. And we feel like that's where we're at in the game.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And how should we think about the potential to drive further eﬃciencies? I'm
assuming that this is tech, this is your tech or your software running on top of yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25

A - David M. O'Harahardware. So there's still probably a lot of eﬃciencies that you could grind out of
that plan.
Yes, I think there's still some to be had. And I also think there's a lot of expansive
growth that we've talked about. The other thing I would say is you eventually hit the
law of large numbers, which is they're going to be pretty big numbers. Now I don't
see that abating anytime soon. But ultimately, we'll get to a point to where I think
that will all start to moderate. But right now, we feel like there's still good growth and
still good eﬃciencies to be had.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. One of the things that came up over the last quarter, there was -- it seemed
like a disconnect between there's a lot of data points that investors are getting out of
component suppliers and OEMs that ship into hyperscale cloud vendors like
yourself, talking about sort of weakness in demand trends and sort of those
shipments coming down. But all of the cloud vendors, including Microsoft, saw really
good demand trends in terms of sort of Azure growth was dead stable in terms of
76% growth. Your CapEx numbers are still really strong. What's the disconnect? Why
are we getting -- I don't want to say a bad read. But why is there sort of this timing
diﬀerence between what we see from the component suppliers versus kind of what
we see in your demand trends and your revenue trends?
Well I think part of it is that as we move through time, there is eﬃciencies that we
drive in our core fabric, for example, where we can get more utilization out of a
server or more utilization out of our networking or bandwidth. And so we -- if you
look at it over a series of quarters or even years and our core fabric gets better, we
can do more with the same amount of hardware. And so I think that maybe even
though the cloud market continues to expand as fast or faster than it has, I think from
the equipment perspective, we're just getting smarter about how we use it and how
we -- what that utilization looks like. And so I don't know if I'd call it a disconnect, I
would just say that I'm not sure the growth rates are the same for those industries
simply because we get better utilization out of the hardware than we used to. So it's
not linear.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Shifting gears to developers, one of the -- actually, I always had a very fond
relationship with developers and a good relationship with developers. But one of the
biggest news items of 2018 was the acquisition of GitHub, which is squarely aimed at
sort of that developer community and further fostering that relationship. Can you talk
to us for a little bit about why GitHub? Why was that such an important acquisition
for Microsoft and how that impacts for the Azure side of the house, if you will, as sort
of an environment where you want these developers to be building their stuﬀ?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 13 of 16Q - Keith Weiss
A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Keith WeissThat's right. So we're very happy with the GitHub acquisition. In the same spirit of
even when we talked about the Red Hat partnership, we started developing a good
relationship with GitHub years ago. And Satya and Scott Guthrie, for example, both
were very involved and were frequently meeting with the GitHub management team.
So when the opportunity came up to acquire GitHub, it's not like it was brand-new to
us. We clearly had an existing relationship. And customers were seeing beneﬁts from
it. The management teams knew each other. And we had -- so we had that strength
there. And so when the opportunity came up, we said exactly what you said, which is,
"Hi. 30 million developers, 30 million-plus developers." Lots of good news for how
we think about Azure. But mostly, it was about how do we really embrace that
developer community. And I think Satya has been clear in articulating that when we
look at acquisitions, we really look at it from a community perspective, like is there a
community we can serve? Is there a community that could beneﬁt from our cloud?
But even with GitHub, we're very committed to making sure that GitHub is a
presence on all major clouds, not just Microsoft Cloud. Now I do think that as we -- as
the companies work together even more, there's an opportunity to educate them on
Azure and how they should think about developing apps on top of Azure. And so we
will certainly be promoting Azure to the GitHub community, to the GitHub
developers. But really, it's whatever cloud they want to build on, we're going to
support that. And so I think for us, it's more about having that community and
growing that community. And if there's beneﬁt to Azure, that's great. But GitHub is its
own -- has its own strength among its developers.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Shifting gears again to Oﬃce 365. The commercial sort of move to Oﬃce 365
has been, I'd say, one of the big successes for Microsoft over the past three years
from our work from the outside in. And I think you guys would agree that more than
half of the kind of units out there, the seats out there that were in Oﬃce on-premise
have moved over to Oﬃce 365. How should we be thinking about the world
trajectory on Oﬃce 365 on a going-forward basis? You're past the peak in terms of
units. Is there enough pricing on the other side of the hill, if you will, to sort of sustain
the type of growth that we've been seeing in that Oﬃce 365 business?
So I think there's a few vectors in terms of how we think about Oﬃce 365 growth.
One is we have said we're sort at the halfway point or a little past that in terms of
moving customers over. But that's still a big growth opportunity for us even though
we're sort of at that point. Two is with our E5 oﬀerings, for example, we think there's
technology and services that we can provide that maybe replace some of their
existing services or maybe augment their existing services. And so as we look at E5
as a new SKU, I think there's some ARPU opportunity to really go beneﬁt from
customers taking advantage of that stack. Then third is we continue to push into the
SMB space. And I still think there's more seat penetration there. The ARPU may not
be the same. But it's still strong and solid. And so we look at it as the existing
customer base, how do we think about new SKUs like E5 and then how do we think
about SMB. All of those are growth vectors for Oﬃce.

Page 14 of 16A - David M. O'Hara
Q - Keith Weiss

Q - Keith WeissGot it. So if we think about pushing ARPU higher over time, what should we think is
more likely, that we're going to see an E7 SKU coming out than corporate given
more functionality that we're not thinking about today, maybe we drop an E1 SKUs to
push guys further up-market and force them onto the E3 or E5 or just price increases
start to roll through on the Oﬃce 365 days?
Yes. We're -- I would say that taking those in sort of random order, we feel like
customers beneﬁt from the E1 SKU. And so as long as customers beneﬁt from that,
we're still going to continue to have that oﬀering. I do think there's always new
functionality that we can add to Oﬃce. Teams is a great example. We have a great
adoption of Teams as a tech. And we personally all use it internally and are very
happy with how we think about Teams. And so I do think if we're going to say which
of those is most likely, it's more likely that we're going to add new tech to the current
Oﬃce oﬀering and then we'll just ﬁgure out the best strategy for that for customers
and for monetization. And so we don't look at Oﬃce and say, "We should be taking
prices up that side." That's not a focus for us. We're more focused on adding value to
the customers -- to the existing oﬀering for customers, both new and current. So I
would say if those are the 3 choices, we're more likely to add oﬀerings in tech.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Then on the -- you mentioned further expansion in terms of a potential user
base. And I'm assuming you're talking about the F1 SKU.
Yes.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
And can you talk to us a little bit about where that's let you take Oﬃce 365, the value
proposition you're giving to these front-line workers and, I mean, your perspective
about sort of the number of users? That's a huge expansion of potential number of
users outside of just the core information workers.
It's a big expansion in terms of number of users. The monetization is obviously very
diﬀerent. But we do think that it's the whole diﬀerent users that we maybe haven't
had before because, for whatever reason in the old world, Oﬃce was seen as being
tied to a PC. And now it doesn't need to be tied to a PC, it can be any simple mobile
device. It can be any type of user. And I think the more users that we get in an
organization that are using Oﬃce in some way, shape or form, the more loyal they're
going to be to Microsoft. And so that really what that's about is getting an expanded
presence in the customer base.

A - David M. O'HaraYou've signed a lot of recent deals with some large companies. ExxonMobil was last
week but also Walmart, Kroger, Walgreens, Gap, et cetera. Do you view this as an
evolution of relationships with existing customers or more moving, transformative,
large deals?
Yes, I would say that the good news for Microsoft is almost any company is a
customer in some way, shape or form. And so a lot of times, it's an existing customer.
But it's an existing customer going through a whole new opportunity. So we need to
basically reframe the conversation. I personally get to spend a lot of time on those
deals, on the bigger deals. And they're super exciting for both the customer and for
us. But they're also looking to us to sort of lead the way. And so there's -- for us,
there's an existing customer that renews and goes through the process of just
continuing to be a customer. And there is the existing customer that says, "I need to
think about things completely diﬀerently. And how should I do that? And how should
I think about that?" So it's both. It's like, "Hi. we want you to continue to be a
customer. But we're here to help you drive through that transformation." In addition
to Exxon, we announced our deal with Walgreens and we have the deal with
Walmart. And we have lots of big companies out there that want to move into the
new world. But it also means that they're continuing with our existing relationships.
So it's both in those cases.
Could you just talk about how the gaming business will integrate with the cloud
going forward and where you see the opportunities there?
Yes, I'm sorry, you said which business?
The gaming business, the video gaming business.
The game business? For us, we've been in gaming for a long time. And we've
watched gaming evolve into more of a cloud business and sort of away from
hardware and more into how we think about cloud. The good news is that while the
percentage of users that are in gaming is small, the ones that are there are intense.
And so we see gaming as being a growth business for us. And how would I describe
it? We're in the unique position of sort of like with SaaS software and running IaaS
and PaaS in gaming, we also have the core oﬀerings as well as the infrastructure. And
so I think that puts us in a unique position to optimize that and also to give a lot of
choice to the gamers. But having said all that, a lot of the gaming companies that
have the most popular titles are all running with us because they know that we canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-25
