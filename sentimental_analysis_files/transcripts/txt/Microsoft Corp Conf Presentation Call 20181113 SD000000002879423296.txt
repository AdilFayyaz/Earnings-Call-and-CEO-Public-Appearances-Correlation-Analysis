Good morning, everyone. I'm Jen Lowe. I cover the U.S. Software Group here at UBS.
And with us this morning we have Chris Capossela from Microsoft, CMO and EVP
Marketing and Consumer Business is your title. But may be before you jump in, you
could just give us a quick overview of your areas of responsibility at Microsoft and
then we can jump oﬀ from there.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes, Great. Well. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being here. So my name is
Chris Capossela. And I essentially have 2 kind of hats. I get to look after marketing
for Microsoft. And so that means our pricing and packaging and naming and
positioning and messaging and advertising and communications, all of the classic
things we think of when you think about marketing, including pricing which often
isn't in marketing. I do that across the company. Then I also look after a few sales
organizations at Microsoft one -- mostly having to do with consumer or in small
business-oriented products. So our Microsoft retail stores and our store -- our online
store, which is quite large. The sales teams that call on are OEM partners like HP, Dell
and Lenovo. And then our large retail partners around the world like a Best Buy and
an Amazon and a Walmart. And also a sales team that looks after competing with
Google selling Bing Advertising to marketers like myself. So a marketing hat for the
company and then a few of the sales teams that have particular areas of focus.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And even though it's a good place to start because they think one of
the things that's really impressed people over the last few years is the brand
transformation at Microsoft and just -- investor perceptions but also market
perceptions have shifted fairly dramatically, can you talk a little bit, because we've
seen other companies try and make that shift from being a successful client server
company, PC era company to being a successful brand in the cloud? And most haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13

Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Lowereally struggled to do that. Microsoft is certainly the shiny example of success. So can
you just talk a little bit about how that happened and what the mindset was?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. It's interesting. It doesn't always feel like the shiny example if successful, while I'll
take it. But it's a journey. Every day, we're trying to make progress and there's a lot
more room to go, I would say. I think there's a couple of things that have helped us
transition from the sort of old Microsoft to the new. One is certainly product. I'd love
to take credit for it as the marketer. But having real product truth when it comes to a
cloud platform that does things that the other major cloud platforms don't do,
obviously, helps tremendously, because when customers see what they can do, in
our case, the hybrid cloud is really an incredible structural advantage that we have in
its true diﬀerentiation for us. So now the marketing job is relatively easy and telling a
diﬀerentiated story. When you have product truth and people can say "Wow, Azure
can really do things that others can't," then that helps tremendously and changes
people's perceptions of the company. So that's one awesome asset. When we take a
business like Oﬃce and move it from a licensed device-based business and make it
a cloud subscription that we update monthly, that is -- that just changes people's
perceptions. So it's incredible. More than half of our Oﬃce revenue is now done as a
subscription product, not as a transactional device-oriented license sale anymore. So
business model changes, product truth, they help tremendously. I would say that
Satya has really made Microsoft a mission-driven company. We have this simple
mission of trying to empower every person and every organization on the planet to
achieve more. And I think that we've embraced that more deeply than anyone felt
we would. And we operate more as a single company than we ever have in the past.
And it sounds trite or easy. But to live that mission actually takes real work. And one
of the most fundamental things that I don't think people yet understand about
Microsoft is we make that mission come true in the business model we've moved to,
which is a consumption-based business model. We used to be a licensing machine.
Now we are driven by consumption. And what I mean by consumption is, a
customer, the more they use, the more they pay. They're only going to use our stuﬀ if
they like what it does for them, not surprisingly. People have this amazing clarity. If
this isn't working for you, I'm going to stop using it. And the way we've designed the
Azure business model and really the subscription business model, it's very based on
customer satisfaction with the product and with Microsoft being a good partner to
the company. And the more we -- the only way we succeed is when our customers
succeed. And that's just simply not true of some of our biggest cloud competitors.
And I think customers really value that. And it feels like a diﬀerent company because
of that. We feel more like a partner to our customers and less like a licensing
machine. And I think that's subtle. I don't think most people deeply understand it yet.
But I think it has deep structural advantages that have helped us on the perception
side of the company.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. And maybe before we sort of dig into the business a little more, I thought --
one of the questions that people ask is, Microsoft spends so much money on sales
and marketing. And it has been a bit more eﬃcient than in years past. But it's still a
very big number. So as you look at your own budget and look at where investmentsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14Christopher C. Capossela
Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Loweare happening, where you see the greatest return on that incremental marketing
dollar, what do you see as sort of the best opportunities to continue and advance the
story?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, I think we're obviously blessed to be a big believer in spending on R&D
and a big believer in spending in sales and marketing to grow. And we're thrilled
that we had incredible growth in Q1. I think it was in the 17%, 18%, 19% range. I think
19%. And it's fantastic. We're very blessed to see those results. We have to be smart
about the way we spend. Microsoft's marketing spend as a % of revenue has come
down dramatically over the past six years. And yet even though that's the case, we've
been able to fund important, new marketing initiatives inside of the company that
have reaped really nice reward. For us, the way I think about it is we are going to
spend more and more of our marketing dollars on what we would consider
performance-based marketing. Because we've gotten our act together as it relates to
our data estate, we have very good line of sight to how much money it takes us to
acquire a new Azure customer direct on our website or a new Oﬃce customer or a
new Xbox customer or a new Surface customer. We have good data now on
customer acquisition costs by SKU, by channel. And we have very good data now on
the lifetime value of an Azure customer to Microsoft or the lifetime value of a Surface
customer to Microsoft. And so putting that math together and be able to say, "Hi. I
want to spend as much money as I possibly can as long as my customer acquisition
cost is within a particular range and my lifetime value stays where we think it is. I
want that budget to feel somewhat inﬁnite to the teams who are responsible for
spending the media dollars to acquire that next customer." And that's been an
excellent engine for us to invest in. And interestingly, even though we've said it's sort
of an inﬁnite budget, the reality is there's only so much media you can buy before
the media stops being as eﬃcient and your customer acquisition cost starts to go up.
Then the media teams will come to me and say, "Okay, we need to ratchet that down
because it's just not as eﬃcient as we need it to be," and that's a wonderful sort of
self-fulﬁlling motion to have created, though I still do love spending marketing on
perception. It is important, I think, to tell the world that you're going to be a leader in
AI, to tell the world you're going to be a leader in cloud. Those are much harder to
draw a direct line to the customer acquisition costs. But we know in our customers'
eyes that if we're not seen as an innovative company and if we're not seen as a
trustworthy company. And those for us are the 2 perceptions that probably matter
most, then that spells problems for us long term. And so I have to constantly balance
performance-based marketing with a hard TAC and LTV ratio with perception-based
marketing to make sure people understand some of the new innovations that we
have and what we're doing around trust and privacy.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And it's interesting because it's a little bit -- as we talk about digital transformation,
you have a pretty concrete example of how data is driving value in your own
organization. But maybe taking that up a little higher. I mean, digital transformation is
just broadly one of the big talking points within the investment community and
within your customer base. And as you think about -- going back to what you were
saying, the truth in the message and making sure that you're able to deliver on whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Christopher C. Capossela
Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Loweyou promise. As you think about digital marketing, what's sort of the right message
that you should have in the marketplace now around digital transformation? How do
you balance having a visionary point of view around things like AI that may be a little
bit forward-leaning versus what's sort of grounded and what the technology's
capable of today?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. So we're lucky to be in tech because the total addressable market is exploding.
Everything is becoming digitized. So every company is becoming a tech company.
And that allows Microsoft to be a great partner to them on their own tech journey.
And I think while a lot of people use the term, there's real truth to it. We see it
happening industry by industry, company by company. And so that puts Microsoft in
a wonderful position of being able to be a trusted partner to these companies who
are trying to ﬁgure out, how do I hire 1,000 engineers? How do I create an
engineering culture to help me transform my products and empower my employees,
et cetera, et cetera? From a marketing perspective, one of the things we found is
truest to our own culture that we want to live, we really want to be an empowerment
company. We're never going to be the cool kids. We're never going to be the things
that a lot of people associate with tech. We're always going to want to be the
company that empowers others. So that means the customer has to be cool. You
celebrate what the customer does. You don't celebrate what your products do. And
that's why if you look at most of our marketing, we're showcasing customers who
have used our technology in some interesting way and allowing them to tell their
own story. It's rare that you'll see an ad that's all about our product. It's much more
common that our storytelling puts a real customer on stage and has them talk about
the trials and tribulations of the transformation that they went through. And once you
go there and you say most of your storytelling is going to be based on real
customers, then you don't really have much of an issue in terms of it being fake
because customers just won't go up on stage at an event and tell you about how
they're doing unless they really believe. They won't let you do a TV ad, even if you
pay for the media on their brand, unless they really believe. And so 98% of our
marketing is based on stuﬀ we're doing right now, that customers are doing right
now, that you can go and buy our products and make them work for you. Then a tiny
bit of what we do, we'll talk about quantum computing, which is an area that we're
taking a real leadership position in. We'll do a 20-minute session of a Satya keynote
at one of our big developer events. And he'll bring computer scientists on stage and
talk for 20 minutes about quantum computing. And people will take notice of that.
They'll say, "Wow! Satya took half of his keynote to talk about quantum. Even though
there's no tech that can use it right this second, it must be important to Microsoft."
But it's really a 95%-5% split on here-and-now versus putting a stake in the ground
and saying, "We're doing things to invent the platforms that'll be important 10 years
from now or ﬁve years from now."
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And if you think about sort of that continuum, because it's great when you have
customers that have long tenure with Microsoft using some of the more innovative
things that you're doing these days. But it might take time for a big Fortune 500
customer. So is there sort of a middle area where things like quantum computing areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13

Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Lowestill very much largely in the realm of academia versus the -- I mean, UBS isn't the
best example. But a company that's fully embraced Azure and has great experiences.
And they can talk about that. But what happens with the things in the middle, where
you have some adoption, it's getting some momentum but maybe isn't mainstream
and you don't have those big, strong reference points? How do you sort of manage
that?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. We typically don't talk about them. You really don't -- we're lucky that we're in a
broad set of markets. You really want to nurture those relationships. You want to help
a customer realize their transformation. You take a partnership like the one we have
with Real Madrid. And that took years in the making before they felt like they had
really used our technology in a way that they were proud of. And so 2 or three years,
we're working with them behind the scenes to actually implement things. Then 2 or
three years down the road, they're willing to sort of stand up and say, "Hi. we have
450 million fans that follow this one small football team. And we have transformed
our fan experience using Microsoft," and you just have to be quiet until the
customers are really ready to talk. And so there's a painful pipeline you have to build.
It's just like a sales pipeline. It's essentially a marketing -- sort of a marketing
storytelling pipeline. And yet you have to go -- I think we've gotten better at resisting
the temptation that when a customer says, "Yes. We're all in with you," to not then
necessarily overmarket that. Because all that is, is a statement of intent. And perhaps
a statement of buying a bunch of our stuﬀ. But until they've actually used it in a
powerful way, we'll try to avoid marketing it because it's just not real yet. I noticed
that Accenture's going to be speaking later this morning. We've been on an
incredible journey with Accenture. Today, they now have more PCs running Windows
10 than Microsoft does. They have more PCs running Windows 10 than Microsoft
does. They're a much bigger company, 450,000 employees and associates. But they
have more people on Windows 10 than we do. And they can update Windows 10 as
fast as Microsoft can update Windows 10 for our own employees. Now that took
years of work. That didn't just happen by saying, "We want to do this." And now you
hear them talk very frequently about how they run on Microsoft. That was not a short
-- that was not a short thing. That took a lot of hard work. So long answer to a simple
question.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
It's a good answer. So maybe shifting gears a little bit. You mentioned also that
pricing and some of those things fall within your purview. And an area where that is
maybe in a bit higher focus is Oﬃce 365 and some of the packaging and the
bundling happening there. If we look at where we are in that journey, you mentioned
the revenues in subscription model. But it's moving fast. And there's a question of, in
the next few years, do you reach a point where everybody is converted to Oﬃce
365? And what's the next leg of growth? So as you think about the pricing strategy in
a business like Oﬃce 365, both bundling and also hitting new user groups, what's
sort of -- how do you approach that? What's the strategy from a marketing
perspective?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14Christopher C. Capossela
Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Lowe{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. So Microsoft is in a bunch of diﬀerent businesses that have diﬀerent sort of
economic models, I guess, I would say. Gaming now has a very heavy usage-based
model. The more hours people play something like a Fortnite or a Minecraft, you can
essentially ﬁgure out what that model is. Azure is a consumption-based model.
Oﬃce is sort of the classic playbook that Microsoft knows so. So well and our sales
force knows incredibly well, which is essentially how many new users are you
attracting and what's the average revenue per user. And so from a pure economic
model perspective, it's probably the -- it's one of the simplest businesses we run. It's
not a simple business. The economics behind it are quite easy to understand. There's
an interesting notion that Oﬃce is somewhat penetrated. And the reality is that
there's a huge number of workers that Microsoft has historically underserved with
Oﬃce. We call these workers the ﬁrst-line workers. Oﬃce has been very good for
people who work in carpeted buildings with lots of glass in them. Oﬃce has never
been great for people who work in buildings that have concrete ﬂoors and are 1-
story tall or 2-stories tall. Think of a manufacturing shop ﬂoor. Think of airline pilots
and people who check people into airlines. Think of Starbucks retail employees or
Best Buy retail employees. These are people who don't use Word, Excel and
PowerPoint as part of their day jobs. And so we put a pretty big investment in
building new tools for these ﬁrst-line workers that are available as an Oﬃce
subscription. But they're not buying all of the Word, Excel and PowerPoint stuﬀ that
the people who work in carpeted buildings typically buy. So ﬁrst-line workers are
one part of our strategy. And that is to reach people that Oﬃce has never reached.
And there's tons of them in the world. We've done a relatively good job penetrating
the relatively small number of people in carpeted buildings. But there's far more
human beings who have jobs as ﬁrst-line workers. And that's a great, great
opportunity. We've shipped a bunch of cool technology to let people like, do staﬀ
scheduling. So if you have a hair salon. And you have 20 people cutting hair, you
need to schedule who's cutting here when. We now have tools in oﬃce that people
are giving us wonderful feedback on. So ﬁrst-line worker is new seats. And then what
we've done on the existing seats, of course, is to create Oﬃce 365, higher value and
-- all the way up to this thing that we call Microsoft 365, which includes Oﬃce,
Windows and Enterprise Mobility and Security. So even when somebody has taken
advantage of all of Oﬃce 365, there is still a way to move them up the value chain by
adding in -- and what's hunting the best right now is security and manageability. And
that move from Oﬃce 365 to Microsoft 365 represents a big step up in average
revenue per user. So the economics are relatively straightforward, can you attract
new people you've never attracted before? And for the ones who are doing things
today, do you introduce new ways that they want to work that are valued and they're
willing to buy? Teams would be an important part of that portfolio for new ways to
work. And then a security would be the other important part of that portfolio to sort
of move people up that stack.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And given some of the earlier commentary about the granularity you have into
things like LTV versus CAC. And as you get into these higher volume, lower price
point audiences, are you able to sort of sustain the LTV to CAC? Or maybe some of
that data and granularity helps you get comfortable that that's ultimately a proﬁtableFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13

Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Loweeﬀort? I'd just be curious to get the perspective on the volume versus the higher
value type stuﬀ.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. So for the Oﬃce business, it's just not an issue at all. We're very happy to
continue to expand to new users. The way we run, we -- given the gross margin on
Oﬃce is fantastic, including the transition to the cloud, we're very pleased that we
have no issue with acquiring a ﬁrst-line worker who maybe is going to pay us less
than a white-collar, knowledge worker. I'd say we have lots of room to grow there.
On the other side of the equation, as we move people up this stack, what we're
ﬁnding is that security is an area where the overbuy from customers is pretty
extreme. The number of security vendors that an IT shop will have inside their
company is oﬀ the charts. And so there's an opportunity there for us to help
customers save money. And their outlay overall goes down where, obviously,
Microsoft's realization of what their spending goes up. So it's not just -- there's
beneﬁt on both sides of the equation, I would say.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And as you think about something like that because there's a huge opportunity for
Microsoft from a revenue perspective in areas like security. But the ﬂipside of that is
also you've been a great partner in security do a lot of companies and you want to
maintain that relationship as well. And that's important. How do you, from a
marketing perspective, show all the great things Microsoft can do and advocate for
Microsoft's capabilities without potentially stepping on the toes of companies that
have been good partners for you in some of those areas traditionally?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. Well the key -- I think the key thing is to make sure that we have a great
partnership with those ISVs. So they understand where we're going. We ﬁnd that
when we can do a good job communicating our roadmap to companies that are
partners of ours, even as we're going into areas that our customers want us to go
that may compete in areas they've gone, if they know we're headed there, then that
typically gives them time to innovate on top of what we're doing or understand
where our focus is so they can make sure that they continue to add value. At times,
you're obviously going to compete head-to-head with somebody. But more often
than not, a lot of the verticalized ISVs that we work closely with always feel like they
have room to do things on top of what we're doing. And that's important to us to
keep those partnerships strong.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And looking at areas where -- at least there is a perception that
Microsoft might compete with itself, things like Azure, where you have a great base
of customers who are paying you under annuity contracts. And have been great
customers for a long time, making sure that they remain happy and feel good about
the product that they have if that's a choice they've made versus trying to get peopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Christopher C. Capossela
Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Loweexcited about Azure and moving to the cloud and that's really where the innovation,
at least the perception is that's sort of the innovation center right now. How do you
balance those audiences and those diﬀerent products within the Microsoft portfolio
that may have sort of diﬀerent long-term aspirations attached to them?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. Well for us, there are a couple of things we think of. One is we don't think of the
public cloud as the end all, be all. For us, we're -- we think there is a big structural
advantage we have around this notion of the hybrid cloud. And being the only
partner, the only company, that can take a customer and allow them to build a
private cloud, allow them to build a hybrid cloud and allow them to build a public
cloud and manage that spectrum of those 3 absolutely seamlessly is a huge, huge
diﬀerentiator for us versus our cloud competitors who are sort of born in the cloud
and cloud-only. And if you want to do your own private data center or if you want to
have a hybrid solution, you really have no option without going to a bunch of third-
party companies. So rather than me thinking about, "Hi. it's either Windows Server or
its Azure," I think of frankly, Windows Server as your private Azure inside your
company. In fact, we have a product called Azure Stack, which essentially allows you
to take Azure and essentially privatize a lot of it and run it wherever you want to run
it. We're the only company that can do that. And so rather than thinking about, "Oh,
Windows server is the old thing," instead, we say no, no, no, it's just part of a
continuum. We want to be the partner for you if you need to be in your own data
center. We want to be the partner for you if you need to be create a portable data
center that goes on cruise ships, that connects to the public cloud when it docks. But
otherwise it's -- when it's out at sea, it's on its own. And when you, of course, want
pure public infrastructure and you don't want to run any of your own servers, we
want your applications. So just be able to move from public to hybrid to private. And
if we think of it as more of a spectrum and less of a, that's old and bad. And this is
new and good, that's an awesome competitive advantage because every customer
goes on their own cloud journey. No 2 look the same. If you're starting a company
from scratch today, unless you're in a really highly regulated industry, you're
probably going to be public cloud from the start because why would you buy your
own servers, why would you hire your own people to manage those servers. But if
you're not starting today, if you have data centers around the world or you have a
data center footprint, you're not just going to ﬂip the switch and move it all to the
public cloud. And so understanding that journey is something, I think, we're better
positioned to do than our competitors. And that's how we think about it. Marketing,
very simple. You market all the new stuﬀ because you need customers to see that
you're not holding onto the old world, that you're embracing the new world. You
have to market Azure, you have to market Oﬃce 365, you have to market the cloud.
You don't market Dynamics, you market Dynamics 365. You don't market traditional
Oﬃce, you market Oﬃce 365. But lots of people just want to go to Walmart and buy
a copy of Oﬃce and they don't want to be a subscription. They just want the disk,
they just want Oﬃce, for goodness sakes. And we're not going to turn that oﬀ. We're
not going to say, no, we don't like those customers. But we're going to market the
cloud because we need that transformation to be clear in everyone's mind.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Christopher C. CaposselaAnd as you think about that marketing audience, the enterprise is an area where
you've been strong for a long time, broadly. Consumer is an area where you have a
strong brand as well. I think there's sort of a view that developers are increasingly
inﬂuential in bringing technologies into the enterprise. Microsoft recently acquired
GitHub and the large community of developers, which haven't engaged with
Microsoft technology traditionally. How do you approach marketing to that
population. And in particular those people who may have been resistant to the
Microsoft brand traditionally and for a variety of reasons?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. I think one of the things that Satya, our CEO; and Amy, our CFO, one of the
things that we -- they've done very, very well is I think understand what we are
buying when we buy something. And if you look at the acquisitions that we've done
that I think have been the most successful under their time as CEO and CFO, they've
been companies that are networks. LinkedIn is a network of hundreds of millions of
people. Minecraft is a network. You think of it as a game. People think of Minecraft as
a game. It's actually -- it's a massive community of builders. And it happens to be a
game. But really as -- the asset is really the network. You look at GitHub. 31 million
developers are checking in code or have open-source projects in GitHub. It's a
network as much as it is a source code repository. And so we're very bullish on our
ability to welcome GitHub to Microsoft to keep the wonderful things about that
community. We named a developer inside of Microsoft as the CEO of GitHub. And
that's Nat Friedman, somebody who has incredible credibility with the elite
developer community around the world, with the open-source community around
the world. We joined the Open Invention Network, which is a network dedicated to
protecting open-source versus patent sort of trolls, if you will. And that was a quite
surprising move. Satya has been on stage multiple times with a slide that says
Microsoft loves Linux. Microsoft hearts Linux. Something like 40% of the virtual
machines that are created on Azure are Linux virtual machines, 40%. Something like
50% of the Azure workloads are open-source workloads. So Azure has become a
cloud for open-source developers. It's taken us a while to get past some old tapes
that people have about Microsoft and open source. But we've moved on. We're the
#1 contributor to GitHub. Way before we bought GitHub, Microsoft was contributing
more to source code to GitHub than anyone else on the planet. And so people have
been watching the company. They've seen this change to embrace open source.
GitHub is the latest big step that I think a lot of people who would say, "Oh, my gosh.
What are they going to do with it?" It's been awesome to see the Microsoft followers
respond to those people who would say, "Oh, no. This is terrible. Microsoft hates
open source. What's going to happen?" A lot of them has come out and said, "No,
no, no. That's old tape. You haven't seen the new Microsoft. This is a completely
diﬀerent place. They love open source. And it's going to be a very, very good future."
So I think courting developers is unbelievably important to us. Embracing open
source is clearly, incredibly important to making that happen. Making Windows an
incredible developer machine is another important thing for us to do. And we've
done a lot of technical things to do that, including bringing the Linux command shell
to Windows. So on your Windows box, you can actually work with Linux. Those are --
there are these many, many small things that we've done that are adding up to
people saying, "Oh, I see Microsoft caring a lot more about us than we thought."
And like I said earlier, there's not a big company I meet with that isn't trying to hireFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13

Christopher C. Caposselamore developers than they can hire. They want more developers than they can
possibly ﬁnd. And if you look at the #1 tool that developers use, what is the line of
business system that developers use? If salespeople use CRM as their #1 line-of-
business system, GitHub is the #1 LOB app for the world's developers. And if you see
the number of developers going up, they become more important to every
company, it's pretty obvious that that's an important tool set for us to love and care
about. And that's a big reason why we embraced it.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And looking at sort of that third population, I guess, the consumers and maybe
taking a step up. So I think historically, there's been this view that companies are
either good at selling to consumers or they're good at selling to enterprises. But it's
rare to do both well. And there's diﬀerent examples on both sides. But I think
Microsoft is the rare company that has strong brand equity in both those domains.
How -- from a marketing standpoint, do you treat those separately? Do you see
opportunities to showcase the Microsoft brand? And how do you want that brand to
either be the same or diﬀerent between those populations?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. So there's only one product that we have at the whole company -- or one family
of products that's only for consumers. And that's gaming. The funny thing, of course,
is that every device you can imagine, the #1 activity on that device is gaming. If you
look at PCs, what's #1 thing people do with PCs? They play games. If you look at
phones, what's the #1 thing they do on their phone? They play games. If you look at
tablets, it's literally every single device. So gaming is sort of this incredible business.
But every other business that we're in, the products that we make for end users, we
want those to be successful at home and in schools as well as we want them to be
successful in the enterprise. Windows is this way. Oﬃce is this way. Skype is this way.
Surface would be one of the best examples. Is Surface a consumer business? Or is
Surface a commercial business? Well revenue-wise, it's almost perfectly split for us as
a company. I market it like a consumer product. If you look at how we do the TV ads
and the video storytelling, we tell individual stories about how people use their
Surface. But if you look closely, a lot of them are using Surface to pursue their
business passions. We have an ad right now that's about a person who loves robots.
And he builds robots using a Surface. It looks like a consumer ad. He feels like a
consumer person. He's name is Adam. But if you look at the scenario, he's running a
company. Is he a small company? Is he a big company? You don't really know. It's
got a consumer vibe to it. But if you actually look at what he's doing, he's making
money using his Surface to run his company. And so I think we don't actually think at
Microsoft we have a consumer business and we have a commercial business. We
actually think we have -- we go after gamers. We love gamers. We love developers.
We love end users. And the end users are people like you and me. We use a device
at home. And then if we love it, we hope our work allows us to bring that device or
they're going to buy us -- buy one for us that's just like it. It's funny, the rest of the
world or maybe investors like to think about commercial and consumer. Well we
actually don't. We think about gamers. We think about IT pros. We think about
developers. We think about end users. We know we have to appeal to end users. We
know we have to win end users in small business, in education, at home. And if weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13

if that makes any sense.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Yes. It does. And actually, I'm going to take one oﬀ the (bolus). But I think it's related
to this. I sort of simplify and say, consumers, enterprises, developers as audiences.
But you have also potential future hires at Microsoft, you also have people like us.
How does that factor into what you view as your domain in marketing versus either
Investor Relations or HR or other groups? How do you sort of -- those populations
like investors and potential hires, how do you think about those in your world view?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
I see. I see. So we have -- I'd say we look at it broadly and say the company has many
stakeholders. Investor is an incredibly important stakeholder. Employees are
stakeholders. Our own employees who already work at the company are
stakeholders. Potential employees who may be thinking about joining the high-tech
world is another set of stakeholders we need to think about. The press and analysts,
not investor analysts but industry analysts like a Gartner or Forrester, that's another
set of stakeholders. So broadly, across the company, one of the nice things about
one Microsoft is the ﬁnance team, the marketing team, the HR team, we can all line
up and say we all have the same stakeholders. Maybe Amy spends more of her time
on the investor stakeholder. But she's counting on me to have great marketing that's
going to appeal and that everyone's going to see. And I might take more
responsibility for the industry analysts. The HR team might take more responsibility
for hiring. But they're counting on me to create pull for young people to care about
Microsoft and know what Microsoft's up to. And that is, I think, the wonderful way
that one Microsoft works. I don't just put the blinders on and say, "Oh, Amy has to
worry about investors." Otherwise, I wouldn't be here at the UBS tech conference,
right? I mean, obviously, it's a team sport at Microsoft now. It wasn't always a team
sport. Now it's a team sport. Everybody has to care. And everybody has a role to
play. I do think deeply about how are we attracting the next generation of
employees at the company. And that's something that maybe other companies
would say, "Oh, that's HR's job." And it's not. It's the senior leadership team's job
because the engineering leaders want to hire them. The HR leader wants to hire
them. The marketing person wants to hire them. We all have to be pulling together
there.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Great. And let me just come back. And so you talked about Surface. And going
through your responses about the marketing and also within the consumer division, I
think there's always a question of, what's considered a win for Surface? Because it's a
product that's successful in its own right. But at least at the outset, it was positioned
as inspiration for your partner ecosystem and what -- how much of that you want to
do versus really just inspire. For you, what's a win? Is it creating a big Surface
business? Or is it seeing a lot of other people come in with their Surface-like devices
and taking the lead?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13

Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Lowe{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yes. I think there's 2 things that we look at as a leadership team in terms of what is
success for Surface. The ﬁrst is Surface should be the very best experience for
Windows and Oﬃce and gaming of any device made by anybody. If we can't do the
work between the Surface design team, the Windows team, the Xbox team, the
Oﬃce team, et cetera, to make Surface the highest product satisfaction laptop or 2-
in-1 or pick a category on the planet, then we haven't succeeded. And today, from
Surface Pro to Surface Laptop to every Surface we make, in its category, we're seeing
higher product satisfaction scores using third-party data, not Microsoft data, that
compares it to the MacBook, that compares it to any device in its category. So job 1,
we better make these the most highly satisﬁed products because we're making all
the pieces. And if we can't make those work, how would you expect our important
OEM partners to build fantastic devices? So one is just make incredibly high-quality
product that then makes Windows better for Dell, Windows better for HP, Windows
better for Lenovo, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The second and probably even more
important one is we have to create new categories. We have the P&L that can
support us investing in new hardware categories that our traditional OEM partners
may not be able to invest in. And so you look at the 2-in-1 category, Surface Pro was
really the product that created the 2-in-1. And now, who makes more 2-in-1s than
anybody? It's not us. It's Dell. It's HP and Lenovo. They're selling more 2-in-1s than
certainly anybody else. You even see one of our big competitors who said they
would never create a 2-in-1 because they were too odd. You either should have a
tablet or you should have a laptop. And now of course, they've created 2-in-1. And
they've got ads talking about their 2-in-1 because we created an absolutely new
hardware category. That new hardware category is growing faster than all the
traditional categories. And it has higher ASPs than all of the traditional categories. So
when we can show our OEM partners that there's a new type of hardware category
that customers want, they will then build it. And we give them the reference
architecture. And we say Windows already does all these things really well. Look,
here's the proof. They're going to then scale it out. They have points of distribution
we'll never have. They have geo coverage we'll never have. And so that's how we
think about it, best-quality devices across our games, our operating system and our
productivity stack, best quality. And then we better create new categories. And we're
working. We're hard at work. We love Surface Pro. I walked around the room. It's
awesome for me to see all these Surface books and these Surface Pros. I think three
years ago, I might've seen none in this room. And now I've seen a whole bunch of
them. It's because of the quality. And it's because of the category creation. But we
love that Dell and HP and Lenovo are selling far more than we are. We've created a
category that they can then scale out, which is great for Windows, which is great for
Oﬃce, et cetera.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And maybe just a ﬁnal question. And it's one that came in from a few people in the
audience as well, is if you think about the layers of success within a hardware
business, some of it's the form factor and having one that's appealing. But some of
it's also the breadth of applications. And at this point in time, Surface is a smaller
installed base than some of the alternatives out there. So how do you think about
getting the applications that you need? And is there sort of a long tail where there'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-13

Christopher C. Caposselaa few that matter and a lot that are less relevant? How do you think about building
out the app community given a relatively smaller footprint of installed advices?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Hi. is that Surface statement or maybe a Windows?
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Yes, yes, I mean, yes, because I have Windows. It looks very diﬀerent. But I'm thinking
more just in the tablet form factor.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Oh, yes. So for us, I think we excel in -- Windows really excels in the 9-inch-and-
above screen size. Once you get to 9 inches, productivity becomes something you
can really do. You could spend hours on the device being productive, not just
consuming. But actually creating. And that's where I think Windows really shines.
Introducing new technology like the pen and the dials, that takes some time for our
ISVs to latch onto and to sort of say, "Okay, I'm going to actually dedicate resources
to making the pen fantastic." We have to do the work in Windows ﬁrst to make it very
easy for them to then pick that up and implement it into their apps. But when we
introduced the pen, I don't know, ﬁve years ago, people sort of were very cynical that
it wouldn't be something that would really take oﬀ. And now you have -- everybody
has a pen. Just about every device manufacturer, whether they're Windows or not,
has embraced the pen, which then means the developers have to follow because
you're seeing people sort of demand a better experience. So for us, it starts with the
hardware and the form factor. We have to build the support into the operating
system. So it's why we do Surface. So that we can actually do it ourselves end to end.
But we're always looking to just push that reference out to the broader community
because it's just ﬁrst party. It's not going to work if it's not going to be broad
enough. But we're not really wedded to Surface-speciﬁc apps. That's not interesting
to us. Windows apps are far more what we're trying to do. Surface will always push
the envelope on the form factor, on the hardware. But we want everyone else to pick
that up as well.
