I think it's pretty good.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
We had some pretty good walk-in music, welcome music. So, thanks, everyone. So,
I'm Chris Caso, Credit Suisse Semiconductor Analyst. So, welcome back to the
conference. Our next speaker will be NVIDIA, which you all know. Here from NVIDIA
is Colette Kress, Arizona-native CFO coming back home to Arizona. So, Colette,
welcome.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you, Chris.
I just want to make an opening statement ﬁrst, as a reminder that this presentation
contains forward-looking statements, and investors are advised to read our report
ﬁled with the SEC for information related to risks and uncertainties facing our
business.
So, I thought I'd open up in terms of some key themes and takeaways as we just
ﬁnished our last quarter and gave guidance for the fourth quarter that we're in. We
are working through our inventory correction that is needed for our gaming
business. We are making progress. Q3 deﬁnitely showed progress in terms of
reducing the inventory that we have on the channel. That was also an opportunity for
us to begin the very beginnings of our Ada launch of gaming as well, and that is
going quite well. We do believe that as we approach the end of Q4, we will have
reached about normalized levels of inventory for our gaming business.
Secondly, theme-wise, we've got a great product line-up, new launches of
architectures not only with our gaming business, but for our data center businessFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-30

and running. We have Hopper out for our data center business that will begin
ramping in next year, and we'll start production in this Q4 with our guidance that we
have.
So, just wanted to open up with some of the key things that we're focused on right
now.

(Question And Answer)
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. And maybe starting with some of that, and I think as I've spoken to
investors in the past few weeks, there does seem to be an appetite for the
semiconductor space after the pullback that we've had. And I think that a lot of folks
are looking at the extent to which things are derisk in making sure that no other
shoes are dropped. What you said on the call was you talked about that you believe
that the end demand in gaming is on the order of $5 billion over two quarter period,
so just about $2.5 billion a quarter. The consensus estimates of how your gaming
business running at about $1.5 billion a quarter now. So, that's a pretty sizable gap.
Does that give you some conﬁdence that again the inventory is burning through at
some point, we get back to where that steady state demand is such that even if
demand weakens a bit, who knows with China and that -- there are no other shoes to
drop in gaming?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, that's correct. So, we had highlighted at the very onset of -- when we saw the
inventory correction need to help folks understand what we saw in terms of solid
sell-through in terms of gaming. So, we came up with a view of our normalized
gaming of about $5 billion stretched over two quarters.
Yes, there is always some seasonality. So, sometimes it's going to be $2.5 billion a
quarter, give or take, depending on the quarter leading in. We still see gaming is
solid, and we're continuing to watch each and every day in terms of the sell-through
that we're seeing particularly as we are looking at the Western holidays right now in
that time.
So, we have been under-shipping. We have been under-shipping gaming at this
time, so that we can correct that inventory that is out in the channel. And as we
discussed, we plan hopefully by the end of Q4 -- as we approach the end of Q4 that
we will be in a solid position to that. That means as we move forward, we will start to
get back up, we'll get to some point of an equilibrium between sell-through and sell-
in, and then we will likely get to where we'll be selling in to build the channel for ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-30

A - Colette KressAda launch, and all of the additional Ada products that we will see coming to
market.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
And following from that, as we look into the April quarter and you haven't provided
guidance, and I assume you're not going to provide guidance right now, but what
are the puts and takes that we should think about? You've got things like seasonality
in the gaming business, you have the normalization in inventory, you have some of
the new H100, which starts going into cloud instances starting in the April quarter.
So, maybe you could speak about some of those things and things we should
consider when thinking about the April quarter.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Correct. We have given our guidance for Q4, and we're going to start-oﬀ new year.
Our new year is going to be a year focused on our new products coming to market.
Ada is just in the early days right now of shipping. We've shipped one of our very
high-end cards, our 4090, and our 4080 is just now starting to sell as well. So, we
have plenty of opportunity with innovation that we've brought to market for the
gaming.
But that's also true for our data center business as well. Our data center business is
now coming forth with our H100 architecture. That's a great opportunity to really take
advantage of a lot of the innovation that we put into focus on large language
models. Transformers is a very big thing of it, and the overall performance
improvement, the eﬃciencies, the total TCO that you get from H100 is there [ph]. We
will start that beginning production here in Q4; and as we move into the year, we will
start that ramp of H100.
As we discussed in terms of our earnings, we will see cloud instances already set-up
for the H100 as we start the new year as well. So, we know it's a very important
product, and we feel that we're in a great position with the new products coming to
market, not just H100 in data center, but the networking, which is often coming very
coupled together with what we're selling in H100. What's out there though that we
can't control is the macro conditions, the macro conditions around the world, they're
here in the U.S., they're deﬁnitely here in Europe and China, we've talked about in
terms of the economy really, really being tough right now.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
And China is important for you as you go into April, given the New Year holiday that
occurs there.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
There is a holiday season in the Asia-Pac China area as well. And we've been still
seeing solid in China, however with the lockdowns that they've been experiencing
with COVID, it makes things just a little harder for the distribution, for the sale
process to happen. So, we'll continue to watch that closely.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-30

Maybe you could speak about the Ada launch. And I think there's been a perception
that gaming had been one of the pandemic beneﬁciaries, we couldn't go anywhere
and that there would be some impact now that we have other things to do. To what
extent have you seen that? What's your perception of the success of the Ada launch
as compared to the 30 Series, the 20 Series launch, how do you benchmark that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
When we look at gaming, we've always discussed that there may have been a little
bit of a pull-in as folks looked for some type of sport during the pandemic. We did
see some great new gamers joining that market and taken advantage of the
leadership that we have in terms of gaming. Not only is Ada a leader in the industry,
so is Ampere. So, the number one and number two top architectures are NVIDIA.
We continue to watch what we see in terms of Steam. Steam is still a record level of
gamers online gaming, and the top 15 cards on Steam are NVIDIA, all 15 out of 15. So,
this is an area that gamers will be gamers for life. And we watch this industry both at
the great times and also during some of the hard times. It is a sport that is
economical, because you can choose many diﬀerent form factors at many diﬀerent
price points for the gaming that you want to do.
Our Ada launch 4090 when it came out, yes, it was only the very ﬁrst card and the
high-end card, it's sold out in two weeks. So we're very pleased to see something
that was a nod for us that we knew that gaming, no matter what time of year, no
matter what the situation is still very important entertainment industry.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Okay. We'll pivot over to data center for a bit. And the H100, so maybe you can
speak to what that means in terms of performance for your customers, what that
means in terms of content for NVIDIA?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, the H100 in terms of its performance improvement depending on the type of
workloads can be more than 6x what we see with A100. We went through the MLPerf
for training the MLPerf benchmarking for inference; and in both of those cases,
hands down, everything that we do here at NVIDIA shows through in terms of
outperformance.
What we see in the market and what led us in the design of H100 is the continued
advancements of AI. Each and every season, each and every year, there is something
new. They're still in that very early days of AI, but large language models, and the
size of large language models and the inﬂuence of natural language processing
within that is very front and centers, not to say that recommendiator engines still
have ways to go, and very popular with the consumer Internet companies as well to
make sure their marketing is appropriately targeted. So, H100 really hones in on that;
and when you think about our development of H100, it was done in coordinationFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 12Q - Chris Caso
A - Colette Kress
Q - Chris Casowith the customers, coordination with the enterprisers, coordination with the
hyperscalers, so that they are seen what they would need in there.
As we move forward, it's not about H100 being a tip, it is about being a system, it is
about thinking of the process of AI from the very beginning that the data enters the
data center to the time that it leaves. And so, you will see a lot of work there not only
with the interconnects, the links, the networking, and the memory to all assist in that
full process.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, it's a good segue into the next question, which is the sustainable
advantage you have in AI. And I don't think there's much investor question about the
growth rate of AI. And at this point, I don't think there's much question about
NVIDIA's leadership in that space; that's why the room is so packed. Going forward,
how do you sustain that? I mean what's the factor? And it has to be more than just
the silicon itself. The concerns that have been voiced in the past have been things
like start-up companies taking a perch, the hyperscalers themselves doing things. So,
how do you fend-oﬀ those challenges and retain that advantage?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, when you think about our products coming to market, we may ﬁrst discuss in
terms of the performance availability. People ask that they talk about what will we
see, but most importantly in there is the software that we've built along the way. And
this is not software that in this last quarter or this last year that we were overall
developing, you're talking about 10 years to 15 years-worth of developing software
for this platform, and really transforming how the world thinks about computing.
The computing architecture of CPU has been here for a lot of time. But to use a GPU,
you are really rethinking that application, you're rethinking the use of that hardware
in the GPU. So, our full stack view of software is essential. We're able to package it up
and create a full system package NVAIE that really is out there to help enterprises
start their very beginning of work in terms of the AI or continue in terms of
workloads that we're doing.
We have SDKs for some of the leading industries and their top applications, so that
they can begin that work. It's very hard to think of a start-up or just a new chip having
any work in this model, if there is no software and somebody has to work to do all
that work. We have more than 3.5 million developers that develop solutions on our
hardware, on our software using our full systems. Each and every time that we bring
something to market, it's really about the developers and what they are looking for,
and how are they going to use us.
So, I think, we've been extremely successful of continuing that model equally as
much as we focus in terms of on the hardware, we are focusing on the development
platform, we are focusing on the software.

Q - Chris CasoCould you give us some help in how we should think about the growth rate of data
center over time, and it's been something that's been incredibly diﬀerent -- diﬃcult
to model? For the most part I think we've all underestimated the growth of it, which
is a good problem to have. But going forward, you need to get despair growth rates
within the cloud part of your business, which is about a half of the enterprise
business, the other half. And content and ASPs are rising as well. So, I think the way a
lot of folks have done is taken a look and ﬁgured some multiple on cloud growth,
but it's not really a very accurate way of looking at it. And I don't know if you have
another way of how NVIDIA looks at it internally.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, as we discussed in our earnings, we have talked about our business in data
center, and we've broken it out with talking about our hyperscales, and then talking
about our vertical industries and we're seeing from each end quarter, you're
probably about -- have 50%-50% in there. We're going to work on providing a little
bit more of a disclosure going forward. Our hyperscales are important, they're large
companies, but many of them are also cloud companies in terms of serving our
cloud instances for the enterprises. So, if we can take this time to look at what we're
seeing also with the cloud, that gives you a better understanding of really the vast
nature of enterprises that are using AI and accelerated computing as we go forward.
So, stay tuned for us as we move forward on that.
What we see with the hyperscales is just that, setting-up cloud instances on a need
for many diﬀerent types of industries enterprise-wise. They do it also for researchers,
they do it also for higher education. And what we are seeing over the period of time
is that cloud is continuing to be a very important part, an important part both
historically and likely going forward, as when you think about the challenges of the
economy setting-up a cloud instance to get started is an easier path than working
through signiﬁcant amount of capital to build out your overall data center. So, it's
also becoming more diﬃcult for enterprises to have real size of IT organizations that
can master some of these very complex conﬁgurations that were seen in data
centers today. So, the cloud is going to be very important.
When you think about some of the announcements that we made with Q3, talking
about our work with the hyperscale such as Azure, such as Oracle selling with them
to the enterprises. This is a real good breakthrough of what we're seeing the
important of our cloud providers, but them also realizing the importance of our
relationships with the enterprises as well as our software stack. So, now, they have
the ability to market the software stack, create instances that an enterprise could get,
whether they built it on their own or put it in the cloud. So, we're really pleased with
this in terms of the partnership and working with our cloud providers there.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Does that mean to say that over time now that perhaps we should see the cloud part
of the business going to be a bigger part of your business, as maybe we see some
migration from on-premise to cloud, as that just more eﬃcient way of dealing with
workloads?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-30

It's tough to say what the diﬀerent growth rates will be, because you'll still have many
that will desire to be on-prem. But stepping back from it, we're indiﬀerent, right?
We're indiﬀerent of whether or not a consumer and enterprise wants to build on-
prem, they want to use a cloud instance whether -- what the hyperscale wants to do.
That's what we're here for.
We have many diﬀerent ways in which you can use AI, use accelerated computing,
and we have now set-up that throughout the world. So, we're indiﬀerent. But yes,
cloud will be a very important industry going forward.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Also want to speak about one of the other product cycles you're expecting this year
and in Grace, the CPU product that gets added there. Maybe you could speak to in
terms of timing, I think an ARM model we're expecting some moderate impact than
the second half of this year. Speak to what that means for your customer in terms of
performance, what it means for NVIDIA in terms of content?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So, Grace. Grace is our ﬁrst CPU, our ﬁrst ARM Grace CPU coming to market. We
plan to start the testing about bringing that to sampling here in the ﬁrst half. Second
half, we'll talk about it being into market.
What Grace is? Grace works together with our Hopper architecture. It is geared
toward very large models, very high-end type of AI. It's not a general purpose CPU, it
has its speciﬁcs to focus on accelerated and AI together. So, we are excited to bring
it to market. We have worked to really understand the importance that that CPU will
have on the workload of AI and we'll see how we do in the second half of the year.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
How do you capture value on that? Because obviously, if a customer buys a board
with Grace on it that removes the need for an accompanying Intel or AMD server,
which the cost of that platform is pretty close to what would be in A100 today. Is
NVIDIA in a position to capture all that value? Because you're essentially giving the
customer better performance, and you actually remove some additional cost from
them.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
When we are developing all of our systems, it is about a total TCO, when they have
moved to accelerated computing. There isn't any one of our architectures in data
center that is not improving a TCO. Enabling now a DGX incorporating Grace and
Hopper together is just a better TCO for that customer that you have a very speciﬁc
CPU for the workload that we're trying to do. But it's not uncommon though for us to
also use our peers' CPUs as well. So, those have been within our DGX, and that is
also beneﬁcial to us just as long as we're moving to accelerated computing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-30

Right. But it's safe to say there's some content that you have to gain in that as you're
adding higher performance. NVIDIA is a company generally that prices to value. So,
if you drive performance, which is -- in all your market, where ASPs have been going
up.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. We price for the innovation and the savings of that TCO. That's really underling
whether that be gaming, whether that be data centers, that's what we're trying to do.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Fair enough. With some of the macro concerns, I mean several -- and some of our
colleagues at Credit Suisse have some concerns about cloud CapEx in 2023,
obviously there's some pressure in enterprises. Does that moderate your view of the
H100 or Grace product cycle as go into 2023? Is that something we should take a
little more modern expectation and expect more in 2024? How do we think about it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We've studied and we're continuing to watch the macroeconomic conditions. One of
the things that you see during these times as enterprises will really study and work
through what they're going to purchase, some of that sometimes is a lengthening of
the time to overall close deals. That may happen, and there are though certain
industries that AI and accelerators is so important to the work that they do, important
to their monetization of their platform, important in terms of new growth for them.
So, focusing on accelerated computing and AI, whether it be sustainability, trying to
think through the use of energy, it's a more eﬃcient platform, and the leading edge
of AI will be important for so many businesses. So, we're in a good position for that,
with both a new architecture as well as being a leader in that industry. The
macroeconomic conditions are there though, so we are watching it carefully, but we
know that the cloud will be essential to keep going during this time.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Okay. I'll pivot to something else, which NVIDIA has spoken about pretty consistently
over the last year. I don't think it's as high of an investor focus, but it's software. And I
think software is interesting, because when you add software economics to a
semiconductor company model, it could be pretty important. How important do you
expect software to be on the ﬁnancials as you go over the next 18 months, 24
months?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So, we have started selling our software separately. For example, our data center
products or gaming products, all of them have had software since the very
beginning of the time. But what we've done is we've packaged up key software in
probably three diﬀerent areas.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Q - Chris Caso
A - Colette Kress
Q - Chris Caso
A - Colette KressOne, NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which is a set of system software that helps every
enterprise get started and essentially treat this what they see with many of their other
enterprise software capabilities, being able to monitor jobs, being able to manage
the whole data center as a whole and essentially get started on much of that
workloads. That's very diﬃcult for enterprises to start, they wouldn't necessarily have
the teams on-board, the engineers on-board to do that. Essentially, this is also an
area, where enterprises want that software, because with applying that to some of
their mission-critical applications and work, they want to know that we are there to
both support, update and keep all of that software current. So, there is a double win
in terms of there. So, that's our ﬁrst piece.
The second one is are Omniverse. Our Omniverse is an important area thinking
about the 3D virtual world and the simulations of much of the build design -- digital-
twin environment that's out there. There's many diﬀerent use cases. So, this is an
area, where we can sell in a pod with our enterprise customers or even in an
individual basis.
Our third piece is focusing on automotive. As we've been working on automotive in
terms of AV, we have agreements, where we will be selling software along with our
hardware and maintaining that software over the life of the car. So, this can be a
meaningful piece in these three areas for us. We're just getting started in working
and selling it. You'll even see with H100 and certain forms of H100, it will come with
our software coupled together with the H100. We're excited to see this. This is a
driver not only of top-line, but it also an improvement can be in terms of our gross
margin for the long term. So, we'll see this drop.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
What's the chance that we get to see software kind of broken-out with a bit more
granularity in the near future? Is that something you've contemplated?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We will be giving you information of some of our key customers and software and
key milestones that we reach in terms of software. We think that would be the most
beneﬁcial to help you and walk us through this journey with us.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Okay. Maybe I'll check to see, it's a packed room, if there's a question that
somebody like to ask. Anyway, I'll continuous as you think about it. Automotive as
well -- and automotive, there's been a transition from the infotainment part of the
business, which has trended down, and we've been waiting for ADAS full self-driving
to have an impact now. It sounds like we're kind of on the edge of that beginning to
occur. So, maybe you could speak to that a bit.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Correct. What you're seeing today, our automotive business has some very solid
growth right now. Our Orin architecture came to market at a very important time,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Q - Chris Caso
A - Colette Kress
Q - Chris Caso
A - Colette Kress
Q - Chris Casowhere there's two important things in the automotive industry, EV or electrical
vehicles as well as AV.
Now, when you are dealing with your EV customers, they're really thinking through
their complete redesign of a car from the bottoms up, they're building a car from
scratch. Important piece of that is that computing platform. Orin is the exact great
product for that to do from soup to nuts. So, we have them working not only on
consolidating all that diﬀerent software into one computing platform, but also
adding AV features to the work that we are seeing.
So, NEVs across the world, particularly in the Asia-Pac and China area have really
lodged on to our Orin architecture and they're using that. We also have now
agreements with very large companies, both Daimler, JLR and futures to really
provide them not only the hardware, but a full software stack. Those will be coming
in the next couple of years. They will start in terms of pre-production, they'll start in
terms of sampling in a little bit more than a year, and then we'll see in terms of
volume after that. So, the automotive has those two things occurring at the same
time.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
So, really -- and I guess the way to think about it is 2023 kind of going to '24 is more
the NEV, and then '24, '25 to larger OEMs.Is that right way to think about it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We believe that's the general direction that it will go.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
And will the NEV -- will it be material? And that -- and you said the auto business,
there's been strong growth, but the high-class problem you've had is, you haven't
had strong growth in a lot of diﬀerent areas. So, it's kind of stayed as a smaller
percentage of revenue. Once we get to those OEM, the larger like Daimler '24, '25,
should we expect that auto grow as a more signiﬁcant portion of NVIDIA revenue at
that point?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That's correct. When we look at our ﬁscal year '25, we do believe there will be a
signiﬁcant amount in there. Keep in mind, our automotive customers not only what
they have within their car is important of what they're purchasing from NVIDIA, but
they're also very important data center customer. In order to build what they want or
AV of the future, they have our computing back in their data centers. It's a very
important part of that. They've also been working of course with our workstations
since the beginning of time. So, it's interesting to see, yes, we have what is within the
automotive car itself. But keep in mind, we also have a great business with them
through the data center.

Q - Chris Caso
A - Colette Kress
Q - Chris CasoOkay. We're almost out of time, and I'll end in a question on margins. And I guess in
NVIDIA's case being fabulous with so many products, your margins have been fairly
stable and is there anything that we should think of with regard to the growth rates
of diﬀerent businesses or you're spending itself that we should consider with regard
to gross margins or operating margins?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, looking at our gross margins, we continue to see not only the manufacturing
costs, but remember we have so much engineering that's working on the software.
First, the value that we distribute in terms of the innovation has allowed us to have
very solid gross margins. In the last year or a couple of years, you've certainly seen
the cost of manufacturing, the cost of components, contract manufacturing
continued to increase. We've absorbed a lot of that, and still had very, very solid
gross margins. We take that opportunity each time that we look at a new architecture
on the value that we're providing, but we also have to take into account the cost that
it takes to do some of this very, very high-end manufacturing that we do. So, those
are the important pieces.
Now, when you look at our overall operating margins, it's another case of very strong
operating margins. During this time, it is always an opportunity for us to think
through how we spend our money. But we're quite an eﬃcient company, we're only
25,000 people large for a company that's operating well into double-digit billions in
there. But we took this time to slow-down our hiring and focus on the engineers,
focus on the teams that we had. And I think the teams rallied around that, but also

will be our focus, focused not only on gross margin for the long term, but also
focusing on our operating margins as well.
