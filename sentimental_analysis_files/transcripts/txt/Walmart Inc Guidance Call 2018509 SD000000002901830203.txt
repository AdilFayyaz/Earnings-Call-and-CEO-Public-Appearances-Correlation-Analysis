Greetings. Welcome to the Walmart Investor Call and Q&A. (Operator Instructions)
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Steve Schmitt, Head of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.
{BIO 19791185 <GO>}
Thank you for joining us today to discuss our investment in Flipkart Group. On the
call is Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO. And Doug is joining the call
from India. So please bear with us if there's a slight delay in the audio. Also on the
call is Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Brett Biggs,
Walmart's EVP and CFO.
Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-
looking statements. You can ﬁnd our safe harbor for these statements in the investor
presentation accompanying this call on our website.
Walmart will release its First Quarter earnings next Thursday, May 17. With this in
mind, we will not be discussing our First Quarter results today. We're hosting this call
to discuss and answer your questions related to our announcement to invest in a
majority stake in Flipkart. We've also put out a presentation with the release this
morning to discuss the strategic rationale.
Given various schedules around the world, we're going to keep this call to a
maximum of 45 minutes. So I apologize in advance if we're not able to get to
everyone's question. The Investor Relations team will be available for follow-up calls.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Doug.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Thanks, Steve. And hello, everyone. As a company in and around the world, we're
taking steps to strengthen our service to customers with increased value, a broader
assortment and improved experience while, at the same time, we're taking action to
position the company for the future. In other words, we are actively working to shape
the portfolio of geographies and businesses we're in, in order to set the company up
for success for another generation. If you've been following us closely, in addition to
the investments we've been making, you will have noticed decisions to sell or exit
parts of our businesses around the world these past few years. There are examples in
the United States, Mexico, Japan, Chile and Brazil where we've exited store formats,
banks, restaurants and e-commerce businesses. Most recently, we shared the
intention to merge our Asda business with Sainsbury's. Doing so will help position
Asda for long-term success, beneﬁting our customers and colleagues in the U.K. as
well as shareholders.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 19Today, we're excited to announce our investment in Flipkart Group. India is one of
the largest and fastest-growing economies in the world and represents an enormous
market opportunity with 1.3 billion people, strong GDP growth and a growing middle
class. We've been operating in India since 2009. And we're very encouraged by the
progress we're seeing.
One of the things we're most excited about is e-commerce in India, which we expect
to grow at 4x the rate of overall retail. Flipkart is already capturing a large portion of
this growth and is well positioned to accelerate into the future. Founded in 2007,
Flipkart has led a transformation in India's e-commerce market. They're a
homegrown winner with a strong team. Over the last few months, we've gotten to
know the leadership team. And we're conﬁdent that they are building a business that
will scale and last. We found them to be committed, passionate and creative. Their
ability to identify and solve problems resulting in an improved customer experience
is impressive. We see alignment between Walmart and Flipkart as it relates to our
purpose and values. Most importantly, we have a shared commitment to serve
customers.
We're also pleased to partner with Tencent, Tiger Global and Microsoft, which will be
key strategic and technology partners as we make this investment. The new Flipkart
work will partially change in composition to reﬂect our new structure and be an
important ingredient in the future success of this company. This will be a team eﬀort,
strengthening existing and building strategic and competitive advantages for the
company.
As it stands today, the company is generating losses to accelerate their growth. We
understand the dilution impacts our shareholders and have given that signiﬁcant
thought as we contemplated this investment. We understand both the short-term
and long-term expectations of our shareholders. When you weigh in those
expectations, we believe this transaction is very important to our company for the
future. Here's why. Flipkart is large and growing. In the ﬁscal year ending March 31,
Flipkart had annual GMV of $7.5 billion, representing more than 50% year-over-year
growth. Flipkart's number of active customers has also grown 7x since 2014, coming
in at approximately 54 million last year. It's also important to understand that Flipkart
has built and is building a powerful ecosystem. It's comprised of the following
segments. Flipkart, the core general merchandise platform, has leadership positions
in some of the most attractive categories in the Indian retail market, including
apparel, mobile, electronics and large appliances. Myntra and Jabong come
together to form a fast-growing fashion e-commerce platform. This is an important
category to win, a positive when it comes to margin mix. And we believe this piece
of the company is positioned well with India's growing middle-class and relatively
young population. The PhonePe payments business supports the growth and
development of e-commerce, delivering innovation to merchants and customers to
simplify transactions. This is an important piece of the puzzle when building an
ecosystem, helping to deepen customer relationships through more frequent
interactions and personalization based on insights in the customer needs and wants.
Plus Flipkart's supply chain arm, Ekart, serves more than 800 cities, making 500,000
deliveries daily. At Walmart, we're learning how to build and how to partner andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 19Brett M. Biggsbuild retail ecosystems around the world. India will now become a key center of
learning for our entire company.
With this investment, we're pleased to be making a long-term commitment to India's
future. We believe we can be a force for good in the country as we work to deliver
shared value. As we look to the future, we believe this investment will contribute to
sustained economic growth especially across India's agriculture, food and retail
sectors. Jobs will be created through development of supply chains, commercial
opportunity and direct employment. We'll continue to invest in local communities,
partnering with kirana owners and members to help modernize their retail practices,
supporting farms through local sourcing and greater market access and reducing
food waste by improving waste management practices and investing in supply
chains.
Walmart is transforming globally to not only meet the needs of customers but to
exceed and delight them. New opportunities emerge every day. And we're moving
quickly to stay out in front of change. We're harnessing technology, investing in
people and thinking diﬀerently about how to serve customers. India is a priority
market for us. The investment will help us continue to serve our members in India,
gain new customers and create more opportunity for our associates.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brett to review the ﬁnancial implications of this
investment.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned, we believe
our investment in Flipkart Group will position us to realize tremendous growth
opportunities in India. Over the next ﬁve years, India's retail market is expected to
reach approximately $1.3 trillion. And we believe that India will be a top 5 e-
commerce market within the next ﬁve years.
Flipkart has seen rapid growth over the past several years. And we expect this trend
to continue. In the latest ﬁscal year, Flipkart had GMV of $7.5 billion and $4.6 billion
in net sales, representing more than 50% growth in both cases. As you likely saw in
our press release this morning, Walmart will invest approximately $16 billion for an
initial stake of approximately 77% in the Flipkart Group. This investment includes $2
billion of new equity funding, which will help Flipkart accelerate growth in the future.
We're in discussions with additional potential investors who may join the round,
which could result in our stake moving lower. But we would continue to retain clear
majority ownership. The remainder of the business will be held by Flipkart's existing
shareholders, including Flipkart's Co-Founder, Binny Bansal; Tencent, Tiger Global
and Microsoft. Walmart will ﬁnance the transaction with the combination of newly
issued debt and cash on hand. Upon closing, Flipkart's ﬁnancials will be reported as
part of Walmart International business segment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

Q - Karen Fiona Short
A - Brett M. BiggsFrom an EPS perspective, if the transaction were to close at the end of Q2 FY '19, we
expect a negative impact of ﬁscal 2019 EPS of approximately $0.25 to $0.30, which
includes incremental interest expense related to this investment. In FY '20, as we
look to accelerate growth in this important market, we anticipate an EPS headwind in
total of around $0.60 per share comprised of operating losses of approximately
$0.40 to $0.45 per share. That assumes minimal tax beneﬁt for those losses in the
near to midterm. This amount also includes about $0.05 per share related to
amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of short-lived assets resulting
from purchase accounting which will only last for a few years post-closing and also
includes interest expense of approximately $0.15 per share.
In the mid to long term, as the business scales and eﬃciencies are realized, we
expect losses to decline and returns to improve. Given Walmart's ﬁnancial strength,
we anticipate the continuation of our current share buyback program while
maintaining our strong credit proﬁle. This investment represents a unique
opportunity in a market with signiﬁcant long-term growth prospects. We're investing
in a local leader with strong leadership and a culture of innovation and service. And
Walmart is aligned with a strategic and committed shareholder group focused on
serving customers.
So with that, Doug, Judith and I would be happy to take your questions.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Karen Short with
Barclays.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Just a quick question in terms of the operating losses. So -- and we can all back into
what that implies on a monthly basis in terms of operating losses. But wondering if
you could just talk to the cadence a little bit in terms of how those losses have kind
of cycled like from last year into this year and then maybe talk a little bit about some
of the ways you plan to stem the losses in the past taking -- I mean, greater proﬁts, I
guess?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Hi. Karen, I'll start. This is Brett Biggs. Thanks for joining. The losses that they've had
up to this point, while we're not going to get too much into the historical ﬁnancials of
the company and what we'll look at is going forward, when you -- as you said, when
you look at our numbers, you can back in pretty closely to where we think the losses
will be. We -- as you can imagine, we're going to have to get into the business more;
assess what we think we can do with the business, we've done a lot of that obviously
before we've signed; continue to learn in the market; and continue to give you as
good a visibility as we can going forward. As you know, we typically, this time of year,
wouldn't even give any guidance toward next year. And so we've tried to do thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler
A - Judith McKennabecause of this being a unique situation that we'll continue to update that along with
our company guidance as we go forward. Judith, do you want to talk about what do
you think about the business?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
So just in terms of kind of the business model. One of the reasons we've put the $2
billion of primary in as well is to allow the business to continue to grow for the future.
And that's really important in this market. We believe there are synergies that we will
bring which, over the mid to longer term, mean that we'll see improvements in the
operating model from them. But we're conﬁdent that they've got the right strategy.
And they're doing the right things. And this is really important to us that the Flipkart
team can continue to operate in a way that they have and make sure that the
business is successful.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Karen, were you trying to ask a follow-up? Go ahead if you'd like to, please.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Sorry, yes. I just wanted to ask, I mean, there's been a lot of kind of commentary in
the press about the potential for an IPO down the road as well. Just was wondering if
you could comment on that and if that's something that you think is viable and what
time line that might be.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yes. So we're not giving a time line to that. We're just saying that we're supportive of
management who would like to see that happen in the future. And there's no time
line associated with that at all.
The next question is coming from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
{BIO 1509751 <GO>}
My primary question relates to infrastructure. Can you talk about the company's
current distribution infrastructure and the kind of investments that you'd need to
make to scale it?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yes. So they currently have quite a lot of investment already in the infrastructure. One
of the things that's great about that business is it has a logistics arm to it. And it's
building out. We think that one of the ways that we can help support the business is
with our expertise in supply chain and e-commerce supply chains as well as retail
supply chains. So that's one of the areas we're looking at. We took into account, as
we look to this business, that there will need to be some investment in that area. But
we're comfortable that we've got the right level of investment in that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

And by way of a quick follow-up, globally, you're a big player almost everywhere you
do business in food. And Flipkart doesn't seem to have a big presence in food and
consumables. Can you talk about your plans for that for that, for potentially changing
that in the future? Or do you expect the lines of business to be consistent with where
they are currently?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
The Flipkart team would say that they believe there is good opportunity with the
food in India. And you heard Doug talk about the opportunities for agriculture, for
food within the whole Indian economy. So it is one of those areas that we're growing
an expertise in. And we're excited about how we can help develop in the future.
Next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.
{BIO 15320650 <GO>}
Our question was about the framework around this and thinking about the majority
investment versus the partnership and how you approach the priorities there. And as
you spoke to the retail ecosystem, what are your thoughts on those synergies and
what best practices may be applicable to -- as you think about U.S. Walmart and your
overall bricks and clicks and physical plus digital dots?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Yes, maybe, Judith, I'll comment ﬁrst on the ecosystem. I think China has been quite
informative. If you look at how that market has developed and understand the
relationship between e-commerce and payment marketplace. And e-commerce and
payment. And then look at what this platform represents in India, we pick up a
payment business, a margin business, unit payroll that's helpful, an e-commerce
business and last mile. And so it really was a unique opportunity to put all those
pieces together. And over time, we think they'll be complementary. In the short term,
we're raising to build scale. And so we won't necessarily lean into leverage. I think
right now speed trumps leverage.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yes. And Doug, just to return to the point about why it's 77% and how did that come
about. One of the things that was important to us here was to have some partners
alongside us as well. So having Tencent, Microsoft and Tiger Global, who are already
investors in this business, is really powerful in terms of the model that we're creating.
When we run through an independent board, we will have to have some Walmart
representation on that. But we think that, that structure best will keep the
entrepreneurial spirit of this business and help guide it strategically as well.

OperatorAnd Oliver, as we mentioned, we still are having discussions potentially with other
investors that might come in on the round which will be great. We'll continue to have
control. But if we're at 77%, we're happy with that as well.
Next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Hey guys, kind of a follow-up to that, just on the potential for additional partners to
join. Is that -- from a time line perspective, is that decided upon at closing? Should
we expect -- or could there be news on that prior to closing? Just kind of curious
how that could theoretically play out.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yes. So we said we're in discussions with a number of people. We'll see how that
plays out. And we'll let you know if there's any kind of updates on that.
Next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Can you just oﬀer some perspective on your philosophy about absorbing operating
losses from the business kind of beyond the next two years and how you think about
the governance structure and its inﬂuence on the business between generating
growth and building for the future and managing more intermediate-term
proﬁtability?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, Michael. This is Brett, I'll take the question. As you can imagine, what you just
described is a lot of things that we've been discussing as a management team. And
we've said that before that these are the kind of things that we've been discussing.
And as we went through this process, we're certainly thinking about how to set this
business up 10, 20, 30 years from now to be incredibly successful but also
understanding short-term expectations from shareholders. And we have
expectations of ourselves as well. And so it's really that balance that was a big part of
these discussions. We realize from an investor standpoint, in the short to midterm,
that the dilution is not insigniﬁcant. But when we balance that out with an
opportunity to really be a player with an innovative company with 1.3 billion people,
we felt like this was the right investment at the right time for Walmart.
The next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

Q - Robert Frederick Ohmes
A - C. Douglas McMillon{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
So I had more of a big picture question. As you think about deploying $16 billion in
capital, how did you weigh that versus deploying that in the U.S.? Does it limit your
ability to do more in the U.S.? We saw yesterday that the Uber delivery relationship
was ended according to the press report. Why not use that capital in the U.S. to
shore up same-day delivery? Or do you think you it -- you think U.S. platform is
where it needs to be from a last-mile perspective. You generate $20 billion in free
cash a year. So this would seem to limit another sizable capital deployment in the
near term.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Yes, Chris, this is Doug. I would say that the plans that we have in place reﬂects
ongoing investment in the United States. And it's not our intention to let the business
suﬀer as a result of investments made elsewhere. But we are being choiceful about
resources. I think the announcement in the U.K. is representative of that. So we've
gone through and basically continually go through a process of prioritization to
make sure that our investments are balanced relative to where we see opportunity,
both sales and proﬁt-wise over the mid to long term.
The next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
Hey guys, another kind of big picture question for you, Doug. Maybe a little more
background, a little more on why do this right now. And also, I think Amazon has
shown much stronger market share gains the last couple of years more recently in
India. And Flipkart's market share gains have been slowing. Does Walmart have a
strategy to help Flipkart reaccelerate market share gains in India? And just another
question would be does Flipkart bring anything to Walmart's U.S. business or other
international businesses?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Yes, Robbie, we like Flipkart's plan and the results that we've seen in the business
over the last couple of quarters in particular. And I think it should be emphasized
that this is more than just a marketplace business in e-commerce. The logistics
capability, the payment capability makes this one unique. And so we feel like that
we're going to be able to learn about how pieces of an ecosystem work individually
and collectively and take that learning to other parts of the world. And there is a
strong tech team here. And I've really enjoyed the interaction we've had over the last
few months, including being here this week. And getting to meet them and hear
about some of the innovative things that they're doing across the business, in the
apparel area as well as in payment and e-commerce. So I do believe that we're
going to get learning out of Flipkart that will help the rest of the business. It may also
be worth mentioning that for a long time now, we've had tech resources in India. We
have a sourcing operation here. So we're really familiar with the country, in additionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

And I expect that we'll see people come out of India to help lead parts of our
business as well as tech innovation.
Next question comes from line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.
{BIO 7138867 <GO>}
I had a question and a clariﬁcation in the press release. It talked about -- I guess, I'd
get to the point, are you guys -- are maintaining your credit ratings when you do
this? Or are they going to fall? Then I actually have a question. So a clariﬁcation and
a question.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, Scott, this is Brett. As you could imagine, we've discussed this with our rating
agencies. And I'm sure they'll be issuing reports at some point. But as we've said, our
strong credit rating is important. And we believe with this -- because of what we've
done over the last couple of years from a working capital perspective, we started
bending the cost curve in the business, we've set ourselves up ﬁnancially really
nicely to do this transaction. I believe our credit proﬁle will remain very strong.
{BIO 7138867 <GO>}
Okay. Then for my question. And we've kind of hit on it a little bit. But I mean,
obviously, you guys have done a remarkable job with the U.S. business, at least it's
obvious to us. But also, I think if we take a step back, the investments made overseas
had generally been a little bit more diﬃcult. And we also see the e-commerce has
been losing money for a lot long. And we keep leading to that term. But it really
hasn't happened yet. So I guess -- and we look at the numbers, $28 billion in EBIT in
ﬁscal '14. It looks like it's going to be somewhere like $21 billion in ﬁscal '20. I guess,
I'm just trying to understand, why not deploy capital into your core business in the
U.S. or North America, obviously, Canada and Mexico do really well, too. I'm just
trying to understand the philosophy a little bit better because the track record in the
core competitive advantages you guys have are really in these super centers in
North America or stores in North America. So maybe some comments on that would
be great.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
I'll go ﬁrst. And you guys can chime in if you want to. I think, if you look at
international business, it's important to remember it's not one business really and
evaluate Walmex and Canada, Brazil, independently as you do that. As it relates to
the U.S., I mean, it's obviously very important that we win there. And if we were
looking at this company with, say, a 3; to 5-year horizon, we would invest in the U.S.
and protect the core and maybe consider not doing other things. As I mentioned a
few minutes ago, we've got a plan that relates to the U.S. investment. And we're
comfortable that we can execute that plan and have a bit of a longer-term point of
view beyond 3 to ﬁve years as it relates to setting the company up for growth andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

A - C. Douglas McMillonproﬁts in the future. And when you step back and look at the world, look at all the
countries, their size, their growth rate, their potential, there just aren't opportunities
like the one that we're looking at. India, as a country, the growth rate in GDP, the size
of the market, the growth of middle income, the opportunity that still exists for the
adoption of technology and mobile and then click down to what space would you
want to be in, we're retailers. And if you're going to look at the retail space in India,
the e-commerce marketplace is the place you'd want to be. And the fact that it's got
this fashion business, payment business, logistics business is just an added plus. So if
you're thinking 10 years or beyond, you check the box on the country, you check the
box on the positioning of the businesses and you check the box on the management
team beyond just one person. But a group of people, I think it leads you to a
conclusion that this is the right decision to make and to do this now. And we're
excited about it. And I think you can continue to expect us to have success in the U.S.
at the same time.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yes, Doug, I'd just add to that, which is we continue to be thoughtful about the
choices we make around the portfolio. And the Asda, Sainsbury's decision that we
announced last week is a really good example of that, about how we're ﬁnding
unique solutions around the world to make sure that the capital choices that we
make are the right ones overall.
Next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Just a couple of questions, I'll put it into one. First, I think there was an earlier
question on infrastructure. Curious if having stores one day and Walmart being able
to open stores one day is any part of the consideration. And the second question is,
as you've evaluated this decision with the board and amongst yourselves, I wanted
to ask about the hesitations you may have had from an operating perspective, not
about the losses which you said was a tough decision but just what are the
considerations why this business may or may not scale, if it -- the market doesn't
scale or if the competitive set, just curious what some of those issues may have
been.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Maybe I'll take the last part ﬁrst. I think we are excited about this management team.
And when I think about risks, the ﬁrst one that comes to mind is we've got to balance
the requirement that we will have as it relates to clients, ethics, accounting standards
and controls, all the things that as a company we've been doing for a long time in
lots of markets and understand that this is a business that's still relatively young and
has been focused on customers and, inevitably, there are going to be some
improvements that we want to make there, I'm sure, as we get into the business.
Doing that, at the same time that you enable the freedom to move with speed,

Operatoras it relates to problem-solving. They identify customer problems, other challenges
in the business. And they innovate and they do it quickly. So part of what we're
doing is investing in a country, in a position, certainly, a management team, a
leadership team. But we're also investing in a set of creative problem solvers. So it's
not just what they've done before but what they will do that causes us to be so
optimistic about the opportunity.
The next question is from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.
{BIO 20333664 <GO>}
This is actually Daniel Imbro on for Ben. First, to clarify the other question. To clarify,
you noted the dilution of the transaction will increase in FY '20. Is that just
annualizing the FY '19 impact? Or are there more signiﬁcant incremental investments
that you guys will need to make to support this growth?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Hi. Daniel, this is Brett Biggs. For the most part, it's the annualization of it. So what
you see in FY '19 -- again, we don't know when the transaction will close. But if it were
for 0.5 year, that's a half-year number. But we do anticipate allowing this company to
continue to accelerate its growth. And we'll be supportive of that.
Next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC.
{BIO 1495823 <GO>}
In today's press release, you commented that, over the long term, you expect losses
to decline which, frankly, isn't the same as transitioning to proﬁts. So I guess the
question is, is there a general rule we should be using for either how big you think
this business needs to be to hit breakeven or maybe how far into the future till the
business hits breakeven?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. This is Brett. I appreciate the question. So again, as we've been in India for a
while, we know the market well, we want to make sure that we allow this business to
do everything that it needs to do to grow. The good thing about our business is
we're global, there's a lot of diﬀerent levers that we have to pull and how we balance
this out as a company. But we want to allow this as another part for our business to
do what it needs to grow. As we go through time and as we go through time as a
company, we'll be coming back and talking to you about what our expectations are.
And right now going out to next year is what we feel comfortable talking about at
this time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

A - Judith McKennaThe next question is from the line of Ed Yruma with KeyBanc.
{BIO 4940857 <GO>}
Just 2 quick ones. First, on the $2 billion that's part of the recap here, is that to
accelerate growth? Or is that to kind of oﬀset maybe cash losses in the business?
Then, secondly, how important is the physical retail strategy for the market going
forward?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, on the $2 billion, again, we want to give them every opportunity to do what they
want to do to grow the business. And so it really is to allow them to continue to
accelerate what they're doing.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
And as it relates to -- sorry, Judith, go ahead.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yes, sorry, Doug. Just to say from a retail strategy perspective, clearly, we already
have an Indian business there with 21 cash-and-carry stores. They've returned to
growth recently, opening 5 stores this year. That will continue to run as an
independent part of the business. But we deﬁnitely see in the future, down the line,
that we can use omnichannel experience to see how well we can continue to grow
and ﬁnd innovative ways to serve customers.
The next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.
{BIO 3131258 <GO>}
Just have 2 questions. The ﬁrst one is, when you look at -- in the e-commerce
penetration as a percentage of total retail in India, the last couple of years, 1.8, 1.8,
this year, 2.1, projected to go to 6% over the next ﬁve years. Why do you -- why are
you convinced that, that's going to triple in terms of penetration over the next ﬁve
years? Like what's going to change between now and what's happened in the next
ﬁve years in terms of that penetration rate? And the second question that I have is,
can you just talk to like the competitiveness for talent in that market and your ability
to retain the talent within the Flipkart organization?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yes. So just to talk about the kind of the growth there and what that looks like. What
we've also got to remember is the absolute numbers in India in terms of the total
population as really signiﬁcant. So those percentages are a lot of customers on the
platforms that we are talking about. But in terms of the growth, the information is
that we've got a CAGR in retail about 9% over the next -- last 10 years, e-commerce is
forecast to grow at 4x that rate. You've got a population where it's becoming
increasingly mobile where you've got Internet penetration across the countryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

Q - Edward Joseph Kelly
A - Brett M. Biggsincreasing as well, it's going to be around about 60% by 2020. It's about 30% today.
So all the indicators are there that this will be a market that will accelerate very fast
from an e-commerce perspective. Interestingly, as well, if you look around the world,
if you take a market like China and you think about, six years ago, in China, that was a
cash-on-delivery market. I don't think anybody would have predicted then as to what
it looks like today to be one of the most sophisticated payments markets in the
world. So we're really excited about what that level of growth looks like and what
that will give us. From a team perspective, in terms of retention, it is clearly a
competitive market in India. But Flipkart's already proved itself that it's got a great
tech team. And Doug's just talked about that in some of the talent that's there. We're
excited not only about Binny Bansal who's going to continue to lead as Group CEO.
But the business unit leaders as well. And they have a real depth of talent across the
business. As you'd expect, we're putting the appropriate retention into place to
make sure that people know how excited we are about them continuing in the new
business.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
It's also exciting dimension as it relates to the IPO that we've spoken about in the
future. And I think the other thing that's key is giving them freedom to continue to
innovate and lead. If we over manage this thing, that would be the best way to chase
oﬀ talent. But we're going to be careful not to do that.
Next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
{BIO 21274619 <GO>}
Just 2 questions for you. First, can you take a step back maybe and help us think
about the cash ﬂow proﬁle of Walmart right now? You made signiﬁcant investments
in the U.S. business since 2014. But your free cash ﬂow hasn't skipped a beat, if
anything, it got better. Now you're selling Asda, which is generating cash, buying
Flipkart, it's dilutive. And I don't want to sound short-sighted because I know you're
not going to run your business like that. But how should we think about the free cash
ﬂow proﬁle over the next two years with no other oﬀsets? Then the second question I
have for you, is there any change in how you're thinking about investment in the U.S.
business? So your appetite for near-term losses for the longer-term beneﬁt from the
outside looking in seems to be growing. Does the U.S. business also need more
investment?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. You bet. This is Brett, I'll start oﬀ. From a cash ﬂow perspective. And you pointed
out our cash ﬂow has actually gotten better. So if you look at the last two years and
combine the last two years, we've generated almost $60 billion of operating cash
ﬂow. CapEx has actually come down a little bit as we're building fewer stores. We're
investing our CapEx diﬀerently. But it's come down, actually a little bit signiﬁcantly
over the last 3 or four years. So as we go forward, we're going to balance. Again,
we've got a lot of diﬀerent things that we can do, a lot of diﬀerent ways for us to
balance what we want to do long term with short term and midterm expectations.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

Q - Charles P. Grom
A - Judith McKennaAnd that, as a management team, that's what we spend a lot of time on is making
those decisions. From an investor standpoint, what I believe you should be
encouraged by is that we are making decisions. There are times today where we're
going to make a big investment; there's times we're saying we're going to invest
diﬀerently or we're going to get out of a situation. I think you've seen us do both of
those. And so we're trying to take a balanced approach as we go into the future.
Doug, I don't know if you want to talk about the U.S. business, your thoughts.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Yes, sure. I think the U.S. plan continues to include some level of price investments
which we manage very closely. You know that we made some additional changes to
wages that we shared a few months ago. We'll continue to see that through. No new
news as it relates to that. Then as it relates to U.S. e-commerce, if you look back over
the last few years, we've been telling you hey, we've got to get our fulﬁllment centers
open, which we've done. We've got to get our e-commerce tech platform in place,
which we've done, continues to be enhanced. But it's there. I'm excited about the
web reset -- design reset that we did just recently. The other things that have to be
done that are not behind us are we've got to have the assortment that customers are
looking for. And we've got to be able to deliver it on time when they expect it. And
we still have room to improve as it relates to those 2 dimensions. Mark, in the past,
has talked to you about our customer value index, habit and delivered are the 2
areas that we're focused on in particular. So we still have an appetite for acquisitions
that make sense that help us accelerate on the assortment side, which not only
drives the top line but also helps us with margin speciﬁcally as we work our way
towards proﬁtability in the U.S. e-commerce.
The next question is from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett.
{BIO 1450381 <GO>}
First, congrats on the transaction. I'm sure a lot went into it. When you think about
the beneﬁts from the deal, I'm curious what you think Flipkart can actually bring back
to your U.S. business, similar to kind of when you acquired Jet with Marc. Are there
any intellectual capital opportunities, category opportunities for the company? Then
second, when I think about the deal, how will Flipkart, the Flipkart team work with
Marc in the U.S. team? Are they going to be separate? Will they be working
together?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
This is Judith. So if you think about the beneﬁts from the deal, I think we've outlined
what some of the key things around this business that particularly interested us. Not
only is it the innovative problem-solving culture that they have. But they do some
great work, both in the artiﬁcial intelligence space, how they're using data across
their platforms. But particularly in terms of the payment platform that they've created
through the business called PhonePe. I think all of those things we can learn from,
from the future and see how that we can leverage those around the international
markets and potentially into the U.S. as well. The business will be run as part of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

Operatorinternational segment. But actually it's an independent part of that, going through a
really important board structure. Marc and the team will help provide advice to that.
And equally, the team, I'm sure, will spend some time with them over the future. But
it's very much a separate business. And we want it to retain that way to keep that
spirit of entrepreneurship very clear. Just as we did. And Doug was very clear about,
when we did the Jet acquisition as well.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
I would just add that Mark has been helpful to Judith, Brett and I and the rest of the
team as it relates to understanding the Flipkart business, digging deep into it. He
made a trip to India with Judith and I awhile back. He spent time with the Flipkart
team in the United States and is supportive of the transaction. But we, Marc and I and
the rest of the team, are very clear that we want Marc focused on the United States
with the vast majority of his time. Maybe someday, we might involve him in more. But
right now, there's plenty to do in the U.S.. And that's what he's focused on.
Next question comes from the line of Greg Malik with MoﬀettNathanson.
{BIO 22796815 <GO>}
I want to follow up on something on the ﬁrst paragraph of the press release, which
was talking about -- or second -- that majority ownership would be key. But also
being -- the ambition of being publicly traded or being a listed ﬁrm in India. Why is
that important? Is it there to help keep the talent and to get it onboard? Is Walmex a
good example there? And does that mean that Flipkart ultimately could be a brand
taken outside of India?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Greg, it's Judith. Yes, I think you're thinking about that in the right way, which is that
not only is that something that the management team there would be very interested
in doing. But we also have one of our models of operating around the world,
Walmex. And that's proved today an incredibly successful business for us. So it aligns
with the management team's ambitions, it aligns with an operating model that we
are used to and comfortable with working with. So there's no time frame on that. But
I think it is something that, for the future, we are considering.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
And Greg, I think as you look at the last week now, it's a good example of how the --
it's a good example of how we are thinking about partnerships diﬀerently and we're
willing to look at diﬀerent structures around the world.

Q - Daniel Thomas Binder

A lot of my questions have been answered. But I wanted more of a detailed
question. Can you talk a little bit about just kind of the ﬁnancing of the deal and the
mix of debt versus cash that you're planning to use? And I know you talked about
still maintaining your -- the buyback program. Can we discuss maybe the ﬂow of that,
like in how that might look this year versus what you -- we all probably thought it
would have looked like?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, Joe, I'll take that. As we -- as you think about where -- again, where we've been
over the last couple of years, our credit metrics are better today than they were two
years ago. And so that's given us stability. And this is a good time for us to do a
transaction like this. As we think about share buyback going forward, as we
mentioned, we believe we can continue our share buyback roughly as we talked
about with you in October and continue to maintain a really good credit proﬁle. As
to the mix of debt and cash, there's a number of diﬀerent ways that this could take
shape, as you imagine, we'll do what ends up being the best for the company with
that mix of some excess cash that we have around the world, the tax reform now
makes it a little bit easier to access than maybe in the past, along with some diﬀerent
sources of debt. And we'll be -- you'll be seeing more of that in the coming period of
time.
Next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jeﬀeries.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more speciﬁcally about what kind of top
line growth you're expecting over the next 12 months. I think you said 4x retail. But I
don't really know what that rate is exactly. So maybe a little bit more speciﬁcity
around that. Then if you could discuss what the greatest sources of losses are in the
business and how that may change if the growth rate is either softer or stronger than
you expected. Then I have a follow-up.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Hi. Dan, this is Brett. So from a growth perspective, we haven't given guidance on
that. We did talk about what the growth has been over the last year, around 50%
both in GMV and sales. And so we won't be talking about that today. From a loss
perspective, there's a number of diﬀerent things that go into that we won't go in as
we won't go into a detailed review of the various parts of the P&L. No diﬀerent than
what you see in most e-commerce companies where they have to make decisions
around margin, marketing and other things from an e-commerce perspective and
ensure that they can allow the business to grow and get the scale that they want to.
So it's not that diﬀerent from other e-commerce businesses that you would have
seen.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-09

Okay. Then my follow-up is around how Flipkart distinguishes itself in the market,
why do customers shop them. And if you can incorporate into that the level of
competitiveness in the market -- I don't know if you want to do that -- relative to the
U.S. or some other way that we could better understand what they're up against.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
One of the things about Flipkart is it's a local Indian kind of business that's been built
from the ground up. And it's incredibly customer-centric within that. And we think
that is one of the things that really sets it apart in this market is that it understands its
customer, it's built an infrastructure to get items to those customers and, thirdly, the
fact that it's building out this e-commerce -- this e-payments platform which
connects back into the banking system and allows easy transfer of payments on an
open-source system. So we think it's got some key components of the business that
come together. And the other part about it is it's got an incredibly strong, growing
apparel business as well, which is an important part of the mix for the overall health
of the business. So it's got 3 key streams, it's got Flipkart, it's got apparel and it's got
PhonePe as well which, together, we think is a unique combination within that
market. From a competitiveness perspective, all of the buckets we operate in around
the world are pretty competitive. And we've got a lot of learnings from the China
market, in diﬀerent places. But that's why we're excited about Flipkart is because of
what it brings to be competitive in that market.
Our last question is coming from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
Just wanted to get some additional clariﬁcation on a topic that was brought up
earlier. Just as we think about this transaction coupled with what's going on in the
U.K., Brett, if you can just circle back and help us understand what the free cash ﬂow
proﬁle as well as CapEx, how is that changing as we think about ﬁscal '19 and '20
versus prior plans that were provided? And lastly, how should we think about the
reporting of this segment in the business overall? What type of details will you
continue to provide on a go-forward basis? Or how will it be integrated into the
global GMV number and other metrics that you all provide?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Paul. So from a free cash ﬂow perspective, let me start with that. I've
been giving you what we have on EPS and operating income into FY '20 to give you
a pretty good idea of what you can expect from a cash ﬂow perspective. E-
commerce businesses typically aren't this capital-intensive as you see with brick-and-
mortar because of the stores you build, brick-and-mortar, there's fulﬁllment other
things like that. So there's a diﬀerent proﬁle to those types of businesses and,
certainly, we thought about that as we look at our free cash ﬂow proﬁle going
forward. We're not going to give any more detail from a free cash ﬂow perspective
