Welcome to the Amazon.com Annual Meeting of Shareholders. I'm David Zapolsky,
Senior Vice President and General Counsel. I now call the formal portion of this
meeting to order. This is our 26th Annual Meeting since we became a public
company. Today's agenda covers our items of business and rules of procedure.
Please note that in the event an unanticipated issue prevents us from being able to
continue this Annual Meeting, we will post updated meeting information on our
Investor Relations website.
After the proposals have been presented, we will have a presentation by Brian
Olsavsky, our CFO. Angie Quinnell[ph], Director of Financial Communications, will
then moderate the Q&A session with Andy Jassy, our CEO. Angie, can you provide
details on how to submit a question?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

to the meeting, please type your question into the ask a question ﬁeld on the
website you've used to access this meeting and click submit. Out of respect for your
fellow shareholders, we ask that each person be concise and limit themselves to one
question.
{BIO 5884426 <GO>}
Thank you. It's now my pleasure to introduce our Directors who are attending this
meeting, including those joining us remotely. Jeﬀ Bezos, Andy Jassy, Keith
Alexander, Edith Cooper, Jamie Gorelick, Daniel Huttenlocher, Judy McGrath, Indra
Nooyi, Jon Rubinstein, Patty Stonesifer, and Wendell Weeks. Also joining us remotely
today are representatives of our auditors, Ernst & Young.
The polls opened for voting on all matters at the beginning of the meeting and we
will close the polls after presentation of today's proposals. The proposals to be voted
on today are set forth in our proxy statement. If you wish to vote during the meeting,
please follow the instructions on the meeting website before the polls close. If you
have already voted in advance of the meeting, you do not need to vote again unless
you requested a legal proxy or wish to change your vote.
A representative of Broadridge was appointed our inspector of elections, has taken
the required oath, and has certiﬁed that notice of this meeting was mailed beginning
on April 13, 2023 to all shareholders of record as of the record date, and that a
majority of our common stock is present or represented by proxies. Therefore, a
quorum exists for the meeting.
I'll now introduce the company's proposals, which are the Election of Directors, the
ratiﬁcation of the appointment of Ernst & Young as independent auditors for ﬁscal
2023, an advisory vote to approve executive compensation, an advisory vote on the
frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation, and the reapproval of
our 1997 stock incentive plan as amended and restated for purposes of French tax
law.
We have 18 shareholder proposals to be voted on, if properly presented. To ensure
that we have adequate time for our Q&A session later in the meeting, each
proponent will have two minutes to present their proposal. If a proponent goes
beyond two minutes, we will need to place the line on mute so that we can continue
the meeting. Thank you in advance for your understanding. Grant Bradski will now
introduce Proposal number 6, requesting a report on retirement option -- retirement
plan options. Mr.Bradski has pre-recorded the following statements.

Laith Abadis of the utmost importance as it asks the critical question, how will Amazon protect
its employees' life savings from the economic consequences of climate change?
Climate change poses material risk to retirement plan beneﬁciaries. The CDP reports
that 215 global companies, including Amazon, have almost $1 trillion at risk from
climate impacts, with many losses expected within the next ﬁve years. More than half
of Amazon employees are invested in the company's default target date option,
which is heavily exposed to high carbon and deforestation intensive industries.
These investments contribute to climate change, create systemic portfolio risk, and
are poor long-term investments for younger beneﬁciaries whose retirement beneﬁts
are likely to be harmed due to climate-related ﬁnancial losses.
Amazon knows we must address climate risks head-on. It's why shareholders are
proud of our company's climate goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025 and its $2
billion investment in the Climate Pledge Fund, which was created to encourage
businesses to reach net zero by 2040.
Yet, how will we meet these goals if Amazon is at the same time directing over $1
billion of employee 401(k) savings into fossil fuels and burning down the Amazon?
These investments undermine the company's climate goals, expose employees'
savings to ﬁnancial risk, and harm the company's reputation on climate, which may
make it diﬃcult to attract and retain top employee talent and could expose the
company to litigation risk, as occurred recently.
Just as Amazon has taken operational climate action, shareholders ask that Amazon
now begin to address the climate impacts of the billions of dollars being invested in
fossil fuels by our retirement plan. This will not only protect our company from the
economic impacts of climate change, but protect our employees' life savings from
these same risks. Thank you.

Thank you. Laith Abad will now introduce Proposal number 7, requesting a report on
customer due diligence. Operator, please open the line for Mr.Abad.
Good morning. My name is Laith Abad, and I'm a software engineer at Amazon
Games and a ﬁrst-generation Palestinian-American. I'm here to present resolution 7
on behalf of the American Baptist Home Mission Society and co-ﬁlers. The proposal
calls on Amazon to commission an independent third-party report on its process for
customer due diligence to determine whether customers' use of its surveillance
products and services contributes to human rights violations.
As an Amazon employee, I can say conﬁdently that my coworkers and I want to work
at a company that stands for the human rights of all people. Proponents again oﬀer

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 4 of 27David A. Zapolsky
Dana Flobergrisk technologies and contracts with government agencies and strengthen due
diligence processes in areas where there are gaps.
Technologies like Ring Doorbell and facial recognition can be used to increase
widespread surveillance, which furthers racist policing, infringes on privacy, and
violates the human rights of communities of color. As a Palestinian American, I'm
especially concerned with Amazon's contract with the Israeli military and
government known as Project Nimbus.
This contract provides powerful technology to an army accused of war crimes and a
government that's enforcing or oppressive system of apartheid, a crime against
humanity, according to Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, the UN, the Israeli Human
Rights Organization, B'Tselem, and others. Palestinian families live every day under
deeply intrusive surveillance, fear of violence, being forced from their homes, and
even death.
My own father was ethnically cleansed from his homeland of Palestine by the Israeli
government, as well as many other relatives. This is deeply personal, and I know I'm
not alone. As Amazon employees, we want to ensure that the tech we build and sell
doesn't harm our own communities and those of our users. Shareholders and
employees want to see Amazon take responsibility and lead the way on ending tech-
driven human rights abuses.
Amazon's business should support human dignity and a fair and just society for all
people, not power oppression, division, and discrimination. I hereby move Proposal
7, which requests a customer due diligence report. Thank you.
{BIO 5884426 <GO>}
Thank you. Dana Floberg will now introduce Proposal 8, requesting reporting on
content and product removal restrictions. Ms.Floberg has pre-recorded the following
statement.
Hello, my name is Dana Floberg. I'm the advocacy Director at OpenMic, and I'm here
to present Item number 8 regarding transparency reporting on removal and
restriction of content. The proposal asks the Board to revise the company's
transparency reporting to include quantitative data regarding content and products
the company removes in response to or in anticipation of government requests.
Reporting suggests that the company has removed products and censored user
content on Amazon's e-commerce platform at the behest of authoritarian
governments and in excess of the requirements of local laws.
Investors require improved transparency reporting in order to adequately assess
whether Amazon is acting in compliance with its internationally recognized human
rights commitments. Without this transparency, the company is likely to be theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

Page 5 of 27David A. Zapolsky
Paul Chessercontinued target of negative press and lawsuits that stand to substantially harm
performance.
The speciﬁc improvements requested by the proposal are standard across e-
commerce platforms and other technology companies, meaning that Amazon's
current reporting falls far short of peer companies such as Alphabet, Apple and
Meta, earning it the moniker of by far the least transparent U.S. based tech company
from independent analysts at non-proﬁt ranking digital rights.
Despite this, the company has refused to engage with the proponents of this
proposal. The proponents expressed every interest in discussing our concerns with
leadership, but instead the company chose to reject the proposal out of hand
without even a conversation with investors. We believe improved transparency
would be in the best interests of Amazon and its shareholders. I urge shareholders to
vote for Item 8 to improve the company's transparency reporting.
{BIO 5884426 <GO>}
Thank you. Paul Chesser will now introduce Proposal number 9, requesting a report
on content removal requests. Mr.Chesser has pre-recorded the following statement.
Amazon totally misses our point in its statement of opposition to our proposal, which
asks for a report on requests the company has received from all branches of the U.S.
Government. All we ask is for the company to list incidents in which a government
oﬃcial has requested content to be removed from Amazon's platforms. But Amazon
throws a bunch of lawyerly language about irrelevant policies and procedures in its
opposition statement to distract from our simple request.
For the purposes of our proposal's request, my organization doesn't care about
Amazon's sales policies. Likewise, my organization doesn't care about Amazon's
legal compliance measures. And my organization doesn't care about Amazon's
content guidelines, and my organization doesn't care about Amazon's community
guidelines. We also don't care how Amazon enforces any of these policies and
guidelines.
To summarize and simplify, all we care about for the purpose of this proposal is for
Amazon to tell us who in the federal government has asked for content removal,
when these government oﬃcials did it, how Amazon responded to these
government oﬃcials, and why the company responded the way it did.
All the information we ask for is irrelevant to any policies and processes Amazon
cites in its opposition statement to our proposal. There is nothing that prevents the
company from providing this information with perhaps a few exceptions in law
enforcement situations. But those by far don't account for the majority of requests
Amazon has received to censor content.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

David A. ZapolskyAnd believe me, this is about illegal and unconstitutional censorship, not about law
enforcement. Amazon obviously does not want to disclose this information. As we
learned from the Twitter ﬁles, big tech companies willfully complied in working with
government to censor based on speech and ideology. So consequently, we now ask,
who in the government is Amazon covering up for. Please vote for Proposal number
9.

Thank you. Rajpal Singh will now introduce Proposal number 10 requesting
additional reporting on stakeholder impacts. Operator please open the line for
Mr.Singh.
{BIO 22105576 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Rajpal Singh. I've worked as a driver for Amazon's
delivery service provider in Palmdale, California for 2.5 years. I'm among the 80
brave drivers who recently joined the Teamsters Union. I'm here to formally move
Item 10, which calls for a just climate transition strategy for Amazon workers like me.
Amazon boasts about its climate pledge, but this company is silent on how its
climate strategy will be fair and just to workers and our communities. Amazon is one
of the world's largest employers with over a 1.5 million workers. The workers cannot
be overlooked. What should adjust transition look like for drivers like me? It means
not penalizing us for returning undelivered packages when it's unsafe to work
outside in brutal 100-plus degree wet heat. And my coworkers and I work in desert
conditions, so we experience this ﬁrsthand. It demands Amazon recognize we are
Amazon employees. After all, we wear Amazon uniforms and drive Amazon vans for
a DSP that Amazon controls.
Amazon pledges to electrify its last mile delivery vehicles, but denies responsibility
for those deliveries. Amazon needs to answer how, with 3,000 DSPs, it will electrify
these ﬂeets without unjustly placing the cost on DSPs and workers. A just transition
begins with respecting workers' rights to organize and collectively bargain to ensure
they have a seat at the table.
There can be no just transition at Amazon if as a decarbonizes the company
continues to trample over the rights of its workers. A just transition begins with
respecting and listening to workers like me. It certainly doesn't begin by threatening
to take our jobs away. We are ﬁghting back. You can stand with us by donating at
http://ibt.io/adsolidarityfund. Amazon doesn't listen, it doesn't respect and that's
why I urge shareholders to support Item 10. Thank you.

David A. Zapolsky
Bruce HerbertFellow shareholders and members of the Board of Directors. My name is Father
Seamus Finn and I'm here on behalf of the Greater Manchester Pension Fund,
Amundi Asset Management and the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate to
move shareholder proposal Number 11. Our proposal calls on Amazon to align with
other leading multinational companies and use the Global Reporting Initiative tax
standard. The GRI is the most widely used sustainability standard and is the only
comprehensive global tax reporting standard today.
A transition to the GRI standard will not require a drastic transformation for our
company. Our company already submits country by country reporting to OECD tax
authorities.
The GRI standard provides transparency of our company's approach to the taxes, tax
governance, controls and risk management, and public country by country
reporting. In a world faced by multiple crisis, the scrutiny of corporate tax payments
is likely to increase year-on-year. If investors are to make informed assessment of
Amazon's tax strategy and evaluations of the company's tax risks, we need accurate,
accessible and transparent data on a country by country basis.
Tax authorities are already starting to mandate greater transparency and
accountability in corporate tax reporting and in Australia to soon make public
country by country reporting mandatory. We believe that companies demonstrating
leadership stand to beneﬁt from staying ahead of the curve. We encourage the
Board to be thoughtful leaders and embrace tax transparency and we urge fellow
shareholders to vote for shareholder Proposal number 11. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Bruce Herbert will now introduce Proposal number 12 requesting
additional reporting on climate lobbying. Mr.Herbert has pre-recorded the following
statements.
{BIO 20126898 <GO>}
Thank you and good morning. I am Bruce Herbert of Newground Social Investment
and I stand to move Proposal number 12, the climate lobbying proposal, on behalf of
Newground and the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Proposal
12 seeks consistency and leadership from Amazon in aligning its political inﬂuence
activities with the company's established climate change goals. First, let me
commend Amazon for taking a leadership stance in declaring a net zero by 2040
target for its greenhouse gas emissions. Industry peers and NGO experts recognize
that a favorable and consistent regulatory environment is critical to achieving
important climate targets.
The challenge is that numerous trade associations which receive funding from
Amazon do not themselves believe in climate change. Examples include theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 8 of 27David A. Zapolsky
Ronald SewellAmerican Enterprise Institute, the Americans for Tax Reform and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, which between them have received failing marks for denying climate
science, funding a host of anti-climate organizations and frequently acting as if paid
lobbyists for the oil and gas industry.
But policy misalignment also happens when companies say one thing, then just do
another without third-party interference, which we see Amazon and others
repeatedly doing. Details on this are in a formal report we recently submitted to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Three responses are needed to counter
the threat posed by misalignment between our company and the actions of trade
associations and other rogue parties.
First, the company needs to assess and report to shareholders on its political
inﬂuence activities. However, in a manner that highlights where there is divergence
between company goals and the undermining activities these groups are taking.
Second, the company needs to articulate and report on what steps it takes when it
does ﬁnd divergence between itself and those that receive funding from Amazon.
Merely saying there's a diﬀerence of opinion does not address misalignment.
Lastly, in all quadrants, Amazon needs to insist on a level playing ﬁeld, one that
ensures all parties are aligned around critical climate priorities, so others cannot take
shortcuts which disadvantage pledged companies like Amazon. In closing, there's
grave need for consistency, alignment, and rapid progress on tackling climate
change. We report this proposal requests is needed because the company's direct
actions are often not consistent with its stated policies, and the positions taken by
groups that Amazon funds are often outrageously hostile to Amazon's public
commitments. Therefore, please join us in voting for Proposal number 12. Thank you.

Amazon.
As an associate and shareholder, I want Amazon to be a better company and place
to work. That's why my coworkers and I are organizing to improve our working
conditions. As the cost of living rises, we are struggling to support our families due
to low wages, unstable schedules, and a lack of upward mobility. While Amazon

Sarah Rehbergassociates don't feel like they have a path forward, they leave contributing to
Amazon turnover problems.
Amazon continue to only report its statistically adjusted pay gaps, which assesses
whether minorities and women are paid the same as their white male peers within
the same roles. This data does not account for who holds what jobs, ignoring the
structural racism, sexism that can relegate people of color and women into low-
paying job categories.
A general capital proposal asks for median pay data so investors can understand
who has access to the higher paying position at Amazon and how that changes over
time. Currently, at least 40 U.S. companies have committed to reporting on median
pay data. Warehouse associates and shareholders would like to see Amazon do the
same. Thank you for your support of transparent and honest pay equity accounting.

Thank you. Sarah Rehberg will now introduce Proposal number 14, requesting an
analysis of costs associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
Ms.Rehberg has pre-recorded the following statement.
Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of Item
number 14, which would require a cost-beneﬁt analysis of the company's DEI
programs. The company's DEI webpage sets forth several commitments to
increasing representation of women and black employees in certain positions. But
what DEI policies such as these overlook is that there is much disagreement across
the ideological spectrum over whether instead of combating discrimination, DEI
practices actually create a discriminatory environment due to its insistence on
placing service level characteristics, such as race and sex, above merit. In doing so,
DEI policies can lead to discrimination against groups that the company doesn't
recognize as diverse.
That's why our proposal seeks to ensure that all employees, not just those deemed
diverse by the company, feel included and receive equal treatment when it comes to
workplace dynamics and career advancement. The company's statement in
opposition to our proposal states that its policies and procedures are intended to
foster diversity and inclusion and promote respect for all people. But it's diﬃcult to
see how the company's DEI initiatives fosters diversity, inclusion, and respect for all
individuals when it sets hiring goals based on race and sex.
Whatever the intention, surface characteristic-based hiring creates a discriminatory
environment where it is impossible for all employees to feel truly included and
respected.

Thank you. James McRitchie will now introduce Proposal number 15, requesting an
amendment to our bylaws to require shareholder approval for certain future
amendments. Mr.McRitchie has pre-recorded the following statement.
{BIO 5114010 <GO>}
In 2002, I petitioned the SEC for proxy access. It took three rule makings and a court
battle, but 20 years later, 81% of S&P 500 companies have something called proxy
access. Unfortunately, almost all bylaws require nominating groups hold 3% for three
years and groups are limited to 20 members.
Proxy access can't really be done without at least one of the big four. I administer
retirement savings plans for companies and have never even ﬁled a shareholder
proposal. So proxy access has gone unused. Now, after decades, the SEC adopted
Rule 14A19, allowing shareholders to split our votes between Board nominees and
challengers without attending annual meetings.
But shareholders are concerned that universal proxy rule will go the way of so-called
proxy access. After reading bylaws adopted by Massimo, Bloomberg's Matt Levine
wrote that company bylaws might demand challengers submit disclosures on paper
woven from unicorn manes, with requirements waived for the Board nominees.
There should be some limits on what Boards can require without seeking
shareholder approval in advance, or at least within a year or so after adoption.
I ﬁled 30 proposals like the one before you, we reached agreements at about one
third of the companies based on guardrails that preserve the rules intent. All
shareholder proposals are advisory, even if we win overwhelmingly here, Boards are
free to ignore them or to adopt whatever they please. Your vote for this proposal can
help us reach a similar agreement at Amazon, either before the next annual meeting
or after an even higher vote next year, based on a revised proposal that reﬂects
agreements reached with other companies to protect the rights of shareholders.

Isaiah Thomaspublicly says it respects workers' rights to freedom of association and collective
bargaining.
Despite Amazon's public commitment, Amazon workers have accused the company
of conduct that violates both ILO conventions and national law protecting freedom
of association and collective bargaining rights.
Many workers experience Amazon anti-union tactics including intimidation,
retaliation, and division every day. I have experienced these tactics when I was
terminated in 2020 after working four and a half years of Amazon for speaking out
over health and safety.
On April 1 of 2022, the workers of JFK Fulﬁllment Center on Staten Island voted to
become the ﬁrst union in American history for Amazon. However, during this
historical campaign, Amazon spent over $14.2 million of your money battling its
workers who just want to exercise their fundamental right to form a union. Without a
union, Amazon workers will not be able to collectively defend their rights as workers
and establish better working conditions, better pay, and better beneﬁts.
Our eﬀorts here in America have been felt around the globe. Many workers are now
ﬁghting to form their own unions in their country as well. The movement will only
continue to grow. Our struggle has been felt by many shareholders of Amazon who
demand accountability for the way it treats its workers today. I am moving Proposal
number 16, calling on the Board to conduct a third-party assessment of Amazon's
adherence to stated commitment to workers' freedom of association and collective
bargaining rights, including the respect of the International Labor Organization core
labor standards. The ALU and 8,300 members that I represent here in Staten Island

Jacqueline SadashigeIn 2021, Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy received over $212 million in total
compensation. This was 6,474x the total compensation of Amazon's median
employee in 2021. While Amazon CEO to worker pay ratio fell in 2022, we believe
that Amazon's history of high CEO pay shows why this proposal is necessary. The
pay ratio between the CEO and the company's employees matters to me and my co-
workers at Amazon.
I can tell you that a high CEO to worker pay ratio hurts our morale as employees.
Like Amazon CEO, we deserve a fair return on our work. According to the proxy
statement, Amazon CEO pay is set using a peer group. Even if you target CEO pay at
the peer group average, other companies may cherry pick their peers to select
companies with higher CEO pay.
As a result, CEO pay is guaranteed to rise for all peer group companies. I and my co-
workers believe that all Amazon employees deserve to be paid fairly in accordance
with the demanding work that we do. Amazon depends on the contributions of its
entire workforce to succeed. All we ask is that you consider whether the CEO pay is
in alignment with the rest of the workforce. For those reasons, we urge you to vote in
favor of this proposal. Thank you.

additional reporting on animal welfare standards. Ms.Sadashige has pre-recorded
the following statements.
Whole foods misleadingly claims that its animal welfare standards for meat and other
animal-derived products are stronger than most anywhere, encompass how the
animals are raised, transported, and slaughtered, and that a traceable audit system
tracks animals from birth to slaughter. Yet Whole Foods has a history of selling
animal-derived products from suppliers implicated in an array of atrocities to
animals.
At Whole Foods' self-proclaimed supplier of Happy Meat, Sweet Stem Farm, sick and
injured pigs languished for weeks without veterinary care, several with bloody rectal
prolapses. Chickens at Nellie's Free Range Eggs, another Whole Foods supplier, had
the tips of their beaks cut oﬀ to prevent stress-induced cannibalism. Last October,
following a PETA investigation into a Whole Foods supplier, Pennsylvania State Police
ﬁled 141 cruelty charges, more than in any case of cruelty to factory-farmed animals
in U.S. history, against 12 former workers at Plainville Farms, a company claiming to
produce humane turkey.
Workers repeatedly and viciously kicked and stomped on turkeys each night, and
birds convulsed after workers tried but failed to break their necks. Two workers were

Endangered pigtail macaques are illegally snatched from the wild, chained,

history of selling meat and other animal-derived products from suppliers in blatant
violation of its animal welfare standards jeopardizes our company's reputation. We

political activity and expenditures, governmental regulations, international relations,

public reputation, and the shareholders' long-term value.
Many public policy issues have been frequently voted at our shareholders' meetings.
7% of the companies in the S&P 500 have a separate Board committee responsible
for public policy. For example, Microsoft established a Regulatory and Public Policy
Committee in 2012 besides Governance and the Nomination Committee.
Considering Amazon's giant size and the complex operations of business worldwide,
even if only 0.7% of the companies in the S&P 500 have a public policy committee,
Amazon must be one of them. Thank you very much.

Yvonda CloptonAmazon has failed to take meaningful steps to amplify worker voice at the
management level despite the fact that the channeling worker voice serves as a key
tool for mitigating investor risk. On the contrary, in the years since I last presented to
Amazon shareholders, the company has doubled down on a strategy to stiﬂing
worker voice and burying growing dissent, which is generating increased
reputational and operational risk to the company.
On the heels of last year's successful vote to unionize Amazon Staten Island, instead
of responding with good-faith negotiations, they challenged with litigation. Instead
of stiﬂing worker voice, which could enable management to address worker
concerns before they grow into PR disasters, Amazon should listen to us.
We are speaking up about grueling hours, backbreaking physical labor, and fears of
time oﬀ task. Employees should have a voice with the Board and upper
management so that these punishing labor practices are addressed head on, rather
than hidden in ways that ultimately come to light.
In fact, things are getting worse at Amazon. Leaked internal memo warned that the
company could run out of workers in certain key markets in the next two years. This is
not a good look for the company, because the media, public, and lawmakers are
listening to us. The need for worker representation on the Amazon Board is greater
than ever today. It will create a sea change opening the doors for management to
understand our needs. Vote for Proposal number 20 and we can make sure that the
leadership understands its most important asset, the workers. Thank you.

Good morning. My name is Yvonda Clopton and I'm an Amazon Associate for St.
Louis, Missouri. Today I'm speaking in support of Proposal number 21, requesting
that the Board of Directors commission an independent audit and report of Amazon
warehouse working conditions. Why am I speaking in support of this proposal?
Because right now Amazon warehouses aren't safe for workers like myself. How do I
know this? I've seen it ﬁrsthand. Amazon high work rates and heavy surveillance are
driving workers' injuries. I've worked at Amazon for ﬁve years. I'm capped out in my
pay, and I feel dead when I leave work every day. At night, I go home and soak in a
tub of Epsom salt to just get myself back together so I can start all over again.
Otherwise, I don't think I could get out of bed. But this isn't just happening in my

warehouse industry. Nine OSHA investigations found the level of injury risk at
Amazon violated the law, and 10 states have introduced new bills to limit warehouse

late for the company to prioritize both worker safety and proﬁtability. Amazon has
the resources and ingenuity to pay workers a living wage and to run the safest

Thank you. Conrad MacKerron will now introduce Proposal number 22, requesting a
report on packaging materials. Operator, please open the line for Mr.MacKerron.
Good morning. I'm Conrad MacKerron Senior Vice President of As You Sow,
representing George Gund Foundation, the ﬁnal Proposal 22. I'm here today to
present for the third year a proposal asking the company to make a commitment to a
signiﬁcant reduction in its use of plastic packaging.
Amazon's substantial use of plastic exposes the company to increased ﬁnancial and
reputational risk. It lags at least 17 other consumer goods companies, including
Walmart and Target, who have established virgin plastic reduction goals. Plastic
pollution is a continuing international environmental crisis, drawing top-of-mind
attention from governments and citizens.
Next week, negotiators from around the globe will gather in Paris to advance a
binding global treaty to reduce plastic pollution. Meanwhile, our company provides
only piecemeal disclosure about its use of plastic and has declined to commit to
setting a speciﬁc plastic reduction goal.
Last year, Amazon ﬁnally released limited data about its plastic use but still does not
provide an overall baseline amount of plastic used throughout its supply chain. The
company disputes the ﬁndings of environmental group Oceana, which has
published separately generated estimates of how much plastic the company uses.
But Amazon has resisted for years providing speciﬁc data to counter the Amazon
data and allow investors to accurately assess its progress.
Last year, this proposal received an impressive 49% support, more than any other
ESG proposal on the proxy, indicating that many of the company's biggest investors
see it as an important priority. We urge investors to again send a strong message to
management that if it wants to be an environmental leader, it must commit to a
signiﬁcant reduction in its use of plastic and provide comprehensive data on use. So
investors can accurately assess its progress in reducing plastic pollution. We urge
your support for and I hereby move Proposal 22. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

Hello. In recognition of this proposal's inclusion in the proxy material for ﬁve
consecutive years, today I deliver to you a special message from Harrington
Investments. Dear Amazon, it's our anniversary. Yes, we are celebrating, with or
without you.
We prefer that you participate, but we've learned that despite what you tell
shareholders, you really don't want our input. You state you're willing to work
constructively to address realistic issues and work towards solutions, while we, the
proponents, appear unwilling to acknowledge any action short of ceasing to oﬀer
recognition as suﬃcient. Then, you declare Amazon as being an active participant in
and contributor to these conversations around the responsible development and
use of AI and helping lead the industry in these important conversations. But how
can this be true when we, the proponent, are disregarded entirely?
When our, albeit strained, relationship came about in 2019, we envisioned this
journey as an opportunity for growth, learning, and collaboration. So much has
transpired since then. Black Lives Matter movement, a global pandemic, the Russian
invasion of Ukraine. Yet after all we've been through and in the face of the
groundswell of support that continues to surge in favor of a resolution, Amazon
remains steadfast in its opposition to the modest measures requested.
Whether or not you choose to engage with Harrington Investments, we too remain
steadfast. Steadfast that an independent study on recognition is warranted and
necessary to ensure earnest eﬀorts are taken to thoroughly assess threats
recognition potentially poses to civil liberties, freedom, and society at large. To
dismiss these concerns is dangerous more now than ever. There is so much we
cannot possibly foresee, and adopting a passive wait and see approach is akin to
being complicit in inﬂicting any subsequent harm resulting from the use and or sale
of this rapidly evolving tech. And mind you, prior studies indicate the
disproportionate likelihood that those negatively impacted will be among the most
vulnerable of demographics.
Further, there's no harm in obtaining external third-party expert insight on
recognition, and at minimum will provide an additional safeguard. In closing, we
reﬂect on the last half a decade we've been engaged in what we originally imagined
might develop into an informed discourse, an exchange of perspective, but this
stalemate we have going on is getting stale. You have such potential for goodness,
but you've grown so arrogant remember where you came from, those humble
benign origins as an online book retailer? Alas, in the spirit of progress, HarringtonFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

{BIO 18872363 <GO>}
Hello everyone, I'm Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's Chief Financial Oﬃcer. Today I will be
providing a recap of our 2022 ﬁnancial results, which will be followed by a
shareholder Q&A with our CEO, Andy Jassy.
In 2022, Amazon's net sales were $514 billion, representing a year-over-year increase
of $44 billion, or 13% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This $44
billion in growth comes on the heels of a two-year period in 2020 and 2021, where
we increased our annual revenue by nearly $190 billion. This step up in sales was
largely driven by our eﬀorts to serve customers during the height of the pandemic.
Now that demand patterns have stabilized, we've seen diﬀerent customer behavior
in response to the tighter economy. Throughout 2022 and into early 2023, we are
seeing customers look to stretch their budgets further with a focus on value. Our
teams around the world, work hard to deliver low prices and secure great deals forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 18 of 27customers, particularly for last year's Annual Prime Day event in July and our ﬁrst
ever Prime Early Access sale in October. These global sales events outperformed our
expectations as customers responded to millions of deals across our growing
selection.
Third party sellers remain a key contributor to that expanding selection. For the full
year 2022, sellers represented 57% of all units sold on Amazon. That's the highest
annual seller percentage mix we've ever had. Sellers help us to increase our
selection for customers, and we work hard to ensure that sellers are growing their
businesses on Amazon. Sellers, vendors, and brands also continue to look to
Amazon's advertising capabilities to reach customers even as the macro
environment requires them to scrutinize their own marketing budgets. AWS
continues to see enterprise customers of all sizes converting to the cloud. Customers
are also working closely with our AWS teams to thoughtfully identify opportunities to
reduce costs and optimize their spend.
While these eﬀorts can impact short-term revenue growth, it is in times like these that
we can build long-term trust with our customers and build partnerships that will last
as they continue their move to the cloud. Turning to our segment ﬁnancial results,
our North America segment sales grew to $316 billion, up 13% year-over-year.
International segment sales grew to $118 billion, down 8% year-over-year on an
absolute dollar basis, and up 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
We're enthusiastic about the businesses we're building internationally. In addition to
our established international country oﬀerings in Europe and Japan, we have added
more than 10 new countries in the past ﬁve years, including Brazil, Australia, and the
United Arab Emirates, to name a few. Across these geographies, we've continued to
invest in the diﬀerentiated value of Prime and look to expand Prime household
penetration. AWS segment sales grew to $80 billion, up 29% year-over-year, and
now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion.
As I mentioned previously, enterprise customers of all sizes evaluated ways to
optimize their cloud spending, beginning and around the third quarter of 2022. And
our teams were there to assist, including help in shifting to lower cost services and
reviewing for architectural best practices. This customer orientation is in our DNA
and is key to how we seek to build these relationships for the long term.
Stepping back, our customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are
many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit
to AWS over the long term, as well as customers continuing existing migrations. We
continue to expand AWS's infrastructure footprint. In 2022, AWS launched new
regions in Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates, plus a second region in
India.
In 2023, AWS launched a new region in Melbourne. Operating income was $12
billion, down from $25 billion in 2021. Throughout much of last year, we continued to
work through many of the post pandemic impacts that began to aﬀect businessesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

Page 19 of 27and consumers globally, beginning in the second half of 2021, including labor
shortages and inﬂation in wages, fuel prices, transportation costs and ocean freight,
to name a few.
We're working hard to return our operations to their pre-pandemic eﬃciency levels
and are encouraged with the progress we are making to improve productivity and
streamline the cost in our fulﬁllment network coming out of 2022 and into the ﬁrst
quarter of 2023. Cash ﬂow remains our most important long term ﬁnancial output
metric. For 2022 operating cash ﬂow was $47 billion, up 1% year-over-year. We
continue to place meaningful attention on improving cost eﬃciencies throughout the
stores business, and in reducing our cost to serve our customers, while ensuring we
maintain an outstanding customer experience.
As we move into 2023, we are encouraged by what we see as we work to regionalize
our operations and transportation network. We've been able to improve our
inventory placement, reduce our touches per package, and increase our deliveries
per hour, resulting in lower shipping and fulﬁllment costs per unit. Free cash ﬂow is
what remains of our operating cash ﬂow after we invest in capital expenditures.
In 2022, free cash ﬂow was an outﬂow of $13 billion. Over the past couple of years,
working capital has not been as eﬃcient as it has been historically, given our
conscious decision to hold higher weeks of cover for our inventory given the
ongoing supply chain disruptions.
As we exited 2022 and move into the new year, we've seen solid inventory level
improvement while continuing to manage healthy in stock levels to support
continued customer demand. We've also seen elevated levels of capital
expenditures in the past few years as we built our network to handle the large
increase in consumer demand.
In 2022, we invested approximately $59 billion towards our capital investments,
which we deﬁne as the combination of capital expenditures plus equipment ﬁnance
leases. Overall, capital investments were roughly ﬂat year-over-year. We reduced our
fulﬁllment and transportation investments by approximately $10 billion compared to
2021 as we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with
post pandemic demand levels.
This was largely oﬀset by increased investment of approximately $10 billion year-
over-year in technology infrastructure, primarily to support our growing AWS
consumer needs. In closing, I'm proud of all the work being done across the
company to continue innovating, to obsess over customers, and to address our cost
challenges despite an uncertain economic environment these past few years.
It hasn't been easy, and we've had to take several actions to streamline costs, but I'm
encouraged by our progress and look forward to seeing our teams delivering and
exciting new projects and initiatives.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

opening remarks and address questions we have received pursuant to the meeting
rules of procedure.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Hi, I'm Andy Jassy, and thanks for taking the time to join us for Amazon's Annual
Shareholder meeting. I want to start by thanking our customers who include
consumers, third party selling partners, developers, enterprises, brands and creators.
Our customers are our inspiration. We appreciate their trust, and we're working hard
to build customer experiences that we believe will meaningfully change what's
possible for customers, and matter to our business in the long term.
I also want to recognize our more than 1.4 million employees for all their hard work.
They continue to innovate always with the customer as the central focus. I'm proud
of the incredible dedication and eﬀort from our employees all over the world and
what they deliver for customers and communities as well as their continued hard
work to help protect the environment.
From my perspective, there's a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for
customers and the results we're starting to see as we've been streamlining our costs
and operations and investing deeply and further improving our customer
experiences. I'm very optimistic about what lies ahead for Amazon and believe if we
continue on this path that we have a chance to emerge from the current
macroeconomic environment relatively stronger than we've ever been. Our best
days are in front of us.
And with that, I look forward to taking your questions.
Questions And Answers

(Question And Answer)
Thanks, Andy. We'll now move to our ﬁrst question, which is what can customers look
forward to in the coming years as far as delivery enhancements?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well, fast, reliable delivery is an enduring priority for us, along with selection of low
prices. It always has been. And it's why we've invested so much the last couple of
decades in our fulﬁllment network. And we've always had a strong fulﬁllment
network. But as we expanded so much in the pandemic, remember, we doubled the
footprint of our fulﬁllment centers that we've built in the ﬁrst 25 years. We doubled itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 21 of 27in about 18 months. And then we also built a last mile transportation network the size
of UPS, largely in those 18 months as well.
As we did that, we ended up with a much larger network that was diﬀerent and had a
lot more facilities and nodes and associated connections. And as such, it caused us
to rethink everything in our fulﬁllment network. A good example of that is our U.S.
fulﬁllment center network. Historically, we had a national ﬂat network but as we have
a lot more facilities and connections, we found that certain sub-optimizations at prior
scale, such as not having inventory in a facility close to an end customer, it just got
ampliﬁed at this new scale, -- this new elbow of the curve and scale.
And so we made the decision to regionalize this network. And what we did was we
created eight interconnected regions in smaller geographic areas to better serve
customers through lower costs and faster speeds. Each of these regions has broad
relevant selection to operate in a largely self-suﬃcient way with some of the most
meaningful and hard work that we had to do coming from optimizing the
connections between this large amount of infrastructure.
We rolled out this regional network in Q1 and we're really pleased with the results
thus far. We've got about 15% reduction in the distance items are traveling from
fulﬁllment centers to customers, 12% decrease in touches or how often a package is
handled, 76% of the products customers are ordering are now in facilities within their
region versus 62% a year ago. That's a big diﬀerence in a short amount of time. And
what we're ﬁnding is that customers are using same day delivery at an increased
rate, about 50% year-over-year. And in the ﬁrst quarter alone, we saw it reaching
nearly 26 million customers doing same day delivery. So shorter distances traveled
means faster delivery speed, lower costs and better results for the environment. And
we're on track this year in 2023 for our fastest shipping speeds ever for Prime
customers.
Now, you're seeing us continue to ﬁnd ways to make it easier and easier for
customers to get packages quicker. We have one day delivery now on more than 20
million items and growing. Same day delivery, which gets products to customers in
just a matter of hours, is available in 90 metro areas with selection of hundreds of
thousands of items.
So we're not close to being done working on improving the speed of delivery for
customers because we know it matters to them so much. So a lot more coming. Your
next question is, what is Amazon doing in AI?
Well, we've been using machine learning and AI at Amazon for 25 plus years, and it's
been really deeply embedded into every business in which we operate. And you can
see it all over Amazon. If you look at the personal recommendations you see in our
e-commerce business, that comes from AI.
If you look at the pick paths that our associates and our fulﬁllment centers pick items,
that -- those are AI algorithms. You look at Prime Air or drones, or if you look at ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 22 of 27Go Stores, or if you look at Alexa, those are all fueled by machine learning and AI.
And so it has been a very big part of our heritage for 25 years.
Now, over the last nine months or so, you've seen this new inﬂection point for AI with
the advent of generative AI. And it's just made it much more accessible to a lot more
people. And we're quite excited about it as well. I think it's still very early days in
generative AI, but moving quickly. And we see it as having three key layers. At the
bottom layer, every company that does generative AI is going to train models and
it's going to run inference or predictions from those models on compute. And the
key factor in that compute is going to be the chips that's in that compute.
And to date, there's been pretty signiﬁcant scarcity in the amount of in the capacity
of chips out there and in the options for customers on what they could run chip wise
there. And so it's why we've been investing for several years in our AWS business in
building customized machine learning chips. And we have one that's focused just on
training that we call Trainium. And we have one that's focused just on inference that's
called Inferentia.
And we're on the second versions of both those chips and the price performance
combination for those training and inference chips is very compelling relative to
alternatives out there. So we're very optimistic that a lot of these models will be
trained on these AWS training and inference chips. Then the middle layer of that
stack really is around the large foundational models that people are going to build
generative AI on top of. And if you look at these leading models, they take billions of
dollars and many years to ultimately train.
And there's going to be relatively few companies that want to pursue that. What
most companies tell us they want is they want to use somebody else's very large
foundational model and then customize it on their own data, making sure that their
own data doesn't leak to the general model, but being able to customize that
foundational model with their own data for their own application purposes, and then
being able to have all the same capabilities they're used to using in the rest of their
technology infrastructure platform.
And that's why we announced Bedrock, which really is foundational models as a
service. And so in Bedrock, we will expose some of our own large language models
that we've been working on for several years that we call Titan, but we'll also give
customers access to other third party foundational models like Anthropics, like
Stability AIs, like AI21s, as people will use lots of diﬀerent models. And they'll be able
to use those as the foundation to then customize with their own data with the same
security, the same privacy, and all the same platform features they're used to using
and running their workloads in AWS that they can run with these Bedrock models as
well.
And then that top layer of the generative AI set of solutions is really the applications
that you're going to build on top of these foundational models. And there are going
to be a lot of these. We think one of the high potential early ones is a code assistant.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 23 of 27A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Andy JassyAnd that's why we built CodeWhisperer that allows customers to use natural
language to say things like I want to build a video hosting website and then
CodeWhisperer generates that code for them to just deploy.
It's a huge game changer with respect to developer productivity. And it's got a lot of
early traction, but there will -- we're pursuing lots of applications ourselves inside of
Amazon. Every single one of our businesses is using generative AI to reinvent
customer experiences and while we'll pursue a number of those applications many
more will be built by external companies and developers. And we're quite optimistic
that a lot of those applications will be built on top of AWS so it's very early days in
generative AI. It's very high potential and we're investing quite a bit in it and expect
to be a leader.
Thanks Andy. What can you tell us about the strategy for investing in Kuiper and
other new business ventures like it? Are they worthwhile?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well we think about our big investments with a series of questions that we ask
ourselves and the questions we tend to ask ourselves are number one, if we're
successful, can it be big and move the needle for Amazon with good return on
invested capital returns? Number two, is it being well served today? Number three,
do we have a diﬀerentiated approach? And number four, do we have some
competence in that area? And if not, can we acquire quickly?
And if we like the answers to those questions, then we'll pursue that big investment.
And sometimes that process has led to pretty straightforward new areas for us. These
were things like getting into other product categories besides books in the early
days of Amazon or getting into diﬀerent international geographies.
But sometimes that process has led to inventions and investments that weren't
initially straightforward. And AWS is a good example of that, where there were a lot
of people wondering why we were pursuing a technology infrastructure platform
when we were really just a retailer and a lot of people questioned internally and a lot
of people questioned it externally. But think about what a diﬀerent company Amazon
would be today if we hadn't pursued AWS.
And so Kuiper to me is an example of one that might not have been predicted by
people, but it makes a lot of sense when you look at that structure outline. There's
over 400 million plus households that today have little to no connectivity or
broadband. And that's all capabilities and technology access that we take for
granted today. But just imagine what people who can't do so today could do with
reliable connectivity, being able to do things like taking online education courses or
using ﬁnancial services or starting their own businesses or doing shopping or
enjoying entertainment or just think about businesses and governments that need
that broader coverage to improve their operations.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

Page 24 of 27A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Andy Jassy
A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Andy JassySo, Kuiper will change this for many, many people. It will be much more aﬀordable
and higher performance than alternatives that are out there today. We're launching
two prototype satellites to test the end-to-end communications network this year
and then plan to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024. We've released
some of the technical details recently, and already consumers, enterprises, and
governments are quite excited about us providing Kuiper. So we believe inventions
like Kuiper have a chance to change what's possible for many millions of customers
and to be a very good business for Amazon.
Your next question is, while Amazon ads is a big revenue driver for Amazon, how do
you balance that with ensuring a great customer experience for shoppers?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Customer experience will always be paramount for us. Everything starts with the
customer and our strategies and tactics evolve backwards from there. That's always
been true and always will be true. Most of our resource and time that we spend in
advertising is spent on machine learning algorithms to ensure that the sponsored
results people see on search results are relevant to what they're trying to ﬁnd.
And we track it rigorously and we're constantly reﬁning the algorithms. Advertising,
of course, is not new in retail. Retailers have been doing this for many decades,
selling shelf space or end caps or placements and circulars. But unlike physical
retailers, we can tailor the results to be relevant to what customers are actually
searching for, given what we know about buying behaviors.
And because our ads are relevant for customers and much more so than you ﬁnd in
physical retail, customers click on those sponsored links a lot, which means they
perform better for brands. And this is a key reason why our ads business is
continuing to grow at a good clip, despite the fact that we're in a very challenging
time for ads-heavy businesses.
I think, it's also worth noting that we're still in the very early days of working through
thoughtful placement in our video, live sports, audio and grocery products. It's just
early days for us in advertising we're excited about.
Next a shareholder asks, international is so ﬂaky with volatile currencies and
administrative situations. Why are you even playing in that area?

Well, we're pretty excited about our international business. I think if you look at 2022
our international consumer segment was $118 billion in revenue and that growth re-
accelerated in Q1 of this year over Q4 of last year. And if you look at our international
consumer business, it's a combination of established geographies. These are placesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

A - Andy Jassylike the UK and Germany and Japan and emerging countries that we've launched
over the last several years.
Now our established international businesses are big enough at this point that
they're not immune from macroeconomic issues. And you could see that over the
last year. But if you look at the compound annual growth rates of these established
international businesses from 2019 to 2021, they're pretty remarkable. 31% in the UK,
26% in Germany, 21% in Japan. That's pretty unusual.
So, we're optimistic about this -- how those businesses will continue to evolve and
grow as we emerge from the current macroeconomic environment. I think, we also
have a number of new countries that we've launched over the last several years. And
these are places like India or Brazil or Mexico or Australia or lots of diﬀerent
countries in Europe, in the Middle East, in Northern Africa.
And what we ﬁnd with these new geographies is that it takes a certain amount of
ﬁxed investment to get these locales going. And then you need a certain amount of
revenue scale where the operating income and margin covers the ﬁxed investment.
But we're really liking the trajectory. It looks very much, for the most part, on the
same trajectory as what we've seen in the U.S. in our longer-standing established
international countries. And we're quite bullish on building a large, proﬁtable
international stores business. We're on the right track.
Thanks, Andy. This will be the last shareholder question. I'm curious -- I'm interested
in the company's foray into health and think there's tremendous opportunity in
service and care. But I'm curious where you are thinking you are going to take this.
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well, healthcare, the healthcare experience across the world, but I'll just start with the
U.S., is a pretty rough experience for customers. Most customers are not happy with
it. And as such, our customers have been asking us for many years if we would
provide a pharmacy solution. And if you think about it, it's not that far an extension
from what we do in retail. There's some regulatory pieces that are diﬀerent, but it has
many similarities. And so we launched a pharmacy oﬀering an Amazon pharmacy a
few years ago. It's oﬀ to a good start. It's growing quickly. And as we've built that
business and as customers have gotten used to, to using us in the healthcare space,
not surprisingly, they've asked us to help with more issues in their everyday
healthcare experiences.
And, if you think about for most customers, if you really want to make a change and
a meaningful impact in their healthcare experience, primary care is right in the
middle of that experience. And just think about how we've all experienced primary
care over the last several decades. I think about telling my grandkids that the way it
was, was that you had to call somebody three to four weeks in advance for an
appointment, drive 20 minutes to the doctor's oﬃce, park, wait in reception for 15
minutes, then get put in an exam room, wait in the exam room, wait in the exam
room for a doctor for 10 to 15 minutes, and the doctor comes in, speaks to you forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-24

Page 26 of 27about 5 to 10 minutes, and then you drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy. That -- our
grandkids are not going to believe that, that was the way that we got primary care,
and it is not going to be the case moving forward. It's just not.
And so, we've been thinking about this for a while, and we were experimenting with
a business that we call Amazon Care, which was telemedicine. And we could not
believe how much customers liked that customer experience. It turned out that we
had the wrong business model for it, which is why we didn't see it moving forward
and shut it down. But the Amazon Care experience really opened our eyes to the fact
that the experience was not going to -- was not just going to change over time, but
that people wanted to change now.
And we came across this company in One Medical who we were just so impressed
with. If you look at how strong and how easy to use their digital app is with all of your
healthcare information readily available in the app. If you want to have a chat with a
medical practitioner, you can easily do so. If you want to have a video conference
with a medical practitioner, you can do so.
If you need to come in and see somebody, One Medical has clinics all over the
country, you can do so same day or next day very quickly. They -- all the One Medical
physical presences have relationships with health service providers in cities. So if you
need to see a specialist, you can do so very quickly. And then whatever medication
you need, you can use Amazon Pharmacy or another third party pharmacy if you like
to get that quickly without having to travel 20 minutes back and forth to the
pharmacy.
So that's a very diﬀerent experience and that's why we became so excited about
One Medical and decided to acquire the company. And I think that we believe
together in Amazon and One Medical together that we have a chance to
meaningfully change the customer experience for so many customers and what they
experience every day with healthcare and we're very excited about that.
As that concludes our Q&A, I just want to thank everyone again for joining us today,
particularly our long time -- long term shareholders. We appreciate your support and
your interest in what we're doing. It means a lot and we appreciate it. Rest assured
we're going to continue doing our part in inventing and taking care of our
customers, employees and communities to make their lives better and easier. Thank
you.
