{BIO 6008923 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I am very pleased to be representing lululemon's Board of
Directors today to introduce you to our next CEO, Laurent Potdevin. Earlier thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-10

Page 2 of 8morning we issued a press release announcing the Board's appointment of Laurent
and we are hosting this call to add a little more color to that announcement and to
give you a fuller appreciation of what Laurent brings to the position.
As many of you know, Christine Day announced her intention to resign in June. We
immediately started the process to ﬁll the CEO position with a thorough and
comprehensive search. Laurent emerged through that process as the ideal
candidate.
Laurent brings to lululemon more than two decades of experience in building global
brands at premium technical athletic apparel and lifestyle centric companies. He is a
seasoned leader with a remarkable track record of execution and will be a strong
cultural ﬁt within our team of passionate and highly skilled individuals.
Laurent comes to lululemon having most recently served as President of TOMS
Shoes where he built a world-class management team, established supply chains
and operations globally, led global expansion and strengthened the company's
cultural identity. The company scaled its footprint during Laurent's tenure, as
evidenced by the fact that TOMS gave away 10 million pairs of shoes over the past
seven years and now expects to give away another 10 million in just the next 18
months.
Laurent also spearheaded expansion in 12 countries in the last 12 months, which
demonstrates his ability to grow brands internationally. Prior to TOMS Laurent had a
15-year tenure at Burton Snowboards, including CEO from a 2005 to 2010. During
his time at Burton he helped the Company grow far beyond its roots of snowboards
to become a truly global brand, synonymous with the sport and lifestyle. Laurent
encouraged technical product innovation, product diversiﬁcation and international
expansion. As a result Burton now oﬀers a complete selection of equipment and
technical apparel designed to meet every rider's needs.
Laurent also had signiﬁcant exposure to luxury and premium brands having served
at LVMH earlier in his career where we keep played a critical role in building and
optimizing the supply chain between North America and Europe. And he also spent
time in the company's M&A division.
During the course of the selection process the search committee recognized that
Laurent has a deep understanding and enthusiasm for all functions in the business,
from marketing to product innovation to supply chain and operations management.
We also found him to be a very strong leader with a proven ability to collaborate and
motivate across an organization. We believe his passion for driving innovation makes
him the ideal candidate to inspire the next generation of lululemon educators,
ambassadors and guests. We are excited to have him join us and bring his global
brand building skills and expertise to lululemon.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-10

Page 3 of 8Laurent PotdevinLaurent is expected to oﬃcially start in January at which time he will become a
member of our Board. He will succeed Christine Day who has done an outstanding
job building the Company and driving our ﬁnancial performance over the past six
years. She leaves in place a strong, vibrant business model as we enter the next
phase of growth and expansion. To ensure a seamless transition, Christine will
remain in place through the end of the ﬁscal year and support Laurent during his on
boarding process.
In addition to Laurent's appointment, today we announced an upcoming change on
the Board of Directors. Our Founder and current Chairman of the Board, Chip
Wilson, will step down as Chairman prior to the annual general meeting in June. At
that time I will transition into the position.
I have served on lululemon's Board since 2007 and am currently the lead director. I
have a long tenure at Starbucks, including CFO for over a decade. And I continue to
work with Starbucks in an advisory capacity. I also was a member of the Board of
Directors of the NASDAQ OM/X group for 11 years serving on the audit committee
and executive committee and as Chairman of the management compensation
committee.
We believe the timing of this shift allows ample room for an orderly transition and
continued strength of our leadership infrastructure. Chip was central to molding the
Company and laying the foundation for continued success and as he transitions out
of his role as Chairman he will retain his seat on the Board.
As a Founder, Chip's critical role and focus going forward will be to advise and
support the culture of the Company and to educate on the original intent of the
brand, product and operating principles, to ensure that the core values which make
lululemon unique and successful are maintained as the Company grows.
In closing, I would like to stress how excited the Board is to welcome Laurent to the
lululemon family. Working with our strong management team we have conﬁdence in
his ability to lead the global expansion of our brand. The Board and I fully support
him as he leads our next phase of growth. I will now turn the call over to Laurent.
{BIO 18481730 <GO>}
Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am
to be joining and leading such an exceptional Company. Its heritage of success is
built on creating technical and beautiful product, its strong culture and values and
authentic consumer and communities. My role will be to make sure that all of these
qualities remain in place and are leveraged as we turn lululemon into a global brand
and business.
One of the things I'm most passionate about and have taken great pride in over the
course of my career is building global brands. And lululemon certainly as all the
elements needed to continue its growth in North America and beyond, including a
strong reputation for creating technical and beautiful product. And the team that is inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-10

A - Laurent Potdevinplace today has already taken very important steps in laying the foundation for
global expansion.
I have met with most of the senior team and see signiﬁcant potential growth both
domestically and internationally as we leverage this Company's outstanding
business model. As I transition into the role I look forward to immersing myself in the
culture and working with the Board, the management team across all areas of the
business and in the stores to make sure we have the very best plan and all the
necessary resources to fulﬁll the Company's potential. And that we all continue to
work as a team to pursue that very goal.
I look forward to meeting most of you in the near future and now I think we have
time for a few questions.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Omar Saad, ISI Group.
{BIO 5302683 <GO>}
Congratulations to both Laurent, you in your new role and Mike as well. Thanks for
taking my question. I guess, Laurent, I would ask if you could discuss maybe how
some of your experiences from your three unique past roles at LVMH and Burton and
TOMS, how those are going to maybe inﬂuence and shape your long-term vision for
the lululemon brand. And Mike, if you have any comments on that from the Board's
perspective?
{BIO 18481730 <GO>}
Well thank you, I think I have been incredibly fortunate for the past 20 years to work
with global iconic brands or iconic brands being on their way to be global. Maybe to
give you a couple examples, I mean earlier in my career LVMH gave me signiﬁcant
exposure to premier global brands in a number of product categories. And that is
when I moved from Paris and came to North America to really restructure the
technology and supply chain around the management of all the Louis Vuitton stores.
Later on at Burton, while we had a European platform, it was very much of an
Austrian subsidiary. And having spent a lot of time in Europe we built a very, very
strong pan-European multicultural group that ended up serving all of Europe and
over a very short period of time the Burton subsidiary in Europe became the most
successful and the most proﬁtable subsidiary (inaudible) the Company, maintaining
the premium positioning of the brand and the high-performance product that we
were known to make.
Then very recently at TOMS, you know we obviously had an amazing brand and
business model to work with. And over the past 12 months we expanded the brand'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-10

Thanks. And Mike, if you have any insights into what you saw in Laurent and his
background?
{BIO 1453776 <GO>}
Well we were primarily attracted ﬁrst to his resume of being with quality companies
that had premium brands and that had grown on a global scale. But then as we got
to know Laurent better we became even more impressed with his passion for
innovation and his demonstrated leadership skills in building strong teams wherever
he worked. And we are conﬁdent that that is going to be very well received here at
lululemon. The culture, as you all know, is very strong and important at lululemon
and we think that Laurent will ﬁt into that perfectly.
{BIO 5302683 <GO>}
Thanks. Congratulations to you both.

Adrienne Tennant, Janney Capital Markets.
Good morning. And let me add my congratulations and welcome aboard, Laurent.
{BIO 18481730 <GO>}
Thank you.
My question is can you talk about your background in building and investing in the
foundation and the infrastructure in quality, supply chain and operational execution -
- that whole area? Sort of everything -- getting the product, the wonderful product to
the stores to really keep pace with lulu's global growth? I think that is one of the
things that sort of has been an issue in the past call it 12 months. I just was wondering
if you could discuss that a little bit. Thank you.

Q - Jay Sole
A - Laurent PotdevinWell sure. I mean I think the two experiences that would be the most relevant there
would be the experience at Burton and TOMS where the environment when I got
involved was very high-growth mode and mostly in one region. In both organizations
we were able to very quickly build the infrastructure both from a technology and
from a supply chain standpoint and from a sourcing and quality standpoint to really
support a global business.
So whether it is putting a platform in China and in Hong Kong in the context of
TOMS to make sure that we have got the right product development,
commercialization and quality assurance model or whether it is building a supply
chain to fulﬁll the needs of our giving model at TOMS, which over the past two years
probably became the most -- the largest scale gift in kind donor around the world.
And building that supply chain in developing countries certainly was a challenge
that we tackled.
And similarly at Burton, building an infrastructure from a technology standpoint
through building a great ERP platform. But also bringing that technology all the way
down to the ﬂoor to make sure that our retailers had access to all of our information
and our product availability real-time. So I think in a number of experiences I have
had to do that across many regions and continents.
Wonderful. Well welcome aboard.

Hi, this is Jay Sole on for Kimberly Greenberger. Congratulations, Laurent. Good
morning.
{BIO 18481730 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning.
{BIO 16089358 <GO>}
Just two questions. First, can you talk about what are the keys to managing high-
speed global growth? Obviously lululemon has a tremendous amount of growth in
front of it. What are going to be the keys to make sure that growth happens in the
way you expect it to?

A - Laurent Potdevin
Q - Howard TubinI mean I think the key -- I mean I haven't had a chance to immerse myself in the
business and I really look forward to start doing that in January. But I mean I think the
key is to really continue to provide the resources, both ﬁnancial and human, to make
sure that we can continue to leverage and capitalize on the current success and
bring that success beyond North America.
{BIO 16089358 <GO>}
Then maybe if you could just describe for us -- you have had a lot of great
experiences at diﬀerent places. But would you characterize your strengths -- your
favorite part of the job is in operations, is it in product, is it managing a brand? How
would you describe yourself to Wall Street?
{BIO 18481730 <GO>}
I would probably describe myself as somebody that has a real passion for all
functions across the business. And as more of a generalist that has had experience
across all the functions in all the regions. So learning is what fuels me and I tend to
be very curious. So I really look forward to spending some time with the team here
and helping them continue to do what they have done so well.
{BIO 16089358 <GO>}
Great. Thanks so much. Good luck.
{BIO 18481730 <GO>}
Thank you.
Howard Tubin, RBC Capital Markets.
{BIO 6382352 <GO>}
So Laurent, my question to you would be as you look at the business today and
everything you know about it, what would be your ﬁrst priorities once you kind of
get on board? And do you envision any sort of big picture changes in the strategic
direction or are you kind of happy with the direction the Company is moving in
today?
{BIO 18481730 <GO>}
Again, I think the ﬁrst order of business will be to really immerse myself very quickly
and learn all facets of the business. I mean, I don't anticipate any major change. I
mean the business model is fantastic, the brand is exceptional, the product is
outstanding and beautiful so it is really a matter of understanding all facets of the
business and collaborating with the team and continuing to make it better.
{BIO 6382352 <GO>}
That is great, thanks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-12-10
