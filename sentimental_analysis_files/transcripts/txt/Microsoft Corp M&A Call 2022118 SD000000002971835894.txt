Thank you, Brett. Thank you, everyone, for joining us to talk about this exciting
milestone for Microsoft, Activision Blizzard and the entire gaming industry.
This morning we announced that we will acquire Activision Blizzard in an all-cash
transaction valued at $68.7 billion. This will be the largest acquisition in our history,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-18
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 2 of 9and we are investing to create a thriving gaming ecosystem, one where world-class
content can more easily reach every gamer across every platform.
For us, when we think about acquisitions, we always start with our mission: To
empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
Activision Blizzard is one of the premier game publishers worldwide, and their
mission to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment is deeply
aligned with our own. Together, our ambition is to bring the joy and community of
gaming to everyone on the planet.
When I step back, it's hard to overstate how competitive, dynamic and exciting the
gaming industry is today. Gaming is the largest and fastest-growing category in
entertainment.
The last two years, in particular, have shown how critical games are to helping
people maintain a sense of community and belonging even when they're apart.
Today 3 billion consumers around the world play games, and we expect this number
will reach 4.5 billion by 2030 as new generations turn to gaming for entertainment,
community and a sense of achievement.
We are seeing more players, more streamers, more titles and more new game
publishers than ever before, but too much friction still exists today between content,
consumption and commerce.
We need to make it easier for people to connect and play great games wherever
whenever and however they want. Today we face strong global competition from
companies that generate more revenue from game distribution than we do from our
share of game sales and subscriptions. We need more innovation and investment in
content creation and fewer constraints on distribution.
Our vision is for a river of entertainment, where the content and commerce ﬂow
freely, driving a renaissance across the entire industry to make games more inclusive
and accessible to all. Together with Activision Blizzard, that's what we will be able to
deliver. Removing these barriers will only become more important as the digital and
physical worlds come together and the metaverse platform develops.
When we think about our vision for what a metaverse can be, we believe there won't
be a single centralized metaverse and there shouldn't be. We need to support many
metaverse platforms as well as a robust ecosystem of content, commerce and
applications.
In gaming, we see the metaverse as a collection of communities and individual
identities anchored in strong content franchises accessible on every device. And
bringing fantastic entertainment together with new technologies, communities and
business models is exactly what this transaction is about.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-18
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 9Together with Activision Blizzard, we have an incredible opportunity to invest and
innovate to create the best content, community and cloud for gamers to build
substantial new value for our shareholders.
It starts with content across the console, PC and mobile. Activision Blizzard is home
to some of the world's most legendary games, including billion-dollar franchises like
Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft. Activision Blizzard's portfolio adds to
our own ﬁrst-party lineup from Minecraft to Forza, to Halo and the iconic franchises
we acquired as part of the acquisition of ZeniMax Media just last year, including
Fallout, DOOM and Elder Scrolls.
Critically, this transaction signiﬁcantly expands our presence in mobile, the largest
segment in gaming business. Activision Blizzard's King division is one of the global
leaders in mobile gaming.
And we will bring as many Activision Blizzard games as we can to our Game Pass
subscription service across the PC, console and mobile, including both new games
as well as games from Activision Blizzard's incredible catalog, oﬀering even better
value and more choice for our gamers. Together, we have one of the most diverse
and robust content pipelines in the industry across every endpoint.
The second key area is community. Activision Blizzard has nearly 400 million monthly
active players across 190 countries today. That reach builds on the strength of our
own gaming community from Minecraft and Xbox network to Game Pass.
Game Pass now has more than 25 million subscribers, and we are creating new
opportunities for creators across our ecosystem with programs like ID@Xbox, which
help independent developers publish their creations across our platforms.
Together with Activision Blizzard, we will have one of the largest and most engaged
communities in all of entertainment. We are excited to create new opportunities for
both leading publishers as well as for individuals and small teams to build and
monetize their creations across this community.
And ﬁnally and not least, cloud gaming. As we have talked about, we deliver the joy
and community of gaming by putting players at the center of their entertainment,
enabling people everywhere to stream games in high ﬁdelity. That's why we've
invested, over the past few years, in Xbox cloud gaming, deploying specialized Xbox
hardware in our data centers around the world.
Through the cloud, we are extending the Xbox ecosystem in community to millions
of new people, including in global markets where traditional PC and console gaming
has long been a challenge. When we look ahead and consider new possibilities like
oﬀering Overwatch or Diablo via streaming to anyone with a phone as part of Game
Pass, you start to understand how exciting this acquisition will be.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-18
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 9Robert KotickI want to wrap by talking brieﬂy about a vital factor that underlies all of the
opportunities I've talked about: Culture. As CEO of Microsoft, the culture of our
organization is my number one priority. This means we must continuously improve
the lived experience of our employees and create an environment that allows us to
constantly drive everyday improvement in our culture.
This is hard work. It requires consistency, commitment and leadership that not only
talks the talk but walks to walk. That's why we believe it's critical for Activision
Blizzard to drive forward on its renewed cultural commitments. We are supportive of
the goals and the work Activision Blizzard is doing.
And we also recognize that after the close, we will have signiﬁcant work to do in
order to continue to build a culture where everyone can do their best work. This isn't
just about employees.
Our journey of inclusion extends to creating a welcoming and safe community for all
our customers, including the hundreds of millions of players who enjoy our games
and interactive services.
We are committed to protecting players and empowering our employees to do what
they love while thriving in a safe and inclusive culture, one where everyone is invited
to play. The success of this acquisition will depend on it.
To close, I'll share some additional details on the transaction. We expect the
acquisition to close in ﬁscal year 2023. When it does, the Activision Blizzard business
will report to Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, who has demonstrated
leadership, driving both gaming business success as well as culture change.
Over more than 30 years as CEO of Activision Blizzard, Bobby Kotick has built the
company into one of the world's most successful and inﬂuential entertainment
companies, and I'm grateful for his leadership and commitment to real culture
change. With that, let me hand it over to Bobby to share more about the opportunity
ahead.
{BIO 1454719 <GO>}
Thank you, Satya, and thank you for welcoming us as a part of one of the world's
most admired companies. I remember our conversations on your very ﬁrst day as
CEO. You shared your bold vision to lead Microsoft to help empower people
everywhere in the world and I left inspired.
Our mission, connecting and engaging the world through joy and fun, is also
incredibly empowering for our players. Thirty-one years ago, Brian and I began a
journey to build one of the world's great entertainment companies. Our 10,000
exceptionally talented employees in every creative, technical and commercial
discipline have passionately built and nurtured some of the world's most loved and
played games.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-18
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 9When we ﬁrst discussed the chance to merge our incredible talent, extraordinary
franchises, our shared commitment to the very best workplace and access to
Microsoft's vast resources, it gave Brian, the Board of Directors and me conﬁdence
that we would have a far better chance to succeed in the increasingly competitive
race for leadership as gaming through the metaverse evolves.
Our Activision, Blizzard and King teams have transformed games into social
experiences, enabled players to ﬁnd purpose and meaning through games. And
every day we entertain communities of hundreds of millions of players connected
through our franchises.
Connecting these communities together is the next step in the creation of the
metaverse. The race to do this is accelerating and the resources required for success
are enormous. So many of the world's biggest companies have ambitions with their
own gaming and metaverse initiatives.
Established and emerging competitors see opportunity for virtual world ﬁlled with
professionally produced content, user-generated content and rich social
connections. Our talent and our franchises are critical components of the
construction of a rich metaverse.
We've always attracted the very best game makers and built the very best game
franchises, seizing opportunity with passion, inspiration, focus and determination.
But competition for diverse talent and the creative and technical capabilities desire
to meet the expectations of our players has never been greater.
As investments in cloud computing, AI and machine learning, more sophisticated
data analytics, user interface and user experience capabilities become more
competitive and more necessary for the exciting gaming future that lies ahead, we
will beneﬁt tremendously from having a partner like Microsoft to better enable our
ambitions.
As we thought about possible partners, all roads ultimately led to Microsoft.
Microsoft has all the important technologies we need to deliver the next generation
of games. And like Activision, Microsoft has a cultural passion for gaming that goes
back to the 1980s.
Microsoft's culture of inspiring people through caring and empathy is a powerful
motivator and one we embrace as we renew our resolve and the work we're now
doing to set a new standard for a welcoming and inclusive workplace culture.
After Microsoft reached out to me and our Board deliberated about our future, it was
obvious that this is the very best way to ensure Activision Blizzard's continuing
success. Activision's Board of Directors unanimously agreed that this was a great
transaction with the right partner at the right time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-18

Page 6 of 9Phil SpencerThe price of $95 per share in cash delivers a 45% premium to our share price on
January 14. Our employees, players, investors and partners will all greatly beneﬁt
from this transaction.
Microsoft scale and resources will only add to the opportunities for our franchise
teams to achieve their visions for their communities, and we couldn't be more
excited to be a part of the impressive team Phil Spencer has built, a team that has
led platform innovation since Microsoft launched Xbox in 2001.
Phil and I have known each other for a very long time. He has the rare combination
of leadership talents that are prerequisites for success in gaming. He is passionate --
compassionate and has deep technical knowledge and the ability to motivate and
inspire all types of talent.
The game publisher and platform provider dynamic is complex, and Phil has always
been an exceptional partner. As you can probably tell, we couldn't be more excited
for our incredible future together. Phil?

Hi, everyone. This is obviously an extremely exciting day. At the broadest level, our
mission at Microsoft Gaming is to extend the joy and community of gaming to
everyone in the planet, billions of people, and this deal accelerates that strategy.
When this transaction closes, Microsoft Gaming will be the world's number three
gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony. We believe that Microsoft
and our team are uniquely positioned with the technical capability, ﬁnancial capacity,
creative vision and the gaming track record required to deliver a truly global
interactive entertainment ecosystem.
With this transaction, Activision Blizzard brings into Microsoft Gaming one of the
most exciting collections of content franchises, creative teams and fan bases
anywhere in global entertainment across any form of media. Many Activision Blizzard
properties, including at King, are truly beloved by people all over the world, and
they will endure for many decades to come.
I'll reinforce that this is not about short-term results. We have seen Activision
Blizzard's product road map and are incredibly enthusiastic about what the teams
are creating and the company's pipeline over many years to come.
We have seen strong recent performance from our existing ZeniMax and Xbox Game
Studios and are well positioned as the stewards of Activision Blizzard's great
franchises. I'm personally excited for the opportunity to work directly with the
dedicated, passionate teams, Call of Duty, Blizzard, King and each of the studios
across the company as we reach new heights and even more players together.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-18
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 9Amy HoodWe're all about putting players at the center of everything we do. This transaction is
going to be fantastic, not only for our existing players, but will also help us bring
innovative experiences to vast new audiences.
That's because adding the Activision Blizzard portfolio to our existing operations will
also propel our new forms of distribution and monetization like Cloud Gaming and
our Game Pass subscription service. Each of these services are helping us reach new
audiences, especially as we expand into new geographic markets in mobile-ﬁrst
economies.
Upon close, we will oﬀer as many Activision Blizzard games as we can within Game
Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard's incredible catalog. As our
platform becomes more attractive, the ﬂywheel of content creators and players
accelerates.
As the creative range on our platform continues to expand, more players are
attracted to the service, and the growing scale of the customer base makes the
platform more attractive for additional publishers and so on. Then as Satya pointed
out, when you think about potential opportunities like, say oﬀering Diablo, Call of
Duty or Overwatch via cloud streaming to anyone on any device, you can see just
how exciting this deal really is.
And it doesn't stop there. Extending our horizon a bit, this transaction will make our
approach to the consumer metaverse even stronger. That's because our vision of the
metaverse is based on intersecting global communities rooted in strong franchises.
A big part of that is the fact that mobile is the biggest category of gaming, and it's an
area where we've not had a major presence before. This transaction adds one of the
most successful mobile publishers to Microsoft Gaming, and I'm personally looking
forward to learning from the innovative teams at King.
And perhaps most important, we're looking forward to working with the thousands
of talented Activision Blizzard employees with the same approach of proactive
inclusion and partnership that we extend to every member of the Microsoft family.
We believe ﬁrmly that the great teams at Activision Blizzard have their best work in
front of them, and we're looking forward to making sure they feel supported, safe
and engaged in every aspect of their work going forward. That includes respecting
the creative vision and identity of individual game studios.
We have fundamental values that we refuse to compromise on, and we embrace the
vibrant creative diversity of our industry. So all in all, as we continue our mission to
bring the joy and community of gaming to everyone, I couldn't be more excited
about the opportunities presented by coming together with Activision Blizzard. With
that, I'll hand it over to Amy.

Page 8 of 9Brett IversenThanks, Phil. Our approach to mergers and acquisitions is to focus on TAM expansive
opportunities in high-growth markets, where we can uniquely add value to the users
or the community. We execute those transactions at a price that supports long-term
shareholder value creation.
You have heard from Satya, Bobby and Phil that Activision Blizzard meets those
criteria. With all acquisitions, value is ultimately created through terriﬁc execution by
an aligned team of talented, creative individuals with a shared vision of the future.
With this acquisition, we continue to deepen our commitment to the three pillars of
our gaming strategy: content, community and cloud. Key measures of our success
include accelerated revenue growth from Activision Blizzard's game portfolio as we
extend content to more devices, resulting in increased engagement and
monetization across the Xbox platform; as well as additional growth in Game Pass
subscribers as we attract new players wherever they play and continue to build one
of the most compelling and diverse lineups of AAA content available.
Now let's turn to the transaction details. We've agreed to acquire Activision Blizzard
for $95 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of
Activision Blizzard's net cash. The acquisition will not impact our previously
announced share buyback program.
The transaction has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and
Activision Blizzard. The transaction is expected to close in ﬁscal year 2023 and is
subject to approval by Activision Blizzard shareholders and the satisfaction of certain
regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate the transaction will be accretive to EPS upon
close. In this context, non-GAAP excludes the expected impact of purchase
accounting adjustments as well as nonrecurring integration and transaction-related
expenses. Following the close of the transaction, we expect to report results for
Activision Blizzard in our gaming business, and the Activision Blizzard business will
report to Phil Spencer.
As you've heard from all of us this morning, we are excited by the opportunity ahead
as we bring two companies with storied franchises together. Gaming is a category
deﬁned by innovation, technical ambition, creativity and a passionate pursuit to
create joy and wonder for those who play.
Bringing exciting new gaming experiences to everyone on the planet through this
combination will drive long-term revenue growth and signiﬁcant shareholder value.
With that, thank you all for joining us for this exciting announcement.
