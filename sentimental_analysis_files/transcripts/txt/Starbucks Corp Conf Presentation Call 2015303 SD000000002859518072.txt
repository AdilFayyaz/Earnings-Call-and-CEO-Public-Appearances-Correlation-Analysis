(inaudible) Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Restaurant Analyst. Very pleased
to be hosting Starbucks today as our keynote address through this lunch gathering.
Representing the Company today will be Scott Maw, Chief Financial Oﬃcer and
Charlie Jemley, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer of the China Asia
Paciﬁc and Channel Development Businesses at Starbucks.
Our format will be exactly what we've been doing so far -- Q&A, where I'll be asking
a couple of questions. But again, we encourage questions from the audience.
(Conference instructions)
With that, let me turn it over to Scott. Scott, thank you for joining us.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the meat of the
presentation, I just want to talk a bit about the picture that you see up here on the
screen. So this is our Reserve roasting and tasting room in Seattle. When you walk in
here, you'll see up to 40 partners, our employees, working at once unpacking green
beans, roasting coﬀee, packaging coﬀee for shipment, scooping coﬀee for you to
consume at home. And delivering coﬀee for consumption on the site and to go in
pour-over, in siphon, Clover, espresso, lots of diﬀerent presentations.
And we believe this is really the pinnacle of retail coﬀee experience and a pinnacle
of any retail experience you can get because you actually get to see the product
made on site and then choose how you wish to consume some of the ﬁnest-quality
coﬀees in the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 2 of 19What I would say is it's oﬀ to a great start. The transaction volume and customer
volume is way above what we expected when we opened. There are lines every day;
sometimes they snake outside onto the sidewalk in front of the building into the
wonderful February weather in Seattle. So very popular among customers. We know
we have a great concept here with the Roastery.
And I think it reemphasizes our leadership position in premium quality coﬀee and
the fact that we source, roast. And serve the highest-quality coﬀee in the world. And
the Roastery's certainly an experience in that. So if you're in Seattle, I encourage you
to go.
Forward-looking statements -- please read those.
Just quickly -- I think most of you know this -- so Starbucks has almost 22,000
locations in 66 countries around the world.
Revenues this year will approach $20 billion.
You can see the revenue growth that we've had in the double digits, operating
margin expansion over the last few years.
Comp sales growth of at least 5% for 20 straight quarters now for Starbucks.
I think, importantly, within the most recent quarter we had two points of transaction
growth. And just to put that in perspective from a sales standpoint, to get two points
of transaction growth globally for Starbucks, that's 12 million incremental transactions
across the system in the quarter. So if you just think about the size of that number we
need to get to drive a comp sales growth, it sort of puts in perspective what we're
doing.
Earnings per share -- our target is 15% to 20% over the long term, 16% to 18% this
year. You can see we've been running, on average, slightly above our long-term
forecast. Part of that's been coﬀee and part of that's been fantastic execution, which
we'll talk more about as we get into the details.
The other thing that's important to point out, I think particularly emphasized in the
last quarter, is the breadth and balance of our growth. Whether it's revenue growth,
which you can see across the three diﬀerent geographies that we have; margin
growth across those geographies; dollar expansion and percentage expansion in
margin; and then, channel development. And top line, bottom line. And margin
expansion, very, very balanced.
And the most recent quarter was a perfect example of that. We grew transactions
substantially in all three regions -- channel development, once again, hit that
(inaudible) revenue growth. And we had margin expansion in virtually every part of
the business. So that balanced growth becomes more and more important as,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 19obviously, our international operations are growing a bit faster than the US
operations.
I think a really important question to ask is how does this $20 billion company
continue to grow the top line at 10% while growing the bottom line at 15% to 20%?
It's a pretty big task. And the key is, as it's been in the past, we have multiple layers
of growth opportunities. And we've talked about that for the last couple of years.
And I'll take you through that.
I think importantly, we have a strategic framework that we developed over the last
year and a half or so that's really focused those growth opportunities in seven
diﬀerent categories. And so that's why I want to talk about the business today.
Charlie and I can go deep into the individual P&Ls of all the business units in Q&A if
you want. But it's really important to understand all the growth opportunities we see
across these seven strategies and what we think it can mean for the overall
proﬁtabilities or for the business over the long term.
So ﬁrst and most important, quite simply is we want to be the employer of choice.
We call our employees partners and that's partly because they have ownership in the
Company. Our stock-based equity programs go very deep -- down into the store at
the barista level.
We've always had compensation and beneﬁts that are signiﬁcantly above where the
rest of the industry is. And that's included health care at 20 hours a week long before
the Aﬀordable Care Act. We've had that in place and it kicks in at 20 hours.
That includes beverage on shift. It now, starting in January, includes food on shift for
our partners, which both gives them a nice beneﬁt and reinforces the quality of food
that we have in our store, particularly since the Lava Lunch [ph] launch.
It includes (inaudible) stock, as I mentioned; the College Achievement Plan, which
gives them beneﬁts at their junior senior year in college and opens up college
education for many of our partners, as well as a broad base pay and incentive pay
for our managers.
We talked a bit on the most recent call about some investments we're making. Those
investments kicked in primarily in January. So again, the food beneﬁt I talked about;
a broad impact of base pay raises, start pay raises, across the market. There's no
targeted number of any market -- we did market-based cost of living adjusted raises.
And so by each market, the percentage and the amount is diﬀerent. We felt very
good about the money that we've put to work in there.
We made those decisions back in the summer. I know other amounts changes. And
we think that's a good thing, recently. But our changes were actually decided on, put
in place, in the summer and went into full eﬀect in January.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 19One thing that's on this slide that's important and we'll talk about more as we move
through time is an investment in technology and tools for our partners in the stores.
So while the technology we have that faces our customers, which we'll talk about, we
think is leading the industry, I think in the stores, around the POS, inventory
capability, mobile apps for our partners, scheduling capability -- all of that we're
probably around the median and we want to be leading.
So as we get through the end of this year and into next year, you'll see us talk about
and quantify for you a number of investments we want to make in technology and
tools that will make things easier and faster in our partners. And we're going through
a big assessment of that as we speak.
Second, we want to lead in coﬀee. So we have a lot of things. And we'll talk about
the opportunities that are going on in our stores around additional bay [ph] parts
and opportunities we see in food. But at its core, Starbucks wants to lead in coﬀee.
And I think the pinnacle of this discussion is the Reserve store that I showed you
earlier. But it goes further than that, beyond the Roastery.
So it includes general broadening of the Reserve product line. So putting Reserve
coﬀees and Clover machines in more stores and more places and more countries
around the world. And we certainly accelerated that. And I think the Roastery gives
us a unique capability to even broaden that and deepen that further.
It includes pour-overs in more markets. China, Charlie can talk about, has a great
coﬀee experience in many of our stores around pour-overs. And gives customers a
chance to interact with baristas and understand coﬀee better.
Importantly, it includes agronomy. So we have a number of farmer support centers
around the world where we work with farmers to improve yield, to understand
fertilizer, to understand the risk around rust, which is a risk for coﬀee plants in many
parts of the world. And allows us to make sure we understand and invest in a
sustainable set of practices across the globe.
Then increasingly, our beverage innovation includes things like iced teas and other
things. But it also includes core coﬀee drinks like the ﬂat white that we just launched,
which is oﬀ to a great start.
And again, our ability to execute and source high-quality espresso, make that in
store, allows us to broaden out innovation in what I would call core coﬀee beverage.
So coﬀee's critical.
Growing the store portfolio. So you can see the targets up there -- both in total in
country. We'll have 1650 new stores this year. Over half of those are in China Asia-
Paciﬁc. The US and Americas comes in at 650 and EMEA at 150. And increasingly,
what gives us conﬁdence around this is additional analytics and capabilities around a
broad base of store formats.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 19So we've been opening in the US, as an example, an increasing percentage of drive-
through stores that have an eat-in aspect and a drive-through aspect. Those stores
have higher AUDs [ph] on average, higher proﬁtability on average. And higher total
return on average than a store that just has eat-in only. So we're continuing to
broaden out drive-throughs.
Beyond that traditional drive-through we have a couple of handfuls of drive-through-
only stores. So in markets and geographies where we would normally not build a
Starbucks store -- it could be an industrial area that has a high amount of vehicle
traﬃc; it could be in a transitional area where we can't get a full footprint in but we
can get a pad and put a drive-through-only in -- those are stores where we see
opportunities to put real estate and stores in where we weren't able to go before. A
lot of those stores are already over $1 million in AUD and trending right up toward
the portfolio average.
In addition, we have smaller-footprint stores, which include kiosks. You can see there
a mobile store. So that's for things like college campuses and other places where we
have the ability to be for part of the day. Making sure we get the execution right, we
get the menu right. And we think we've got some opportunity there.
And it includes small-footprint stores. So there's several of these that I see just
walking around in New York. So places where either because of economics or just
lack of space we can't put a full Starbucks store with dine-in seating, we're able to
put a small store. If any of you came out to Investor Day, you saw an example of this
that we actually built in our headquarters, where it's basically a walk-through store.
You walk in one door, you order, you walk out the other door.
All of this is opening up real estate opportunities. It gives us a chance to segment
and add stores. Flagship stores, like the store in downtown Disney, which has given
an incredible volume. A great investment for both us and Disney.
As we broaden out that tool kit and broaden out our mindset around the types of
stores we can build, we've got increased conﬁdence both in the US and globally in
hitting those numbers. And so far, over the last couple of years, the stores that we
have opened are as proﬁtable as many stores we've opened in our history. So things
are working well.
Incremental occasions. And a lot of this is around food. But it's also around
beverage. So we continue to want to own the morning. This is things like our
improved breakfast sandwich platform, which we launched last March. And we're still
seeing a 29% lift in the most recent quarter in total breakfast sandwich sales.
We launched a new breakfast sandwich over the last week or two called the double
smoked bacon -- I think that's right; John's checking me on that. It's a fantastic
sandwich but it's a new introduction and we'll see opportunities in the morning day
part, oﬀers like SKUs, limited-time oﬀers, to continue to drive that breakfast occasion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 19Then at lunch, we've seen food growth at lunch; it's the highest part of our day part
for food as far as growth standpoint is concerned. So percentage growth, it's not
necessarily dollars. And lunch has grown at 14% to 15% over the last two quarters.
And we see an additional opportunity to continue to see lunch grow kind of in that
teens growth rate over the next few years. So lunch will be the largest percentage
growth for us.
We've been up-leveling the lunch platform, actually for a number of years. We
recently launched a couple of sandwiches, really with the Lava Lunch [ph], inﬂuence
will continue to roll out and replace and up-level additional SKUs in lunch as time
goes by.
In the afternoon, it's really about refreshments and snacks for us. It's about having
relevant, refreshing drinks. So things like Teavana shakes and iced teas, which we
saw were a big hit this summer. And we're actually up 20% year over year, even in
the most recent quarter. Obviously it's winter out. So to see that kind of growth in
iced tea signiﬁes that we have a winner in Teavana.
There are other things in that refreshment platform like Fizzio, like refreshers. And
snacks that go along with it. And again, I want to emphasize that that 11.00 to 3.00
day part, those four hours, is where we've seen our highest comp growth over a one;
and two-year period in most of our quarters over the last couple of years.
So we continue to see outsize growth in lunch, even before we fully roll out the rest
of the lunch food platform.
Then, evenings. We have about 30 evening stores today. We've tested all for
diﬀerent concepts and formats. We think we have a winner now; we'll probably open
several hundred stores at the end of this year. We think evenings can be up to 20%
of our total portfolio. It has unique foods oﬀering in the US, which includes small
plates that can be shared. Obviously, beer and wine is part of the ticket.
But when we look at the average ticket, we see a good mix between food, beer and
wine. And core drinks. So people will come in, a small group, they'll order something
to share, one or two will get beer or wine, some will get espresso or a tea drink,
generally a little bit larger ticket. And it allows us to capture a bit more traﬃc in a day
part that's a little bit lower in volume for us.
CPG. So lots of opportunities in CPG. And for us it's really about meeting our
customers where they are. So whether they're on the go or at home, in the grocery
store, we want to be able to have relevant oﬀerings for our customers via CPG. And
there's two big growth opportunities to focus on right now in CPG; there are others.
But two major growth drivers over the next ﬁve years.
The ﬁrst is to continue to extend our lead in single serve. So this is primarily K-cup in
the USA. We've seen signiﬁcant growth. We hit a No. 1 share, most recently in the last
quarter; that's been a share position we've traded on and oﬀ a little bit with one ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 19our competitors. But generally at the top of the share list in K-cups. And we've really
grown that over the last few years by expanding choice for our customers.
So we know we occupy a premium space within the grocery aisle around ﬂavor
proﬁle and oﬀering of product. And we also knew we have opportunities to continue
to add SKUs, whether it's ﬂavored SKUs like cinnamon [ph] dolce or mocha, single
origin coﬀees -- every time we add and innovate around those SKUs, we generally
see a pickup in volume. And so we have a lot of things lined up with Green Mountain
to continue that momentum that we've had to date.
The other opportunity in CPG is really around international. And probably the
biggest near-term opportunity within that is ready to drink. So when you look at
ready to drink internationally, we're in 21 countries already. We think there's a
signiﬁcant opportunity both to expand the countries we're in in ready to drink -- for
example, in China -- and also drive increased market share. We know we can get the
recipes right, we know we can get the distribution right. We just have to put it all
together and drive the growth.
So CPG will continue to grow roughly at the rate it's grown over the last few years.
Next is tea. So we've talked about Teavana already. The biggest opportunity for us is
today and it's happening today in Starbucks stores. We've talked about iced tea. Hot
Teavana tea products launched fully across the US in January. So all the chai tea, hot
tea oﬀerings are now Teavana. And again, we continue to see lift both in price point
and in unit volume as we introduce Teavana. So we know we have a winner.
We'll continue to test and learn and understand the tea bar concept. We have about
six across the US, several of them here in New York. And we want to see what the
concept might work, what it looks like. And then how we'll roll that across the
country.
And last but not least, all things digital and mobile. It's really important to focus on
what we call the echo system here. We have the Starbucks card, where one in six
Americans got a Starbucks card last holiday.
We have the rewards program. So once you get a card, we try to get you to register
it for the Starbucks reward program, which is a great thing for our customers and a
great thing for us. We can understand what your likes are, what behavior is over time.
And we can do marketing that's relevant to you and helpful for us.
Then, the mobile payment program more and more has functionality. Not only just
pay but, as we've launched in Portland, an ability to actually order and pay and walk
into the store and pick up and really skip the line in the ordering line.
You can see some of the transactions there -- we're now at 16% of transactions on a
mobile device. We expect that to continue to go up; that's doubled over the last yearFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 19or two. And we'll continue to drive more mobile and MSR adoption through mobile
order and pay.
And soon -- to be launched this summer -- mobile order, pay. And deliver. So the
ability to have Starbucks deliver to you where you are at home or at work.
On mobile order and pay we launched in Portland in December with 150 stores.
We'll launch in the next two weeks in the Northwest, where we'll have 600 stores.
And the launch in Portland has gone very well, both from a qualitative standpoint --
all the ﬁnancial metrics that we're seeing there are at or above our expectations.
And the qualitative aspects, the impacts on customers and partners, that's running
ahead of where we expected as well. It's dead easy for our customers. It's fully
integrated into the app. It's easy for our partners because it's fully integrated into the
POS and the drink production system that we have today. And so we're seeing a
really good start in Portland.
MSR, I talked about. I think what's important is the chart on the right. We're in very
early days of growing our MSR population and growing our capability within the
Company to mine that data and provide relevant oﬀers and marketing to our
customers. And so we're starting to see some very early good results there, as you
can see. But we're just getting started in all things digital. But particularly in the MSR
one-to-one marketing space.
I dropped a slide somewhere. But that's okay. The slide -- let's see if it's next; hold
on. No, okay. I'm going to talk about it instead. The slide that was there was just
around coﬀee prices. And I'll just say a quick reminder -- we're 94% price-locked for
2015. We're starting to price 2016.
I think as you all know, we didn't buy a lot of coﬀee when it spiked up generally
above 180 on the seed price. Just the fundamentals that we saw and heard coming
out of origins didn't really support that level of price. And of course, it's a good thing
that we were right and coﬀee has come down into our target price and we've priced
a signiﬁcant amount of coﬀee.
As we get closer to 2016, we'll talk more about how that's shaping up, given our
activities further out on the curve.
Cash returns to shareholders -- as you can see, they've ramped up nicely. Operating
cash ﬂow growing almost 30%. So we still are generating a ton of cash in the
business; we're returning that through a dividend that's generally grown over the
years. And we'll continue to pay out within that 35% to 45% dividend payout ratio.
There's an opportunity to move up a bit within that.
Then, share buybacks generally equal to oﬀset dilution. Again, we'll lean one way or
the other depending on cash needs and market conditions around that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 19So there's the seven strategies in 20 minutes or less. Underneath that, it's important -
- I'll just say a couple of things around some speciﬁc margin improvement initiatives
that underlie all of that, which are really around driving COGS improvement.
So last year, we had $150 million of rate-related P&L savings from our supply chain
that we realized. This year, that number will be about $200 million. And over the
course of four years, that'll add up to $1 billion. So we have momentum, we have
speciﬁc work streams to drive that. It's real rate savings in the P&L and we're oﬀ to a
great start already this year.
G&A and support costs -- we reduced our run rate by about half from -- generally
we've been growing G&A and support costs about equal to revenue. This year we're
trying to grow at half that rate. And that math works out to be about $100 million in
savings.
That's getting reinvested; it's all in our forecast numbers. But it's important that we
free that up, that expense investment, up for other things that we prioritize as growth
opportunities in the business.
That's really all this says. This slide basically says COGS and G&A have been growing
equal to revenue. We grow revenue double digits; that just doesn't work
mathematically. It's not an equation that we love. We want to get leverage in COGS
and G&A and so you can see the math of what the opportunity is for us.
Oh, there's the coﬀee slide. Sorry -- it just got in a diﬀerent order than what I had.
There it is. So really all this says is if you look at the spike that happened in the
middle of last year, we weren't buying in that time frame and as it's dipped down
we've purchased up to 94%. That's really all that says.
As far as long-term targets, comp growth in the mid-single digits.
Revenue growth of 10% or more. This year we want G&A growth to be half of
revenue growth. Going forward, that relationship between revenue and G&A, we
want a few points of a gap between revenue growth and G&A growth. I'm not sure
half the rate makes sense just given the growth of the Company and the things we
want to invest in. But if we can have a few points of a gap in between there.
Long-term EPS growth of 15% to 20%. And ROIC of over 25% and increasing by 50
to 100 basis points a year.
So that's kind of our target.
And when you add it all up, as I mentioned at the beginning, we have a clear
execution framework. And innovation is a core competency for Starbucks. I got a
question earlier today -- what innovation is the most exciting to me? Really, you have
to narrow it down a little bit. We have signiﬁcant product innovation, we haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 19Joe Buckley
Scott Mawsigniﬁcant innovation within our digital capabilities, we have innovation in beverage
execution, we have innovation around Reserve coﬀee. It's just what we do at
Starbucks is we drive innovation. And that fuels growth.
We have fantastic operations, both in the US and internationally with Charlie and
John Culver driving the operations in Asia and Kris Engskov running EMEA, which
has been a tremendous turnaround story for us. And strong ﬁnancial discipline with
what we see as some incremental margin opportunities to help us fuel growth in the
near term. Okay?
{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Okay. Scott, thank you very much. I'll lead oﬀ the Q&A. And again, if there's question
from the audience, please raise your hand.
Scott, could you talk about the recent management changes at Starbucks? Troy
Alstead taking a leave and Kevin Johnson joining the Company from the Board to be
Chief Operating Oﬃcer.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. So they're two diﬀerent things that sort of aligned for us in January. In the most
recent investor day that we had in November, Troy was all in, very involved in
preparing and presenting during that investor day. Then he took a bit of time oﬀ
around the holidays, had some discussions with his family and did a lot of thinking.
And decided to take advantage of a great beneﬁt that we have at Starbucks that we
call the Coﬀee Break. It's a sabbatical. And it gives up to a year oﬀ for people that
have been at least 10 years at Starbucks. And I think Troy had been thinking about
that for some period of time.
But I think the stars aligned for him around a number of fronts to do it now. No, 1, his
oldest is reaching the end of high school years and so I think if Troy wanted to spend
the maximum amount of time with his family, this was the last real window before
they started graduating kids and having them move out.
I think if Troy was here, he would tell you he has a very level of conﬁdence in
management with John and Cliﬀ and Kris really driving the operation. You've got
people like Adam Brotman running the digital capability. There's just a lot of
substantial leadership and tenured leadership across the Starbucks continuum. So I
think when he looked at how well the business was doing as we exited the quarter, I
think he had a lot of conﬁdence he was leaving us in good hands.
And we'll miss Troy. I'll probably miss him as much as anyone; he's a fantastic
executive and a great person to have at Starbucks. But you certainly have to respect
the courage and the prioritization that he had to pull this oﬀ. So we all feel really
good for Troy and a little bit sad that he's leaving.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03

Page 11 of 19Joe Buckley
Charlie JemleyThen separately from that, Kevin Johnson, who has been a very active Board
member for years with Starbucks, deﬁnitely on the active side of all Board members,
involved in audit [ph] committee and just involved with us pretty deeply in general,
had been having some discussions with Howard about are there things that Kevin
can do more? Kevin's still pretty young; he's in his 50s. And I think was enjoying the
Starbucks story, enjoying being involved in that. But wanted to go deeper.
And so I think those two things came together. And with Kevin's signiﬁcant and deep
international operations experience and his great technology background. And
given where our growth is, probably disproportionately towards tech and
disproportionately towards international, it was -- as Howard said, we had a No. 1
pick that we could put in the spot as things lined up.
Kevin is already digging in. I have many emails on my phone that I haven't been able
to get back to him on already. So he's going to pick up in a lot of places where Troy
left oﬀ. Helping work with me around driving prioritization, bringing that operations
team together to drive around our priorities, getting the supply chain and IT
connected in the right way with the business.
Then, Kevin will have his own agenda of things around IT and digital and how we run
and measure the business. So he's oﬀ to a great start already.
{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Charlie, if I could take advantage of your presence with us here today, can you tell us
a little bit about Starbucks' business in China? How the Chinese consumer uses the
brand, how the brand is positioned versus what we're used to in the United States.
And maybe talk about some of the growth.
{BIO 20239120 <GO>}
Yes. There's a lot of similarities between the businesses -- that's the good thing. But
we do have some diﬀerences. More of an afternoon business, obviously, versus a
morning. Our stores are very little take-away, large party size. Blended is probably
more important in Asia than it is in the US.
And we have very little customization at this point, which I think is a big upside for us.
Which means that while people enjoy the brand, they enjoy the third [ph] place
atmosphere, they haven't yet attached the coﬀee yet, which is the big up side.
Scott mentioned, in terms of innovation, we're really excited about Reserve and
pour-over. And we've got pour-over bars in China now that we have open and
they're doing very well. Not only for the customers who get to sit and enjoy the pour-
over experience. But for the customers in the queue or in the rest of the store
watching what's going on. So there's a bit of theater. So there's an observational
theater aspect to it that they get to pick up on.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03

Joe BuckleyAnd they may not go over to the bar, they may not be comfortable just yet doing
that. But they see it and observe it. Then, that sort of ﬁts to the Chinese tea culture,
the pour-over nature.
So there's a lot of both product and experience innovation that we're doing in China
that I think separates us from competition that's gone very well.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
How is the brand from a price point relative to the US, given the income diﬀerences
between China and the United States? (inaudible) how it works for you.
{BIO 20239120 <GO>}
First thing I would say about that is just relative to our competitors, we've very
similarly priced. But if you do an aﬀordability index, the math would tell you that it's a
more luxurious purchase in China than it is in the US.
But that's never. And doesn’t appear to be, an impediment at all. We don't have the
high degree of frequency yet so we have a lot of room in price to go, I think. So even
though we're, on a relative basis, maybe a little bit more expensive purchase. But
everybody in there with us is in a very similar price position. So we're pretty
comfortable where we sit on that.
And we have great design, great stores. Again, I talk about pour-over, a very good
experience. People gather in our stores and stay for a long time so they see the
value they're getting. It's not just about what's in the cup, it is about the experience.
And because they take time in the experience, I don't think the price actually
manifests itself as a value issue for them.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
And the only thing I would add to that -- it's really well said -- is the price that we
charge largely reﬂects the cost of doing business in China. There are very real costs
to making sure we have the supply chain right, costs to making sure we have real
estate right. And so that all goes into the price that we charge. And I think many of
our competitors' charges are comparable.

Scott, one for you, back to the Americas. You guys hosted a very thorough and
interesting investor day at the end of last year. One of the things that stood out is
that although the margins in the Americas segment are at all-time record levels, you
envision them going higher over the next ﬁve years.
Could you talk a little bit about the components of that? And some of it is top-line
driven, I know. And some of it is cost driven. Just your conﬁdence in achieving thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03

Conﬁdence is high. If you break it down, when you take mid-single-digit comps and
you take the even historic expansion that we have and you lever across that across
that ﬁxed cost infrastructure, we get a fair bit of operating leverage. I think when you
add on top of that the COGS savings and some things we can do around support
costs, broadly G&A, that contributes to margin.
What oﬀsets that. And I think rightfully so, will be a number of investments. So even
mobile order and pay, as fantastic as we all think it's going to be -- and I'm at the top
of that list -- there's an investment curve at the front end where it'll be a little bit of a
margin drag.
But I think most importantly, Joe, is the investment that we're making in partners.
That number, I think rightfully so, is the biggest investment we'll make across the
Company this year. And that will have an impact on margins and we're happy to do
it.
So I think it's about continuing to operationally and for our customers drive the right
level of traﬃc, launch things like mobile order and pay, which has a little bit of a
front-end investment, then is extremely accretive and transaction accretive.
Then, taking that ﬁxed cost leverage and all the things that come oﬀ that healthy
growth and reinvesting in partners and the next thing that's coming along around
delivery. Other investments we'll want to make around product launches. And so
that's kind of how we think about it.
To put some numbers on it, I would expect -- so it's a great big business in the US. I
would expect margins to expand several tens of basis points every year. There might
be a quarter here and there when we lean in on investment a little bit or there might
be a quarter here and there where there's a little bit more tailwind. But I would
expect to see sort of 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion over time in that US
business.
{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Okay. You talked about mobile a little bit. And I know you launched it in Portland, I
guess just a couple of months ago, in the beginning of December. Very few
companies sort of launch in their ﬁrst live market and also disclose plans to be fully
rolled out within 12 months. I've followed Starbucks for a long time; I wasn't shocked.
But talk about your early experiences and the conﬁdence in rolling it out so rapidly
over next year, this calendar year.

Page 14 of 19I think -- I talked a little bit about this. But the qualitative aspects; think about the
modeling that we did. We have a very, I think, appropriate model that we think is
going to drive signiﬁcant value for us as we grow out mobile order and pay.
Early days -- a couple of months in. That trajectory across all the measures --
incrementality, MRS signup, all the things that we measure -- it's right on or above
that model. So we're really happy about that start.
It's 150 stores in Portland. So it's a meaningful market. But obviously we'll continue to
learn as we go through, rolling out 600 incremental stores. So quantitatively, it's
quite encouraging and we'll continue to measure that. And as we get further into it,
we'll share some of those speciﬁcs with you.
I think qualitatively is where it's running ahead of plan. And so the ease of
understanding it from a partner standpoint -- I told you this story before. But we sent
out a training video to our partners. And because the system is so integrated in what
we do every day, the training video is almost exclusively about what the customer
goes through. It's not actually, hey, here's all the things you have to do diﬀerently for
mobile order and pay because there really aren't many.
It comes into the POS just like every other transaction. If something goes wrong, you
can pull that transaction up with the customer there and make a change; you don't
have to go to a POS in the cloud or a diﬀerent spot in the store. Go through the
same production line over to the same hand-oﬀ plane. And so it's highly intuitive for
our partners.
And because customers have responded favorably, partners are happy. It reduces
the amount of time waiting at the POS.
Then, customers are learning and loving it. So there is some in-store marketing, we
did some out-of-store marketing. So the understanding and the adoption curve is
moving along nicely. And generally what we ﬁnd is if customers don't know about it
and they see it in action in the store, they'll ask questions of either another customer
or a barista. And they're really trying to learn and understand and perhaps sign up.
So a couple of months into it, Portland's gone very well.
The other thing that we haven't talked much about but Adam would tell you is we
expect, when we roll a major app like this, to have some hot ﬁxes we needed to do.
We haven't had any of those yet, knock on wood.
We don't have Android Robot yet; it's just IOS. So we know that'll be a signiﬁcant lift
within a few months when we get that ready.
There's some capabilities around understanding inventory trends so that we know
whether items are likely to be out or in stock. That capability hasn't been added toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03

{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
In the Portland market, have you found it more eﬀective in a diﬀerent type of
footprint that Starbucks has -- urban stores or drive-throughs or suburban stores. Has
it varied by the types of store?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
We know the answer to that question. But we haven't disclosed it yet. What I would
say is common sense just tells you in highly busy both urban and suburban stores -- I
think a lot of people think it's just going to be in those in-city markets that have a big
peak in the morning. I think we'll see a beneﬁt in urban, suburban stores that have
heavy traﬃc at peak. And I think we'll see the beneﬁt throughout the day.
But our modeling is based upon a disproportionate share of that beneﬁt at peak in
our busiest stores, which just makes sense. That's where the lines are the longest and
that's where people want that choice.
I think it's important to note as we've rolled drive-through out over the last 10 years
or so. And given customers that choice, as I mentioned, those stores perform far
better than stores that don't have a drive-through. And I really think mobile order
and pay taps that same opportunity.
So for us, what we see with our customers is drive-through's about convenience, it's
about speed, it's about how I want to interact with Starbucks. And really, mobile
order and pay follows that same trajectory.
{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
If there are questions in the audience, please raise your hand. If not, I'm going to
keep proceeding here.
Scott, one more maybe on the mobile ordering. It's easy to understand how that
eases things at the point of sale. What is the impact on the production and how is it
faster and more eﬃcient?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
We have the ability in virtually all of our stores to add additional staﬃng, even at
peak. And so as those stores have more transactions, the labor system gives them
more labor, they earn labor. And that labor depends on the number of transactions,
the type of transactions based upon complexity, more warming of food versus less.
And so as transactions go up. And we think they will at peak, we'll be able to add
more staﬀ and move things through.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03

Questions And Answers
What happens to Troy when his coﬀee break is over?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Well we hope he comes back. I certainly hope he comes back. And I'm planning on
it.
Okay. And assuming he does come back, what would he do?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think that's one of the things that I think Troy has to decide and we have to decide. I
think if he was here he would say a year is a long time. As he sits today, he only
knows, working at Starbucks, he loves the Company deeply. And so I think he wants
to come back.
How that changes over the course of the next year, who knows? I'm not even sure
Troy knows. Then, does he want to come back into a 100-mile-an-hour job or does
he want to ﬁnd something that's maybe a little bit more balanced? I don't know.
But I think if he wants to come back, there's no end of work that we can do with Troy
at Starbucks. There's lots of things he can do to help us. That would be a good
problem to have.
{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
You have a question over here.
I had a question on your Chinese stores. You said they're primarily, like, afternoon
day part. Is there any initiative to drive more of a morning kind of coﬀee or is there
just diﬀerent consumption pattern where that's just not the main form of
consumption, usage, case the Chinese consumers have?
{BIO 20239120 <GO>}
I think -- we segment our stores in China. So if we're in an oﬃce tower, we may have
a diﬀerent initiative there. But I think primarily food. I think as we up-level the coﬀee
experience -- we talked about Reserve. Pour-over may not be something in theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantmorning because people are in a hurry. But as we sort of dial up knowledge and use
of coﬀee, then that sort of ﬁts in the morning day part along with food.
So there's lots of ways that we can turn on the mornings. But it'll take a little bit
longer to build that versus what we have in the afternoons, just given the habit. The
last shoe to drop from dinner to lunch to morning is kind of the way people
consume, not just in our business but other businesses. So the morning being the
most habitual home thing. At some point that code will be cracked as well.
{BIO 1491816 <GO>}
Scott, can you talk about the recent increase in -- I'm trying to think, you mentioned
the food and the beverage for your partners, for your workers. Also the wage
increases that have been implemented. Just the thought process around that.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think if you look over time, we've had a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the beneﬁts
and pay that we oﬀer and sort of the rest of the industry. And that diﬀerence drives
signiﬁcant -- we have lower turnover at the manager and barista level, higher
employee satisfaction. And we know that is the single biggest key to success for
Starbucks and success in the stores. There's just no doubt about it.
And so as we got into the summer we started to look at, how -- are there ways out
there where we truly can bolster that diﬀerence and invest in it? And so for us
naturally being already ahead of Aﬀordable Care Act in health care, with the stock
beneﬁt, we naturally started looking at cash compensation. Again, this was back in
August.
We started looking at a food beneﬁt, which we'd been talking about for a while. It
just makes so much sense for us given where food's going for Starbucks. And so we
put those into our plan and we executed them, really before some of the recent
changes were announced. We understand, while others in the space have done that.
But we had this lined up and ready to go for a number of months now.
And I think, honestly, Joe, that would be something that we look at and we watch
every year. It's not that we haven't been increasing Starbucks wage [ph] and we
haven't been increasing wages -- we have some about that we add every year. This
year we said that if we try to take a deep look and take a bigger step to reach down
that path. And I think there'll be more of that as we look in the future, whether it's
cash compensation or the technology investments I've talked about. We've got to
make sure that we're disproportionately investing in our partners.
I have a question about sourcing and supply chain. Can you speak to your forward-
looking vision with respect to sourcing of coﬀee in terms of diﬀerentiation, cost
advantages, and relative sustainability?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-03
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 18 of 19A - Scott Maw
A - Joe Buckley
A - Scott Maw{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Right. The key to our coﬀee sourcing is what we call cafe practices. And cafe
practices is our collection of safe sustainability initiatives. And they include
everything from farmer ﬁnancing to cultivation on the farm -- all the aspects of
everything that goes into developing a sustainable supply chain.
They are up to or better than fair trade, frankly. And we are over 90% cafe-practice
certiﬁed. We actually certify and audit cafe practices to make sure every farm that we
source coﬀee from is following cafe practices and cafe-practice certiﬁed. So we're
over 90%. We think in the next two or three years our goal is to get to 100% basically
ethically sourced coﬀee and we think that's best in class, as good as you can get.
We build farmer support centers in countries all around the world where we put
agronomists on the ground. And their job isn't to further Starbucks' coﬀee supply
chain; their job is to further the coﬀee supply chain broadly. So we share agronomy
capabilities, we share learnings. On our coﬀee farm in Costa Rica we're doing things
around planting and cultivating more drought-resistant, disease-resistant strains.
Then as we develop those plants, we share them with everyone.
Again, whether folks produce coﬀee for Starbucks or not, for us it doesn't really
matter. It's about developing sustainable producibility.
We're always looking at additional countries where we can add those farmer support
centers and put in some of the best coﬀee knowledge in the world to teach farmers
how to do things better. And it's all about driving that production. But in the right
way with the right level of fertilizing, the right level of water, understanding when to
replace plants. And just having those good basics around agronomy that we know
so deeply about. But it takes a while, as we come into a country, to spread that
knowledge.
