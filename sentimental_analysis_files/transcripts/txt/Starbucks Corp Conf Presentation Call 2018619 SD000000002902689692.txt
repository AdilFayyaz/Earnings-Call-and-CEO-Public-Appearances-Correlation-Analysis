Thank you, again for coming to the 18th Annual Oppenheimer Consumer
Conference. And thanks for joining us for the last presentation of the day. We're
obviously very grateful to have Starbucks Corporation with us, a company that
arguably has represented the best large-cap growth story in consumer for a number
of years.
At Oppenheimer, Starbucks is an outperform-rated stock with a $66 price target.
What we're going to do is we're going to have Kevin and Scott both give a
presentation. Then afterwards, we're only going to do about 10 minutes of Q&A. And
then they actually have a conference call scheduled for 6 p.m. after this presentation
that you can all listen to as well.
So with that, I will hand it over to Kevin.

Brian, thank you. It's a pleasure to be here today. I'm here with Scott, our Chief
Financial Oﬃcer. Roz Brewer is with us in the audience, our Chief Operating Oﬃcer,
along with our IR team.
The IR team has asked me before we begin to just mention the forward-looking
statements and the safe harbor message that's before you.
I want to begin by setting some context. I think oftentimes, it's too easy to fall into
the trap of looking at the morning comp report or the weekly ﬁnancial ﬂash or
preparing and looking at the quarterly earnings. I want to set context for the long
term. Many have written about transitions from founder-led to founder-inspiredFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 2 of 21companies. Now I personally have experienced it myself multiple times. In fact, I've
worked with founders for the last 25 years. When I joined the Starbucks board nearly
a decade ago, I had the opportunity to work with Howard Schultz, one of the iconic
entrepreneurs and founders of our generation. And the last 3.5 years working
intimately with Howard.
In fact, our 2 oﬃces are connected by a door. And that door is symbolic. It's symbolic
of the open and transparent partnership we have developed. And it's also symbolic
of Howard's willingness to teach and my desire to learn everything I could about his
nearly 4 decades of experience building Starbucks.
And we have worked in a very thoughtful, intentional way to ensure that this is a
smooth transition into the next chapter of Starbucks. And we're now at an inﬂection
point. Certainly, with Howard transitioning oﬀ the board and entering a new chapter
of his life, it's an inﬂection point, a transition.
And what I want to share with you today are some -- not only some unique things
that I think I can bring to the table at this important time for Starbucks. But our
priorities and the focus that we have that I believe will transition this company into a
great next chapter of growth at scale.
Now 3 things that I think I bring that are a little bit diﬀerent. I tend to be much more
data driven and analytical. And I'm bringing that to Starbucks. But I'm also very
appreciative and respectful of the creative and the emotional aspects of the brand.
Certainly, I tend to bring a much more disciplined approach to picking the priorities.
And that's because in my experience at scale, if you pick the right priorities and you
put the resources and energy behind them, you move the needle. And third, I
believe in a distributed leadership model, transitioning from a hub-and-spoke
leadership model to a distributed model where I unleash the creativity, the power
and the energy of a world-class leadership team and that we get more parallelism
and more agility in the innovation we're bringing to market.
Now why is that so important? Well if you look at the fact that Starbucks was founded
in 1971 and over that 47 years has built a global reach and scale second to none. We
operate in 77 countries, over 28,000 stores, over 330,000 Starbucks' partners
proudly wear the green apron, serving nearly 100 million customer occasions a
week, global scale.
And in that journey, we've created signiﬁcant shareholder value. Now if I were to
think about this next chapter and the fact that over these 47 years in a founder-led
model, we've created an iconic consumer brand with global scale, this next chapter
starts to think about growth at scale.
And in many ways, the size and complexity of scale can often be the enemy of
speed. And so the focus that we're going to have is on the core value drivers for the
brand. We're going to become more agile innovators. And we're going to do it in a
way that unlocks shareholder value.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 21So let's just start by looking at the past three years of the ﬁnancial track record. Over
the past three years since I've joined the leadership team, we've delivered a top line
revenue CAGR of 10%, 17% on earnings per share. And we've returned $12 billion of
capital to shareholders. That said, our growth has been slowing. Now when you think
about growth at scale, growth at scale means we deliver predictable sustainable
growth at scale in a way that creates shareholder value.
In this last quarter, we had an unplanned initiative related to the incident in
Philadelphia that culminated in us closing our stores on May 29. And with that
unplanned incident, it is not an excuse for the fact that we're looking to post a 1%
comp globally this quarter. In fact, I expect better, our shareholders deserve better.
And this leadership team and I are committed to ﬁx this.
Now the fact that since May 29, our business in the U.S. has been comping and
tracking at a 3 comp for the month of June is not an excuse. Growth at scale means
we deliver consistent growth quarter after quarter, month after month, week after
week, year after year. And we've got to get into that dynamic.
Now how do we do that? Well the ﬁrst set of actions we've been taking over this past
year are characterized as streamlining the company. And the entire purpose of this is
being very thoughtful and intentional about how we're structuring the company in a
way that allows us to amplify our focus on the core value drivers.
Three pillars. Retail market alignment. Retail market alignment means looking at
each marketplace that we operate in the world and understanding what's the
holding capacity of stores, what's the return on invested capital and what is the best
model to drive growth and shareholder value. That is why we have transitioned a
number of markets from company-operated to licensed.
Speciﬁcally over this last year, Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, Brazil all transitioned
from company-operated to licensed. Our licensed partners are fantastic. And our
licensed partners in deploying their capital consistent with our brand will grow that
market faster than we would. And it allows us to focus our shareholder capital on the
higher return on invested capital market opportunities that we have and that we can
grow.
Now a comment, we are actively exploring strategic options in other appropriate
markets. Streamline is not ﬁnished. There are more steps to follow.
In addition to converting those markets to licensed, we also invested capital to
acquire 100% of our joint venture in East China. And that was the recognition that we
have a phenomenally signiﬁcant growth opportunity ahead in China. And the best
way to capture that is to unify Mainland China as a company-operated model. We'll
talk a bit more about that in a minute. But this is all about focusing on markets with
the right business model and the right growth agenda.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 21The second pillar under streamline, business simpliﬁcation. This is looking at every
aspect of the business. And if there are noncore, slow-growth assets, we've divested
of them. If there are things we can do to simplify things and simplify operations,
we've done that. This is all about operating margin improvement.
So we've divested of Tazo to allow us to focus on our core premium tea brand
Teavana. We closed the Teavana retail stores, understanding that when we launched
Teavana, we sold over $1.6 billion of Teavana in our U.S. Starbucks stores. So closing
those stores allowed us to focus on that distribution channel. And now we're taking
Teavana through our channels business down the aisle.
We transitioned our e-commerce site, shut down our internal e-commerce site,
transitioned to our channel partners. Companies like Amazon can do it better than
we can. And we've been going through a process to optimize our SKUs in the lobby
and in many parts of the store, all with an eye on operating margin improvement.
Then ﬁnally, we recently announced this Global Coﬀee Alliance with NestlÃ©. I'm
going to go into this in more detail. But this is absolutely about accelerating global
growth and taking the phenomenal business we've built in our channels in the U.S.
and Canada and taking it global, at the same time, bringing Starbucks coﬀee to the
Nespresso and Dolce Gusto platforms.
Now by streamlining the company, it allows us now to amplify our management
attention, our capital, our resources and our entire team with partners to execute
against the most important strategic priorities for the company. And they are as
follows: number one, it's about accelerating our growth in our targeted long-term
growth markets, China and the U.S. Those 2 markets have a signiﬁcant opportunity to
continue to drive the growth agenda for the company while beneﬁting from all the
licensed markets that are then paying royalties and product fees that will help grow
those markets.
Now China and the U.S., 2 important priorities they have, the ﬁrst is extend and
amplify our digital advantage. I'm going to take you through some data and some
new things that we've done with the Digital Flywheel. The #1 thing to unlock comp
growth in the U.S. is expanding the number of digital relationships we have. In
parallel with that, we're going to take you through how we are modernizing and
elevating the third place experience. And those 2 pillars are consistent pillars that
we've got to execute against in China and in the U.S.
Second priority is to expand and leverage the Starbucks brand with this Global
Coﬀee Alliance through NestlÃ©. We now have combined eﬀorts in this alliance with
2 of the most signiﬁcant consumer brand players in the category of coﬀee. And we'll
take you through what that's going to mean.
Then third is about sharpening our focus on shareholder value return. So we're
going to walk through how all of these priorities come together and how this really
sets the agenda for growth at scale.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 21Now China. We hosted 1.5 days China investor conference in Shanghai in May. So I'm
not going to go through all the content materials that we went through there. Those
are all posted for you to review on the website. But I just want to touch on 3
important points. The ﬁrst is characterizing the opportunity. First of all, you look at
the growing middle class. And everybody reports and the analysts predict that
middle class is growing from a population of 300 million to 600 million by the year
2022. 600 million people in China in the middle class is roughly double the entire
population of the United States.
And roughly 450 million of those 600 million are millennials. So you have a younger
generation who is being introduced to premium coﬀee at the point in time when
they are growing in numbers and at a point in time where they value the opportunity
to connect with others over coﬀee and tea in our stores. And so the inﬂection point
of this growth with what we're investing in, we think, is meaningful.
Coﬀee consumption. If you look at China, the average number of cups per capita per
year is less than 1. It's about 0.5 cup per year. In the U.S., it's about 300. So the
opportunity to introduce this growing population to coﬀee and do it in a way that
elevates their experience through experiencing coﬀee at a Starbucks store is a
signiﬁcant one.
Now there's a very clear growth agenda. We have an entire team led by Belinda
Wong, the CEO of Starbucks China. And a growth agenda that really is anchored
around partners and their families and how we create the environment for our
Starbucks partners to succeed and grow and have opportunity to be a part of the
Starbucks journey, creating that third place experience, extending it to digital and
then also extending it down the aisle in grocery and mass merchant, all the while
doing it in a way that's consistent with the culture and the values and the consumer
sentiment in China.
Now China really is our second home market. In fact, the long-term growth targets
that we have since we're now in the process of integrating and unifying East China
have allowed us to increase the new store growth count by 20%. We increased it
from 500 stores a year to 600 stores a year.
Now as we build 600 stores a year, by 2022, that should take us to north of 6,000
stores in China. As we're building in these new stores, we are going to enter
approximately 100 new cities in China. And each of those cities is the size of Los
Angeles or greater in population. So we're moving into 100 new cities that do not
have a Starbucks present that have a population the size of Los Angeles or greater.
Now I'll comment that China, the game is about new store growth. It is about
expanding the presence and the reach and growing the number of transactions and
the number of customer visits we have through new stores. So we'll continue to see
ebbs and ﬂows and same-store comp. But this is a play of establishing the brand.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 21And certainly, if we look at this quarter, there's going to continue to be new
dynamics in China. Right now, one of the priorities the team in China has is to --
they're in deep discussions with a large delivery partner to now light up delivery --
mobile ordering and delivery in our stores. That is a key priority they have. And so if
we look at how they're driving on their comps and what they need to do this quarter,
it's about new store growth and are we enhancing the experience by now expanding
into things like mobile order and delivery. That's China.
The U.S. In the U.S., much of what we've got to do is really adapt to the rapidly
changing consumer trends. And we identiﬁed 4 trends that we're focused on. The
ﬁrst is digital. And on digital, it's not just enabling Mobile Order and Pay and
delivery.
It's about establishing a digital relationship with more customers so that we can
communicate with them. And that digital relationship allows us to then use our
personalization engine and all the software platform that we've built to deepen that
engagement and do it in a way that's contextually relevant and situationally relevant
to every customer that we touch. So digital becomes a very critical priority or market
trend that we're focused on.
Second is convenience. Now we've been focusing on convenience. As we launched
Mobile Order and Pay, as we've started to build out drive-throughs attached to our
stores, as we think about new store formats, for example, we're piloting a new store
format right now in Manhattan at the Empire State Building that is a Mobile Order
pickup store only. It's right next to another store. So we're now starting to pilot more
things around convenience.
Now in pursuing convenience, we're going to be very careful not to disturb or
disrupt the fact that we create community in our stores. But we think we have an
opportunity to continue to extend both in a very unique way that no others can do.
Third is premiumization. And this is about providing custom beverages, custom
handcrafted beverages at scale. It's about premium ingredients, premium beverages
and a premium experience. And that's something that consumers are looking for.
Consumers are looking for those experiences and those premium beverages that
are customized for them.
Then the fourth trend is health and wellness. And there's a number of consumer
reports that sort of point to the fact that more consumers are going to choose
healthier-for-you food and beverage. Now how does this manifest itself at Starbucks?
Well let me just show you one data point.
On the left here, I show you -- from our company-operated stores in the U.S., I show
us the blended Frappuccino category and how revenue was -- grew 17% in FY '15 and
then steadily declined until year-to-date through May, it was at minus 3%. Now
Frappuccinos, that entire category in the industry, is in decline.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 21The category of what's called slushie coﬀee, which is what this falls under, is in
decline. And so we're seeing a similar thing. Now these are oftentimes more
indulgent beverages, higher in sugar, higher in calories. What we're seeing is then
consumer shifting to healthier beverage choices, better-for-you beverages. We see
that in our Teavana Shaken Iced Teas. And we see that in our refreshment portfolio.
If you look at our recent Afternoon Made campaign, this is why we are amplifying
many of these core beverages and amplifying the range of oﬀerings that we have
that allow us in that afternoon daypart to shift much of that customer base who's
choosing not to -- from more indulgent beverage to focus on a healthy -- healthier,
better-for-you beverage.
So what are the actions? Well we're going to accelerate relevant product innovation
around our core beverages. And this is really exempliﬁed by 3 things. First of all, we
launched Blonde Espresso earlier this year. And in launching Blonde Espresso, you
see we sustained an ad campaign for a long period of time to give customers the
opportunity to experience and taste and understand what ﬂavor proﬁle they prefer.
They can have Blonde Espresso or Signature Espresso. It's another way to
premiumize through customization.
And since that campaign ended, the Blonde Espresso trend is continuing. So we set
some -- we established a new product. We educated the customer base. And a
portion of those customers choose Blonde Espresso in their beverage choices.
Second, with Teavana and Refreshers, with Teavana Shaken Iced Tea Infusions. With
the Infusions, what we've done is we've separated ﬂavor with natural ingredients
from botanicals and fruits from sugar. So now with Teavana Shaken Iced Teas, a
customer can then choose to have the ﬂavoring they want. And they can either get it
unsweetened, lightly sweetened or sweetened. So we're putting the customer in
control of some of their choices.
This concept of separating ﬂavor from sugar is something we're working on now to
deploy across the entire platform where customers can have their coﬀee and tea
beverages in a certain ﬂavor and separate that decision of the sugars and the
sweetener.
So beverage innovation is key. Certainly, our coﬀee beverage, our Espresso
beverages, Teavana, Refreshers, one of the key things we've seen is the shift or the
growth in cold. And so our iced espresso beverages, our Cold Brew, Nitro Cold Brew
are all doing very well in this environment.
Now the ﬁnal piece of this is really acknowledging that plant-based beverages,
plant-based proteins are a choice that many consumers are gravitating towards. And
we've introduced almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk as choices in our beverages.
And coming later this summer, we have a blended protein Cold Brew where we start
using then plant-based proteins in a blended beverage with Cold Brew. So plenty of
innovation coming on the product road map really focused around those trends.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 21Now how do we make customers aware of all these new beverages and the choices
that they have? The answer is expanding the breadth of digital relationships is the #1
thing we can do in the U.S. to drive comp.
Now let me just share with you what we've done just in the last 90 days. If you look
back June a year ago, a year ago, we had approximately 13 million active Rewards
members. And I'll remind you, those active Rewards members use the mobile app to
order and pay. And in fact, that mobile app has become the #1 mobile payment in
the U.S. -- mobile payment scenario in the U.S., Starbucks mobile app at Starbucks.
Now to widen the aperture and attract more customers to our Digital Flywheel, we
took 3 very signiﬁcant actions that launched in the last 90 days.
Number one, we opened up Mobile Order and Pay for all customers. No longer do
customers have to sign up for the Rewards program. They could go and download
the app and do a mobile order and just put in their Visa card. And so customers have
the opportunity to use that. Second, for use -- for Wi-Fi in our stores, we had
customers sign up for Wi-Fi by giving us their email address. And we then simplify
their ability to connect to Wi-Fi going forward. And those customers then opted in
for us to communicate with them digitally, what we call a digital registration.
Then third, we reimagined Happy Hour. Happy Hour used to be sort of a mass
discounting time period that anyone that came in the store could participate in that
discount. What we've done with the reimagined Happy Hour is you now have to sign
up -- you have to register digitally and we use a digital single-use coupon for
customers to participate in Happy Hour.
Those 3 actions in the last 90 days have generated 5 million new digital
relationships. So we now have 5 million digitally registered customers who have
opted in for us to communicate with them. We're seeing good response and good
outcomes in our new reimagined Happy Hour. And this number will do nothing but
grow.
Over the next 3 to four years, we're going to consistently ﬁnd ways to acquire new
customers and now engage deeper with new customers. But with our 15 million
active Rewards members plus this incremental new 5 million digital registered
customers that we've acquired in the last 90 days, we're now at 20 million digital
relationships.
So what's next? Three major initiatives will enable acceleration of digital in ﬁscal '19
and beyond. I want to start with the one in the middle here, Stars For Everyone. In
the spring, we are now going to launch a program where anyone that registers a
credit card or a debit card can earn stars, simple as that. And every time you do a
transaction in the store with that same debit card and credit card, they will earn stars.
They'll earn stars at a lower rate than rewards customers. But they will earn stars. It's
a way to now attract customers who want to beneﬁt from the rewards program
simply by using their credit card and debit card.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 21In addition, when we launch Stars For Everyone in the spring, we're also going to go
to a multi-tier redemption where, let's say, a less expensive product in the store
could be redeemed for fewer stars, where a more expensive product in the store
might require more stars. That does 2 things. Number one, it allows a customer to
have a lower number of stars they need to earn before they can start getting beneﬁts
and rewards. And it also allows us to widen the range of products that we make
available for customers to redeem stars for and do it in a way that is a responsible
way on the discounting and margin. So those 2 events will create another wave of
customer acquisition.
Then perhaps one of the most important things we're doing is we are applying our
personalization engine to these new digitally registered customers.
Now you think about this, our ability from a technology standpoint to look at
tokenized credit card transactions, map up to a digitally registered customer allows
us to point this personalization engine that has driven signiﬁcant comp growth with
our active Rewards members and start to focus it on these digital registered
customers.
We think the combination of things we are doing as we go into FY '19, we expect that
to drive an incremental 1% to 2% points of comp in the U.S. Digital, very important.
Store portfolio. There are 3 principles that we're using to really determine how we're
managing our store portfolio in the U.S. The ﬁrst is we're going to grow our store
portfolio, targeting underpenetrated geographies. Now many have speculated, have
we hit a saturation point in the U.S.? I want to show you the data that shows we have
not. And our job is to make sure we are targeting the right markets, the right
geographies with those new stores.
We're going to leverage our store formats to blend those store formats in a way that
we can better serve customers in that area. Some stores may have a drive-through,
some may be a Reserve bar format. Some may just be a core Starbucks store.
And in addition, we relocate, reposition and close certain stores, as we have always
done. The principles we've used here as we deploy capital is, are we deploying
capital in a way that is that store is hitting the right AUV and margin to give us the
hurdle on return on invested capital.
So when we think about optimizing the store portfolio, what I show you here is the
data. This is a data-driven approach where we map the number of the population
per store that is supported by a store. And we start by looking at metropolitan
statistical areas and then counties and broaden it out. But you can see, all of the
space in Middle America, in the Midwest and down through the South is wide open.
And so a large proportion of our new store growth are going in the areas where we
are underpenetrated.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 21On new U.S. store growth, we intend to maintain the pace of new store growth going
into ﬁscal year '19 of company-operated stores.
Now I mentioned every year, we prune some number of company-operated stores,
either because we need to reposition them, the lease is expiring or they're
underperforming. Typically, that number is up to 50 stores. Going into ﬁscal year '19,
we are going to prune approximately 150 stores. Now we're going to increase the
number of stores that we're going to prune in this ﬁscal year '19 based on the data
that shows us by pruning those stores, we get not only comp lift. But we get
operating margin and operating income lift as well.
And these stores are typically in more dense areas. Oftentimes, they're in urban
areas where wage pressures and occupancy and sometimes other regulatory actions
that have been taken are making those stores unproﬁtable. So we're going to
increase the pruning to 150 stores.
On the licensed number of stores, we are also going to reduce the number of new
licensed stores in ﬁscal year '19 by approximately 100 stores. And this is working
closely with our licensed -- our channel licensed partners in the U.S. And part of this
is they're not building out new store footprints as fast. But it's also the realization that
managing this portfolio means we look at not only where company-operated stores
are located. But where licensed stores are located. And we know that we drive more
shareholder value in a company-operated store simply by the economics than in a
licensed store. So we're being thoughtful about how we optimize the store portfolio.
And Scott will share a bit more on the ﬁnancials and the details.
The third place experience is very important as we optimize the store portfolio. I'll
comment brieﬂy on Siren Retail. We currently have 2 Roasteries: Seattle and
Shanghai. And we're pleased those Roasteries continue to grow. We continue to
evolve. And we have 4 additional Roasteries under construction: Milan, New York,
Chicago and Tokyo. It takes us about a year to build 2 of these. So for the next 18
months, two years, we're going to be busy fulﬁlling the pipeline of what we've
created here.
Now I think of these as brand ampliﬁers. I think of these as innovation hubs for the
brand. And so we're going to stay with where we're at on 6 of these Roasteries for
right now until we continue to see how they evolve and the economics of them
going forward. But we do believe there may be opportunities for others. It's just
premature to make that decision. Right now we've got the work ahead of us to
continue to open these wonderful beautiful stores and continue to drive on the
economics behind them.
The Reserve stores with Princi, I want to introduce a new term. When we launch a
new store format, we launch that store format in what I call concept phase. Concept
phase means we deploy capital, we deploy resources, we build a number of these
stores and then we iterate on how to create the right ingredients, the right mix of
whether it's staﬃng, the store design, products to hit the AUV and the operatingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 21margin we need for these stores to hurdle a return on invested capital target that we
use. So the Reserve stores with Princi, we now have 1 in Seattle. And we will build
here in the coming six months or so 6 to 10. And we're going to use those 6 to 10 as
our sandbox for concept phase.
Now once a format exits concept phase, it goes into commercial phase. The Reserve
bars, the Reserve bar, which is the experience bar for Starbucks Reserve, that does
not include Princi. China, the team in China was the ones -- were the ones that
created that concept. They're now at more than 150 of those Reserve bars. And
they're in commercial phase. They're growing more as they continue their store
growth in these new cities.
In the U.S., we have about 20 of these stores in concept phase. And it is a goal that
I've given our team to really work over this next year to get that store format to the
point where it hurdles the economics to allow us to get into commercial phase. We
will not exit until we hit that target. But we've set that as a clear goal.
Then ﬁnally, our core Starbucks stores are in commercial phase. Now one of the
things I've done recently is I just promoted Liz Muller to be the Chief Design Oﬃcer
of the company reporting to me. Liz is a longtime partner in our store design. She
has single-handedly led the team who's designed all the Roasteries, all the Reserve
stores and intimately involved in the Reserve bars. She did a lot of work on the core
Starbucks brand prior to that. And so Liz is going to play that creative role to ensure
that as we're designing these stores and as we're taking concepts from the Reserve
brand, that we're bringing them into our core brand and weaving them together in a
way that have impact.
The next thing we look at in the U.S. is really -- and globally is really the investment
we make in our partners and how that investment translates to an enhanced
customer experience. Now we've been on a multiyear journey to continue to invest
in wage and best-in-class beneﬁts for our partners.
Now I'll tell you, at the end of the day, it is those 330,000 partners who proudly wear
the green apron in our stores who create that Starbucks Experience. And we will
continue to do everything we need to do and can do to ensure we create a great
partner experience for them, that we attract the kind of partners that create that
Starbucks Experience, create that connection with customers and continue to help
grow this brand. We're going to do everything we can to continue to create great
opportunities for our partners.
In parallel with that, we've worked to enhance the customer experience, not only
through partners but by helping make partners' jobs easier. Just 2 examples of that
was the work we did around Deployment 2.0. Deployment 2.0 was the set of
routines and the tools that we gave partners in the stores to handle not only the high
volumes that they were seeing at the peak morning daypart. But also then how to

Page 12 of 21Then SKU optimization is another one. We've reduced the number of SKUs in our
lobbies. We've reduced the number of SKUs in the stores, which makes it easier for
inventory management and easier -- or less administrative tasks for partners. So they
can focus more on the customer.
Then ﬁnally, I'll just close with the Global Coﬀee Alliance. Now in this Global Coﬀee
Alliance, NestlÃ© brings over 5 million points of presence in 189 countries. And you
think about their expertise in CPG and their alignment around all things coﬀee. I
think -- I view this purely as a growth agenda for shareholders. Now we could say,
here are the alternatives. We have a CPG or channels business in the U.S., Canada.
We could go build one organically in all the other countries we're in. That would take
many, many years and a signiﬁcant investment; or we can do this Global Coﬀee
Alliance with Nestle, which allows us to rapidly accelerate that growth. That growth in
channels in CPG is a brand ampliﬁer for our stores. And we do it with a partner that
we think we have a great alignment and a great opportunity with.
In addition, they are opening up what have yet to have been closed platforms,
Nespresso and Dolce Gusto. If you saw what happened when we introduced K-Cups
on top of the Keurig machine and Starbucks-branded coﬀee on the Keurig platform
quickly became the #1 premium brand and ultimately the #1 brand in share on the
Keurig. The fact that there's estimates that the Nespresso and Dolce Gusto installed
base in households and oﬃces around the world is more than double that of Keurig.
So that, too, is growth.
Then we're going to partner with NestlÃ© around sustainability, making coﬀee the
ﬁrst sustainable agricultural product. And that's the work we do in our Farmer
Support Centers, the agronomy research and the things that we do on the ground
with farmers.
So the NestlÃ© partnership around the Global Coﬀee Alliance is an important one.
We're making good progress on the regulatory front. We expect that to -- that
partnership with that alliance to close this summer. And so that's an important aspect
as well.
Now in these eﬀorts to streamline that I started with, retail market alignment,
business simpliﬁcation and the Global Coﬀee Alliance, I'll remind you, we have freed
up $8 billion of shareholder capital in the last year. We redeployed approximately
$1.3 billion of that capital into East China to then unify Mainland China and set us up
for our growth agenda. And the sum and net of all those actions, accretive in
revenue and earnings per share in ﬁscal '18 and '19.
Now in addition, those streamlined actions are allowing us to now focus our
attention on key value drivers: U.S. and China, Global Coﬀee Alliance and returning
cash and creating value for our shareholders.
And to take you through a bit more on that, I want to introduce and let Scott Maw
take you through some of the numbers. Scott?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19

Thanks, Kevin. Just a few things I want to touch on here. And then we'll wrap up and
go into Q&A. I'm going to touch on a couple of items that Kevin talked about and
give a little bit more ﬁnancial detail behind some of the points he made. Then I'll talk
a little bit about a couple of updates to our guidance.
So the ﬁrst thing I want to build on is the points that Kevin made about our store
portfolio and just give a little more texture around the changes that we're proposing,
both a little bit in 2018. But importantly, as we move into 2019. So what this chart
shows is it shows our portfolio growth rates split between company-owned. So
percentage of new stores for company-owned and percentage of new stores for
licensed stores.
And what's important to understand here, in our company-owned store base, which
obviously drives the majority of our proﬁt and comp and revenue growth in the U.S.,
that's been pretty steady at about 4% growth of net stores, a little bit of increase. But
it's rounded to 4% for years. All of the growth that we've driven on increasing that
percentage from 4% to 6% overall has come in licensed stores. And those have been
opportunities that have been good for us to execute on, in conjunction with our
partners, getting that real estate that we wouldn't normally have access to and have
been accretive. But that's where the portfolio growth is coming from, licensed stores.
And so as comp growth has slowed a bit, particularly transaction comp growth,
we've continued to ﬁne-tune the work we do on sales transfer. I stood in this building
a few months ago and gave you some more speciﬁcs on that. And in company-
owned, we're still really comfortable that the net of that sales transfer and new
customers acquired via store growth is very positive. And you can go back to the
February presentation and take a look at that. Those numbers and that approach still
holds.
But what we're thinking and what we're seeing in the licensed stores are 2 things.
Number one, it's harder for us to measure that sales transfer in licensed stores. We
can approximate it and we have models that estimate what that will be. But because
we don't own all the data, it's not always as easy to nail it.
Also, given the growth that we have in-licensed stores and the relative impact, as
Kevin mentioned, the cost, if you will, of sales transfers for company-owned, the
licensed is many times the cost of company-owned to company-owned. We think it's
wise to step back, take a look at that growth rate and just prune back the level of
gross new stores that we're going to open. So that's where it comes, down about 100
in licensed stores.
We'll probably pull back a little bit on company-owned. But not very much and then
take a look at closing about 100 incremental company-owned stores above the run
rate we've been on. So 150 in total, those are the numbers that Kevin has talked
about. And all of that is on the company-owned side, accretive to overall proﬁtability.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 14 of 21So that means a lower net new store growth rate next year of about 3%. That
probably normalizes a bit when we go into 2020 and beyond, maybe 4% or 5%.
We'll revisit that as we go through. But I think the key thing is as we continue to ﬁne-
tune our analytics, a little bit slower store growth. And it's really concentrated in-
licensed.
The other thing I want to talk a little bit about is owned versus licensing in a few of
these company-owned markets. So Kevin has already talked about how in markets
where we can get our hurdle return, we prefer to own. And this chart shows why. In
markets where we can't get our hurdle return, we prefer to license and work with a
licensed partner. And there are both qualitative and quantitative reasons. Again, this
is a select, call it handful of large markets where owning our stores make sense.
What this does is a very simple example that says if we have a company-owned store
with an AUV of $1 million and we have a licensed store in that same market at $1
million. You can see the revenue given the licensing model and the overall cash
proﬁt in dollars given licensing. Still great returns in both examples. However, you
can see the cash proﬁt in those company-owned stores is 4x the licensed store
model.
And so what we've always said, when you do the economics, it's really tough to give
up all that cash ﬂow in the company-owned model and share it with licensees when
you can get your return.
And the reason we see that is our business model. Our business model has a lower
build cost because unlike a lot of people that we get compared to, we don't have
kitchens. It has higher margins because unlike a lot of people we don't -- we get
compared to, we have a high beverage mix versus a high food mix, again, overall
higher gross margins. And all of that drives signiﬁcantly higher proﬁts. So that's why
we're disciplined where we own. But when we can own, we think the quantitative
proof is to own those stores.
The other side is the qualitative side. And Kevin talked about this. You have to
remember that the most important aspect of our model is our partners in the stores.
And we have to invest in those partners. We have to make sure we can attract and
retain those partners.
We have the best turnover rates, the highest retention rates in the entire industry.
And that's because we take it very seriously because they deliver a premium
experience, a premium product, yes. But a premium experience. And the #1 driver of
our success is that premium experience to our customers.
And so that is something we need to invest in. That is much easier done in these
larger markets in a handful if we own those stores and can make the investments that
we need to in wages, beneﬁts, et cetera.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 15 of 21The other thing is we're much more nimble. So Kevin uses the word agility. We're
much more agile with new product introductions, store design changes. Can you
imagine how hard it would have been to do the antibias training in about 4 to 6
weeks if we were trying to work through a franchise set of stores? It wouldn't have
been possible. So the ability to move and pivot pricing methodology is much more
consistent and much more, in my opinion, rational and sort of easier to analyze when
you own all the stores.
So those are the qualitative reasons to go with the quantitative reasons. But I just
wanted to make sure you understand that overall cash proﬁt view.
The other thing we're committing to today is to go deeper on G&A. So G&A has
been growing as a percentage of system sales. We've been managing the core G&A,
I think, pretty rigorously over the last couple of years. But to be honest, at 4.5% of
system sales, our G&A is higher than where we want it to be from a benchmark
standpoint.
So if you benchmark us versus the industry and you adjust a little bit for ownership
structure, we think we're about 1 point higher than where we'd like to be. And it
might be a little bit less than that, it might be a little bit more than that. But we're
committed to going after that as we move towards the end of 2018 and into next
year.
We're going to engage one of the large consulting ﬁrms to come in, help drive
speed, bring outside-in views, best practices, tools, techniques, benchmarks, all the
things that they can bring. But also to help us move quickly. This is something we
really want to analyze and start executing on perhaps as early as Q4, Q1. So Q4 of
this ﬁscal or Q1 of next ﬁscal to start driving some savings.
So we'll come back in Q3 earnings call here in a few weeks. And we'll go much
deeper on the how much, the whats and the whens around that. But that's a
commitment we're making today. The opportunity is there.
Then Kevin alluded to additional shareholder returns. So what this chart shows is you
go back to 2014, we had about $1.6 billion of total cash returned to shareholders
between dividends and buybacks. We'll be many multiples of that this year and next
year. We started the year with a commitment to add $15 billion to -- or to do $15
billion of total buybacks and dividends between now and the end of 2020. We took
that up oﬀ the back of the NestlÃ© deal and the cash that we're receiving oﬀ that to
$20 billion. And today, we're taking it up another $5 billion to $25 billion. So $15
billion to $25 billion over the course of the year. And I want to -- I'll talk a little bit
about how we're getting there. But that's a commitment between now and the end
of 2020. Just for modeling purposes, most of that incremental $5 billion, as you can
imagine, will happen in 2020 because 2019 is pretty full up with the NestlÃ© work
that we need to do with the cash there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 16 of 21We'll increase our quarterly dividend actually starting this quarter, which is a quarter
in advance, by 20% to $0.36 a quarter. And that dividend will run for 5 quarters and
then will be right back on our normal annual cycle. But just given the overall payout
ratio, given tax reform, we thought it was wise to go ahead and address and take up
the payout ratio a bit this quarter and give you clarity on where we think the
dividend is going to be for the next 5 quarters.
And the other thing that I think is getting lost a little bit in the translation between
mainly me and you is what's happening to our leverage ratio. And so it's really
important for us as a company-owned and licensed model that the leverage ratio
includes capitalized leases and includes the impact of rent. So this is the leverage
ratio, which is adjusted debt. So debt plus capitalized leases. And then the multiple
is based upon EBITDAR.
So what we see from several years ago, right around that 1.6 level. We're adding
about 1 turn by the end of this year, call it 2.6 to 2.9 between this year and next year.
We'll be issuing additional debt. That's the source of the additional buybacks. What's
important to call out in this is to make sure you guys see what's coming from the
leverage ratio. It is going up. It will go up. Then importantly, we've made a
commitment, the board, to the rating agencies that the leverage ratio will remain
below 3x in all of this. So less than 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. And we're
committed to a ﬂoor on ratings of BBB+ for S&P and Baa1 for Moody's.
So that's the debt proﬁle. We feel really comfortable with that 3x. We want to stay
below it. We think that gives us plenty of leverage, plenty of ways to increase cash
return to shareholders. But importantly, the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility we need in the
commercial paper market, in the international debt markets, we like that rating.
Okay. So what's this mean for guidance for this year? And we'll come back to in 2019
as we get towards full year guidance for '19. The headwinds that Kevin talked about
that we were calling a 1% comp globally are primarily around the blended category
and afternoons. This is a consistent message. This is our biggest quarter for
Frappuccino. And it was softer than we expected. We expected a softer Frappuccino
quarter given Happy Hour approach, given what happened last year with Unicorn.
We had all that forecast. It was softer than we expected. And the primary category
was Frappuccino and the primary daypart was afternoon. Morning peak is still
comping positive.
In the May 29 antibias training, that's in that comp estimate. That's impacting it. We
closed our stores. And it had an impact. I would also call out from an earnings
standpoint, we had about $0.03 of investment in the antibias training. That's oﬀset
by about $0.01 of favorability from stock-based compensation adjustments. So you
add those 2 together and all of this forecast has $0.02 of headwinds for those items.
Then China. So Kevin mentioned China. I just want to call out China comps. We're
calling it ﬂat to slightly negative this quarter. And it's due to some of the things that
Kevin talked about and the opportunity we see in digital and the opportunity we seeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 17 of 21Q - Brian John Bittner
A - Scott Harlan Maw
Q - Brian John Bittnerin delivery. I would just really emphasize that unlike the U.S., almost all of China's
revenue growth comes from new stores. So it's not that comp growth isn't important,
we're not saying when -- about ﬂat comps in China. I don't want to send that
message. But a huge portion of the economics in China, the proﬁtability and
revenue is coming from new stores.
And just to give you an indication of that, we'll grow transaction comps, total
transaction comps, new -- sorry, transactions, both comp stores and new stores, we'll
grow that in China mid-teens this year. So that tells you almost all of that is coming
from new stores. And even this quarter, where transactions will be ﬂat to negative,
we'll see well over 10% transaction growth across the entire store base if you include
new stores. So it's about share, it's about taking advantage of the growth in China
and it's about making sure that we have stores in the right places and we're serving
customers in the right way.
So when you add all that up for guidance, what we see is our previous guidance on a
GAAP basis, $3.32 to $3.36. We now see that $3.23 to $3.26. And non-GAAP, $2.48 to
$2.53 the last time; and this time, it will be $2.39 to $2.43 for the year. Again,
remember, all those numbers have about $0.02 of those headwinds that are really
somewhat unique to this quarter.
So with that, I'll wrap. And we can move to Q&A.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
All right. So what we're going to do is we're going to do about 10 minutes of Q&A.
And again, Starbucks is hosting a conference call at 6 p.m. tonight as well. And so
we're just going to do a short Q&A. And I'm going to kick things oﬀ. And then raise
your hand. We have 3 microphones. And so just raise your hand and wait until we
give you a microphone. As it relates to the guidance for 2018, about $0.10 reduction.
Is there any way you can tell us how much of that is in the Third Quarter versus kind
of the Fourth Quarter? Or help us understand...
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Without giving speciﬁc quarterly guidance, let me give you some shape, right,
because I really want to stick to annual guidance. What I would tell you is we expect
some improvement in EPS, higher EPS in Q4. And that's because of some of what
Kevin talked about. We expect some improvement in comps, lower than what we
had originally forecast. But improvement in comps. Then we still have good
momentum. And I'm sort of putting it -- Roz here in the middle of the P&L across
waste, labor and COGS. And that, as we've said, accelerates through the year and
that continues in the Fourth Quarter. So I expect the Fourth Quarter to have higher
EPS than the Third Quarter but not quantify that speciﬁcally.

Q - Brian John Bittner
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Kevin R. JohnsonOkay. And just as it relates to sales growth in the United States, I think accelerating
the power and momentum of your Digital Flywheel is the biggest growth
opportunity. And in the Second Quarter, you implemented new ways to attract
digital customers beyond your Rewards program. And I think what you showed us in
the presentation today is that's working. And so I guess, the question is despite that
working, the sales trends have been falling a little short. So where are you seeing the
pockets of weakness? I think you called out a couple of things. But that's question
one. Then two is, as far as getting these digital customers, does it take a little bit to
convert them into higher-comping customers once you acquire them?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes. First of all, the 5 million incremental digital registrations that we acquired, we
just acquired those in the last 90 days. And we have not applied the personalization
engine to those customers. We are now in the process of now connecting tokenized
transactions to those customers. So the personalization engine could be used. So we
have not enabled personalization. The thing that we -- that is driving is this
reimagined Happy Hour. And we're seeing better-than-forecasted results from that
Happy Hour. So we've acquired those customers. The one place that we have been
marketing to them and communicating to them is around reimagined Happy Hour.
That is overperforming expectations. But we have not lit up the communications to
now start marketing with the personalization engine to them. So I view this as just
untapped opportunity. And the fact that we're seeing good response to the
reimagined Happy Hour and the fact that we can continue to grow that base of
digitally registered customers, I ﬁnd, is a very good positive thing.
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
Audience? Right over there. Someone hand (Neil) a microphone.
Quick question. So I mean, clearly, it's a very strong economic environment right
now. I mean, it seems like most restaurants are doing pretty well, whether it's
NATTrack data or CREST data. So if you're growing the Rewards program high single
digits, double digits, whatever it may be, clearly, there's an oﬀset there. So help me
understand if someone's leaving the system, why are they leaving? And where are
they going for coﬀee? Because coﬀee as a category seems to be growing mid-single
digit still.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes. I'd say that our core beverage platforms continue to grow, coﬀee and espresso.
The place that we've got negative is the occasional customer in the afternoon on
blended Frappuccino. That said, with the May 29 training, we delayed the launch of
our spring and summer marketing campaign that was supposed to launch in mid-
April when this whole event unfolded. We delayed that by 2 weeks. And we lost
momentum. Not an excuse. But that's -- if you look at the data-driven drivers of that,
that's the impact. And as I mentioned, too, post-May 29, we're now comping 3 in the
U.S., trending towards the 3 for the month. But that is not, in my view, not an
acceptable performance. And we need to do better.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-19

Anybody else in the audience?
Just taking that one step further, just as it relates to comps, if you hold the 3, if, is
there anything about the Fourth Quarter -- I mean, it sounds like when we started the
year and if you thought the Fourth Quarter would have been a 3 comp, I think,
initially, there was a certain earnings expectation attached to that. If you end up
doing a 3, would the Fourth Quarter from an earnings perspective be the same as
what you imagined 3 or six months ago or whenever the last time we kind of thought
about the year?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think the only thing I would say, yes. But we've got to make sure we get transaction
comp growth. So one of the things we talked about in the most recent quarter is the
3 needs to have 1 point of transaction comp growth because that matters for
leverage and operating income. And so if that 3 comes with transaction comp
growth and we can deliver on the savings, I would say we'd be within the range of
our initial guidance.
And sorry, anything about the 3 -- I'm all shouting -- anything that you see now, is it
consistent with 1% for positive transactions?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Transactions have been harder to come by. So it's mostly ticket, which, by the way, is
consistent with what's happened year-to-date. So to Kevin's point, we hold onto that
3. We get a little transaction with that. And we'll be right back in line with what we
were talking about with our guidance -- with our long-term guidance and all the
things that are inherent in your question.

What I would say is the analytics that we have around elasticity modeling have been
and continue to be very accurate. So we can check store by store, product by
product within products and also people exiting the system because of price
increases. And there's been no change in that elasticity for the 4, ﬁve years that I've
been CFO. They continue to have -- that's why that low level of consistent, careful
pricing market by market, product by product has driven 1 to 2 points of price
because we're really careful at how we do it. And Roz has actually brought additional
discipline there. If we see places we can lean in, we will. But if we see that
cannibalization or elasticity spike a bit, we'll pull back. And that has stayed pretty
consistent over the last few years.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes. I think we don't do across-the-board price increases. So it's very targeted and
even down to micro-trading area pricing and then we have the analytics that the
team -- the pricing team uses both predictive analytics. But then after they make a
change, they track. And our core beverage platforms have been doing well. I think
the one decliner is in our blended Frappuccino. And I think that has to do with the
health and wellness trend.
