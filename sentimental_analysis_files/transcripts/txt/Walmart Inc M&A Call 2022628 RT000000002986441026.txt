Page 2 of 25C. Douglas McMillonGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Tony Waller, I am Vice President,
Constituent Relations and Racial Equity at Walmart. And it really is a pleasure to be
with you this afternoon. I do not know what these crazy people were thinking, but
they're asking me to do this. But hey, if that's what they want, that's what they're
going to get here. And I hope that you all come along with the ride with me and put
up with me as best you can. Sounds good? Thank you.
To all my Walmart family, I'm so happy you're here. Man, it's been a long time that I
have been able to see so many of you all that I normally get to see only on zoom and
I get to actually see you in person, it feels good. And so, thank you. I am just so
grateful that you're here with us. And to all of the vendors, suppliers, entrepreneurs
who are in the room, oh my goodness, you are going to go on. Do you all
understand that?
This is our 9th open call, 9th. And at this particular open call, if you are in this room,
you all did good. I mean, you all worked hard because there were over 13,000
suppliers, vendors, entrepreneurs, who put their names in the basket to be looked at
and selected, 13,000. That ain't no joke you all. And of the 13,000, what -- we got
what, like 1,100 -- little over 1,100 people here, 1,100 of the 13,000 up in this room.
That's less than 10% you all, and I'm not being good at math, okay? But I even know
that. That's less than 10%. You all are on it, special, great.
And when I think of the diversity of the supplier group that's here, it is amazing -
veterans, people with disabilities, African-American, Latino, Asian, Indian, (Inaudible),
I mean it's all here. You know that's hot. That is hot and I'm proud of the fact that we
have been very intentional about making sure that the diversity of the suppliers that
we're looking at, is as various it possibly can be. Looks like we're never satisﬁed with
this thing, we are never satisﬁed, right. We've done great in the past, we'll do great
this year, we can do better the next year before, the next year after.
So, we in for some good times. So you'll ready, you'll ready for this ride? I know I am,
that I don't care I'm working. You bet, that's my handle right there. You'll don't know
what I have to pay, if I don't do this thing right, when I get oﬀ the stage. Okay. Look
at that, look, he tried to cut me oﬀ already. No, I'm just playing. But Mark, you've
done a wonderful job in helping to put this thing together. I love you for it. I love
you. I love you. I love you. Own your greatness, baby.
So let's get this thing on the road, right? I'm very happy about the program that we
have for you today at this Executive Session. We got some great speakers here, few
executives. We might even have a little celebrity or two, you don't know. I ain't say
nothing. But we're waiting to see what happens, right? But I'm going to bring to you
all, the star, you'll ready? I don't know if you'll can handle it. I can't handle it. But we
have with us today, none other than the President and CEO of Walmart. The one, the
only Douglas McMillon. I'm hugging and then I'm bowing.

{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Welcome to the Tony Waller Show. I'm going to try to go fast to make up the time,
because we're already over scheduled for this session. If you're his handler, Mark,
dude, good luck. I love you, Tony. I really do.
How is everybody? Congratulations, making it here as Tony said. It was a big group
of people that wanted to be here and you all made it. This is one of my favorite days
of the year. It does feel little like the American dream is coming true, kind of like the
Shark Tank meets Bentonville, Arkansas. Welcome. There's nothing more fun than
being in a meeting with one of you and asking the question, how many can you
make? Like we'll take them. And I hope that happens to a lot of you while you're
here.
I'm going to share just a little bit about the company and I'll start out by talking
about our purpose. Walmart was blessed to be founded by Sam Walton, who
created a purpose for this company that is timeless and we get up every day, trying
to fulﬁll that purpose. How can we help people save money and live a better life?
Give them access to high-quality products and services that they otherwise wouldn't
be able to aﬀord and help make their lives better for their families.
We have a set of values that we use to try and shape our culture and behaviorally
carry out every day, whether it's in a store or a Sam's Club, a distribution center or in
one of our oﬃces, we are constantly trying to behave in a way that's consistent with
those four values that you see on the screen.
In terms of where we're going, we want to be the best retailer, the ﬁrst best place
where people come to shop, but we also have aspirations to help improve their lives
as it relates to healthcare and ﬁnancial services. Help families reduce the cost of
money, save for the future. And we also want to invest in communities and make
decisions that are good for the planet. So as Tony mentioned, we care about having
a diverse supplier base, we care about having suppliers that think about the same
things we do and take action to strengthen communities and to strengthen the
planet as we do it.
We've learned as a company that it's possible to do all those things at one time. You
don't have to just focus on cost or just focus on other things, you can work together
and think systemically and make a lot of good things happen for the communities
that we serve in planet. And we believe in having multiple stakeholders, the ones
that were mentioned on the screen.
I'm going to take just a minute and talk about Saskia Foley. And I think Saskia is
participating via Zoom today. She's got a family-owned company called Radius, inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 25John FurnerKutztown, Pennsylvania. And she and her family make a kid's toothbrush that's made
out of 70% recycled content. And she was here last year at this meeting. Her
company also makes products with 60% of the materials from the U.S., on low
energy machines with 75% CO2 reductions.
This was the ﬁrst recycled product that we had in the kids oral care category. We're
working on an adult skew. She was sitting in one of those seats, I guess last year on
with the pandemic, it may have been on Zoom. And she was one of the folks that got
a yes. And so she's a great example of success. We want to congratulate her, if you
want to.
When we think about sourcing, we want to buy locally. We want to buy near
communities where we serve customers, that's true here in the U.S., that's true
around the world. We want to do that because we want to help create high-paying
jobs. We want your help to create value for customers to help us ﬁght inﬂation.
Inﬂation is way too high right now and people are struggling and suﬀering as a result
and we want your partnership to help get those prices down. We're in communities
we're within 90% of America within 10 miles. So we're part of the community with
our associates, our associates volunteer hours, we give money locally. We want to
have a complete cycle there that enables communities to get stronger as I
mentioned before.
Our big goal is to have $350 billion of investment, made with items that are grown
here, produced here or assembled here in the U.S. And along with that, would come
an additional 750,000 jobs by 2031 here in this country. We can't do that without
you. So, thank you for playing the role that you play. And now we'd like to take a look
at how our investment in American jobs actually comes to life. Thank you all, and
please check out this video.

{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Welcome to open call, 2022. It was special to watch that video and to see those
stories of people who were once sitting in your seats whose lives were changed with
a Walmart order. As grateful as they are for the opportunity, we are even more
grateful.
There's nothing we love more than empowering an American entrepreneur or
business. And this is a passion of mine. In fact, when I'm visiting our Walmart stores, I
also try to visit a Walmart supplier. When I was in Anderson, South Carolina last year,
I visited the TTI factory where some of our lawn mowers were assembled. When I
was in Minneapolis, I visited Nordic Ware. Nordic Ware connected with Walmart
1986, responding to a call from Sam Walton, who was looking to boost American
manufacturing. Walmart soon began selling their Bundt pans.
When I was in Dallas earlier this year, I went to the Ole Mexican Foods Factory that
produces La Banderita Tortillas and I talked to Veronica Moreno, and her son Edgar.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 25Kathryn McLayVeronica told me about how she made Tortillas in her Georgia home using her
family's recipe, then successfully pitched them into Walmart. When I was in those
factories, it was striking to watch people working and to think that their jobs are
often made possible because of Walmart. To think even one new item for Walmart
could lead to dozens, hundreds or thousands of jobs in the U.S. community. We take
this very seriously. It's why we hold this event. We want to see new products that are
made, grown or assembled in the U.S. and we want to add some of them to our
assortment.
If you want to know how serious we are, think of those numbers you saw in that
timeline, $250 billion and $350 billion. Back in 2013, Walmart pledged to spend
$250 billion over 10 years on products made, grown or assembled in the U.S. And
today, we've met that commitment. We made it by partnering with so many amazing
entrepreneurs and businesses, many of whom were once in your seats, and we're
celebrating that milestone today, but at Walmart we never just celebrate. We keep
going, so we're already focused on that $350 billion number.
By 2031, we plan to spend an additional $350 billion on products made, grown or
assembled in the U.S. That investment will support the creation of an estimated
750,000 new U.S. jobs. Now those are big numbers, even for Walmart. And we need
you to get us there. And that's why you're here. So thanks again for coming. The
team is so excited to see your products. Have a great time and good luck.
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Good afternoon. Thanks for being part of open call. I love this meeting because
there's just -- there's so much potential of what could happen. This could be your
time. When I think at Sam Walton's time, when his time arrived, and he opened that
ﬁrst Walmart store in 1962, the unemployment rate was rising, the stock market was
reeling, and the economy felt pretty shaky.
It might not have seemed like the perfect time to make a dream come true. But our
founder understood that the right idea combined with opportunity could lead to big
things. And I think dreams need perfect timing. Sometimes they just need a chance,
and I think that's what Open Call is all about. It's about ﬁnding -- having a chance.
So like Sam Walton, you wouldn't be here in this room today, if you didn't have a
vision or a product that you really believe in, and we wouldn't be in here, if we didn't
have customers or members, who are looking for unique products like yours that are
made, grown or assembled here in the United States.
More than 85% of Walmart customers say that carrying products made, grown or
assembled in the U.S. is important to them. And it's important to our Sam's Club
members too. They understand that purchasing these products support American
jobs and American dreams.
Here's another powerful number, more than two-thirds of the item we sell in our
clubs are made, grown or assembled in the U.S. And as John noted, by selling theseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 25Tony Wallerproducts, we're supporting or helping create thousands of jobs in communities all
across the country. That helps U.S. manufacturing grow and it's good for our
business too. We have shorter supply chains, quicker lead times that helps our clubs
keep the items on the ﬂoor, in the club.
Sam's Club sells thousands of products that are made in the U.S. One of my favorites
is the Key Lime Pie. The pies are made from natural ingredients, including fresh-
squeezed limes and supplied by Kenny's Great Pies' of Smyrna, Georgia. They
arrived in the club, ready to go, and we top them with members --Sam's vanilla
whipped ice cream and our members absolutely love them. And we have sold more
than a half a million of those Key Lime Pies already. I think that's the taste of the size
of the opportunity and that's just at Sam's. So, all you have to do is blow us away with
your amazing product.
Congratulations for making it this far. Hopefully, this is your time. Good luck.
{BIO 19374461 <GO>}
Did I do that right? Oh, I'm up. I got a little nervous here, you know, I thought my
microphone might be cut oﬀ, but can you hear me? Yes. Kat, that was awesome.
Thank you so much. Did you all know this is one of like my favorite days of the year,
like I love this day. Ain't nobody saying like why Tony do you love this day?
Because we get to be with you all - the entrepreneurs, the ones who've got like
amazing ideas and products that we're going to get a chance to take a look at, this is
your day. Isn't that awesome to think that you all have an opportunity. Kat said that so
well. This you had vision and now there's an opportunity and you're combining it,
and this could be your shot.
And so I'm loving that. I cannot wait to see what ends up coming out -- and you
know what ends up coming out of this. I'm hoping that that you've enjoyed
everybody so far, and that you really had a good time.
For real, for real, this whole notion of entrepreneurship and U.S. manufacturing is
incredibly important to us, because it has the kind of like this rollover eﬀect, right?
It's not just about your product, but it's about the fact that your product or your idea
has the opportunity to create jobs. And Henry, you all talk about that all the time,
right? How not only is it transforming your dream, but it's transforming the dreams of
others. New jobs are being created, right. And not just new jobs are being created,
people's lives are changing.
Folks who did not believe they had an opportunity, now have an opportunity to
change their lives. One life at a time. One community at a time. That's the kind of
impact you all, that you all are making. You're not just changing the world, you're
changing the axis on which the world turns. That's how bad you'll are. Don't ever,
don't ever, don't ever, don't ever discount that. Whatever happens today or doesn't
happen today, the deal is that your dream, your vision, literally can change the way
this world operates and I want you to always think that way. Can we do that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28

Andrea AlbrightNow, Marcus asked me again to get oﬀ stage, so I'm going to do that. But before I
do, I would like to bring up to somebody's -- bring up somebody who is just
awesome, awesome, awesome. Please join me in welcoming Andrea Albright,
Executive Vice President for Global Sourcing to the stage.
Awesome, awesome, awesome. Do we have some entrepreneurs in the house. Yeah.
You're excited to be here? Yes. You really going to sell some stuﬀ? Yes, I'm excited
for you.
My name is Andrea Albright. I have responsibility for Global Sourcing and I'm so
excited to have you here today. As Doug mentioned, we have an ambitious goal,
$350 billion and sourcing from Made in American products. That's a huge objective
and we know that doesn't happen overnight. It's kind of hard to make products in
the U.S. There's a lot of things, a lot of challenges, whether its supply chain, whether
its manufacturing, and we know we have an opportunity to kind of, to continue to
ﬁgure out how to solve those challenges.
In true Walmart fashion, we know we can help. It's not just up to our entrepreneurs
and our suppliers to do it on their own. So as part of that initiative, we've created a
program called American Lighthouses and what that means is that we're putting
together industry representatives, we're putting together manufacturing, supply
chain and a lot of academia to ﬁgure out how we want to solve these problems and
do it in a new and a diﬀerent way with the support of Walmart, powered by Walmart,
you could say.
And so, we're excited to talk a little bit about that opportunity. And one of the ﬁrst
lighthouses that we went after was in the textile industry. We knew that there's an
opportunity in apparel and soft home and really trying to ﬁgure out some of the
cotton and fabric and ﬁber Made in America. So I'm really excited to bring up two
people to talk to me, and talk to you a little bit more about this initiative.
So I'd love to introduce Classic Apparels. We have with us today, Sanal Kumar, who is
the Chairman of Classic Apparel. They were one of our ﬁrst partners in Made in
America, in the Lighthouses project to really help us rally behind the opportunity in
textiles. And then Deanah Baker, our SVP of Apparel, to help us kind of talk through
this project with Classic. So join me on the stage, please. Hi, guys.

Questions And Answers
{BIO 19374461 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
You're the guest of honor. You can start right here in the middle. Yes, no, take your
seat. So Sanal, we're going to start with a question for you. You've been
manufacturing for Walmart since 2002, you're in a lot of diﬀerent countries. Nine
countries I believe, primarily Jordan, Bangladesh, you've been a long-term partner
for us. What changed for you? Can you tell us why you decided to come into the U.S.
and why today?
Thanks, Andrea for the question. Before I answer your question, I should thank
Walmart to getting me here today, It's a huge honor for me to sit and face all this
audience, and it's a huge honor, that's what I can tell you.
And to talk about what made me to think about U.S., I should say that in the last two
decades, I'm into this business and initially we started in Jordan, then we got into
Bangladesh and India, and we have 30,000 people working in Jordan. And in this
30,000 people, the beauty is I started with just 300 people in 2003 and I could grow
to 30,000 people today. And on this 30,000 people, 6,000 people are Jordanians
and these 6,000 Jordanians were trained, engaged and all these people are in the
rural areas of Jordan. I am pretty sure that if we could not have created this job for
them, there is no way they could have ﬁnd a job in those rural areas. People who
knows Jordan, do understand what I am saying.
So the same spirit is what got me into U.S. I know that U.S. was once upon a time
manufacturing garments. I'm talking about 1970s. And now since the business was
not there for a long while, the expertise is missing, the engagement is missing, but
I'm sure that if we start, I mean initially, we are starting with 100 jobs. And we are
planning to have at least 300 jobs in next two years. So that's the plan. And once we
start this, there are a lot of challenges we understand, but I am sure that with the
support of a great, great company like Walmart, we will deﬁnitely thrive through and
we are absolutely conﬁdent of.
Yeah. Deanah, what's your thoughts? I mean, this isn't an easy thing to do. Talk a little
bit about your thoughts on Classic and how you engaged in that way?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 25A - Deanah Baker
A - Andrea Albright
A - Sanal Kumar
A - Andrea AlbrightWell, if it were easy, someone would have already done it, right? But you just heard
someone who likes to tackle and does a wonderful job doing very diﬃcult things. So
what I appreciate most about Sanal and his team is that they are true visionaries, but
coupled with execution, they have great executional abilities. And so when this came
up as the challenge and we're going to do it, it made perfect sense that with the
partnership of Classic that we could ﬁgure out a place to start. And so it was pretty
easy, yes, on my part.
Yeah. Great. Sanal, what, what barriers did you encounter? What did you have to
solve for as you started to build manufacturing in the U.S.?
Yes. The major challenges of the workforce, the scalability, the expertise, and the raw
materials. So if you talk about, there are a lot of challenges. But at the same time,
these challenges were there when I started in 2003 in Jordan too. So, as long as you
hold on, give your 100%, and keep working on toward, we are very sure that down
the line we can make it happen. May not happen the year one, but we are absolutely
sure that with continuous perseverance, we should be able to reach there.
And in addition to that, Walmart U.S. Lighthouse, along with the state's commitment,
I'm sure that a lot of incentives can possibly ﬂow in to see that we can create these
jobs and then we can hold on. And initially, we are starting from connects [ph] you to
consumer. But we have an ambitious plan to have, possibly from the yarn forward to
consumer down the line, and that is what we are looking for. We are not just making
300 jobs and going to stay there.
And for you to know, 2016 we started our design house in the U.S. When the call was
made by Walmart in November 2015, when they visited me in Jordan, they saw -- I
mean Deanah was there in the trip. When they saw our operation, they said what is
lacking for Classic is a design ability in U.S.
In three months, from November to February 2016, we started and we started in a
basement with just two designers. Today, we have total 27 people working in our U.S.
oﬃce and this people, 12 of them are designers and the balance of them are in the
supply chain management, and now with this factory coming in, we are sure that we
are completing the cycle of concept to consumer. And we are absolutely sure that
we are just starting and this is only just the start, and we are absolutely conﬁdent of
growing, may not be the size of Jordan, but deﬁnitely we have ambitious plan to
grow.
Yeah, that's great, thank you for that. And Deanah, it's not just on our supplier
partners, right, there's considerations that Walmart has to make. Can you walk me
through some of those considerations you had as you embarked on this program?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28

A - Deanah BakerWell, speciﬁcally with Classic because to your point earlier, we've invited lots of our
suppliers and academia to help us ﬁgure this out. But speciﬁcally on this initiative
with Classic, you talk about 20 years with Walmart almost, I've known you for 10 of it,
right? So there's a lot of trust and relationship that's been created over the last
decade, and the track record if you just stop for a moment. You know we've talked
about our commitments to each other, they've invested for Walmart.
There's new factories at -- it's called Walmart City, it's for Jordan in Jordan, for
Walmart product. It's near a port, so we can cut down lead times. Putting your money
where your mouth is and you did that. It's the design oﬃce. In 2016, that we had the
conversation that this would really help us forward the business done even local help
for our teams here in Bentonville. And let's just not forget that it's been -- Classic has
been our supplier of the year for apparel, several times in the last 10 years. So, I have
all the conﬁdence in the world that we're going to start here and it's going to go
places.
Thank you. Awesome. Congratulations on Supplier of the Year, that's a big deal. So
now you've got a lot of entrepreneurs in the room who are maybe manufacturing in
the U.S. or excited about the opportunity here. What advice do you have for them as
they start the journey as an entrepreneur yourself?
First of all they should be very conﬁdent about what they're doing and they should
come with a value proposition and they should know what the consumer is looking
for, and they should believe in their product, and that is what they should do. And
they should continuously perceive.
I mean, they are all here for a pitch tomorrow. Some may work, some may not work,
but they shouldn't give up. They should continuously pursue so that they can
deﬁnitely reach there. That is what my experience, my life experience taught me. And
as I said, I started in a very, very small way. And when we talk about two decades of
my business, prior to that, I was working for people for 12 years in the same line. So it
was a -- it was a journey. I mean, you should also pursue the same thing. That's what I
can advise you. Thank you.
Deanah, anything to add?
I would just take the moment to say all of you in the room, like as a merchant, we live
to ﬁnd quality and value items that our customers want, that will exceed their
expectations. So go into your meetings with gusto and tell your story. Bring it to life.

opportunities that exist for you and your businesses and how this day can be a part
of your success story.
{BIO 21582983 <GO>}
It really is a big day, not just for you, but for all of us. Sam's Club has a long history of
helping small businesses. In fact, helping entrepreneurs, just like himself was exactly
why Mr.Sam opened the ﬁrst Sam's Club in 1983. Since that time, we have grown to
oﬀer products and services, not just for entrepreneurs and small businesses, but also
for families.
But no matter what our member looks like, they love great items, items that are high
quality and oﬀer a fantastic value, items that are innovative, distinct and churn right,
and most importantly, items that are made, grown or assembled here in the U.S. And
as you know, we have a lot of great items that are made in the US. One of my
favorites is our Danishes. And let me tell you, they are not just a hit in my home, but
with our members too.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28

what they do. They create authentic European-style breads and pastries, utilizing
traditional baking processes, high-quality ingredients, and state-of-the-art
equipment. And when the pandemic hit, they expanded their facility and product
lines to keep up with our demand. Their business with Sam's Club has been
increased by 200% and because of that growth with us, they were able to bring 150
jobs to their community of Swedesboro, New Jersey. We love hearing stories about
this. Stories that showcase the importance of oﬀering our members high-quality
items that are made, grown or assembled right here in the U.S. Charles, I'm sure
Walmart customers value the same.
{BIO 19453530 <GO>}
Yeah, Megan absolutely. Every day at Walmart, we are focused on serving our
customers and their needs. More than 85% of our customers tell us it's important for
us to carry those products made, grown or assembled in the U.S. as you said Megan.
We also know how much our customers love new and innovative items in our stores,
but also online, especially when those items are from companies like yours, and the
towns across America our customers lived in.
And when we sourced domestically, we have shorter lead times and that means
delivery more quickly for our customers. That is more important now than it ever has
been. To sum it up, this day couldn't be more important. Megan, I imagine Sam's
Club members feel the same connection to this impact.
{BIO 21582983 <GO>}
You bet Charles. At Sam's Club, we want our members to love our items. It's why
they choose to shop with us. And as a result, they expect to discover new and fun,
high quality items at a good value every time they shop Sam's Club or
samsclub.com. Items like yours. That is why this is such an exciting time. We are
always seeking out great items to bring to our members. And over the course of just
a few days, we get to see hundreds of them. In fact, this year is the largest event ever
for Sam's Club, with more than 400 meetings set to happen.
{BIO 19453530 <GO>}
That's awesome. 400 meetings set. I got to tell you, I've had the pleasure of meeting
with many potential suppliers over the years during our open call. And one thing is
always clear. You're all great merchants. The products we see, just learning how
they're made and hearing about the American jobs they help support. You should be
so proud of the work you're doing.
Now, I know we're humbled and honored to have the chance to learn about you,
your business and what you can oﬀer our customers and our members. And like
Megan said, I have a favorite item as well. And it's from our last year's Open Call.
Now it has to be with Aunt Fannies. They manufacture non-toxic, cruelty-free,
microbiome friendly, pest control and household cleaning products that use vinegarFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28

{BIO 21582983 <GO>}
Sounds great.
{BIO 19453530 <GO>}
Now, one of their items, is Fruit Fly Trap. It's a non-toxic Fruit Fly Trap. It's safe around
people, food and pets, which is really important. So customers can use it in their
home and their yard, worry free. Now, not only does it keep fruit ﬂies away Megan, it
also helps reduce food spoilage and waste.
Now Aunt Fannies pitched their brand and several items during last year's Open
Call. And their Founder and CEO, Mat Franken was given a yes, the day of Open Call
to get on the shelves of about 2,500 stores as well as online at walmart.com.
So, after spending time with Mat, we started working with him more closely. Our
merchants learned more about the brand's production capabilities and Mat learned
more about how his items ﬁlled a need for Walmart customers. It became very clear
to Walmart just after a few conversations with Aunt Fannies. This was established to
be set up for success and bring their items to even more stores. And so today, there
are nearly 3,200 stores across the country. This is just one of thousands of success
stories that are born from this day today. But we know everyone's success story looks
a little bit diﬀerent and we recognize the importance of supporting each of
businesses individual needs.
{BIO 21582983 <GO>}
I know Sam's Club and Walmart Merchants are so committed to helping all of our
suppliers succeed and that's why today's one of their favorite days too. They love
serving our customers and members, but they can't do it alone. They need you and
your exciting items. So they're excited to see what you have to share.
{BIO 19453530 <GO>}
That's right, Megan. Our merchants are very excited to meet with everyone
tomorrow. They're ready to listen and learn from you, they're ready to understand
how together we can bring customers and members even more products made,
grown or assembled right here in the U.S. And make sure that you use your time
together to ask questions and learn from them. I know we have the strongest
merchants in business, so make sure you take advantage of that.

You look so good in peach.
Thank you so much. It's cobbler. Not to get nitpicky, but --
Did you look that up, because you called it peach in the back.
It was all a setup for this moment, where I got to say cobbler.
We're going to talk about U.S. manufacturing. Why don't you talk to us about how
the manufacturing facility came about in Waco?
Yeah. Well, as you saw, it's very colorful for good reason. Our businesses, I mean Dax
and I at least run the business of storytelling. It's really important that everything
feels eventized, and it feels like an experience and a story. That's why we have all the
games outside and the stuﬀ for the kids. We know that it's important to our
consumer, that things are manufactured here in the U.S. and our job at when we
make products is to listen to the consumer.
So we thought why not bet on ourselves. And it was a big risk that has it turned out
to be, I think the best thing we've done for the company. So far, we're able to reduce
our carbon footprint, and I think the entire facility is renewable energy. We're able to
source and support U.S. raw manufacturers suppliers and logistical eﬃciencies and
just better quality control. So it was a big investment, but it's really been a win-win.
Sustainable, you're part of Project Gigaton, you're doing all of the things.
We're trying.
You are. Thank you. Customers, thank you. And not only are you doing that, you're
impacting the community. And I know community is really important to you. So talk
about how you think about, what is it like in Waco? How do you think about the role
that you play in being part of the community there?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 16 of 25A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Well, the premise of Hello Bello is really simple. We raised our kids in Los Angeles.
There were a bazillion diﬀerent outlets to get bazillion diﬀerent products. We had
access to everything. We had a budget that was disproportionate and probably
unfair. And we're from Michigan, and our family is still there, and we thought it's not
right that we would be in -- having access to this, and being able to aﬀord this and
not my sister-in-law or any family members.
So, the original premise is like everyone should have this, in likewise we're both born
in Detroit, and I think at the peak of (Inaudible) watching manufacturing, leave, leave,
leave, leave, and the devastation of that. That too is incredibly important to us. We
very much want manufacturing to happen here. I think being where we're from, it will
be impossible not to care about that. And we've added 200 jobs thus far to Waco.
And when we're there helping by lifting that tractor up, they seem to like it. I mean,
who knows, we're there. I don't know what's said behind our back, but they do seem
very, very joyful to be in that playhouse.
We got to meet a lot of people who were really excited that it was opening actually
as a diaper facility, because some of the guys that were there were -- ﬁrst of all, that
machine goes so fast.
Stand back.
You can't believe it. I mean, the 2 billion butt cheeks [ph], that's not a joke, there's a
lot of butt cheeks in America, and all over the world. Everybody's got them, right?
Most people, we don't want to exclude anyone without butt, but assuming you are
humans.
Of course, Of course. But there were some guys that worked, it was a diaper
manufacturing facility a way long time ago. And they were super excited that it was
opening again as a diaper facility, because it had just been an empty building for so
long, and they just expressed gratitude in that. I mean, that really does mean the
world, because it's, you can think about a business and you can look at numbers and
spreadsheets, but when you're talking about human interaction, that's the most
important part of it for us, for me, I think.
For you, yeah.
Yeah.
Look, this company is mom's quality and ingredients at dads' prices. So we both
bring something much diﬀerent to the table.
That's true.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28

You make it all very good and healthy.
Yeah, you are very particular about good and healthy.
Yeah.
I'm sure, you care about the budget too?
I do. Yeah. Well, yeah, actually. No, I do. Because the goal of this entire company
when we were going to these little boutiques and buying everything we wanted for
our baby and not looking the receipt and kind of feeling this weird guilt about it,
because we're actors and were drastically overpaid.
You more than me, but yeah.
Correct. Yes, very much so.
Go girl.
The idea behind all of it was, how do we get a great -- a premium product, intersect
with aﬀordability and accessibility.
And that's Q Walmart.
Yeah, that's right. And I remember the ﬁrst time we met, and the most incredible
part, and you told this, but I think people I know. You told the story about your sister,
and about wanting her to be able to have the same things for her kids, that you had
for your kids, and be able to aﬀord it. And you came to us and said, we believe that
you're the people who can make that happen because we're all about accessibility.
Do you want to talk about the beginning?
Yeah. This company doesn't exist without Walmart in any shape or form. There's no,
no way we could possibly have done it. Because the goal was to have such an
aﬀordable price point, that there's no way we could have launched other than at a
place with this enormous power over the economy and the scale, but it went beyond
that. That just was a scalable math proposition. But the team here has developed, I
don't know half of our products have been co-created by the -- under the
stewardship of you, of Marley, of a bunch of people. I mean from our vitamins --

Also hand sanitizer, yeah.
But yes, I mean, it was way more than just hey, can we have access to your stores,
which again was crucial for us to launch at this price point. But the development of
the brand and the diﬀerent products we have would not have existed without this
partnership. It's been really incredible.
The guidance, because when we have questions, you guys answer it. And
sometimes, we don't even know that there's a question ﬂoating around or something
we could do better, but you tell us, it really -- it is felt like a partnership from day one.
We never ever could have been able to do anything to this scale. Not even with
leveraging all the weird talk show stuﬀ we have, like, there's nothing that would ever
be in comparison than working with Walmart, having access, because you guys, you
have the stores everywhere like that story about my sister.
I have two sisters. We talked about things all the time. Oh, did you try this lipstick?
Oh, did you try this diaper? And there were a lot of things I was recommending to
her that, she, A couldn't aﬀord, that just was like $5 higher than what she could
budget that month. And B, she couldn't ﬁnd. She did not have access to it. There
were no stores carrying it, because I was living in an LA, New York bubble. And
Walmart provided answers to all of those questions. The stores are everywhere. The
guidance is amazing. And we keep this on a really strong price point.
Thank you. Thank you. I think the thing that I would say, that's important about what
we've learned from the two of you is knowing what you're trying to achieve, knowing
what you want to achieve, and having the discipline around what you want for your
products to stand for and helping us drive that in a consistent way with our ideas and

I can be sincere about this. And also I will only speak for us, but we had other jobs,
we like the other jobs. We really did not do this, so that we could have a big
business, that sincerely wasn't the goal. And for us to be a part of anything, I've got
to really believe the thing is of importance. I'm not -- we're not looking to ﬁnd like,
oh, that came in a 32-ounce bag, but if we go to 34-ounce bag, everyone will buy.
That's never been the thing. We believe in our story.
Our story is we want everyone to have what we had. We've been spoiled and we
want as many people to be spoiled as possible. And that drives, that little principal
kind of drives all the skews that come out, and everything that follows from it. And it
helps us when we have to make hard decisions. They come endlessly. There's always
something tempting to do. The Waco in manufacturing facility. That's not an easy
commit. I mean, there's way easier and cheaper ways to do it. But I think for us

Can we say it at every dinner party?

Only independently owned diaper manufacturing facility here in the U.S., from

It's been -- it's been such a learning curve for me, because I have the story and the
product in my head.
But ﬁguring out how to make that come to life, requires someone that's much
smarter than me in a diﬀerent ﬁeld. And I have been able to depend on our Walmart
merchants for so much guidance, helpful tips. What do you think we should do? Like,

Wow. How cool is that? That is only at Walmart, right? Hello everybody. My name is
Ben Peterson. I am the gardening and grass seed buyer for Walmart.
I'm Kim Levitsky. I buy sauces and condiments.
Hi, I'm Slade Blair, I'm the merchant for our batters and seasonings business.
We are so excited to have you guys. I mean, this is a magical moment for all of us. As
merchants, we want to have the best products. We want to have the best retailer, and
the only way we can do it is with you guys. And then making it U.S. manufactured
makes it that much better. So I just want to thank you all for being here, and
tomorrow is going to be a really, really fun day.
So to kick into it, Kim, Slade and I have picked out three items that we thought were
pretty cool. We haven't met with you guys yet, but we were able to kind of look over
the pictures and get a little bit of a sneak peek. And we wanted to highlight a couple
of them, just to get us kicked oﬀ. So I think we have a picture of them coming up, so
we'll go ahead and get into them. But as the gardening and grass seed buyer, I --
yeah. Please. Yeah, go ahead. This is great items. Great items. Thank you.
So as the gardening buyer, I'm always looking for what can we take and make the
gardening experience easier for customers. I look across this room and I see 1,100
potential gardeners, but I'm looking at each and every one of you and trying to
ﬁgure out what's keeping you from starting your own little garden. So my ﬁrst item is,
it's a spicy salad mix, microgreen kit. So that's kind of a mouthful and it's kind of a
big deal. So microgreens, if you don't know about them, they are the small version of
maybe like a broccoli or an arugula, but they pack about 20 times the nutritional
value as when you fully grow them.
So it oﬀers a great nutritional value and they're trending pretty heavily right now. So
that's also something we look at as a merchant. So with this item, our easy grow
supplier partner has come up with a solution. No soil, no mess. All you got to do is
set the preceded pads in this little tray, add some water, and in probably about, I
don't know, two weeks you'll end up with microgreens that you can enjoy puttingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28

Page 23 of 25your smoothies, your salads. So this is an awesome item. So, give it up for these
guys. This is a really -- this is a cool product.
So as many people before me have said, this is one of my favorite days every year,
because I get to meet all of you and learn about all of your great products. I've been
a part of this event for seven years now, and I have met brands that are on the
forefront of innovation, creating opportunities for their communities and delivering
on our customer's needs.
Our customers are continuing to cook more and more at home. They're making the
same meals over and over. They're getting bored. I know, I am every night when I
make the same thing. So what better than sun sauce, a fun and ﬂavorful sauce to
ﬁght that food fatigue and make your meals exciting again. Our customers are
asking us for ﬂavors that are regionally relevant, from their local communities and
their favorite restaurants, but they're also looking for better for you options, that they
can feel good about serving to their customers.
Pitmaster LT's barbeque sauce delivers on all of that. Luther Tooks, a U.S. army
veteran and Pitmaster started to develop a recipe, when he couldn't ﬁnd anything
that satisﬁed his taste. He perfected his recipe over three decades and he owned
and operated a restaurant that many claim still to this day to have served the best
barbeque in Kansas City. His barbeque sauce is distinctly Kansas City style, but also
incorporates ﬂavors from other regional styles. So not only does it have a really
unique and high quality ﬂavor, but it also is all natural, preservative-free and has no
high-fructose corn syrup in it. I really enjoy being able to deliver products that meet
our customer needs while also supporting local communities. And I can't wait to
meet you tomorrow, Pitmaster LT.
Nice. Fantastic. So, this will be my ﬁfth year now. Doing these open call events. I got
to tell you the excitement level, I think goes up substantially every year. And I'm
going to go ahead and say, because everyone else has. It's the most fun day of the
year, most fun week of the year. That's just, I feel like you have to say that when you
get on stage here, but it's true. It's very true.
The reasoning for that go way beyond just the items themselves. Like I'm going to
talk about the impacts that an item can have. So obviously, it impacts you guys, for
the entrepreneurs to get a deal. It impacts the end customer at Walmart to have new
compelling assortment. And it certainly impacts communities in which manufacturing
occurs.
And so Katrina's Kitchen here, an all purpose season ﬂour, who doesn't love a good
fried chicken, right. So, a fantastic item that kind of checks all the buckets for us on
that front. So she started just in the restaurant industry, right, 20 years, continually
had customers coming in, just raving about her diﬀerent bread and her seasonings,
all under the sun there. And then, so she decided to go and package it, and actually
bring it to life at mass. And so just a fantastic, fantastic item, really excited about whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28

Page 24 of 25A - Tony Wallershe can bring to the table and really hone in on the strategy around for me
personally within food, being super regional, right.
I mean, be conscious as, you know, as you go in your meetings tomorrow on what
your scale looks like, it could be a hundred stores, it could be 3,500 stores, be aware
of your reach as far as your consumer, and your end customer, and be transparent
with your merchant about that as well, because ultimately that's what's going to set
you guys up for the most success. So, Katrina looking forward to meeting you
tomorrow, if you're in the room. There you go. So thank you for being here.
That's awesome. So I promise we didn't get together to try to make you guys all
hungry with these delicious options, but I'm kind of seeing some good dinner for
tonight, some good inspiration, but thank you guys very much. And seriously,
tomorrow is going to be a big day. Can't wait to see the magic happen. I think
there's a few in this room that I get have an opportunity to meet with and see what
kind of innovation you guys are bringing to the table, but just know that, we're
thrilled. We're going to ask some hard questions, feel free to ask us some hard
questions as well.
And just to get this thing kicked oﬀ, I think we could do one last little special event.
So, if you give me just a moment. So, tomorrow all three of you suppliers are going
to be receiving an 'I got a deal ticket.' So Katrina, Pitmaster LT, could you guys please
stand up for just a moment.
And don't worry, everybody, will bring a big check book. There'll be some more --
there'll be some more deals tomorrow. So that's what we've got for today. We got
one more words of encouragement that we're going to ﬂash on the screen for you,
but thank you guys very much, and we'll talk to you tomorrow.
Great job.
Hey, thank you, Charles.

Is this the best day ever or what? It is the best day ever, but tomorrow is going to be
even better, you'll. Tomorrow is going to be awesome. I'm so excited for you all.
Thank you all so much for being here today, and I hope that you enjoy today's
executive session. Tomorrow is going to be a tremendous day, and it's going to
manifest itself in a lot of diﬀerent ways.
For some of you, right, we might do a little testing in a few stores here and there. For
some of you that test may be a couple of hundred stores. For some of you may be
something virtual. It could be a combination thereof. But know this, you have been
created for this moment. You are prepared for this moment. Take advantage of it,
okay? Make this your moment. I cannot wait to see what comes out of this tomorrow.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-28
