{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
(technical diﬃculty) -- Microsoft to our conference today. From Microsoft, we have
Takeshi Numoto. Takeshi is the CVP for enterprise and cloud; he runs the marketing
function there. Then in the front row, we have Mat McBride. He works with Takeshi, a
senior director of ﬁnance in the same business unit. And, of course, the omnipresent
Zack Moxcey from investor relations.
And Zack asked me to read a little regulatory blurb. So I will do that. So before we
begin, Microsoft may make some forward-looking statements during this
presentation. And you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for the risk factors relating to
their business. And that's true whether you are here in person or listening on the
web.
So with that, Takeshi, let's just start. Maybe we can start with your role. First of all,
help us to understand what you actually do in your day-to-day role. And as an
adjunct to that, you've been at Microsoft for 20 years, would love to get your
perspective on the Microsoft today relative to the Microsoft that you've seen over the
last number of years.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
So ﬁrst of all, my name is Takeshi Numoto. I'm the Corporate Vice President for cloud
and enterprise marketing. I'm responsible for basically going to market and driving
worldwide marketing strategy for our Microsoft application platform and
infrastructure services and server products.
So that includes products like Azure as a public cloud service, as well as on-prem
server products, such as Windows Server, SQL Server, software tools like Visual
Studio portfolio of products, as well as our business applications around Dynamics
365. So I get to work on a wide portfolio of products.
I've been at the Company just over 19 years, not quite 20 years yet. And I started out
actually as one of the engineers on Windows NT. I've been around a while. But it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-09

Takeshi Numototruly inspiring to see what customers do with technology these days and the
transformational impact that it has on their businesses. And it's really an exciting
time.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
That's great. So let's start with Azure. By our math, it's about a $3 billion revenue run
rate business. But it's actually accelerating, which is kind of amazing at that scale.
And also pretty amazing when you think that probably ﬁve years ago this was pre-
revenue. So an amazing business --
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
According to your math.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
According to my math. So maybe let's talk about the diﬀerentiators. We all know that
Microsoft is a player here. We know that your friends at Amazon with AWS really kind
of maybe were [ph] the catalyst for this market. But let's talk about what makes
Microsoft diﬀerent when you're talking to your customers.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think that's a great question. Because I think in a lot of the cloud dialogues I see,
people focus on speciﬁc properties, Azure or Oﬃce 365 or each of these individual
portfolios that we have.
And each of that is important. But for us one of the key things that we are rallying
behind is this whole notion of Microsoft cloud. And when we talk about Microsoft
cloud, it's basically the handle representing our commercial cloud service oﬀering.
So that includes Azure and all the constituent services underneath Azure, as well as
Oﬃce 365 and Dynamics 365.
And when we think about the diﬀerentiation at the highest level, not at the individual
property level. But what does Microsoft cloud do that is diﬀerentiated, I think it really
boils down to three things. One is the global scale and reach that we oﬀer. So if you
just take Azure regions as an example, one region -- when we talk about Azure
regions, it's not one data center; it's essentially a logical representation of multiple
data centers that are within sort of a network latency such that we can represent it as
one logical construct to the customer.
So that's a large-scale thing that essentially spans multiple data centers most of the
time. We have 38 of those. And that essentially oﬀers more choice to our customers
and partners in terms of how they can deploy their solutions closer to their market,
closer to their customers, closer to their company -- partners or their employees.
And that's a huge beneﬁt that we oﬀer. And that's -- we think of this as really sort of
(inaudible) enterprise requirements, because for us one of the key design points forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 10Microsoft cloud is that we are really designing for the enterprise and not -- enterprise
requirements are not an afterthought.
And that relates to the second point in the sense that the notion of really meeting
enterprise-grade requirements, it's something we've had a privilege of working with
many, many business customers of all sizes, large and small. And we really feel like
we have a sense of going deep with customers and understanding their business
requirements and investing in their needs. And is not just about technology. It's
about how we engage with customers, how we support them through the lifecycle of
their product consumption.
And part of that is really making sure we are helping them be comfortable with the
uses of technology in the cloud. And trust is a huge element of it. And so, we've had
a very, very deep investment all sorts of security capabilities, as well as compliance
certiﬁcations. Everyone [ph] thinks about compliance certiﬁcations, we have more
compliance certiﬁcations than any other global cloud vendor.
So that's not just a horizontal certiﬁcation, whether you talk about the numerous
certiﬁcations we have around ISO this, ISO that, as well as soft one, two [ph], also
vertical ones like kitsa [ph] or PCI and whatnot. And we have the broadest portfolio
of compliance certiﬁcations that essentially designed to reduce the increased
comfort and conﬁdence in trusting customers being able to use their cloud. And
that's really paying oﬀ well.
Then, thirdly is really hybrid. When you think about our approach, we know that
despite the fact that we have all these reasons giving more choice for customers to
be able to deploy their application solutions closest to their targeted areas, we also
do not want to build regions in every country and just every geography. And so the
whole notion of being able to oﬀer a solution that lets customers essentially use
what they have on prem. And almost all enterprise customers have these
investments on their on-prem assets. And building both a technology that's really
deep and comprehensive. But lets them use what they already have on prem with
the things they can do in the cloud. And taking that as synergistic copacetic sale is
something that we feel like we are uniquely positioned to do because we not only
provide a cloud service. But also deliver software that customers can use on
premises.
And so, that enables us to go beyond just hybrid in the sense of just narrowly
connectivity. Oftentimes, how we get talked about is it's just a connectivity thing
where you connect on prem to the cloud. But it's so much deeper than that.
Oftentimes, maybe if people talk about infrastructure, because hybrid in the sense
that you may be able to move storage around or compute around.
But for us, hybrid is far deeper than that. It's really a platform consistency. So from
the productivity, like Oﬃce 365, all the way down to things like application platforms
and data platforms like SQL, identity management like -- all of that is baked in where
we actually have a very deep hybrid all the way down from infrastructure, all the wayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10Ross MacMillan
A - Takeshi Numotoup to the application layer. And we feel like that's something that's really resonating
with customers. So those are the three things, global, trusted. And hybrid.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
And just on that last point, it kind of dovetails a little bit with your commentary
around higher tier services, because that's been a big message from Microsoft,
which is as you think about the evolution of this Azure service, it's about continuing
to add incremental value up the stack.
And I was just curious. When we think about a customer journey on Azure, is there a
way for us to sort of think about how this is typically approached, where the
customer starts. And if we look to some of the customers that are more advanced on
the platform, where are they going with this?
Questions And Answers
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think there is a consistent pattern we see in the customers' journey to the cloud,
regardless of their entry point. And what I mean by that is diﬀerent customers start
with the diﬀerent assets of the cloud.
Some customers start with essentially consuming our SaaS services ﬁrst. So they
might go deploy Oﬃce 365 or they might deploy Dynamics 365. And that's their ﬁrst
entry into cloud consumption. Some cloud customers start with infrastructure. Okay, I
want to drive some storage into the cloud or move some virtual machines into the
cloud. And it's kind of an infrastructure-centric approach.
Or a third (inaudible) essentially customer saying I want to essentially do net new
things in the cloud. So I have an on-prem investment, I'm going to continue to
harvest it. But for net new applications, particularly the ones that extend the
capabilities that I already have on premises, perhaps through to the Web, through to
mobile devices, cloud provides a great leverage point to be able to do more of that.
So think about it as application modernization, that new applications. And those are
typical three entry points customers start using the cloud.
But the common pattern we see is no matter where you start amongst the three entry
points, you end up needing all the elements, from SaaS to infrastructure to higher-
level services. Whether it be machine learning or whether it be face detection or
voice detection and things like that, the application and the cloud consumption
patterns basically become increasingly more sophisticated and the customer needs
a vendor that essentially addresses all the portfolio needs that they have for their
business.
And this is why I think, again, sort of we feel we are very uniquely positioned with not
just Azure. But the Microsoft cloud approach and being able to oﬀer all the things
they need in their journey to the cloud. And that includes also things likeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-09

services that you would probably classify as higher-level services.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
The other thing is you've embraced open source in a way that Microsoft historically
has not done. And you've made comments that as much as 30% of the workloads
now, I think, are running on a Linux OS as opposed to a traditional Microsoft
Windows OS. How important has that been for the messaging and how important is
that to customers when you consider Azure?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think it's been a huge boon for our cloud business, frankly, because we had
become really clearer around our sort of core goal of all around driving Azure
consumption from our end in furtherance of customers' business transformation in
the cloud.
And so, of course we continued to invest heavily in our software IP assets. And it's
great when customers use our software on top of our cloud. That's kind of the best
combination from a software purview. But we are basically, more than any of our
particular individual product goals, essentially driving cloud adoption. And helping
customers transform their business by their broad consumption of cloud is our
primary goal. And so in order to do that, we really deeply embrace the notion of
basically all we want [ph] pursuing in kind, all IT pros (inaudible) kind so that they can
bring their skill sets and consumer cloud based on the skill sets they already have.
So we invested heavily in not just the operating system where we support all Linux
variants. But also a lot of open source-based frameworks, whether it be at the
database level or the language level, you name it, low dev [ph], Python, PHP. We've
invested deeply in being able to recruit developers of those skill sets being able to
productively use Azure. And like you said, over one-third -- over a quarter of our
Azure VMs and over one-third in some regions are running Linux (inaudible) in our
cloud right now. And so that's a huge (inaudible) from our standpoint that's very
exciting for us in driving new growth.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Yes. It's about let's ingest the workloads regardless of the platform. And that's a
good thing for Microsoft.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
So last thing I just wanted to touch on Azure. And this is maybe a little esoteric. But
there's something that Amazon has done. I guess it's called this nomenclature of
services -- serviceless computing. They have this function lambda. Microsoft has
something called Azure functions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-09

just talk to us about what that is and why is it getting airtime? Why is it becoming
something that we are hearing about more in the market?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well it's basically what you sort of talked about as serverless compute, basically to
where you're not essentially not having a server running all the time that may be idle.
But actually being able to have that compute capacity on demand when something
is invoked, a message comes in or signal comes in. So that then it does the right
processing at that time right here and there. And then it actually shuts down once
the job is done.
That's kind of the whole notion, whether it's lambda or Azure functions. That's just
one -- another element of essentially cloud computing bringing more eﬃciencies
into overall compute. If you think about the overall journey, you started with basically
bare metal servers. And then you would virtualize them. That means you can actually
virtualize and essentially pack more virtual machines into a given hardware box so
that your overall hardware utilizations are higher.
So this is kind of another way to take it to the next step. But it won't address all
customer scenarios. At best, you have to have sort of a ﬁt for -- it's a purpose ﬁt thing
that you wouldn't initially use in every scenario. But it's certainly one of the scenarios
that extends the cloud computing eﬃciency and something that we oﬀer as Azure
function as well.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
So boost eﬃciency from a vendor provisioning standpoint. And also from a customer
standpoint. You are not prepurchasing compute capacity; you are not buying, if you
will, reserved instances. You are just basically putting the app out there and it will
consume what it needs as and when those demands arise.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Exactly. Yes.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
So let's talk a little bit about Oﬃce for a minute. So 85 million active users on the
commercial Oﬃce 365 product now, really impressive. And the other thing that's
really interesting is you see growth still at 40%. And I guess one question I have is, is
it clear that Oﬃce 365 is actually driving new users to the platform? You held an
analyst day maybe a year and a half ago where you talked about unit growth within
the Oﬃce franchise. So I'd love to just talk about that for a minute. What is Oﬃce 365
able to do in terms of attracting new users to the platform for a product we think of
as pretty mature?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 10A - Ross MacMillan
A - Takeshi NumotoYes. The background, right, is actually I've been in this current role for about four
years. And before that, I actually got about eight years of working in Oﬃce, including
actually launching Oﬃce 365. So it's been great to see (technical diﬃculty) now that
I'm in a diﬀerent role how Oﬃce 365 is being -- just growing and seeing tremendous
success with customers.
And you're right; 40% see [ph] growth and actually representing, I think, 56%
revenue growth. So it's not just see growth. It's actually driving average revenue per
customer up as well as we are growing.
One of the phenomenon’s that's really encouraging for us to see is that the Oﬃce
365 momentum is actually resulting in increasing our install base for Oﬃce. So this
isn't just pure substitution; it's actually adding to the overall install base of Oﬃce. So
it's having a great impact.
And not only that, we are actually then moving from just selling pure essentially
desktop applications, like Word, Excel. And PowerPoint, to actually selling a service
that includes email, that includes collaboration so that you're seeing that reﬂected
into essentially the upper uplift. So we are seeing install base increases and an upper
uplift. So it's great to see.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
And you've been driving these higher tier SKUs, if you well, E3, E4, E5 now. And as
you oﬀer these, you're adding more whether it's business intelligence capabilities or
uniﬁed communications capabilities. Is this something we should expect as a sort of -
- is there a path, if you will, that we could see more and more value, higher tier SKUs.
And we sort of, if you will, sit on a continuum of sort of higher ARPU over time?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think it's a logical thing for us to continue to think about. Like if you think about the
transition that we've been on for Oﬃce 365 from essentially a traditional license
business where perhaps the highest economic case from a lifetime value standpoint
is to take a transactional customer that may have bought a license once every few
years to the subscription relationship. And that certainly increases the way that we
can deliver value to the customer and therefore increases the lifetime value of the
customer.
Then once we do that, we certainly also want to increase the aperture value that we
deliver. So whether it be going from just pure desktop set of applications to that plus
collaboration and communication. And then, okay, that's certainly seeing see growth
and ARPU growth, like I talked about. And the next step is to continue to drive that.
It's logical for us to say, hey, what are the additional values in the subscription
relationship we can add.
And right now, I can't talk about what's the next. But right now we're really excited
about the opportunity we have around this Oﬃce 365 eply [ph] oﬀer, where certainly
you are really seeing a lot of residents from customers on the security valueFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 10A - Ross MacMillan

A - Ross MacMillan
A - Takeshi Numotoproposition that it represents. And we are also really liking the fact that that also lets
us -- the oﬀering essentially positions us to participate in additional adjacent market
opportunity areas, like business intelligence or voice.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
And just on security, obviously in the last couple years there were a number of
acquisitions that Microsoft did in the security domain. Maybe at a high level you can
help us understand how you're weaving new security functionality both into Oﬃce
and into Azure and into the on-prem products. It feels like that's become an elevated
part of the strategy.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Absolutely. Particularly as we work with customers to help them take advantage of
the cloud, security is a huge issue that we want to make sure we address.
And one of the things we are very focused on is to essentially drive security as an
intrinsic part of the workloads we deliver. So not thinking of security as kind of a
bonus [ph] product to the side. But security as infused into the additional capabilities
for Oﬃce 365, security infused as an intrinsic value proposition of Windows, security
as infusing to the part of how you manage mobile devices through EMS.
And so, we are seeing tremendous amount of success across our product portfolio
whenever we infuse a security value proposition into the workloads that we go to
market with, whether it's Oﬃce 365, whether it's MS, or Windows with mass [ph]
threat protection.
Then, we are essentially also making it easier for customers to sort of secure their
employee base across the board with this oﬀering called secure productive
enterprise. So then we make it super easy for customers to have one transaction to
cover all their employees with, whether it's the security technologies in Windows,
security technologies baked into Oﬃce 365, or across devices with EMS, enterprise
mobility suite, which grew 85% (technical diﬃculty) tremendous amount of success.
So that's kind of how we are approaching it in terms of infusing security deeply into
the workloads that we deliver and essentially making sure that they work seamlessly
across.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Is it monetized or is it just you are, as you said, infusing that into the product portfolio
and so it becomes part of what you oﬀer?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Basically, it's -- a lot of times it's part of the higher editions of the oﬀer. The security is
always one of the things where we want to make sure even our baseline products is
secure. But you want to be able to layer on additional value propositions from that
perspective.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 10A - Ross MacMillan
A - Takeshi NumotoAnd so, Oﬃce 365 E5 is one let way of layering on strategic value proposition on top
of the base Oﬃce 365 workload. And we have Windows enterprise that essentially
also delivers additional enterprise treatment (technical diﬃculty) additional security
capabilities on top of what you would get on your Windows subscription, as well as
EMS essentially that lets you deliver mobile device management and mobile
application management across devices to be able to deliver security capabilities
there. So you can think of it as essentially value propositions that we are both
infusing into the product. But also layering on top of those workﬂows.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Great. Just the last thing I wanted to touch on, because this was an announcement
just earlier this year, was on the Dynamics 365 business. Maybe at a high level you
can just talk to us about what that is, what's diﬀerent about Dynamics 365 versus
Dynamics. And what is it from a customer standpoint that they would look at that and
say this is new, this is something that we didn't get from Microsoft before?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
We are taking a diﬀerent approach with Dynamics 365 from the traditional way that
bizapp, I think, vendors have gone to market, which is sort of the segregation of
diﬀerent functionality and business processing to pieces. So there was sort of a
notion of a CRM versus an ERP that was separate.
But that separation is largely sort of a vendoring use notion in the sense of from a
customer standpoint, they want to be able to have a solution that goes from leads all
the way to cash and order fulﬁllment. So basically with Dynamics 365, we've
essentially uniﬁed our traditional what used to be a CRM and ERP oﬀering into one
cloud service that goes across the entire business oﬃce from leads to order
fulﬁllment all the way down.
And at the same time as unifying it, we've also made it very modular and purpose
built so that you don't have to buy this monolithic mixing [ph] end to end. But can
start with any one of the business processes you want address. So if you want to start
with just customer service, you can do that. If you want to just use us for ﬁeld service
or process service automation or our customer sales automation, you can just get
going, knowing fully well that it's essentially future proof for future expansion to
address more applications and business processes as you move forward. So that's
kind of a very diﬀerent approach than we are thinking from the marketplace.
And we are also building it on top of all the goodness of Azure and all the
capabilities, higher-level services, that it can take advantage of. So it's infused with
what we would think of as intelligence capabilities, whether it be things like
essentially building a model for each of the customers that use the product to do
things like an inventory stockout alert, or being able to do your relationship helping
your customers' sales automation so that depending -- regardless of what the human
judgment is on the ability to close this deal, we can actually say, hey, this deal really
is going to close based on that relationship help that we observed in the customer
engagement through our system.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-09
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 10A - Ross MacMillanSo you can think of it as infusing business -- connecting all the business processes
across diﬀerent areas. And then essentially letting customers start wherever they
want, knowing fully well that it's future proof for expansion.
{BIO 1994797 <GO>}
Great. I'm conscious of time; we are coming up against the end of our slot. We could
probably go on for another half an hour, easily. But there is a breakout; it is across
the way. So Takeshi, thank you so much for coming today. Appreciate it.
