We're very pleased to kick oﬀ the TMT conference with Qi Lu, EVP of Application
Services -- Dr. Qi Liu, with Microsoft. Before we get started, I'm just going to read a
brief (technical diﬃculty).
Both I and Microsoft may make forward-looking statements in the presentation. You
should refer to Microsoft's SEC ﬁlings for risk factors relating to their business and
disclosures at the end of our research and found on our website for the appropriate
Morgan Stanley disclosures. So with that out of the way, thank you very much for
joining us.
And I thought a good place to start would be at a high level, talking about the
broader devices and services strategy. When you guys think about that strategy,
there's been a lot of diﬀerent pieces that come into place for the past couple of
years. Does Microsoft have all the pieces in place today to execute on that strategy?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
Thank you very much Keith for (technical diﬃculty) important questions. And to get it
started, I would like to provide you the audience with a little bit of context on how we
think about Microsoft and how we think about (technical diﬃculty) forward.
First, is we view our industry is at the formative (technical diﬃculty). There is a few
massive tidal waves that are driving and shaping our industry, very, very important
(technical diﬃculty) matters. There's really four things (technical diﬃculty). One is,
computing moving to the cloud. And this is once in several decade (technical
diﬃculty) paradigm shift from mainframe to client server, client server to the cloud.
That's a massive change (technical diﬃculty) creating another opportunity for aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

Page 2 of 14diﬀerent type of (technical diﬃculty) product and (technical diﬃculty). That's number
one.
The second is the (technical diﬃculty). Moving substantially beyond PC, or the
desktop/laptop, the cloud (technical diﬃculty) mobile [ph] devices. Third is social
communications. This used to be, in the last couple decades, the digital connection
between human beings typically is e-mail. But now, the digital connections goes way
beyond e-mails, with rich content and also the ends of those digital connections are
often mobile devices. That's the third (technical diﬃculty).
Fourth one is equally important which is big data (technical diﬃculty) because the
cost of capture (technical diﬃculty) digital observations and the cost of processing
those digital data become cheaper and cheaper. And as we all know, having
business innovation, product innovation at this point about, it's so many new
patterns and using new products to businesses, (technical diﬃculty) starting [ph] to
plan and discover (technical diﬃculty). Turns out if you use big data in the (inaudible)
and if people follow (inaudible) then they can take it a ways any pattern that are
stable, that a human being can tell a diﬀerence. The old machine (technical
diﬃculty). And that creates this massive opportunity because you can systematically,
using technology to discern patterns and use those to drive innovations on
(technical diﬃculty) businesses.
So those are the major tidal waves that are still in the early stage of adoption,
shaping our industry. Financial model can be (technical diﬃculty) we're here today in
San Francisco. Before the large earthquake (inaudible) (technical diﬃculty) shape the
city, after the big wave the city is, probably just our industry is in that place. So we
view that as the content, stand up to look at [ph] Microsoft.
Our founding DNAs go back to the days of Bill, Paul Allen, Steve. And a common
[ph] core is, we're a do-more company. Meaning that, we produce products and
services that enable individuals, businesses, organizations, to appear more
accomplished. It doesn't matter, whichever human undertaking you set out to do, the
Microsoft products and services enable you to accomplish more.
If you take that length to say, we're fundamentally in the do-more category, in the old
last three decades, computing contained a [ph] sort of client server for every home
to every desk which is Microsoft's early vision, which is a great vision. Deliver PC for
every desk, every home. We change the world. And now computing can deliver
everywhere. Digital connection between human beings goes way beyond e-mail.
And also, all of computing is moving away and beyond client server, into cloud.
(technical diﬃculty) big data. We get to ride these major tidal waves. Take the do-
more category (technical diﬃculty) substantially new level. So at the core, to answer
your question now, do we have what it takes? (Absolutely), because (technical
diﬃculty) our core business which is to enable people or organizations to
accomplish more. Now, we have the opportunity to ride these tidal waves. (To
double down on) core, renew it. And elevate it. So it can enable not only individualsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

A - Qi Luto do things in oﬃce. But on the go, at home. Our opportunity as a company is
substantially bigger. When you look at all the assets you have, not just the
technological assets, the human (capital) assets. But our (inaudible) assets, especially
the Microsoft (inaudible).
Our relationship with enterprise customers, our relationship with professionals, we
take all these in combination. The answer is emphatically yes, because we have what
it takes to take our company from where we are today, renew it. And elevate it. And
we truly have strong belief the second phase of Microsoft is going to be substantially
stronger one with a larger footprint. It's going to have a business impact, an
economic impact. And a world impact for our customers (technical diﬃculty).
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
(technical diﬃculty) investors about the prices (technical diﬃculty) (versus) strategy. I
think investors have a relatively optimistic view on the services side. They like
Microsoft's position with enterprise. They are very optimistic upon, on what you guys
have done across (Q5) and what you have done with Azure. I think where guys are a
little more doubtful or have a little more pessimistic, is the mobile devices side.
So the question to you would be, why does Microsoft have to do mobile devices?
Why not just leave mobile devices to Apple, to Google, with Android, you could just
focus on the parts that you guys are more optimistic (technical diﬃculty) enterprise
(technical diﬃculty) cloud services and all (technical diﬃculty)?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
Yes. That's a great question, Keith. First of all, it's important enough for me to re-state
our company's strategy going forward. And in particular, Satya Nadella, our new
CEO, made it very clear. Microsoft needs to (slide) in the cloud ﬁrst and the mobile
ﬁrst (inaudible), strategically very important for us. There's a couple things in your
question I want to emphasize.
One is, our industry is at the phase whereby vertical integrations, particularly
innovations that happen across the boundary of device hardware, operating systems,
(technical diﬃculty). And application services tend to drive (greater innovations),
(technical diﬃculty) to take economic advantage. So from value creation standpoint,
having the ability to go end-to-end is a key part of (technical diﬃculty) Microsoft
deliver unique value proposition to our customers to drive innovations. That's one.
The second is, in terms of the ability to capture economic (values), as you look at
today, the dominant business models are able to capture substantial (inaudible)
economic values, (technical diﬃculty) few that are major. One is (technical diﬃculty)
has been shown by Google and Microsoft, are able to drive substantial economics.
The second is selling to enterprise, which Microsoft has a very strong presence. And
so, they sell devices. And if you look at the cost (be the globe) (technical diﬃculty)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

Page 4 of 14A - Keith Weiss

A - Keith Weissﬁscal years, the companies tend to drive a lot of economic values around those
mainly (inaudible). So it's a combination of driving innovation, creating values. And
being able to in a position to capture economic value.
So strategically, being strong in mobile devices is very important for Microsoft.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
You mentioned the new CEO on board at Microsoft, the ﬁrst time that a non-founder
(technical diﬃculty) CEO at Microsoft. I was wondering if you could give us your
impressions of the new boss? What do you think of his leadership style. And what do
you think of his ability to execute? And what changes might we expect from the new
boss at Microsoft going forward?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
First of all, (technical diﬃculty) speak on my behalf and I think that I speak on the
behalf of the senior management team. We're just as thrilled to have Satya as our --
be at the helm and taking leadership role as the Company's new CEO. That's
number one.
The second is, at the personal level, I have the opportunity to work with Satya for a
number of years and we worked together closely in diﬀerent capacities. And I can
tell you I hold very, very high regard for Satya (as a leader) and am very excited
about the future opportunity to partner with Satya very, very closely, taking our
company going forward.
Speciﬁcally, there's a lot of things Satya has already hit the ground running, driving a
lot of forward progress. And you will see us focusing a lot more (driving) clarity. We
have our strategy, device and services. But fundamentally use device and services
(need) to deliver what we call a high value (scenario). Especially (I'll do) more
experiences for individuals, for businesses. Driving clarity and (ﬁnd the) alignment.
The company needs to be far more aligned. We made an organization change in
July last year, where we called it (One Microsoft organization) model. But still, a lot of
work need to go (into) so that across the Company our resources, our business
initiative, are fully, fully aligned.
And also, driving (intensity), the face of forward progress. So there's a lot of
excitement and energies going forward.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
At the analyst day at the end of the last year, you talked about one of the values of
cloud services is the ability to immediately observe what the customer does. And
puts it there, the capabilities of a cloud scale infrastructure to use those machineries
you were talking about to change the face of innovation, to bring out new services
faster. You were talking about this earlier. Where are we likely to see that initially from
Microsoft? What kind of oﬀerings or services might we see that ﬁrst emerge in?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 14A - Qi Lu{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
Okay. So that's a serious question. When (the same) product is moving from a on-
premise (world) or into a cloud (world), for example the Oﬃce Suite, moving to the
cloud to become (Oﬃce 365), there's a number of important beneﬁts. This particular
aspect is the way you bring that up is, really above the ability, the new ability to drive
(hard innovations). Because worst that come (cloud) (technical diﬃculty) deliver the
services, there's a few new important dimensions of innovation capability. One is the
pace of product update and experience innovations. In the old on-premise world,
many people familiar with Oﬃce product. We ship new versions every few years. And
in reality it takes IT department (inaudible) issue a lot of eﬀorts to upgrade.
So there is actually usually only a percentage of customers actually get the beneﬁt of
new product. Once you move to the cloud work, you always immediately get the
beneﬁt from new innovations and new experiences. But much more importantly,
cloud (inaudible) services the software has a way to immediately observe customer
behavior. So we can respond to customer needs in a far more agile way. Our entire
relation is going sort through a profound change so that we can follow along with
continuous developments. We have continuous deployment, continuous quality,
continuous intelligence, using business intelligence inform us in his planning, driving
all the new values for customers on a steady basis.
The most important thing that (technical diﬃculty) going forward would be
(inaudible) source of cloud innovation. It's the (technical diﬃculty) patterns and to
convert those patterns into what we call the high-value enterprise (graphs). So they
happen to be important today, we have another conference as we speak the same
day, (it must be) the SharePoint conference so we could announce a number of new
products. And one thing (inaudible) is for the ﬁrst time we announced to the world
the ability of one called Oﬃce (Graph).
This is, just think about this, many, many graphs, the highlighted graphs (inaudible).
What Oﬃce Graph is, is, we look at the user behaviors and the (price), some of the
communication exchange on SharePoint and the documents that they use. And to
connect documents with the people. You can say -- ah, this Power Point, you will go
to this product called (Alzerol), you can assign your (inaudible), it conditions all your
information. You can say, this document, my manager present it to his boss two
weeks ago and (inaudible) my colleague says they like it.
So you think about there's like a (buzz feed) like capabilities that tell you what's
trending, what's important, which customer have seen this report. And this is really
the (technical diﬃculty) (improvised) look of what Oﬃce Graph (technical diﬃculty).
And you think about is maybe, may be other graph we can imagine. 35 years ago
the (inaudible) people publish research paper about a $1 trillion enterprise high
value graphs.
But once you move to the cloud you have that opportunity to observe deep patterns,
innovation (paradigm). It's a fundamental shift from writing new software, shippingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14A - Keith Weiss
A - Qi Lunew services, of (building graphs) and then using (graphs) as fundamental driver.
Driving new innovation. Not just for Microsoft, for (I3) customers.
So this is just the beginning. I think really the beginning we're moving into diﬀerent
era of driving innovation. Super, super excited because we do have to look forward.
If you just look at Facebook, LinkedIn, what Facebook has is a really who-knows-who
graph. Think about what they are able to deliver in terms of value to their customers.
And enterprise value (inaudible).
LinkedIn is really this (pure graph), people connecting to professional relationships.
Microsoft Oﬃce 365 will be in position to discover surface generation (technical
diﬃculty) many, many high value enterprise (graph, professional graphs) and use
those to drive innovation. So today is really the beginning, the SharePoint
conference, the announcing the availability of the Oﬃce Graph for (inaudible)
opportunity.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Great segue into, I want to start drilling down a little bit into some of the individual
business units you have responsibility for, starting with Oﬃce. Oﬃce 365 has been a
big part of (inaudible) over the past (year and) (technical diﬃculty) bigger parts start
going forward. What should we think about the release date in Oﬃce 365 on a
going-forward basis. And maybe the release that (guys) are most (anticipating) is the
potential of having Oﬃce on iOS. How should investors be thinking about that
(inaudible)?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
Yes, Keith, I think this is a question -- I believe actually, we got the ﬁnancial (technical
diﬃculty) we -- let me maybe answer your iOS questions ﬁrst, then talk about the
release cadence then.
So as a principle, we look at two (technical diﬃculty) (factors) for us to decide what to
ship on what platforms and what timeframe. There's really two factors, okay. The ﬁrst
factor is, whether there is genuine customer, interpret customer needs. And whether
we are in a position to deliver great experience for a customer, that's number one.
The second factor is whether we can do that, that basic economic (inaudible)
Microsoft. And those are the two things we look at. And with regard to the Oﬃce
Suite product, a portion of product -- for example, OneNote (technical diﬃculty)
(Sync), type, OneDrive. They're all available on non-Microsoft Windows platforms
already, on iOS (nine). So (inaudible) phones and tablets. So that's important just to
make it clear.
The other is, we also have another (version) of core applications, namely Word,
Power Point, Excel, Outlook. Those products, today they are available on Windows,
Mac OS, they're also available on the Web. So if you use an iPad, if you want to use
Oﬃce, you can use the web version as well. But those products were primarily
designed for mice and a keyboard, for the desktop mode. So we have been workingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14A - Keith Weiss
A - Qi Luon touch-ﬁrst version of those co-apps. And we're going to make those applications
available for Windows devices and non-Windows devices. But exactly what
timetables (the when and how) you have to again go back to these two facets. Are
we in a position to truly be able to deliver the great experience to serve our
customer's (needs). And whether we can do that (inaudible).
So that's how we think about this. And then to take a step back to connecting what I
earlier said, our company's fundamentally about deliver true (inaudible) experience
for our customers. And we view those really as great opportunities, because the
more (modem) device that are out there, the better it is for Microsoft to have, to be
able to reach more customers, delivered high value experience to them. Particularly
in touch (modem) device (world) and you can have additional capability to go
beyond the experience that we have.
For example, most of those (modem) devices will have camera, right? How many
times we see people taking picture of what's on a white board, or taking picture of
slides on a screen? And we will have the opportunity to make far easier for you to
capture this information over (inaudible). So we generally view those as
opportunities. But what (inaudible) if, (in matters) as I mentioned. So that's one part.
The other part about release cadence, that's sort of very, very important. I want to
emphasize it. (technical diﬃculty) to fundamentally change our engineering
capability, moving to a new order whereby we're always (striving and wishing) and to
be able to accelerate the pace of our heartbeat. It is fundamentally important. And
the net of it is, we're moving toward whereby we can ship our services on a
continuous basis. And also getting a position where we can shift client (bids) on
quarterly (basis).
So we're not quite there yet. This is a (long, hard point) (inaudible) to go to but that's
a fundamental shift, which dramatically raise our company's capability to drive
innovation at the much more greater level. So there's a lot of important activities
(inaudible).
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
(technical diﬃculty) remains one of the best (as far as) product areas for Microsoft.
And one that we hear some of the most positive feedback from enterprise customers
around. Can you talk about what's really resonating with these customers and how
big that business is today? Where are the further areas that it can go into. And
maybe also touch on how Skype plays to that overall (opportunity)?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
So this is indeed the one area we are super, super excited about. One is, as we all
know, the communication products and experiences and really moving upwards in a
sense that a lot of people are still using e-mail. But voice and video communications
is a lot richer. But there's a lot of opportunity to systematically (raise) that expense.
That's number one. The second is, our (length in this) is going very, very strong. And
all the (inaudible) revenues will be disclosed is (only the other one bidding down)
revenue. And the (polling) -- so, very, very high post (inaudible).FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 14A - Keith WeissSame time, we also have a very strong asset in Skype. And you should fully expect
the world, the future world to (link in Skype), (link to operate) each other so that our
customers, our users, will be able to (prove) the rich audio/video communication
whether you're at work or at home. So there's a lot of opportunity for that.
But more importantly, we see this area whereby it's tremendous opportunity to
deliver more innovation values. But combine the large -- today's, the digital
communication, digital meetings, (is still) far away from being a truly satisfying,
satisfactory experience So let me, I'll give you something that's based on some of
the statistics we say from our Lync customers.
On average, it takes more than 10 minutes to get a meeting started, because you're
always (fumbling) the dongle and all those (inaudible) things. And I don't know
about you -- if you have an adjoining a conference call on others, it's almost a
guarantee, there's always somebody forgot to unmute. And they keep talking, then
oops, forgot to unmute, they have to repeat themselves. So the meeting experience
is far, far from being satisﬁed. We see those fantastic opportunities both to drive
innovations and some of the things we've been planning on (inaudible). How about
we just focus on, you can start a meeting instantly, any time you join a meeting, it
starts. You don't have to fumble around.
And how about in the future you could have a meeting, you don't have to repeat
yourself. Let's just start from there. And then think about the meetings. I give you one
example, there is a (subtle thing) in the (inaudible) in San Francisco called (Epsolac).
They have a -- have a client. And we have meetings but all the information we talk
about, let's say two people talking about making (chip plus data), everything you talk
about (inaudible) that's one swipe away. As you talk, it can swipe information for
what you're talking about. Need to (share the last thing). And if you annotate the
comments, (technical diﬃculty) fantastic opportunity for us at Microsoft to take the
asset what we have. But truly take the experience as of today to a much, much higher
level and we see a lot of opportunity to drive not just experience beneﬁt. But also
drive economic value for our customers and for (our company).
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Another good segue. I want to make sure, I'm going to open up for questions from
the audience, I want to make sure we touch on all the relevant provisions before that.
A little over a month ago at the meeting with Dave O'Hara who worked with you, you
made a comment that really resonated with me around the Bing asset that you guys
have. Talking about Bing as being one the few search technologies out there that are
really able to be at-scale and be large enough (technical diﬃculty) business on all
elements, what's going on, not just (technical diﬃculty) Internet but also what's
going on with (technical diﬃculty) organizations. Become an (aﬄuent) technology for
information technology on a going-forward basis. With that in mind, it is something
that's a little of what you're talking about, bringing in these other areas of
information into a meeting presentation, for instance.
On the other hand, when I talk to investors, we hear a lot about the (technical
diﬃculty) ability to (technical diﬃculty) out Bing, something that hasn't beenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14A - Qi Luproﬁtable for you guys for a while. Perhaps just a distraction. Can you talk about the
wisdom of whether or not it would make sense to spin out Bing? What does it bring
to Microsoft and how hard would it be -- is this one you guys would ever (inaudible),
something that's really a possibility?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
That's a question that (inaudible) right over there. So the strategic pieces for Bing,
there is several dimensions Keith, I want to be able to comment on.
One is, if you look at the search engine technology, at the core it's about building
the digital connective tissues to organize the worlds of information. So for Bing,
(some of the numbers) we see tens of trillions of (new URLs) at any given day, we
discover tens of billions of new URLs a single day. And because as a -- outside our
industry overall are digitizing everything that we do. So although the product is
manifesting in the form of giving keywords, getting URL, listing URL (inaudible). But
the capability is really the digital connective tissues organizing information,
organizing digital experiences.
So it's fundamentally important as the ingredient for Microsoft and for our industry to
drive innovations, build next generation digital experiences. For example in the
device arena, can already see our smartphones, the way people seek information
may not be typing in URLs and get; typing keywords and getting URLs. Particularly
let's say if you use a smart watch. You're not going to type keywords and click on
URLs. What you will do probably just speak to it, or using other ways to (inaudible).
But you can use search as a fundamental technology for organizing information,
(give us) information based on its ability to understand using (inaudible) focus of
human being (inaudible) information.
So there's a lot of opportunity for us to use Bing as an ingredient to diﬀerentiate
Microsoft devices in the (mix of) core services. For example in Oﬃce, we have the
Oﬃce Agave deliver new experiences as part of Oﬃce Suite. And the Bing's already
delivering a lot of new value, will see us deliver more and more values in those
regard.
So that's one important fact. The second is Bing as a business. As we look around
across the -- our entire industry, search is a very, very potent (inaudible) (ability).
There's actually very few as helpful as Search. And we don't have to go very far to
look at in the United States, Google, Microsoft, are able to drive economic revenue
growth using search engine. And in China, there is actually for example a company
called (inaudible) 65 and they are able to use search as economic model, to extract
potential value. So search is a very, very important capability for Microsoft in our
quest to drive device and service strategy to be able to capture economic values.
And also, most importantly is, search as the ingredient in drive fundamentally
innovations to take Microsoft experiences from there. But particularly to do more
experiences. Because we have, when we started with the Bing innovations, we have a
diﬀerent point of view to begin with. We say, people search for information, is always
in a (inaudible). Your inspiration to search for information is always in the context ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 14A - Keith Weiss
A - Qi Luaccomplish something. So for Bing experiences we always want to build
(experiences) to say not only are you getting information but you also get the
contents (technical diﬃculty) (media) information and you also had the opportunity
to do the activities right there.
So (our mantra has always been), let's organize the world of information diﬀerently,
to enable our users to accomplish task, get stuﬀ done. So the Bing experience, the
Bing capabilities is a fundamentally consistent with our do-more spirit for take our
company to (technical diﬃculty).
The last thing I want to mention is, fundamentally we as an organization, are hard-
core committed to make our Bing investment, the economical, viable endeavors
because in many ways you could think about the best invention we as a society, as
human being has come up with so far is this (inaudible) market. This market is, is a
fabulous (technical diﬃculty). Once you make something economically viable and
the organization would try and drive innovation. So the entire Bing organization is
very much committed in making Bing an economically-viable endeavor and then
we're very, very (pretty) proven so far because we've been gaining market shares.
Since we launched the Bing search engine, every month (technical diﬃculty) (since
June) 2009 we've been gaining market share in the United States. And it would be
(technical diﬃculty) Bing service across the globe.
So very pleased about progress we've made so far. The net of it is, it's a
fundamentally-important piece of technology for Microsoft, to take where we are
today (technical diﬃculty) Microsoft. Second is, it's strategically important for us to
capture economic values (inaudible).
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
To put a point on it, in terms of the proﬁtability and the route to proﬁt, proﬁtability,
do the targets remain the same in terms of the levels of share? I mean, you can
remind us what those levels are of market share that you need to be, to reach
proﬁtability. And what kind of timeline for the (technical diﬃculty) are you thinking
about when we'll get (technical diﬃculty)?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
So to just talk about the speciﬁc timeline. So we have to talk about given the ﬁxed
cost for you to invest in the operating expenses and the setup fee, because search is
one of those (classic) you have very high (inaudible) cost and the (modular) cost of
serving extra customers is actually very low. So in the United States, it takes roughly
about somewhere between 20 to 22 points of market share. And depending on the
diﬀerent expense can also, in case -- meaning we could (turn on your investment
postures) and we want to invest you know, with our (sustainably gained) shares. Be in
position to drive more innovation. And also drive those innovation for our devices,
also this business. At the same time, be able to drive economic (inaudible) to make it
economically viable endeavors.
Maybe -- that's what I wanted to mention a couple of things. One is, the search
economics is all volume-driven, as you know. Search is one of those products,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 14A - Keith Weiss
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Qi Lu
A - Keith Weissvolume scale is magic. The largest, the more the scale is the product gets better.
People say that I could search (inaudible) any time for the search box, I think
audience knows and (inaudible) knows what you are about to type. And that feature
alone is driven by scale. Essentially the more people use it, the quality of suggestion
gets better. So that's number one.
The second is, the more scale is, the more economic yield, the high economic yield.
First (inaudible) inquiry you're able to make more revenues. Just because search is
(inaudible) spend, always sold out, there's a strong market (to price it). But the more
volume you have, the more economic yield. So we've been driving volumes
organically for our own (inaudible). Also through distribution of partners, there's a
couple things I want to mention. One is being able to probably know this -- Bing is a
partner for Apple Siri. So we've been providing Siri backﬁll, we've been serving
billions of queries already. And (whatever increase) to that, the Apple customers,
Apple (inaudible) so far, that's all customer satisfaction and zero complaint. That's
awesome, awesome to know.
The second is, Amazon Kindle devices, Bing's also the default search for that. There's
a lot of opportunities because on a global basis, there's only two (inaudible) as I said.
From a technological standpoint, it's the foundation, it's organizing the digital fabric
for outstanding innovation on (inaudible). Economically, it is strong as a value
extractor that (technical diﬃculty). And we're very, very pleased that Microsoft are
able to invest in that technology and to grow it. It is a (novel) opportunity for us to
drive more volume organically so the solution (inaudible) and we drive a better
product and a better yield (technical diﬃculty).
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
I've been asking my questions too long already so I want to make sure we open it up
to questions from the audience. Any questions from the audience?
Can you name (technical diﬃculty)?

As I said, our strategy has been deliver high value scenarios and through devices
and services. That's number one. The second is, our core is, Do More, because that's
our founding DNA. And third is, we're going to try a lot more clarity, (technical
diﬃculty) become a strategy and it would drive a lot more alignment across the
Company. And also, the velocity, the intensity, is -- the industry is moving at the very,
very fast pace. And our company's opportunity for the next phase. And a truly vast
one. So you will see us move with a lot of (pace forward) of energy and speed and
intensity with clarity, (technical diﬃculty) alignment. So that will be, that's the
strategy. The focus on Do More, the focus on getting the (highlight scenario)

A - Keith WeissMight sound a little bit outrageous, thinking about how you matched up (technical
diﬃculty) not, doesn't have a presence yet. (technical diﬃculty) might make sense for
Apple and Microsoft to merge?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
So I will, I will not directly answer the last part of your question. That's (technical
diﬃculty). But the ﬁrst part of the question is important. The Microsoft in bread and
butter is our do-more work (technical diﬃculty). Microsoft experience in many ways is
our brand. And our relationship with enterprise customers was professional.
(technical diﬃculty) Microsoft experiences our longevity of the investment in
technology and R&D capability.
The areas we need to do a lot more is on the end user side, on the consumer side. In
my organization, one of the key things I'm pushing hard is that we have to drive
innovations, drive much faster pace of innovations so there our products, our quality,
the simplicity, the ease of use. And our product also needs to appeal to the young
generations. Those are the other areas we need to do a lot more work. But we have
fundamental strengths and we have a lot of base ability to execute it, around those.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
I wanted to get in, in our last couple minutes. Going back to the search business and
relationship with Yahoo!, CEO Marissa Mayer has expressed frustration with
Microsoft, their partnership in the past. More recent commenting a little more
favorable. Do you think that's going to be a durable relationship for Microsoft going
forward?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
So ﬁrst of all, we have a ten-year, excuse me, partnership between Microsoft and
Yahoo!. And that's a very, very important relationship (between our two companies).
And we are very, very committed of working together as strong partners to drive
innovations for both companies and drive value, that's number one. The second is, if
you pay attention to Yahoo!'s oﬃcial comments in the quarterly earnings, you will
ﬁnd that Yahoo! always expressed they are pleased with the business performance,
they are pleased with the partnership, because that's very important.
And so this is about driving innovation and as we all know, (technical diﬃculty) today
is (ill-informed). Keywords. URLs. Our mobile devices, there's a lot of opportunities.
We see Yahoo as a partner to innovate together because we hear the same
(inaudible). The more innovation Yahoo! is able to drive, the better it is for Yahoo!
customers. And the better it is for the Bing platform. As I said, on a global basis,
there's only two games in town. So we're motivated, together, to drive innovation, to
drive more value. And we see we will continue on that strategic (inaudible) serving
both our companies well.

A - Qi LuI'll do one last question to wrap it up. And really talking about the synergies between
the search business and mobile, how important is WinPhone 8 adoption to really
have mobile emerge as a big value driver on the search side of the business for
Microsoft?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
So there's a natural synergy between mobile devices and search. Because if you look
at what you use a phone typically to do, it's a lot of times you use the phone to
accomplish important day-to-day tasks. And part of be able to (inaudible)
accomplish your day-to-day tasks is ﬁnding information, seeking information. So we
see phone is a Do-more device. And search is really the gateway to enable users to
collect the information you want. That's (digital experiences). It just has speciﬁc user
experiences, is not going to be the same as you type in keywords and getting URL.
And Apple Siri in many ways is a good example of the new kind of experiences you
value by blending search technology and the mobile phone device (four factors) of
usage and modality to take the experience to the next level. So we are actively
investing a lot of technological capabilities. And if you look at the Windows Phone
today you see a lot of experience for example, Local Scout, the recommendations for
applications and services. All those are diﬀerent ways of using search technology to
deliver more value. And we're at the very, very early phase to have (inaudible) we're
pretty conﬁdent we're able to drive a whole lot more user value, economic value at
the same time.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
