{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Ramon Laguarta, I'm the Chairman and CEO of
PepsiCo It is a pleasure to present a cognate this year. I'd like to focus my agenda on
discussing how PepsiCo has evolved into an even faster, even stronger and even
better company and how we expect to sustain that momentum in our business
performance.
But before I get started, I would like to take a brief pause and ask that you please
take note of our cautionary statement.
I'll focus my agenda on providing some background on our business, our strategic
framework, the results we have delivered against that framework and conclude by
discussing our priorities and value-creation proposition.
Before we get into the presentation, I would like to thank our highly experienced
local teams and frontline associates who continue to focus on driving superior
marketplace execution to serve both our customers and our communities. Our
associates are the backbone of this organization. I could not be prouder of how they
continue to manage through what has been an incredibly complex and volatile
environment.
While many of you probably know us very well, I would like to start with an overview
of our company and our businesses. PepsiCo is one of the largest beverage and
convenient food companies in the world. With more than $79 billion in net revenue
and more than $11 billion in core operating proﬁt.
Our products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories. And we have a
diverse portfolio of large iconic brands, that consumers know and trust including
Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, and Quaker, just to
name a few. And we have a very clear vision of how we can create growth and value
for the planet and for the people with our recent launch of pep+.
From a category perspective, our businesses have complementary characteristics,
including consumers, customers, shoppers and locations. We are the market leaderFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-02-23
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 9in convenient foods and hold a leadership position in savory snacks with
opportunities to expand our presence within macro snacks and convenient meals.
We hold a strong #2 position in beverages globally, with a solid representation in all
LRB categories and seek to expand our businesses into other beverage occasions.
60% of our global net revenue is derived from North America, while 40% is derived
from our international markets. Our top 10 markets account for over 80% of our
global net revenue with the U.S. being our largest market.
Our North American beverage business is the largest contributor to our net revenue,
while our Frito-Lay North America business is the largest contributor to our core
division operating proﬁt. Our international businesses span across many markets and
have a long runway for growth. Currently, Europe and Latin America are the largest
contributors to our international net revenue. But we do expect AMESA and APAC to
become a larger part of our international revenue over time.
Our core division proﬁt margin is greatly inﬂuenced by category mix and our choice
to own or franchise our bottling operations. For example, our strategic decision to
own and operate a substantial portion of our bottling operations in North America
and Russia are important factors to consider when analyzing our core division
operating margin at PBNA and in Europe. Within North America, most of our
beverage and convenient food products are primarily distributed via our company-
owned direct store delivery system, while certain products are distributed via a
warehouse delivery system.
Product velocities, market share and scale, category dynamics and, of course, return
on investment are all important factors that go into considering the appropriate go-
to-market distribution system. The same principles also apply to our international
businesses.
I will now shift my focus to the continued implementation and execution of our
strategic framework. Three years ago, we embarked on a mission to become the
global leader in beverages and convenient food by winning with purpose and
becoming a faster, stronger, and better organization. Faster meant winning in the
marketplace, becoming more consumer centric and accelerating investment for top
line growth. Stronger meant developing capabilities that can give us a competitive
advantage with technology and digitalization at the center. Building a diﬀerentiated
culture and driving productivity through holistic cost management. And better
meant integrating purpose into our business strategy and becoming leaders towards
building a more sustainable food system.
To mark on this mission, we developed a set of principles called the PepsiCo Way,
which primarily involves taking a consumer-centric lens into everything that we do,
empowering our employees to act like owners and making diversity a competitive
advantage. The heart of this agenda includes investing in our people and making
PepsiCo a diverse and great place to work.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-02-23

Page 3 of 9Our culture and values also extend beyond our people to the planet with our launch
of pep+. The goal of pep+ is to transform the way we create growth and value by
operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet
and people in the global food system. Pep+ drives action and progress end-to-end
across three key pillars: positive agriculture, positive value chain and positive
choices.
We also took decisive action and ﬁne-tuned certain operating models throughout
our organization to become more agile, nimble, connected end-to-end and
consumer centric. In North America, this included a new operating model for our
beverages business, which enhanced our focus on execution at the local market
level. It also included the creation of PepsiCo Foods North America, which has
improved collaboration and agility around innovation and productivity initiatives at
Quaker Foods and Frito-Lay.
In our international markets, we realigned our reporting structures within Asia, Africa
and the Middle East to focus on local relevance and consumer centricity for this very
large and diverse populations and cultures. We also delayered our organization in all
our divisions by shifting resources from the center to local markets to enhance our
expertise and local execution capabilities. These models have clearly helped us
navigate the complexities created by the global pandemic in the last two years with
superior marketplace performance.
To build on the changes we employed to our culture and organization, we prioritized
our actions to accelerate top line growth and enhanced our competitive advantages.
This actions included numerous investments and initiatives to support our faster,
stronger, and better framework and I will now take you through some very speciﬁc
examples.
To become a faster organization and accelerate growth, we invest into 45 our global
brands and businesses. For example, we bolstered our global advertising and
marketing spend, reﬂecting investments across our large brands, such as Lay's,
Doritos, Pepsi, and Gatorade within beverages and convenient foods.
We also invested in advancing our in-house content creation and automation
capabilities to deploy targeted higher return on investment and marketing programs
in a manner that is both eﬃcient and scalable. We added manufacturing lines to
capture new demand spaces and unlocked capacity for constrained products. The
expanded capacity has enabled us to be more responsive to the evolving needs of
our customers and consumers in areas such as variety packs.
We are envisioned our workforce of the future by matching jobs and global talent
more eﬀectively to maximize eﬃciencies and free up resources to focus on new
capabilities. We also added routes, merchandising racks and people, as well as
leverage technology to make our go-to-market systems more ﬂexible to satisfy
heightened consumer demand with greater precision and eﬃciency. And we
continued to automate and digitize our supply chain to help reduce bottlenecks andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-02-23

Page 4 of 9enable greater agility and speed-to-market for breakthrough innovation. As a result
of all this investment, we've seen a consistent acceleration in the net revenue growth
of our large global brands.
Another key initiative has been to invest behind meaningful consumer-centric
innovation. We've expanded variety pack and multi-pack oﬀerings to satisfy
heightened consumer demand, while also providing positive choices for the
consumer on our larger brands with sustainable packaging, zero sugar, baked and
lightly salted options. We also have invested to create smaller brands to participate
in fast-growing new consumer segments such as bubbly and Oﬀ The Eaten Path,
amongst some others.
And we've continued to refresh our products with great-tasting ﬂavors and textures
for our convenient foods, while also expanding our presence to satisfy the demand
for energy drinks, which remain a fast-growing and highly proﬁtable category.
Innovating to extend our brands further within beverages and into convenient foods
by targeting new occasions has also been an important facet of our approach.
Within beverages, we've extended our presence in the energy category with our
Mountain Dew brand, while expanding options in the coﬀee category with our
Starbucks partnership. We've also entered a new business venture with The Boston
Beer company to distribute Hard Mountain Dew.
Within convenient foods, we've extended our Doritos franchise into Tacos and our
Cheetos franchise into the popular and convenient Mac 'n Cheese category, while
also innovating with inconvenient meals with Rice-A-Roni and Pasta Roni.
To further strengthen our -- and enhance our portfolio, we've made highly strategic
acquisitions over the last few years, including SodaStream, Rockstar, Be & Cheery,
PopCorners, Muscle Milk, Pioneer Foods and Bayer to expand our opportunities for
growth and advance our capabilities in both developed and developing and
emerging markets.
We entered new business ventures with Beyond Meat to develop producer market,
plant-based protein products, and The Boston Beer Company, as I mentioned earlier.
In addition, we recently completed our divestiture of Tropicana, Naked and other
select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $3.5 billion in pre-tax cash
proceeds and a 39% non-controlling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will
operate across North America and Europe.
The next key facet of our strategy involves becoming a stronger organization by
building advantage capabilities to stay ahead of the evolving consumer marketplace
and set the stage for future growth. For example, we are digitalizing our marketing
and consumer insights eﬀorts to help make our consumer engagement more
eﬀective and eﬃcient and we are simplifying and harmonizing our technology
systems to connect and integrate various components of our global business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-02-23

Page 5 of 9Ultimately, we strive to better leverage technology and data analytics to capture data
at a more granular level and ensure we have the right products in the right location
at the right place or what we refer to as precision at scale.
To address the evolving retail landscape and how we engage with our consumers,
we've continued to invest in building end-to-end advantage omni-channel
capabilities, including ﬂexible manufacturing platforms that can oﬀer customization
and variety and enhancing our transportation and logistics expertise to ensure our
products travel eﬃciently from the plant to the consumer. By building an advantage
backbone to support these initiatives, we've been able to launch and gradually scale
our direct-to-consumer platforms with existing brands and assets such as Gatorade
and SodaStream.
These platforms provide valuable consumer insights and data, which helps us tailor
and enhance our engagement and oﬀerings to the consumer. In 2021, our top 5 e-
commerce markets delivered over $4 billion in estimated retail sales and expect us
to accelerate our presence and build even additional capabilities that would
enhance us to win in the marketplace well into the future.
To help ﬁnd our capability investments, we've identiﬁed opportunities to become a
leaner and more eﬃcient organization and began managing our costs, as if they
were an investment. This is what we refer to as holistic cost management. For
example, we're reducing general and administrative expenses by leveraging
standardization, digitalization, and global business services. We're redesigning
frontline work by utilizing more technology and automation to drive agility and
eﬃciencies, while also creating better jobs. And we're continuously rethinking our
business processes by identifying key areas of waste throughout our value chain and
applying best-in-class benchmarks and solutions to further cut costs. Our eﬀorts will
aim to deliver at least $1 billion in annual productivity savings through 2026.
To further complement and enhance our strategic framework, we introduced pep+,
an end-to-end strategic transformation with sustainability at the center of how we will
create growth and create value. From how we source ingredients to how we make
and sell our products in a more sustainable way to how we inspire consumers
through our iconic brands to make better choices for themselves on the planet. Pep+
is our roadmap for becoming the global leader in beverages and convenient foods
and a leading actor in the transformation of the food system.
Pep+ focuses on three key pillars. The ﬁrst pillar is positive agriculture. We're working
to spread regenerative practices to restore the Earth across land equal to the
company's entire agricultural footprint, which is approximately 7 million acres;
sustainably source key crops and ingredients and improve the livelihoods of more
than 250,000 people in our agricultural supply chain, all by 2030.
The second pillar is positive value chain. We're helping to build a circular and
inclusive value chain with goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, become net
water positive by 2030, cut virgin plastic in our packaging by 50% by 2030, andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-02-23
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 9progress against our more than $570 million investment in our racial equality
journey.
And the third pillar is positive choices. We're continuing to evolve our portfolio of
beverages and convenient food products so that they're better for the planet and for
the people by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing food
products that are better for the planet and are delivered nutritional beneﬁts,
prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins, and whole grains.
Expanding our position in the nuts and seeds category, where we're already the
global branded leader, accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium
using science-based targets across our portfolio and cooking our food oﬀerings with
healthier oils, and continuing to scale new business models that require little or no
single use packaging, including the global SodaStream business, an icon of a
positive choice and the largest sparkling water brand in the world by volume.
Following the implementation of our strategic framework and investments in our
business, our performance and results have meaningfully improved. Our annual
organic revenue growth has accelerated from 2.3% in 2017 to 9.5% in 2021, while our
core constant currency earnings per share growth accelerated to 12% in 2021. And as
you will see on the next few slides, our strong performance is broad based across
key categories, divisions and geographies.
Over the past few years, we've delivered on average mid-single digit organic
revenue growth in North America and high-single digit organic revenue growth in
our international markets, each of which represent a strong acceleration versus
previous years. A key factor behind these results have been our marketplace
execution. We've held or gained share in approximately 80% of our key savory
markets and in approximately 70% of our key beverage markets, including Mexico,
Russia, Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia, and Poland. And within our largest market, the
U.S., we held or gained share in salty and savory snacks and carbonated soft drinks
in 2021.
Our organic revenue growth also accelerated across beverages and convenient
foods with our largest divisions in North America and our international developing
and emerging markets, each delivering meaningful improvements. We believe that
our investments to increase manufacturing capacity fortify our supply chain and
continuous focus on consumer-centric innovation aided our strong results on
marketplace execution.
Our investments in our people and products have also aided our success. We've
invested to achieve a collaborative, inclusive and equitable workplace. As a result,
our employee engagement and conﬁdent surveys have produced very favorable
scores. In addition, we've made good progress in oﬀering positive product choices
to the consumer and we will continue our eﬀorts to oﬀer more choices with lower
added sugar, sodium and saturated fat levels over time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-02-23

Page 7 of 9We're particularly pleased to see our eﬀorts being recognized by our retail partners.
For the sixth consecutive year, PepsiCo received the #1 manufacturer ranking in the
latest Kantar PowerRanking survey, while also ranking #1 in all nine metrics in the
survey over the last ﬁve years. This survey reﬂects our customers' view of PepsiCo as
a valued partner and demonstrates the beneﬁts of investing alongside our
customers to help them drive growth. We also were awarded Best ESG Reporting
and Corporate Governance Team of the Year for large-cap companies at the annual
corporate governance awards for the second year in a row.
In addition, we're named amongst Newsweek America's Most Responsible
Companies in 2021 and we're ranked #1 food, beverage, and tobacco Just Company
by JUST Capital. I hope that you have a better understanding of our strategy and
business performance.
Now, I will spend some time on our future priorities and how we look to create value
for our shareholders over the long term. We remain encouraged about our growth
prospects, as the categories we're competing are large and growing. Speciﬁcally, we
compete in an addressable market that exceeds $1 trillion with our market share
below 10%. So the opportunities for future growth remain vast. And our business
priorities within this large and attractive categories remain consistent with our
framework as we look to become an even faster, even stronger, and even better
organization with pep+ at the center of our strategic transformation.
Speciﬁcally, we look to rationally outpace category growth across our businesses and
channels by expanding the depth and breadth of our products and packages to
capture new consumer occasions within beverages and convenient foods. We will
also look to improve the core operating margin of PepsiCo Beverages North
America by targeting proﬁtable growth occasions that are beneﬁcial to our product
mix and become more eﬃcient with our advertising and marketing spend.
In addition, we will look to drive greater manufacturing, supply chain and
distribution eﬃciencies, while also accelerating our global business solution model
to reduce general and administrative expenses.
We will continue to invest in people and technology and build advantage omni-
channel, data and analytics and consumer insights capabilities, while also making
targeted IT investments to modernize and harmonize our systems. We believe these
investments will yield opportunities for growth and contribute to our target of at
least $1 billion in annual productivity savings through 2026. And we will look to
advance our culture and talent. We have numerous initiatives and investments in
place to achieve an even more collaborative, inclusive and equitable workplace at
which we focus to get things done fast, act like owners with very high levels of
integrity.
Our capital allocation approach fully aligns with the priorities I've laid out.
Speciﬁcally, we'll look to invest appropriately in our business; pay and grow our
annual dividend; selectively consider acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-02-23
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 9meet very strict strategic and ﬁnancial criteria; and repurchase shares while
maintaining ample liquidity and access to top-tier commercial paper.
Our net capital spending as a percentage of net revenue has increased since 2018
with almost half of our capital spending directed towards growth initiatives in 2021.
For example, we've added to and upgraded our ﬂeet of vehicles to fortify our direct
store delivery system. We have a plan to continue to expand our manufacturing
capacity for many of our iconic brands to meet the evolving needs of consumers
when it comes to convenience and packaging. We're accelerating the digitization of
our supply chain. These initiatives look to unlock real-time inventory visibility, split
sourcing and machine learning capabilities in order to minimize complexity in a
rapidly evolving marketplace.
We're continuing to harmonize and simplify our technology systems, which will drive
productivity and help enhance our trade promotional management, forecast
accuracy and ﬁnancial planning.
We have and will continue to allocate the net proceeds from our green bond to
invest in sustainable plastics and packaging, decarbonization of our operations and
supply chain and water sustainability. And we're investing in pep+ which requires
rethinking and re-engineering our approach across our value chain to better serve
our people and the planet. We believe our capital spending investments will better
position PepsiCo to compete and win in the marketplace.
After ensuring that our businesses are well funded, cash dividends will remain a
critical component of our total shareholder return proposition. We have
demonstrated our commitment on this front by announcing our 50th consecutive
annual dividend per share increase, while also repurchasing shares to reduce our
share count.
In conclusion, I hope you have a greater level of conﬁdence in our strategy and our
aspiration to deliver strong organic revenue growth and longer-term value creation.
And I want to emphasize that we remain conﬁdent in delivering against our long-
term objectives, which include a 4% to 6% increase in organic revenue growth,
approximately 20 to 30 basis points of core operating margin expansion and a high-
single digit increase in core constant currency earnings per share growth.
With that, I'd like to conclude this presentation and thank you again for your time
and attention today.
