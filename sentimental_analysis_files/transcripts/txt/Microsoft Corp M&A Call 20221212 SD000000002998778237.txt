Presentation
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to this investor call regarding the
Strategic Partnership Between LSEG and Microsoft that was announced this morning.
(Operator Instructions)
I would like to remind all participants that this call is being recorded.
I will now hand over to the CEO of the London Stock Exchange Group, David
Schwimmer, to open the presentation.
Please go ahead.
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone.
Anna and I are really excited to be here this morning to take your questions on the
partnership we announced this morning with Microsoft.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 2 of 17Judson AlthoﬀThere's no better way to reﬂect that partnership than our being joined here by
Judson Althoﬀ, who is Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Oﬃcer at
Microsoft. Judson has been leading this partnership on their side, and Judson, it is
great to have you here with us. Judson and I will each make some brief introductory
remarks, and then we will open it up to your questions.
So this agreement is transformative for LSEG's business. We've been working for
over a year to put this partnership together with a real focus on both sides to make
this a win-win-win: a win for our customers, a win for Microsoft and a win for LSEG.
It's another signiﬁcant step on our journey towards becoming the leading global
ﬁnancial markets infrastructure and data business, building on the strategy that led
to our acquisition of Reﬁnitiv. We're bringing together LSEG's leading data sets,
analytics and global customer base with (inaudible) trusted cloud services and
global reach to transform workﬂow and the user experience for our customers
across the ﬁnancial markets value chain.
As always, with LSEG, we will remain true to our open access model, making it even
easier for users to access our data and combine it with their own, driving multiple
new use cases and creating attractive revenue growth opportunities for both
companies.
At a high level, our plans comprise four main elements: the migration of our data
platform to Microsoft Azure, allowing much greater ﬂexibility, usability and scalability
than we have today. Number two, an enhanced version of LSEG Workspace with
seamless Teams communication and Microsoft 365 interoperability, including built-in
compliance features for the ﬁrst time. Three, the development of new analytics tools,
combining the best of our data and analytics with Microsoft AI and collaboration
tools. And a 10-year Cloud deal underpinning all of our work together. We've also
agreed to explore the development of digital marketing infrastructure based on
cloud technology, with a goal to transform how market participants interact with
capital markets.
During the build-out phase, we and Microsoft will be investing in the products and
capabilities I've mentioned. This investment, outlined in this morning's release,
reﬂects our continued focus on long-term growth and will enable us to deliver a step
change for our customers rather than small, incremental improvements. I'm also
delighted to welcome Microsoft as a shareholder in LSEG and Scott Guthrie, who
leads Microsoft's Cloud and AI Group, to our Board, subject to certain approvals.
This reﬂects the depth and breadth of the partnership and the level of commitment
both companies have.
Let me turn it over to Judson for a few remarks.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Thank you, David. And let me start oﬀ by saying it's a real pleasure to be able to be
here with you today, and thank you all for listening this morning. We're really excited
at Microsoft about this new strategic partnership with the London Stock ExchangeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 17Group. It has been, as David said, a journey over this last year, coming together in
partnership. And we're really excited about Microsoft's partnership with LSEG across
many, many facets here, and I think it would be great to spend a little bit of time to
dive into some of the things that David said about the characteristics of the
partnership itself.
First and foremost, when we look at the opportunity for Microsoft to help the London
Stock Exchange Group digitally transform their own infrastructure, we're very excited
about bringing the power of the Microsoft Cloud to help lift infrastructure to the
cloud but digitize business processes at the same time, and drive the eﬀectiveness
and eﬃciencies of the globally systemic market infrastructure that LSEG has built at a
world-class scale. So we're very, very excited about the cloud partnership that is
underpinning this relationship.
But we're more excited, quite frankly, about what we can do together for customers
across the ﬁnancial services industry, and there are two key areas here that I think are
worth reﬂecting upon in a little bit more detail.
First of all, with Microsoft Teams, we've been able to really help the entire ﬁnancial
services industry to better collaborate, of course, through the pandemic but into
post-pandemic phase and hybrid work, and we're really excited about the
opportunity to combine the power of LSEG's Workspace technologies with Microsoft
Teams in a never before, seamlessly integrated capacity that provides instantaneous
information to ﬁnancial advisers like never before across the workspace environment
across mobile scenarios, and leveraging AI capabilities to provide the next best
action for ﬁnancial advice into the next generation of solutions for this industry.
The other piece of this really centers around the data and analytics portion that
David mentioned a moment ago. The data is at the source of real -- really, every
single ﬁnancial decision that's made in the world today. However, the current state of
aﬀairs is that most ﬁnancial institutions have silos of data that they have to work
tirelessly to bring together to have insights that are relevant for their customers and
their institutions. By taking the LSEG data sets to the cloud and running them on
Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Azure Synapse in integrated data service, we can
enable ﬁnancial service institutions around the world to mash [ph] up these data
sources and make better decisions more eﬀectively and more eﬃciently than ever
before. So we're very excited about bringing that foundation of data to the world of
ﬁnancial services in integrated capacity and allowing analytic reasoning to occur
instantaneously to make better decisions for all of our customers.
So foundationally, this is a long-term partnership that Microsoft is very excited to be
entering with LSEG. Again, we're very excited about being able to help LSEG
continue to transform digitally, leveraging the power of the Microsoft Cloud, and
then bringing these great new technologies to our customers through the
advancements of Teams and integration with LSEG Workspace and bringing these
data and analytics services capabilities to the cloud.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12

Q - Bruce Hamilton
A - David Schwimmer
A - Anna ManzSo I'll pause there, and David, hand it back to you.
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Thank you, Judson.
And with that, we'll open up the lines to Q&A. So operator, who do we have ﬁrst?
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) We will take our ﬁrst question from Bruce Hamilton from
Morgan Stanley.
{BIO 15118430 <GO>}
A couple of questions from me just to kick oﬀ.
Maybe on the ﬁnancial impact. Can you help us think around those a little bit more?
So the additional costs near term of GBP 250 million to GBP 300 million, maybe a
little more around what is driving that, given you were already on a path to sort of
moving to the cloud? And then perhaps more importantly, can you help us think
about the time line and the quantum of the revenue impact? You talked about a
meaningful uplift, but can you help us think about what services products you have
in mind, what time frame those could come to market, and how else to think about
that improvement versus the 5% to 7% growth you're currently targeting?
And then I had a second question, just -- there's a number of exchanges globally
that are in partnerships with technology partners, CME with Google Cloud; Nasdaq,
AWS. So how is this sort of partnership diﬀerentiated in your view?
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Thanks, Bruce. We'll turn it over to Anna for the ﬁrst one, and then I'm happy to jump
in on the second. And Judson, you may have a view as well about that.
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
So I'll just talk through the ﬁnancial impact. Thanks, Bruce.
I'm going to start with revenue, and we've said that this partnership will meaningfully
accelerate revenue. Although we're going to have a couple of years of product
development, so we won't see that revenue ﬂowing through until 2025. It will be
delivered by selling more of our existing products, accessing white spaces and also
better pricing the broader set of products that we've got.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 17A - David Schwimmer
A - Judson AlthoﬀTo bring that to life a little bit, you've just heard Judson describe what making
Workspace native within the Microsoft 365 that really could look and feel like, that is
going to help us accelerate our trading or banking revenue. But also on top of that, it
allows us to take data analytics much more broadly and access the full suite of Teams
uses potentially with our ﬁnancial data in the future. So that's about selling more.
And then the analytics example, again, that just unpacked. That's about us coming
together with our modeling capabilities and Microsoft's Machine Learning and AI
capabilities to really create some very sophisticated analytics.
And price. As we improve the quality of our products such -- as a whole, that allows
us to be conﬁdent in our price positioning. But also as we move to more
consumption-based pricing, that allows us to better monetize our entire product
portfolio. So feeling good about revenue. It doesn't change our short-term guidance
of 5% to 7%, which of course expires at the end of 2023, but we'll see meaningful
acceleration beyond that.
And in terms of cost, excluding the investment we've been at today, we're on track to
our (inaudible) 50% EBITDA margin at the end of 2023. We've laid out that this will
have a 50% to 100% -- 100 basis point impact on our EBITDA margins over the next
three years, which is frankly quite a modest investment for what is a big opportunity.
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Thank you, Anna.
So to your second question, Bruce, this is a signiﬁcant strategic partnership where
we are building product together and accessing markets together, and we've been
working together for many months now. We have detailed product road maps. The
teams have been spending a lot of time together. So I would really emphasize the
strategic partnership angle here and the fact that we're building and going to
market. Building product and going to market together. Judson, you can share your
view as well.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. I think that's precisely right, David. The real diﬀerentiation here is the co-
innovation and control [ph] that -- over Microsoft and LSEG. And in fact, we had been
working, as David said, over the last several months on preliminary designs and road
maps, and there's been a lot of engineering work across the board to help form
these solutions that we want to take market together.
And so if you think about the diﬀerence fundamentally in this strategic partnership
versus other cloud deals that may exist in the market, it has to -- you have to start
think fundamentally about both LSEG and Microsoft as diﬀerentiated entities
themselves and the power of the two of them coming together. Let me say a little bit
more about that.
Look, LSEG is unique in the market in that they have systemic market infrastructure,
data assets and Workspace technologies that bring data forward to the folks thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12

Q - Andrew Coombs
A - David Schwimmer
A - Judson Althoﬀactually need to make decisions in real time to support their customers. Microsoft, at
the same time, has the most comprehensive and trusted cloud in the industry, with
more pre-integrated assets that enable customers to do more with less. So if you
think about everything that Microsoft does across the cloud, from traditional
productivity capabilities through to hyperscale cloud technologies in serving up data
and artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning capabilities, you combine that together
with LSEG's diﬀerentiated assets. What we can do is not only have data
revolutionized in the cloud for more eﬀective and eﬃcient access or instantaneous
decision-making, but also pull it right through to the hands of people who need to
make those decisions on behalf of their institutions and provide advice back to their
clients.
So if you think about any interaction you may have had with Microsoft Teams,
imagine every data asset within LSEG's portfolio being served up instantaneously
inside of Teams, whether it's in a desktop environment, a mobile environment with
next best action and curated advice, so that we can help the ﬁnancial institutions
around the world to be more nimble in their engagement with clients. Far, far
diﬀerent than simply lifting and shifting assets to the cloud.
The next question is coming from Andrew Coombs from Citi.
{BIO 15301551 <GO>}
Just one question from me, please.
In the Microsoft release, it talks about a $5 billion revenue opportunity, and that's
including the $2.8 billion that LSEG's referenced for cloud-related spend. But I'm
intrigued to where the other $2.2 billion is coming from? And if you could perhaps
elaborate on exactly how the revenue sharing opportunity works with LSEG going
forward?
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Thanks, Andrew. I'll turn it over to Judson in a moment.
Just on the revenue, we will each be compensated for the services that we provide,
so it's not much more complex than that in terms of revenue share. Judson, over to
you.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
So to the incremental revenue opportunity, it comes from precisely where I ended
with my last answer, which is how we'll serve the market together. We think both the
integrated Workspace solutions coming together with Teams and AI-driven next best
action in the ﬁnancial services market is a huge revenue opportunity for both
companies, and LSEG will monetize their assets as Microsoft will monetize hours. The
second piece comes from serving up the data and analytic capability for ﬁnancialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12

Q - Arnaud Giblatinstitutions around the world and commercial institutions around the world that
leverage the same data to make better investment decisions.
Again, just to reiterate, today's market consists of many, many diﬀerent ﬁnancial
services institutions acquiring data from many, many diﬀerent service providers, co-
mingling our own data and trying to rationalize it. And an amazing amount of work
product in terms of human capital, and on-premise compute today is leveraged to
make these data solutions come to life. If you take those assets, bring them to the
cloud, leverage LSEG's data assets and Microsoft's cloud data services, we have the
ability to really sell new solutions to market like never before that allow ﬁnancial
institutions to make better and more eﬀective and eﬃcient decisions than they have
historically. So we see that driving a tremendous amount of upside revenue for both
companies.
So again, you can think of the $2.8 billion as cloud infrastructure that is a part of the
digital transformation that will happen inside of LSEG, but the rest of it will come
from our success in the market together.
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
And Andrew, should I just sort of clarify from the LSEG perspective, so you are clear
which of it works with respect to us.
So $2.8 billion cloud consumption commitment you're aware of, and then really,
there's two other pieces to this. One, we're collectively selling new products. And as
we see those products take oﬀ, we will see incremental revenue and Microsoft will
see incremental cloud consumption. And then on top of that, as Judson just
explained, there is a network eﬀect across ﬁnancial services which drives cloud
consumption across ﬁnancial service customers for Microsoft.
{BIO 15301551 <GO>}
That's clear. I mean, I guess the onus [ph] of my question is would you steer us away
from that $2.2 billion number? Is there a read across to the revenue appetite
potential for LSEG?
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
That's exactly what I'm doing. An element is relevant to the revenue upside potential
for LSEG and comes with that revenue coming, and the other fees comes from
broader network eﬀect across ﬁnancial services.
The next question is coming from Arnaud Giblat from BNPP Exane.
{BIO 15145619 <GO>}
Could I please ask for a clariﬁcation?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 17A - David Schwimmer
A - Anna Manz
A - David Schwimmer
A - Judson AlthoﬀIf I heard well the answer to Bruce's question on the revenue -- the incremental
upside. Is that coming after '23 or '25, I think?
And I've got two other questions. Could you talk a bit about the exclusivity of the
partnership? I mean, is -- what terms of the agreement are tied exclusively to LSEG,
or is Microsoft open to entering any other partnerships?
And also, I was wondering if you could give us maybe some concrete examples of
how a user who (inaudible) on Workspace, what sort of improvements he might
experience? Just to get a better feel as to how it's going on the platform client
perspective?
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks, Arnaud.
Want to touch on the revenue question?
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
Yes.
Just to clarify on the revenue, the revenue upside associated with this partnership in
our number's from 2025 onwards.
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Okay.
And then just -- we -- a couple of thoughts on your second question about the
partnership. This is a long-term strategic partnership where we will be investing
together to build products together. And I think there will be our IP in that and
Microsoft's IP in that, and we look forward to building on that together. We will
continue to work with other cloud providers. And Microsoft, I'll let Judson talk about
this, but Microsoft will continue to work with other market participants.
And -- anything you want to add to that?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Look, Microsoft and LSEG are both open in companies, so this is not a signal that
somehow we'll not work with other like entities. And what we're really focused on
here though is just what we're building together. We're really excited about the
unique capability we'll be able to bring to life with LSEG's Workspace technologies
and Microsoft Teams, as well as all of the data services that we can bring to life on
Microsoft Cloud.
Maybe that ﬂows into the question about some of the scenarios, and how do you
think it's diﬀerent than it is today. So you've all sat on video calls, one or two over theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12

Q - Philip Middleton
A - David Schwimmerlast three years. And whether you've used Zoom or whether you've used Microsoft
Teams, you -- most likely, you know how to switch in between your voice, video and
chat environment and your systems of record. You've probably had to pull up
research notes. You've probably had to pull up shared documents, and perhaps
even bring in other people into the conversation to help convey whatever it is you
were trying to discuss.
And so to translate that into the world of trying to provide ﬁnancial advice in real-
time markets instantaneously, what we can do through this integration is eﬀectively
bring all the LSEG Workspace data to life in integrated capacity with Microsoft
Teams. All in one screen, one canvas. So the 360-degree view of your clients, all of
the ﬁnancial trading data that you need to support (inaudible), the next best action,
to the extent that calls would be recorded as permissible by the client. You can even
do sentiment analysis to gauge your rate of eﬀectiveness, whether that be to
improve your outbound sales and marketing techniques or just from a listening
perspective and being able to better serve clients.
So it's all revolutionized, the way in which ﬁnancial advisers to provide advice to their
clients. And you'll be able to do it not just in a compliant Workspace environment,
but also through mobile technologies in an omnichannel engagement scenario. So
we're really excited about this.
The next question is coming from Philip Middleton from Bank of America.
{BIO 3021993 <GO>}
Two questions.
Firstly, you've already talked about moving about some double running costs in your
IT, which is supposed to be running oﬀ in 2023. Does this aﬀect that at all? Because
you are already investing in the cloud as you said, so how does what you've
announced here interact with the guidance you've already given?
And secondly, you've been quite compelling about the attractions of this in
Workspace, but could you talk a little bit more about the opportunity on this outside
Workspace, particularly in the wholesale data maybe? Because it seems to me
there's a huge amount you can do here as well in terms of data integration, AI and all
that kind of thing, and that also ought to be a big opportunity for you? Are you
looking at that as well?
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Thanks, Philip.
Anna, you want to touch on the ﬁrst question? I'll take the second one.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 17A - Anna Manz
A - David Schwimmer
A - Judson Althoﬀ
Q - Philip Middleton{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
Yes. So you're right. We've already been on a journey to the cloud for the last three
years and we have seen a journey to the cloud as we looked forward, and therefore,
all of the costs associated with our journey to the cloud are included in our current
guidance. We've announced an incremental investment today that is associated with
the investment in the initiatives you've heard David and Judson describe.
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
And Philip, you're right on the second question as well, where we've been spending
a little bit of time on the call so far talking about the integration of Workspace and
Teams and other Microsoft collaboration tools. In many ways because, as you know,
we get a lot of questions about Workspace, and that is very tangible for a lot of our
investors but also our users.
But you're absolutely right, there's a signiﬁcant opportunity here in terms of our data
platform and there's a signiﬁcant opportunity here in terms of the initiative we have
working together on analytics and modeling, where we will be providing signiﬁcant
new capabilities for ﬁnancial market participants to access our data, our analytics
capabilities, our modeling capabilities in a Microsoft environment using a number of
diﬀerent Microsoft tools. Judson can talk about it if that's helpful, but signiﬁcant
opportunity well beyond the Workspace opportunity.
I'll turn it over to Judson.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. Look, Anna used a term that I think is really important to understand here a
moment ago when she said there's a network eﬀect. When it comes to data, as you
well know, look, ﬁnancial services institutions around the world acquire data from
internet sources. Today, it tends to sit on proprietary infrastructure that is extremely
heterogeneous. And so it leaves the technology staﬀ, the IT organization, the group
with a responsibility of trying to bringing together a seamless understanding in an
analytic product from many, many data sources, including mashing up their own
resources.
By taking that to cloud, by leveraging the Microsoft Azure Synapse capability, we can
hydrate data sources with LSEG data being the foundation. And being able to have
that network eﬀect or data gravity, if you will, bringing together more data to
rationalize more eﬀectively over the complete corpus of a given ﬁnancial problem or
opportunity state and provide better answers more eﬀectively and more eﬃciently
than ever before. You can think about it as simply as no system can be any more
intelligent than the data over which it reasons [ph]. So if we can create a data gravity
and a network eﬀect around the LSEG data, we can help people reason over more
eﬀectively than ever before.

Q - Enrico Bolzoni
A - David SchwimmerOkay. And the revenue upside partly comes from that enabling people to reason
over, which means enabling people to use it more and enabling them to use your
joint services, presumably?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Correct.
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
The joint services and increase our own cloud consumption.
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Yes.
The next question is coming from Enrico Bolzoni from JPMorgan.
{BIO 19966397 <GO>}
So my ﬁrst question is I just wanted to ask, within your data division and the various
subdivisions within that, which of these lines you expect will beneﬁt the most from
the partnership in terms of acceleration of growth? So that's my ﬁrst question.
My second question is on EBITDA margin beyond 2025. What is your expectation
from this agreement? And you talked a lot about clearly integration and moving to
the cloud and the help that Microsoft can give you there. What can we expect in
terms of cost synergies? Is there a potential scope for actually reducing costs more
than what you disclosed in the past?
And then ﬁnally, I just wanted to ask. Would this deal agreement change at all the
London Stock Exchange Group M&A activity in terms of a slowdown maybe in the
number of deals you do every year, or things pretty much would remain unchanged?
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Thanks, Enrico. I'll turn over your second question over to Anna in just a minute, I'll
take your ﬁrst and third.
So the businesses with MD&A where the strategic partnership and the initiatives that
we've been working on with Microsoft, our most relevant are for enterprise data,
wealth solutions and trading and banking solutions.
And then with respect to your third question. LSEG will -- so ﬁrst of all, we're in very
good shape in terms of the Reﬁnitiv integration. We've made great progress there,
and this builds on top of that. You've seen that we've done a number of transactions
this past year, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities. And if they make sense
from a strategic and ﬁnancial perspective, then we certainly have the capability to doFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12

Q - Johannes Thormann
A - David Schwimmerthat. And as I said, we'll continue to focus on the Reﬁnitiv integration process and the
transformation that we have that will be driven by this partnership with Microsoft.
So Anna, over to you.
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
Yes. So the cost eﬃciencies associated with moving to the cloud, we already foresee
that we've been on a journey to move into the cloud for a number of years now, so
they're within our existing guidance.
To be speciﬁc of our EBITDA margin, as I said, we -- prior to this announcement, have
guided to an exit rate of more than 50% EBITDA margin at the end of 2023. We're
conﬁdent of delivering that, and then we've describe the investment of 50 to 100
basis points that comes with this exciting opportunity that we've described today.
And I guess I would characterize everything you've heard today as part of our
journey to a more scalable division in data and analytics over the medium term.
The next question is coming from Johannes Thormann from HSBC.
{BIO 3397505 <GO>}
Johannes Thormann, HSBC. Some questions from my side as well.
First of all, just on the beneﬁt for the Data & Analytics division, you mentioned
enterprise data and then trading and banking. In the midterm, would this accelerate
growth by a high single-digit percentage or rather also in some years by double-
digit percentage?
And secondly, do we see any spillover eﬀects into your other businesses from this
deal for capital markets revenues or for proposed rate revenues?
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Thanks, Johannes.
We're not going to give any more speciﬁcity around revenue opportunity. I would
just refer to the meaningful revenue growth that we expect from this. Anna has
talked already about the time frame.
And then in terms of similar eﬀects for other parts of the business, I think over time,
there are likely to be signiﬁcant beneﬁts for the overall business. We've talked with
you all in the past about how we are harnessing all the diﬀerent parts of LSEG,
bringing them together, and getting the beneﬁt of the broader ecosystem. And I
should also mention that as we touched on in the release, we are working -- going to
be working with Microsoft on digital markets infrastructure. And although this is aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12

A - Anna Manzlittle more exploratory at this phase, has some very interesting potential in terms of
what that could mean for capital markets.
{BIO 3397505 <GO>}
Could you -- but meaningful is a very unspeciﬁc term, if I may say so, because it's all
about headwinds on costs now and tailwinds on revenues in some years' time, and
then the discount factor is increased with rising rates. So a bit more speciﬁc help on
modeling would be appreciated.
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
So as I said to you, we will see that revenue growth come for 2025 onwards.
Now I will try to give you clarity over the next few years, the next couple of years,
then you can model that. And it's a little bit hard to guide today so far out, but what
you will hear us do is we come back at subsequent -- a full year and then onwards.
We will, of course, be revisiting our guidance because our current guidance is
through to the end of 2023. So we will give you more clarity over time, but we're not
going to go further today.
The next question is coming from Ian White from Autonomous Research.
{BIO 15068031 <GO>}
I had just two additional questions, please.
Firstly, is there any granularity that you could provide to help us think about the
revenue upside opportunity for LSEG? I get that you don't want to put through
speciﬁc numbers on that upside, but I guess, are you assuming ultimately that you'll
displace competitors and take to increase market share? Is the assumption that
you're going to develop these sort of new products and tools as you've described,
and therefore, your existing clients should pay a lot more for the service? Is it that
you think you can access new markets? Are you able to maybe provide some more
granular thoughts around that, please?
And just secondly, can you just demarcate for us how this agreement diﬀers from the
previous partnership, I think, that Reﬁnitiv had already entered into with Microsoft in
2020? Kind of what speciﬁcally is kind of new here versus the previous agreement,
please?
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Sure. Anna, you want to take the ﬁrst one? And I'm happy to touch on the second
one.

Page 14 of 17A - David SchwimmerYes. And feel free to build. So maybe just to sort of unpack some of the drivers of
revenue growth. So absolutely, there's market share gain, and I'll give you some
examples of each of them in a minute. The ability to reach a broader customer set,
there is some white space and there is pricing.
So let's start with Workspace. You've heard Judson describe a really diﬀerent
experience. You're not moving in and out of screens. You've got all of your data and
analytics in one place where you are working in an integrated workﬂow with external
communication with the partners that you need to be working with. That is a step
change in the product oﬀering versus where we are today, and that should allow us
to gain share and give us better pricing power.
In addition, we've talked about the huge global reach of Teams. If we can oﬀer data
and analytics to other user groups across that global region, we will be accessing
new (inaudible) versus the customers that we are accessing today. So that's what I
expect, and you can see the growth of that.
Now analytics, you heard the product description that Judson gave. This is a white
space. We've got some fabulous models. But if you put that together with the cloud,
with Machine Learning and AI, you can create models that -- some really
sophisticated analytics that are not in the market today, and will better help our
customers make decisions and make decisions also including their own data as they
look at various scenarios. So that is a really interesting area, one of which is your
appetite for in the market.
And then certainly, taking our data oﬀering to the next level such that we cannot just
provide a -- our data oﬀering, but as you heard Judson describe, allow integration of
our customers' data in there in a more meaningful way, again, will drive further
revenue beyond just the improved accessibility of our own data platform. And
improving the accessibility of our own data and data platform will help us better
monetize it and better achieve [ph] pricing, so that maybe gives you some sense of
the levers over time.
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
And to your second question, Ian. A couple -- you're referring to an announcement
made a couple of years ago in a partnership a couple of years ago around a single
product. That's a great product, but a single product. And this is a completely
diﬀerent category where we are building substantial new products together on an
entirely diﬀerent scale from what that announcement was a couple of years ago. We
will be investing together. We will be designing products together. We will be going
to market together. And as part of this, in terms of alignment of incentives, the long-
term commitment.
I mentioned earlier, Scott Guthrie will be joining our Board. Microsoft is taking a
signiﬁcant minority stake in LSEG, so just an entirely diﬀerent category here in terms
of the level of collaboration going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12

Okay. I wondered if -- would you be prepared to oﬀer sort of a broad indication on
the revenue upside of how much depends on sort of growing your share in the
existing market versus how much could be achieved from sort of accessing new
markets or essentially sort of growing the overall pie even in broad terms? Kind of
how much of the upside comes from those sort of two portions, please?
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
I think we'll deliver value from revenue in a diﬀerent order. So actually, what I've
given you is sort of temporal ﬂow. Tackling workspace is something we can do more
quickly than some of those other areas that we will be building towards. I'm not
going to share breakdowns at this point, but you can see how we will build our
product sequentially, and revenue will grow as we build out where we are.
The next question is coming from Ben Bathurst from RBC CM.
{BIO 17516248 <GO>}
I've got two questions, please. Firstly, as part of the partnership, you committed to
$2.3 billion in cloud spend with Microsoft over the next 10 years. I just wondered if
you could give an indication how much you've been spending annually historically
on cloud-related spend, and maybe a clue as to what proportion of that has been
with Microsoft?
And then just secondly, on the Microsoft investment. Is the right read of this that by
granting the waiver to '24 and '25 lockups, that this investment eﬀectively increases
the potential quantum of sell-downs from the Reﬁnitiv shareholders between now
and the end of Jan 2024?
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
Thanks, Ben. Do you want to take the ﬁrst question? I'll take the second.
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
Yes. So the way to think about this, the two -- we -- as I've said before, we've been on
a journey to the cloud for a number of years with multiple cloud providers, and so
we have signiﬁcant cloud spend already where we sit today. The way to think about
that $2.3 billion is it was always foreseen in our journey to the cloud, and taken on
average over that period is a single-digit proportion of our overall cost base. So I
would say to very much keep it in that proportion.
{BIO 2014277 <GO>}
And Ben, on your second question, we have signiﬁcantly reduced the overhang here
through the transfer from the Blackstone Consortium to Microsoft. We're thrilled toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-12

The next question is coming from Philip Middleton from Bank of America.
{BIO 3021993 <GO>}
Sorry, just a quick follow-up. Given you're not going to tell me what to put in my
revenue number for FY '25, I wondered if you could slightly de-confuse me on your
revenue margin, please? Is your guidance exit velocity of 50% before this deal or
even including the margin dilution, which understandably this deal will bring about?
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
So -- sorry. Let me de-confuse you on the EBITDA margin.
{BIO 3021993 <GO>}
If you can manage that, but.
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
It's early on a Monday morning. I'll do my best. Prior to announcing today, we've
given very precise guidance around a 50% EBITDA exit margin at the end of 2023.
What we're saying today is the impact of the investment will decrease our EBITDA
margin by 50 to 100 basis points in 2023. So we will reduce our previous guidance
to that.
{BIO 3021993 <GO>}
Okay, so reduced of the previous guidance. So it's now 49% and a bit percent,
EBITDA velocity at the end?
{BIO 18054882 <GO>}
Yes. That's the way to think about it.
There are no further questions on the conference line.
I will now hand over to the management for closing remarks.
