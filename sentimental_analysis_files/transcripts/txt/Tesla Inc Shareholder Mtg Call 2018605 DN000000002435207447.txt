Hey, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We're glad
you could join us today. My name is Todd Maron, and I'm Tesla's General Counsel
and Corporate Secretary. Following the formal part of the meeting, I'll be introducing
Tesla's Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Elon Musk, to the stage. In addition, I'd also
like to introduce several other people we have here from Tesla today. In the front
row, we have our Board of Directors. We have our CEO (sic - CFO), Deepak Ahuja;
and Martin Viecha from our Investor Relations team. We also have several other
members of our management team. We have Larry Westall and David Humphries
from PwC, Tesla's Independent Auditor.
There are going to be two parts to today's meeting. First, the formal part of the
meeting, also known as the very boring part, that will cover the four items that
stockholders have been asked to vote on today. After the voting, Elon will answer
questions about Tesla both from those that were submitted on Twitter before this
meeting and from those in attendance today.
Okay. Let's get started by calling the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to order.
Please refer to the agenda and rules of the meeting that were provided to you today.
The time is now 2:36 PM, and I declare that the polls are now open. We have already
received, over the past few weeks, voting proxies from our stockholders, meaning
that almost all of the votes that will be counted were already submitted before this
meeting. However, as I mentioned earlier, if you wish to submit a ballot to vote your
shares or change your prior vote, you can do so today by picking up a ballot at theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05

Todd Marontable in the corner and handing it to Lisa Brenton from Computershare. Lisa, if you
could just raise your hand one more time, there she is.
Tesla's Board of Directors has appointed Lisa of Computershare to serve as the
Inspector of Election for this meeting. Lisa has taken and signed an oath as Inspector
of Election. Computershare has certiﬁed that starting on April 26, 2018, the proxy
materials are a notice of Internet, availability of the proxy materials were mailed or
provided to all Tesla stockholders of record as of April 12, 2018. We have a majority
of the outstanding shares represented today. So I declare that there is a quorum
present and then we may proceed with the meeting. The items on the agenda are as
follows.
Number one, the election of three Class II directors Antonio Gracias, James Murdoch
and Kimbal Musk to serve for a term of three years or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualiﬁed. Number two, to ratify the appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers as Tesla's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm
for the ﬁscal year ending December 31, 2018. Tesla's Board has recommended that
our stockholders vote for each of the director nominees and for the ratiﬁcation of the
appointment of our accounting ﬁrm. I know we have one stockholder today, who
would like to make a brief comment on the director proposal and now would be the
time to do so.
{BIO 5905726 <GO>}
Thank you, Phil. Thank you, Todd. My name is Steve Diamond, I represent the CtW
Investment Group shareholders in Tesla, who work with union-sponsored pension
funds, which are also shareholders in Tesla. For several years, we have engaged with
Tesla about our corporate governance concerns. We want to see Tesla succeed in
providing energy eﬃcient transportation and generating sustainable high skill, high
wage industrial employment, but the current Board is an obstacle, not an aid to
these goals. We urge shareholders to vote no to the re-election of Mr. Gracias; Mr.
Musk; and Mr. Murdoch. We do not think these individuals are credible, independent
voice for shareholders. Their lack of signiﬁcant auto industry experience and human
capital management experience are only their most obvious deﬁcits. We are also
concerned about whether these highly paid directors can help the CEO focus on
solving the serious ﬁnancial, production and labor relations problems now facing
Tesla.
Before we vote today, we believe it is important that each of these candidates
personally explain to us how they can contribute to ﬁnding solutions to these
problems. Thank you.
{BIO 18879554 <GO>}
Thanks. Obviously, we've put forward a diﬀerent presentation in our proxy and the
Board recommends that the shareholders vote for the election of each of the
directors. We also received two stockholder proposals as described in our proxy
statement. The ﬁrst proposal is to require that the Chair of the Board of Directors be
an independent director. Our Board has recommended that our stockholders voteFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05

Todd Maron
James McRitchieagainst this stockholder proposal. That proposal was proposed by Mr. Jing Zhao,
who is here to present this proposal today. Mr. Zhao.
{BIO 15003234 <GO>}
Is that Okay. Hi -- hi good afternoon. There is no need to repeat the content of the
proposal. I think that you can read it. I don't want to spend too much time, and I just
want to point it out. First, the opposition statement, number is a little misleading. In
fact, only 49% S&P 500 combined, CEO and the Chairman (inaudible). And the
second, as just actually as the gentleman pointed out, our Board is not fully
independent. For example, our lead director is not fully independent and some
Board Members are not independent. So combined these factors and the other
factors are listed in my proposal, it's the time for all to change course to have an
independent Chairman. Thank you very much.
{BIO 18879554 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks. Finally, we received one last stockholder proposal regarding proxy
access, which is also described in our proxy statement and our Board has
recommended that our stockholders vote against that proposal as well. This
proposal is being presented by Mr. James McRitchie. Go ahead, Mr. McRitchie.
{BIO 5114010 <GO>}
Tesla shooting for the moon and beyond, and we love it, but shouldn't we have a
little insurance. A cost beneﬁt analysis by CFA Institute found proxy access would
beneﬁt both the markets and corporate boardrooms with little cost or disruption
raising US market capitalization by a 140 billion, in other words, a vote in favor of this
proposal is likely to raise the value of our stock. Two of our directors hold no stock in
our company. Why do they have such a little conﬁdence? Proxy advisor, Institutional
Shareholder Services considers three of our directors to be not to be independent.
Whatever you think of our current Board, it's not good to have just a little insurance
in the time of crisis and I don't just mean our ongoing production crisis. We could
place two nominees on the proxy without going through an expensive proxy contest
based on the -- my proposal, any group putting forth nominees would have to have
held 1.5 billion in Tesla stock continuously for three years between 2015 and 2017,
and I have a total of 206 proxy access proposals were voted, average support
exceeded 53%, more than 60% of S&P 500 companies have adopted proxy access.
In its statement of opposition, the Board points to a lack of safeguards, such as the
ability of investors to use proxy access, even if they have lent out shares, hold a short
position or intend a change of control. However, this proposal simply oﬀers advice to
the Board subject to a 500 word limit. The Board is free to adopt proxy access by law
that includes restrictions on the use of proxy access, just as every other adopting
company has done.
Furthermore, the ability to include a Director nominee and the company's proxy
does not guarantee election, even if "special interest" shareholder were to be placed
on the ballot that nominee would still need to win broad support to be elected. KeepFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05

Elon Muskin mind that current oﬃcers and directors, who presumably would vote against any
such nominee own nearly 25% of outstanding shares. No shareholder nominee
would win without the support of our largest investors, such as Fidelity, T. Rowe Price,
Baillie Giﬀord, Tencent, Vanguard and BlackRock. Vote for proxy access, item number
four, vote for insurance. Thank you.
{BIO 18879554 <GO>}
Okay. Thank you, Mr. McRitchie. Before we conclude, are there any proxies remaining
in the audience that have not been submitted. This would be the time. I see one
here. Keep them up high and we'll have people come by and grab them from you.
Anyone else? One up here. Last call. Okay. All right. I declare that the polls are now
closed. Based on the proxies that we've received before the meeting, I can
announce that our shareholders approve the recommendations of the Tesla Board of
Directors on all four agenda items and they did so by a wide margin. Each of the
items passed in line with the recommendations by more than a super majority vote.
We will formally announce the results of the voting by ﬁling a Form 8-K within four
business days of today's meeting.
That concludes the oﬃcial business of today's meeting, also known as the boring
part, which is now adjourned. I welcome you to now stay for the Q&A session and
Elon's presentation. In addition to taking questions from the audience, Elon will
answer questions that you have and that you submitted on Twitter before the
meeting.
During the course of the Q&A session, we may discuss our business outlook and
make other forward-looking statements, such statements are predictions based on
our current expectations. Actual events or results could diﬀer materially due to a
number of risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in our most recent Form
10-Q ﬁled with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements represent our views as of
today, should not be relied on thereafter and we disclaim any obligation to update
them after today.
With that, please welcome Elon Musk.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Welcome. Welcome. I love you guys too. All right. I think we've got quite a lot of
good news to talk about and look forward to sharing that with you and then taking
questions from the audience. And yeah, I'm just really proud of the Tesla team for
accomplishing so much against incredible headwinds, and I just like to express a
note of appreciation for all of our customers, who bought our cars. Thank you for
buying our product. We're doing everything we can to make it as good as possible,
as fast as possible. I think, I like -- this is going to sound maybe little cheesy, but at
Tesla we build our cars with love, like we really care.
I think -- at a lot of other companies, they are built by like the marketing department
and the ﬁnance department and it's -- there is no soul. So like we're not perfect, butFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 5 of 21we pour our heart and soul into the product we really care. So and the dedication of
the Tesla team has been incredible and people have -- they've really been working
incredibly hard to make the cars. It's very diﬃcult to become a mass manufacturing
car company, no one has succeeded in doing this in a very long time in the United
States, and even the ones that have -- only Ford is -- Ford is the only one that hasn't
gone bankrupt. So it's super diﬃcult.
So in fact, yeah, in the history of the American Auto Industry, it's always worth
bearing in mind that only two have not gone bankrupt and that's Ford and Tesla. So
it's insanely hard just staying alive. So just want to be clear, it's really diﬃcult. And
we've had people at Tesla, who've sort of worked like 60 days straight. It's like we
basically forced them to go home, like you got to go home and you are going to
keel over and then snuck [ph] back in work, like, dammit, we said go home. So but
the net result is despite a lot of diﬃculties, all lines -- all parts of the monthly
production system have demonstrated a 500-car per day capability or a 3,500-car
per week capability. So -- and -- and then we -- we just did a big set of upgrades and
we're spooling up the production lines again, and I think it's more -- it's quite likely
that we will achieve a 5,000-car a week by the end of this month.
It's like, this is like, I will tell you, the most excruciating hellish several months I have
maybe ever had and lot of other people at Tesla, but I think we're getting there. The -
- we're doing well in market share. The blue line is the Tesla Model 3. We just
became in May the best selling mid-sized premium sedan in the United States of any
kind. So that's of any kind, so not just, so it's beating all internal combustion engine
cars, not just battery or hybrid or anything like that. And that's despite the fact that
we still oﬀer only one version of the car and we don't -- all wheel drive is coming out
next month and -- and then we'll have the lower cost -- the shorter range battery and
lower cost car at around the end of this year, is the one we are expecting to do it.
So we've also made huge progress in the reliability of the car. So in the beginning it
was a bit bumpy and now as deliveries have risen, the quality and reliability of the
car has improved dramatically. So it's improved by a factor of maybe four or ﬁve
since started production, and we're working on making that even better. Employee
safety is a big deal for us. It's -- it's always tougher to achieve safety when you are
building a new manufacturing line. So if you've got a manufacturing line that's in
steady state, then you've got an opportunity to iron out the processes and make it a
lot easier to build the car. As you're ﬁguring things out, it takes a while to get there.
So thus far, in 2018, our average industries -- our injuries per person are 6% below
the industry average, which is great because last year, we are a little bit above and
now we are little bit below, and then -- and that trend is continuing downward. So I
think we've got a shot at being maybe half the injuries per person of the auto
industry and that's the goal we're striving for us to be half the injuries per person.
When you're building cars and you've got a huge number of peoples, it's impossible
to be zero. We wish it could be zero, but we think being twice as good as the
average in the auto industry is a very achievable number and that's what we're
working hard to achieve. It's worth noting that when the injuries, the vast majority of
injuries are repetitive stress injuries. So like back strain or restrain by far the mostFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 6 of 21common thing. So then the way to address that is with better tooling and ﬁxtures
and rotating people through diﬀerent roles, so they're not always doing the same
action and it's also boring to do the same action over and over again.
So we're making good progress on that. And it's also worth noting even our current
injury rate is half that of what it was when Toyota and GM were operating the plant.
So that's often lost in a lot of the media articles. So if we achieve our goal, we will be
a quarter of the injuries of when it wasn't any. So this is very -- what I really want to
emphasize it's a super important thing to me because we, obviously owe a great
debt to the people, who are building the car, I really care about this issue. So --
And Supercharger expansion is going, going really well. We're almost over 10,000
Superchargers worldwide. And our goal is to -- to be able to go almost anywhere on
earth using the Tesla Supercharger system. We're very excited about the next
generation Supercharger that is -- it's mostly ﬁnished in design and will go into
production, hopefully around end of this year. So Supercharger Generation III will be
a -- quite a dramatic improvement. But we want to save that announcement for when
it took place, which is hopefully later this year. And then once we have that system in
place, then we're going to accelerate the Supercharger expansion even more.
So we've managed to do now a gigawatt hour of energy storage deployment
worldwide. This is all the way through from the Reign of Ramses II of Egypt through
today. So it's very impressive period of time. And in -- in less than a year from now,
we will do another gigawatt. So that's -- it's pretty massive. Yeah. So the rate of
stationary storage deployment is going to grow exponentially. I mean, it's really -- I
think for many years to come, the -- each incremental year will be about as much as
all of the preceding years, which is a crazy, crazy growth rate, and it's also sort of
production limited thing. We would actually be able to do more if we could produce
more and we are producing a lot of batteries. So in fact, next quarter at the
Gigafactory, we expect to make more battery capacity than all other EVs combined
worldwide, including China.
So I mean is this is a really crazy amount of batteries. It's -- it was one factory is
making -- will make more than all the other batteries on earth, I think really deserving
that Gigafactory sort of title. It's really, really nutty. We are going to try have like
maybe, when things got calm down a bit, like have more tours available for Giga
because it's like epic. Yeah, it's like a two -- at least two hours to walk -- just to walk
through all of the parts of Giga at this point, just to walk through everything, it takes
two hours, like if you don't pause a lot. It's like good exercise. So that's -- yeah, pretty
well.
We have our ﬁrst really -- we've actually have a bunch of non-Tesla employee solar
roof customers and the response has been very positive that that whole roof is solar,
and it just looks normal, in fact, it looks better than the roof that was there. So I have
and I have it on a house that I -- the little house across the road that used to be
owned by Gene Wilder, it's sort of like Willy Wonka House. And I was like trying to
ﬁgure out how to -- how to go solo with that, kind of running the Gene WilderFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 7 of 21Aesthetic, which is I really like. So but I was able to put these on Gene Wilder's old
house and it still looks it look like, it still has the same character, which is great.
And it's -- we're spending a lot of time just validating the solar roof because they
need to last at least 30 years ideally longer and there's only so much accelerate --
accelerated life testing that you can do on a roof. So before we can deploy it to a
large number of houses, we need to make sure that -- that all elements of the roof
are going to last for at least three decades and ideally sort of half a century or more,
but this is going to be a very big product. So -- and also it's going to grow
exponentially. Yeah. And I think you kind of want to have a thing where if you look
around the neighborhood, having solar actually made the -- improved the aesthetics
and feel of the neighborhood. I think that's a really big deal.
We are not far from Q3 and I'm -- actually my CFO and General Counsel like, you
have to watch what words you use in these situations. But I think we -- it's really
looking like we're going to have positive GAAP net income next quarter, and as well
as positive cash ﬂow in Q3 and Q4. And we -- as I've said before, do not expect to
need to raise any incremental debt or equity.
Here we've got some exciting products in the works. The Model Y is really going to
be something super special. We're aiming to unveil Model Y approximately March
next year and then go into production about -- maybe around two years from now,
maybe a little less than two years, but basically ﬁrst half of 2020 for production
Model Y. Something similar for Semi and Roadster.. So these products are shaping
up. I think there are -- Semi and Roadster are actually going to be even better than
what was unveiled. We ﬁgured out ways to improve the range and overall
functionality of the Semi, in particular.
The Roadster, we -- what I unveiled with the Roadster was the base model
performance that's -- it's going to have a SpaceX option package. It's crazy. And I
think it's important for us to show with the Roadster that an electric vehicle can
outperform a gasoline car in every way, so that -- because gasoline car still have sort
of a halo eﬀect. And I think if we can show an electric car can outperform gasoline
car in every way, then we sort of get rid of that halo eﬀect of gasoline cars and I think
that's quite a powerful thing conceptually for the general public.
So these are just some questions that we got on Twitter. I guess some -- it's a really
insightful questions on Twitter, as well as some strange ones. But -- yeah so one of
the ﬁrst questions is in -- from Model 3 production line. As I said before, we're really
going to focus on manufacturing technology for Tesla, and we've made a lot of
mistakes with Model 3 production that -- but we've recognized those mistakes and
we're conﬁdent we know how to address them, in fact, we are addressing them. And
long term, I think the biggest competitive strength of Tesla is going to be
manufacturing. This is -- this is sort of counter-intuitive, but it is -- it's going to be
quite dramatic, I think.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05

Page 8 of 21Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Elon MuskThe approach to automation that we are taking, I think at some cases has worked
and some cases has not, but it's clear that there are some elements of production,
which are really well suited to people doing it and some parts production that are
really well suited to robotics. And one of the biggest mistakes we've made was
trying to automate things that are super easy for person to do, but super hard for
robot to do. And when you see it, it looks super dumb, you are like well, why do we
do that?
So -- and then, as you -- it sort of makes sense to have start oﬀ with initial production
line, which is -- has a relative bias towards people and then you automate the parts
of the production system that are the most painful and diﬃcult for people to do. So
particularly ones that result in repetitive stress injuries or mechanically diﬃcult, that's
really a much better approach and that's -- that's what we're going to do for
(inaudible) factories I and II, it's a much more sensible way to do things.
See, well, let me actually have Tesla, some [ph] Tesla executive team come up, Guys,
you want to come up and hangout. So Jamie [ph], do you want to talk about the
battery car stuﬀ?
Sure. So it's diﬃcult for us to talk about speciﬁc cost numbers that's always a diﬃcult
topic, but we are still very conﬁdent that we have the best price and performance of
anything out there in the world. If there's something better, I don't know about it,
and we've looked as hard as we possibly can. We try and talk to every single battery
start-up, every lab, every large manufacturer, we get quotes from them, we test cells
from them. So if there's something better, we're all the years, we'd love to ﬁnd it, but
we haven't found it yet. So generally yeah, we're still pretty conﬁdent about that
same direction.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, we think at the cell level probably we can do better than $100 per
kilowatt-hour maybe later this year depending upon what on commodity prices. If
commodity prices are roughly, where they are today, then we'll probably do better
than $100 kilowatt hour at the cell level. And then, with further improvements to the
cell chemistry and the production process and more vertical aggression on the cell
side, for example, integrating the production of cathode and anode materials at the
Gigafactory, and then, an approved design of the module and pack, we think long-
term we can get below $100 kilowatt hour at the pack level, which is really the key
ﬁgure of merit for a car. But long-term meaning, deﬁnitely less than two years, that's
Tesla long-term.
Anything, I mean -- yeah, we think -- we think we've come up with some pretty cool
breakthroughs on this front on energy density and cost of the battery pack, and
yeah, I think it's going to be pretty great, as far as I can see. Yeah. Cool.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05

Page 9 of 21Robyn Denholm
Elon MuskWhen will the Gigafactory be completely built? I think we'll keep building on the
Gigafactory for at least four years or ﬁve years. It will be by far the biggest building in
the world. It's not that far from being the biggest building in the world already and
based on the plants that we know, it might be as -- it might be twice as big as the
next building in the world. Hence the interesting tour. So it's yeah -- yeah it's about a
third done right now. And yeah, so it's really, really, really enormous, and I think it's
going quite well. There will be more Gigafactories in the future. I think we're close to
announcing a combined vehicle and battery factories.
So future Gigafactories will include vehicle and battery pack and powertrain as a
single integrated unit. And we're close to announcing something in China that I
don't know Robyn, do you want to talk about that. Well, I mean, we don't want to
make an announcement exactly, but maybe just talk about like the preamble or
something on it. So Robyn is the Head of Worldwide Sales for Tesla.
{BIO 5964382 <GO>}
Thanks, Elon. I didn't expect to talk about this. So we're incredibly excited to build
ﬁrst Tesla Gigafactory outside of the US. In China is speciﬁcally, it's going to be in
Shanghai and we have been holding discussions with the government, various
governments in China, really great discussions, great partners. We really look
forward to working with them in the years to come. This is going to be the next
generation of Tesla factory we are super excited. The stuﬀ that we are going to be
put in there and the cars that we are going to be building in that factory is going to
be incredible. So we are going to announce something really -- all the details really,
really soon. So I won't tell more, but this is enough.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Thank you. And particularly as we try to make cars more and more aﬀordable, it's
very [ph] important to localize production to at least the continent level and so
having Gigafactory and vehicle factory in North America, one in China, and then one
in Europe will be -- that sort of the -- those are the obvious three places for vehicle
and battery Gigafactories. So probably if things go according to our plan, we will
probably be announcing the details of the China Gigafactory as soon as next month,
and then Europe Gigafactory maybe end of this year, kind of depending on how the
-- we need to ﬁgure out where to put it exactly. So but probably towards the end of
this year for the Europe Gigafactory and ultimately we expect probably there is 10 or
12 worldwide.
So I had some questions on Tesla Semi. We are going to do another revision of the
Tesla Semi design because there is -- we've learned a lot and we think we can
actually make it even better than what was unveiled and really have a range that is
way beyond what people think, what most people in the industry think is possible.
And we want to -- it's deﬁnitely going to be a Semi that works in Europe and in North
America and China and the rest of world. I hope you guys were convinced with that,
yeah one major factory in the works and then another one in the works later this year.
Yeah, do you want to talk about cells?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 10 of 21Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Elon MuskYeah. We've talked about this a few times, but Tesla will absolutely recycle and we do
recycle all of our spent cells, modules and battery packs. So the discussion about this
waste, is sort of ending up in landﬁlls is not correct. We would not do that. These are
valuable materials. In addition to, it's just the right thing to do. So we have current
partner companies on every major continent, where we have our cars operating that
we work with to do this today. And in addition, we are developing internally more
processes. We're doing R&D on how we can improve this recycling process to get
more of the active materials back and ultimately what we want is a closed loop right
at the Gigafactories that reuses the same recycled materials, this isn't possible. We
see a pathway to do it, but that's where we're headed with this. And today, we're on
the way to do that. It's deﬁnitely something that will be a huge beneﬁt in the long
term to cost, as we're able to reprocess more materials instead of actually having to
mine new materials.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
In terms of repairability of Model 3 including insurance costs. We're working with the
-- with insurance companies and on some internal activities. We're really conﬁdent of
getting the cost of insurance for Model 3 to be at least 20% to 30% lower than say a
BMW 3-Series or equivalent mid-sized sedans. So the safety is deﬁnitely better, and
then we're working on the repair costs, we made a lot of progress in that front. But
bottom line is that the insurance cost -- total cost of -- ownership of Model 3 should
be signiﬁcantly better than any other mid-priced premium sedan.
So, yes, there will be -- we will deﬁnitely oﬀer a $35,000 version of the Model 3. And
I think probably at the end of this year is where we should be able to make the
smaller battery pack and then get into kind of volume production of 35,000 version
in Q1 next year. So that's deﬁnitely -- we will deﬁnitely honor that obligation, and we
will do so right now if it was physically possible.
See yeah, we're going to -- in -- probably next month oﬀer a free trial for people to
try out Autopilot and see how it works. We're also making rapid progress on
Autopilot technology. So the -- there's a new version of Autopilot that's rolling out, I
think this week, which I think is quite a signiﬁcant improvement. And I think what
you'll see is that the reliability and capability of Autopilot will increase exponentially
over the next 6 months to 12 months. It's really -- the improvements are very, very
rapid.
The length of time to wait for Model 3, if you're ordering one now will vary quite a bit
depending upon what part of the world you're in -- you're in and what conﬁguration.
So if -- for the existing conﬁguration, if you would order now in the US, you probably
would be waiting, I'm guessing about three months or four months. If you on the

A - Elon Muskfrom 3 months to 15 months approximately. But for current conﬁguration order it
now, it's maybe about three months or four months.
This is actually quite a complicated answer. There are many lines to the Model 3 and
some places it's -- there are several lines, in some places, there are -- there's just one
line and it kind of depends what the capacity of that line is. So for general assembly,
which is like putting the parts together at the end, we currently have two lines and
are constructing a third. The third line is, I think dramatically better than lines one
and two. We started construction on that third line about two weeks ago, and we
already putting the ﬁrst car through that line. So it's really crazy fast and that's part of
what gives me conﬁdence about the 5,000 per week for Model 3. But currently, the
biggest constraint on output is general assembly and I think we'll probably get to
5,000 a week with the current two general assembly lines, but with the third one, I'm
highly conﬁdent that we can exceed 5,000 units per week.
In Model 3 test drives, we should able to oﬀer Model 3 test drives starting at the end
of this month, and I think we should have them in almost all stores in North America
by the end of next month. We are rapidly expanding service centers. I think by kind
of year-over-year probably see a doubling of service center capacity for Tesla, and
we are making major progress on the body shop front. We are also -- it was quite a
big deal. We're creating Tesla body shop repair locations, and we should have by the
end of this month the -- at least the top 10 metro areas in the US being able to be
serviced by Tesla body shop. This will be a dramatic improvement in the cost and
time of body repair. In fact, we think we might be able to do for a lot of them like
same day body repair, which is, you know, it's deﬁnitely possible, so I think we want
to aim for at least some number of body repairs to be the same day, whereas if we
go to third-party, best case, it's about a week and some cases, it's several weeks. So
this is pretty exciting actually. We are basically just taking our biggest service centers,
adding in an annex for body repair and then pre-stocking the parts, so you don't
have to wait for parts to come from the factory. Not yet, but, yeah, March next year, I
think we'll have something very exciting to show.
All right. So let's take some questions from the audience. I think it's basically is lined
up with the mics and go for it.
Questions And Answers
I wanted to ask, is there going to be a time perhaps in the next eight years and Tesla
is going to produce compact and/or sub-compact vehicles; such a huge segment
and it seems like that would be necessary to fulﬁll the Master Plan, Part Deux
mandate?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. I think we'll do a compact car in less than ﬁve years. Yeah, all right.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05

A - Elon MuskGreat progress. You mentioned Autopilot progress as well. So when do you expect
like fully enhanced Autopilot functionality like, following navigation, switching
freeways within the six month time frame?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I was just testing that last night at about 1:00 AM. I think we might be able to release
something in a couple of months, that can do that. We've been pursuing two paths;
one really complicated path, but I think isn't working that great, and then a simple
path that I think will work pretty well. I mean, I was able to drive last night, go from
highway on-ramp to highway oﬀ-ramp using the simpliﬁed version of the control
system, and I think with some further eﬀort, we can get that out in the next couple of
months. Yeah.
Is this on [ph], there we go. So as far as Tesla Inc is concerned with the Model 3 and
to what degree of certainty will there be a consumer or a ﬂeet lease option within the
next three years on the Model 3, is that something that you guys already have in the
plans and the works or is there room for ancillary business?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We do -- we will oﬀer leasing on Model 3, but probably end of this year or early next,
because it does have a slight impact on the capital usage of Tesla. We -- in terms of
ﬂeet stuﬀ, I think we've -- I think people can certainly buy a lot of Model 3s and then
operate them as a ﬂeet like people do for Model Ss and Xs for taxies. Yeah, I think
we're -- certainly be happy to support that, yeah.
(Technical Diﬃculty) Kind of a simple follow-up to that, just kind of the understood
thing. If I purchase the whole ﬂeet and then Tesla comes in and says, all right we're
going to start leasing direct to the consumer or having a commercial option that
might not work out so well for me, but that's why I'm asking is it anything commercial
happening that you have in the works in the next two years even?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, we don't really think -- right now we're just super focused on ramping up
manufacturing of Model 3 and make sure people can get their cars because they
have been waiting for a couple of years. And we're not really thinking much about
incremental demand generation because as it is even getting to a 5,000 cars per
week, we would -- it would take us almost two years to produce enough cars to
satisfy those that have put down a $1,000 deposit. So yeah, we need to kind of ramp
to 5,000 and then next year ramp to 10,000 a week, and get the right-hand-drive
version done and homologate the car for Europe and Asia. And then we will think
about other things once we've done all those things. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05

Gwynne Shotwell of SpaceX mentioned that Tesla automobiles might use in some
way the Starlink satellite network, I was wondering, if you might elaborate on that
opportunity and when that might take place?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's possible. I think it probably will be -- the Starlink thing is more meant for like ﬁxed
terrestrial, homes and businesses and that kind of thing. For mobile, it might be
possible to use the Starlink system eﬀectively if you had a repeater, a ground-based
repeater system. But the Starlink uses a terminal as about the size of a sort of small to
medium size pizza. So I'm not sure, if you want to put that on the roof of the -- of
Tesla. Maybe, but I think probably just using -- most likely we'll continue to use just
Wi-Fi and the cellular network, yeah most likely. Yeah.
Hello. My name is Steven Singleton [ph]. And my question is, how is Tesla engaging
regarding virtual power stations with governments and territories in countries that
may have weak power infrastructures to provide clean energy to more of the world
citizens?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah, I think the -- we'll have a lot more to say about that when we announce the
Generation III of the Superchargers because that we have been doing much more of
an integrated solar battery system with the Superchargers. So to-date only a few of
the Supercharger systems have solar and battery systems, but long-term, we want to
have almost all of them have that. And the nice thing is that if you've got like a solar
powered -- kind of like a solar-powered carport area and Tesla batteries, than even if
-- you don't even need to be connected to the grid. So it's sort of like even proof
against like a zombie apocalypse of digital work, as long as the zombie is not too
near of the Supercharger, I suppose. But yeah there, it will be able to work anywhere
even if there's not good power infrastructure.
I think he's also asking about like networking powerwalls together?
And for like a virtual power plant, if that's kind of what you also were alluding to. We
do have a really cool project in Australia, where we're actually networking together
up to 50,000 individual homes with powerwalls, so each one of those homes has its
own battery. They can still serve as like a backup power source if the utility totally
goes out, if there's a storm, but when things are working normally, all those houses
can talk together and then we can talk to the utility and treat them as sort of one big
distributed power plant. So that's a really cool project that has beneﬁts across the
whole grid, for the homeowners, for a lot of people. And we're building that outFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 14 of 21Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantright now and we'll probably be expanding that same model. We have a small demo
in the US and we'll be expanding it worldwide.
And we're also doing again, quite a lot in Puerto Rico. I think we have -- I think Tesla
has more battery projects and solar projects in Puerto Rico than everyone else
combined. So it's -- we're making a big diﬀerence there, doing our best to and I
think there is potential for kind of a virtual grid in Puerto Rico, as well rather than
rebuilding a legacy sort of oil and gas based energy generation system.
Hey, Elon, I also think boring, boneheaded questions are not cool, so hopefully this is
little more interesting. I've had a Model S since 2012 best purchase ever, you guys
nailed design, nailed performance. The one thing, I always get from friends and
family because I do the drive down to LA a lot is the Supercharging time. I know you
mentioned you guys are working on Supercharger III, I assume it's going to be a bit
faster. Just curious, do you guys see room for kind of orders of magnitude
improvement in charging time or are we kind of reaching a plateau with current
battery chemistry and technology?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I wouldn't say that there is an order of magnitude improvement, but I think a factor
of three or four is possible, now it won't be applicable to all battery chemistry's. So
2012 chemistry can take the charge rate of current chemistry, but and we wish it
could be -- wish it could, but we just have to make much improvements to increase
charge rates. The key, I think, ﬁgure of merit is that the ratio of drive time to charge
time should be at least on the order of like 6:1, if not 8:1 or 10:1. The point at which
you're driving say 10 times as much as you're charging, then the natural sort of
human need to take a break unless you have an enormous bladder is (inaudible)
paramount. I mean, if you start a road trip at say 9:00 AM typically by around noon,
you want to stop, hit the restroom, grab a bite to eat, grab a coﬀee, and then you
want to get back to your car and have it be ready to go.
So that's where -- I'd like to say that, that's like maybe half an hour, that's kind of the
minimum threshold for the car to be ready to go when you come back from a break.
And then once you get to the point, where I would say 10:1, where maybe it's only 15
minutes, 20 minutes, yeah, sitting on the road 15 minutes, then the car is ready to go
way before you're ready to go. And for some of the long distance like, if you get to
say a Model S 100D, you can drive non-stop from LA to San Francisco, if you drive
carefully. That's a long drive, so and we think there is potential -- there is certainly
opportunity for range improvements down the road, where we're able to oﬀer cars
with ranges in excess of 400 miles. Thanks.
Hi. My name's Dr. Catherine (inaudible) and I'm with People for the Ethical Treatment

Gear shifter. Our Gear shifter, I don't think, has anything. Steering wheel maybe does
or -- steering wheel (inaudible). But, Franz [ph], if you want to?
Are you still using leather in some of your components?
So we do in Model S, X and 3 currently, we have the only leathers on the steering
wheel rim and people have asked and kind of oﬀ menu, we do replace that for
people that are -- need a fully vegan car.
Sure. So our concern is that we're obviously facing environmental crisis and animal
agriculture, as we all know is one of the main contributors particularly leather
production and we're really pleased to see that you have introduced non-leather
seating options and that's a really fantastic step towards your goal of sustainability.
We would really like you to take the next step and eliminate all leather components?
Yes. I think S, X and 3, they are -- we may be the ﬁrst vehicles in production to kind of
go non-leather and at least in all of our seating and our trim. And we're actively
working on replacing the steering wheel as well, we just want to make sure that the
experience is as good, if not better.
Sure. Yes, just to add to that. So there are some existing premium vegan leather
suppliers, Ultrasuede and Alcantara, if I'm pronouncing it correctly they are used by
other luxury cars like Ferrari. So yeah, we would really like to see Tesla step-up as
well?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yeah. Well, deﬁnitely we are oﬀering sort of -- as far as technically, we do not say it on
the website, but you can actually have a Tesla that has zero leather whatsoever,
including on the steering wheel. It's a little diﬃcult because we do it in small
quantities at the design studio. So it's challenging to do it in scale. But Model Y, for
example, will not have any leather in it, that including in the steering wheel even if it
does have steering wheel. Thank you.
When do you expect signiﬁcant battery advances to allow Tesla to pack twice as
much energy into each of the batteries without increasing the size or weight?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05

Twice as much as tricky, but we can certainly see a path to about a -- about a 30%
improvement maybe a 40% improvement in energy in the same size battery pack,
but like the best technology, we our conﬁdent does work and it just -- it needs to be
scaled up and made very reliable, but 30% to 40% is deﬁnitely doable long-term
probably double -- long-term by other people standards. From a Tesla standpoint,
we think probably two years to three years to get to about a 30% improvement in
volumetric energy density and, yeah, maybe six years or something, six years to eight
years to get to a doubling, it's highly dependent on making lithium for that really big
jump, lithium anode is the key, just plating after [ph] lithium on the anode.
I started a company called Tesla Attractions, Tesla Attractions is basically gamiﬁcation
version of visiting Superchargers. And I know that you've tweeted about this a while
ago saying that it was a good idea. And if you ever decide to go through with it,
obviously, I do not want to be in a position of competition with you. So how could
someone like me help the mission?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Maybe you should interview at Tesla. I said folks right now is getting through the
critical stuﬀ like -- especially the Model 3 production ramp, and then smoothing out
the production process to make the car aﬀordable, getting the lower cost battery
pack or small batter pack into production. So those are kind of critical fundamental
things to really the survival of the company. And then we do kind of like the fun,
frivolous things, like they add joy to the experience, maybe later this year. I think it
was like doing sort of fun, silly things in the car, like the Easter eggs, that -- there's
like a lot of Easter eggs in the Model S and X and 3 that are quite fun if -- in fact,
once they're discovered, they're put in the Easter egg box, which you just tap the
Tesla logo on the screen and then wait for about 30 seconds and it opens the Easter
egg box, yeah. All right.

Hi, I got my ﬁrst Model S in 2013 and have an X and the 3 now, I love the product. I
feel like I'll always be one of the ﬁrst to try -- to try one of your new products. And I
was just wondering, is there any chance in the future that we will be able to text
commands to our car, like keep my car at this temperature, come pick-me-up that
type of stuﬀ?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
We're going to keep enhancing the Tesla app on the phone and to be able to, long-
term, just tap the summon button and your car will come ﬁnd you wherever you are
and really wanted to learn -- you can change the temperature right now from the
app, but we want the car learn what you are most likely would do like you basically, if
there was a great chauﬀeur in charge of the, what would that person do anticipating
your needs and knowing what you'd want. So it's sort of like an intuitive trustee's
deed that just always knows what you want, ideally, and then you can easily adjust
that as needed. So you want as -- be as close like a mind meld with the car as
possible.
Hi. My name is Kevin. I have the model S since '13, and my question is about
Autopilot and the use of LIDAR. As we all know that Tesla probably still, the company
alone that not using LIDAR, where all other vendors using it. So as autonomous
driving is close to reality, I think, inevitably, there will be a showdown on which
approach will be more superior. So what do you think, when that time will be?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I think LIDAR will be seen as -- what LIDAR tends to drive companies to do is to
go to a local maximum in terms of Autopilot capability or autonomous driving
capability and LIDAR ends up being like somewhat of a crutch, it's helpful to get
almost there. But if you rely on it, you will never get actually get there is my opinion.
So you have to make vision work extremely well in order to achieve true self-driving.
Once you've made vision work extremely well, LIDAR is really unnecessary, its not
really adding anything.
We do have sophisticated sonar like ultrasonic sensors around the vehicle for near
ﬁeld, and we do have a forward radar system, which is useful for detecting objects
even in fog, sort of snow or rain like low visibility conditions, where you can't see
what's going on, and that's also the case where LIDAR is ineﬀective, because LIDAR
is an active proton generator in the visible spectrum. This doesn't make sense to me,
because you have a massive amount of incoming photons in the visible spectrumFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-05

we're doing -- as you ramp up production, it ends up being -- it's negative just as it

early next, we should be in the 20% to 30% gross margin level for energy storage.
Hi, thanks (inaudible) on the conference call by the way. And my question was just
rounding as a long-term investor, I hate to say this, but I feel like my trust in Tesla's

discounting things on Elon time or you guys have you learned anything about this?

I think, I do have like an issue with time, it's like, it's been true since, so and my
brother is here, I was like have a condition, and my brother used to like when we
were catching the bus to school, he'd lie to me about the time. And he always says
like -- or it's sometimes like earlier than it actually was, and I get there slightly after
that and then we'd actually able to catch the bus. So this is something I'm trying to
get better at sort of naturally optimistic person, which I have not probably done cars
or rockets that was not. But so I'm trying to recalibrate these estimates, yeah, trying
to recalibrate as much as possible. Yeah. I mean, I probably put some sandbag on
future dates that's probably wise. But I kind of stayed with say -- when I think it can
occur, but then I'm typically optimistic about these things. But maybe less --
hopefully less optimistic over time. So it's yeah, like it pretty much always happens,

A - Elon MuskHey, Mr. Musk, my name is Sonia and my mom has Model 3 and my dad has a Model
S, and I have (inaudible). So I've noticed that whenever my mom is like kind of going
a little bit too fast, so like approaching a car to stop sign, the Tesla beeps pretty
loudly to kind of warn like, hey you're going to hit that. I was wondering like are you
guys thinking about developing mode, where like drivers could choose to turn it on
and then if a Tesla detected that it was approaching something quickly or was going
to crash, it would like gradually slowdown a little bit so best case scenario if the
driver takes control doesn't really matter worst case scenario and the crash it
decelerate so it's not as bad?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It does actually have -- there is a automatic emergency breaking. And I think what
you're saying is like instead of like last-minute kind of dramatic slowdown, maybe
slowdown sooner, but less dramatically, and that is something that will occur with the
latest versions of Autopilot. So it will -- if as it will decrease speed proportionate to
the conﬁdence level we want to do that in a way that's not annoying to people like
the car isn't slowing down a lot. But -- so it's really a delicate balance between not
annoying people, so they want to turn it oﬀ, but also being safe.
For Autopilot, I think the improvement is going to be really quite dramatic in the --
over the next several months. Yeah. This is intended to change speed proportionate
to its conﬁdence in going forward. But in order to do so, we have to improve the
sophistication of the Autopilot and all that and the heuristics that go with it. So it just
didn't annoy the hell out of people. Because at many times, when the car thinks it
should slow down, but actually not really and that will just drive people crazy. So I do
think what you're getting at is something that you'll see play out with the versions of
Autopilot that are deploying later this year including the one that's coming out this
week. Thanks.
Hi guys, I just wanted to personally thank Elon, JB, Franz, Deepak, good to have you
back; Tim, Emily, Vinny, Andrew the people at Tesla, who I don't know by name the
proud owner of an early 2012 Model S very diﬀerent than Model 3 that my dad
recently got his ﬁrst new car, he's pretty perplexed and amazed by it. I actually drove
that from New Jersey to Richmond probably could've skipped supercharging
entirely, charged the car for I think it was maybe about 20 minutes and continued
the trip, and the car was actually telling me that I was ready to go before I was done
eating the sandwich I picked up. I just want to ask a quick question, is there a
possibility to get a business card from the guy to your left because I wanted to tell
him about a company this man has been working on disruptive technology that
you're already indirectly using and wanted an opportunity to speak with you about it
further? Thanks.

A - Elon Muskhaven't been good at educating people on is that the Model S and X, but especially
the Model S has improved very dramatically from 2012. So we are arguably on
Version 3 or 4 of the Model S right now. So it's really a gigantic improvement in
Model S today versus Model S of 2012 when we ﬁrst started production. I really
encourage anyone who's got an early Model S to test drive the current version, I
think you'll be blown away by how much its improved. All right. I think that might be
the last question.
I will soon be driving around in Model 3. I am curious to -- you mentioned earlier that
during production, it's people ﬁrst and the automation later slowly. What kind of
considerations prompted to do otherwise when you started Model 3 production.
Can you talk about that?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think we're just over conﬁdent about the degree of automation that was possible.
And we did rely quite a bit on Tier 1 manufacturing automation integrators, and a
couple of other things really didn't work out at all, and now we are -- we are really
going to internalize all Tier 1 manufacturing systems at Tesla. So we'll have a lot of
suppliers, but they will be the Tier 2 and Tier 3 level. All right. Thanks very much for
coming.
