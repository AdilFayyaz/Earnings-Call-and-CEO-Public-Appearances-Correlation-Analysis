The following presentations contain forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could
cause our actual results to diﬀer materially from these statements and should be
considered in conjunction with cautionary statements and risk factor discussions in
our ﬁlings with the SEC, including our most recently ﬁled periodic reports on Form
10-K and Form 10-Q and subsequent ﬁlings.
Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements
or information, which are made as of their respective dates.
Non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures. Certain ﬁnancial measures included in this
presentation are not measures of ﬁnancial performance under U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, GAAP.
Certain non-GAAP measures were not reconciled to the comparable GAAP ﬁnancial
measures because the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking
basis.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable
eﬀorts because the company is currently unable to predict, with a reasonable degree
of certainty, the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact
GAAP measures for these periods, but would not impact the non-GAAP measures.
Such items may include acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other items.
The unavailable information could have a signiﬁcant impact on the company's GAAP
ﬁnancial results.

Good morning. I'm Tiﬀany Willis, Vice President and head of Investor Relations here
at Starbucks.
On behalf of our leadership team, we welcome you to our 2022 Investor Day.
Now before we shift into our presentations, allow me to cover just a few
housekeeping items, such as our forward-looking statements that we made available
at the beginning of this meeting for everyone to reference.
Second, I would like to share our agenda for the day. And as you'll see, we have an
action-packed day brewed just for you.
Now you may be wondering, wow. This is long. But don't worry. We have plenty of
coﬀee, okay?
Then, third, for everyone joining us virtually online, you'll be able to follow these
presentations, and they'll also be made available through our website for everyone
to access throughout the day.
Now with that, let's get this show started in a way that only Starbucks knows how.
And that's through our coﬀee tasting.
So please help me welcome Michelle Burns, Demetrius Brown [ph], and Neesha [ph]
(inaudible) to the stage.

Tiﬀany Willisbelieve the last time that I was with this community, we were in New York. So
welcome to Seattle and it's great to have you back. You're in for a great day. I'm
honored this morning also to be standing alongside 2 of my Starbucks partners,
Neesha [ph] and Demetrius [ph]. So over our most sacred rituals at Starbucks, one of
them is always connecting over coﬀee. Our tradition has often been tasting hot
coﬀee, the highest quality, ethically sourced arabica coﬀees from all over the world
as we have done for over 50 years.
While I'm also here to tell you that all that care and quality continues, but it's a new
day. And the fact is cold is hot. So today, we're really proud to share with you a future
cold beverage that we will be tasting in just a bit. But before we do that, Demetrius
[ph], I'd love to invite you to introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about you.
Thank you. My name is Demetrius Brown [ph]. I'm a 4.5-year partner at Kent Flexible
Plant, where I'm currently plant lead. The highlight of my day really is bringing in
coﬀee from all over the world from the farmers, roasting it to its own certain
character of proﬁle, and the shipping it oﬀ to Neesha [ph] and all the green aprons
in the store, which I'd really love to thank the green aprons. They're out there on the
front lines every day. And without them, there's no me, manufacturing or distribution.
Whether it's Cold Brew or our journey, I'm really excited for tomorrow.
{BIO 20642917 <GO>}
All right. Awesome. Thank you, Demetrius [ph]. Give it up for Demetrius [ph] and his
green apron, bringing a lot of ﬂash.
Neesha [ph], here for the very ﬁrst time today is wearing her Black Coﬀee Master
Apron, congratulations. Neesha [ph], tell us a little bit about yourself.
First, thank you Demetrius [ph] and all the (inaudible) partners. Because green stores
can do, we do and serve our customers if it was not for you all. So I appreciate some
of that. Hi friends, I am Neesha [ph], I am and almost 8-year partner. I started in the
Chicago area, and I moved to Seattle in 2016, and I worked at various stores
throughout Seattle. Currently I work at our Heritage store in Pike Place market at the
very ﬁrst Starbucks store. So I have the unique opportunity to welcome all of our
guests from like across the world and share coﬀee and culture and little bit of like the
store company history with them.
{BIO 21492161 <GO>}
Yes. Awesome. Thank you. And then Neesha [ph] and I both share a starting in
Chicago here 8 years ago, (inaudible) 28 years ago. So it just kind of goes to show
the beauty of this company and the expansion of what we do. Now we created Cold
Brew in 2015 and brought the best of ﬂavor and heritage of Starbucks to ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Michelle Burnscustomers as a new cold coﬀee oﬀering, and it has been growing ever since with the
launch of Nitro in 2017, and then the incredibly favorable and favorite Cold Foam in
2018. But maybe instead of telling you all about it, let's all have a taste of this
fantastic beverage that will be coming out in the winter.
All right. So we'll take a couple of seconds. And as the coﬀee is coming on.
{BIO 20642917 <GO>}
Green Apron Partners, right on, thank you. Now while they're passing, our
commitment to craft and great tasting coﬀee truly remains our ultimate
responsibility. As I mentioned earlier, cold is hot. In fact, 2/3 -- thank you, 2/3 of
beverages served in the U.S. today are cold beverages.
Now we've taken our coﬀee leadership to next level through cold, maintaining a
premium coﬀee forward beverage that is innovative and diﬀerentiates us from all
others. Now Cold Brew is our third fastest-growing segment over the last 2 years
with a 30% CAGR. It's contributed signiﬁcant growth over the pandemic. Cold Brew
alone is over a $1.2 billion business and growing.
Again, let me say that 2-year 30% CAGR on an over $1.2 billion business. And I think
really importantly, we are meeting our customers in relevant ways, cold refreshing
customized beverages that are largely enjoyed by our largest customer segments
Gen Z and Millennials. Now I think it looks like everyone has a beverage in their
hands. Neesha [ph], why don't you go ahead and lead us in the tasting.
Absolutely. So I am excited to introduce our pistachio cream Cold Foam Cold Brew.
It will be launching in stores (inaudible) 2023 so very soon. It is our Cold Brew and it
has a pistachio cream Cold Foam on top with a cocoa dusting and a nice citrus spritz.
This streak was inspired by our pistachio latte that it serves in our Roastery stores. It
launched to commemorate the opening of the Chicago Roastery back in 2019.
{BIO 20642917 <GO>}
All right. Let's take a taste. What do you think?
What do you think? How about the orange?
{BIO 20642917 <GO>}

beverage.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Good morning. It's great to see you all. It's really going to be a seminal day in the
history of Starbucks Coﬀee Company. Let me ﬁrst acknowledge our Chair, Mellody
Hobson is here this morning. Mellody, please stand up. We also have, I think, about
30 of our international partners who have traveled very far to be here. Please stand
up and be recognized. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you so much. Well, it's
been an interesting 5 months for the company and for me. And I think as we
prepared for this morning, I think all of us could not be more excited, more enthused
to really tell the story of the future of the company. And if I had to pick one word to
describe what we're going to share with you, it would be ambition.
Now if you look about the slide behind me, you see Starbucks stores all over the
world. But who could have imagined that a company that began in 1971 and had 11
stores in 1987 and just 100 employees would one day have 35,000 stores around the
world in 80 markets, serving 100 million customers a week and approximately
400,000 people wearing the Green Apron. That was the ambition. It was ambition
that was the entrepreneurial DNA of the company, and that was the courage and the
curiosity to see around corners and really do things that other people did not think
was possible. But here we are.
And what you're going to experience today, you're going to have a front row seat is
that the ambition, the entrepreneurial DNA, the curiosity and the curve to see
around corners and make big bets has never been greater than today. Now there's
one diﬀerence between today and years past, and that it is the strength of the equity
of the brand and the demand that exists for Starbucks Coﬀee all over the world,
which gives us extraordinary levels of encouragement in terms of what we have
planned.
Now let me begin by telling you a story, a story that kind of deﬁnes the
entrepreneurial DNA of the company. Here it is. In 1996, just 4 years after the IPO of
the company, we had less than 400 stores, and we were getting calls from all over
the world for Starbucks to open up internationally. Now here's the thing, none of us
had any international experience to speak of, except one of us was from Canada.
And so with all the inquiries that we were getting, we decided to take a tour around
the world. Remember, just 400 stores, we had a young group of people. Some of us
had never been in Europe, never been to Asia. And we took this tour around the
world, and we saw an extraordinary level of opportunity. And we decided that we
were going to open up in Japan. Now the Board at the time, given their ﬁduciary
responsibility, we had no experience, said, Howard, we need to hire a consulting ﬁrm
to help us understand what the opportunity is and the challenges. So we did that.
Now I'm not big on consultants, but we did it. They went out for months did a
comprehensive study of the market, came back to the Board with a thick book andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 75the headline was, if Starbucks goes to Japan, it will be dead on arrival. Dead on
arrival, why? Our no smoking policy would not go well with the Japanese consumer.
Certainly, no Japanese customer would ever eat or drink in the street, they would
lose space and the cost of real estate would be too expensive. So what did we do?
We listened and we decided to go to Japan. And so in 1996, we opened up our ﬁrst
store in Tokyo in a great site in the Ginza, but we made one calculated mistake. And
the mistake was we opened at the wrong time of the year.
August in Tokyo is a 100 degrees with 100% humidity, and we had no cold coﬀee at
that point, no Frappuccino, just hot coﬀee with a 100-degree weather. So the night
before I say to our Japanese partner through a translator, Yuji-Tsun [ph], you have to
understand, we made a mistake, we should have opened up in the winter. It's going
to be a tough day.
The translator was afraid to tell the truth. And she says to him, Mr. Schultz says it's
going to be the biggest day in Starbucks history. I'm dying. I get to my hotel room,
and I have an enthusiastic person on the other line saying, Howard, you got -- we
have incredible news. CNN is going to cover the opening live. I didn't sleep the
whole night, wake up that morning. Howard Behar, who's here.
We rushed to the store at 6:00 a.m. And as we're driving to the store, there is a line
around the corner and I turn to the translator again. And I said, Yuji-Tsun , did you
hire extras. It turns out they slept overnight. We cut the ribbon and a young man
doesn't speak a word of English, rushes to the front of the line to the barista and
says, Double tall Latte. And at that point, we all knew we were at home. That was
1996.
Just imagine what's happened since then? 400 stores now in Tokyo, 1,800 in Japan,
18,000 stores in 30 countries around the world because of the entrepreneurial
courage, commitment of the leadership team, which you're going to see in spades
today.
Now from the IPO in 1992 to 2008, we accomplished something that was
unprecedented, never before done. 64 consecutive quarters of positive comps, 190
consecutive months of positive comps, while cannibalizing approximately 30% of
our stores never done before, unheard of. It was really an extraordinary level of
growth, development and just what we were doing as a leadership team in the
company. And all of that was based on the quality of the coﬀee, the equity of the
brand and the currency of trust that we were building with our people and
customers all over the country.
And then, unfortunately, 2008. Now 2008 was a cataclysmic ﬁnancial crisis. We all
experienced it. There was something else going on at Starbucks. And we have to be
honest about what happened and what we learned. And that was a disease entered
the company in 2008, and it was hubris.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 75It was hubris in which the company was chasing, measuring and rewarding the
wrong things, the stock price, comp store sales, operational eﬃciency at the expense
of the customer and Starbucks lost its way. And we went negative.
I don't think we go negative, but look at the headlines. Some of you might even
recognize that some of those headlines might have been yours. So what did
Starbucks learn, what did we learn about ourselves? And probably most importantly,
what did you learn about us that is threaded into the year 2022?
Now what we learned about ourselves is the resiliency of the brand, the relationship
we had with our customers. And in 2008, the bloom is oﬀ the rose, everybody was
counting us for dead. And believe it or not, we did our best work. The level of
innovation was extraordinary. What we did in 2008 was literally transformed the
company. Now look at this. 2008, we built for the ﬁrst time our rewards program.
That led to Mobile Order & Pay, which is currently a signiﬁcant part of our business,
60 million rewards customers around the world, 30 million alone in the U.S. and
driving about 50% of our business, born in 2008.
Bottled Frappuccino, here we were, we had blended Frappuccino in our store, and
we said, why don't we bottle it and create a CPG business. Very few bricks-and-
mortar companies have ever been able to do along the lines of the CPG business,
which you'll hear about in a minute in terms of what we've been able to do. Bottled
Frappuccino led to a multibillion-dollar partnership with PepsiCo.
Thirdly, we embraced our coﬀee. And in 2008, we said we need a coﬀee that
appeals to the masses of Starbucks customers beyond our core customer base. And
Pike Place Roast was introduced in 2008, today, the biggest selling coﬀee in the
world for Starbucks. Again, innovation. And Dan, it was Clover, recognizing that we
needed to really produce the highest quality brew coﬀee in a new machine, a new
basis of how we're going to brew coﬀee. But what you're going to see today in the
Tryer center is that Clover has led to Vertica, and Vertica will be rolled out nationally,
Coﬀee on Demand, highest-quality coﬀee in the world and signiﬁcant savings in
waste.
That was 2008. Now what happened since 2008. 2008 with our -- everyone saying
the world was over for Starbucks, we bounced back in approximately 17 months. In 17
months, we were back positive comp store sales, opening new stores at record
numbers, the aﬃnity of the brand, highest level of retention among our people, and
we were back.
So what did we learn? We learned that there was a crisis externally. There was self-
induced mistakes. And we had to look in the mirror and say to ourselves, what is the
core purpose and reason for being for Starbucks. And it's always been the same.
And that is our ambition has been to create a great enduring company to achieve
outsized levels of returns for our shareholders and a level of benevolence and
conscience in terms of the equity of the brand and how we share success with our
people.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 75And from 2009 or so, until today, we were doing things again that produced $100
billion in market cap for the company. And if you look at where we were $11 billion,
$20 billion, we went all the way to $100 billion in market cap, growing the company
successfully embracing the conscience and the sensitivity of the brand and what we
stand for.
And then once again, crisis occurs. Now let's just talk about what that is. 2008 was
not a proxy for what has happened in 2022. There is no textbook whatsoever for how
to navigate through a pandemic, the likes of which we've all seen. No proxy. But
what it was a proxy for, unfortunately, is there was self-induced mistakes again where
we lost our way.
And so when I came back in early April with the next generation of leaders at
Starbucks, we looked at 2008, not as a proxy, but as a proof source of the capability
of the company to once again innovate at levels that had never been seen before.
And what I'm here to tell you is that the level of ambition, the level of innovation, the
entrepreneurial DNA, which created the company has never been greater.
Our site line in terms of what we see for the company. is extraordinary. And diﬀerent
than 2008, in 2008, we came back in 17 months, but we did not have demand.
Remember, we had negative comps. We had negative traﬃc. Right now, at Starbucks,
domestically and around the world, record demand. Inﬂation number comes out
today. So far, we have been immune, immune from any recognition whatsoever that
there is a downturn in customer traﬃc, a downturn in terms of average ticket.
In fact, in terms of our business, the most signiﬁcant thing that I can see is that
despite the fact that the business has changed dramatically, 50% drive-through, 25%
Mobile Order & Pay, 70% cold. Starbucks has adapted. And underneath all of that is
the relationship we have with our customers, record demand. Our international
partners are in the room today. With the exception of China, every single market
internationally is either meeting or exceeding plan.
And if you look at the innovation that's taken place, go to the next slide, please.
What we've been able to do in just 5 months is quite something, and it's just the
beginning. What you're going to witness today is a level of thoughtfulness,
understanding and a complete level of line of sight on how to once again capture
the sizable market for Starbucks in which every market that we're in, we will be the
leader in the U.S. and around the world.
Now what gives me comfort to say that. Well, just 2 weeks ago, just 2 weeks ago, we
introduced our fall campaign, and we have the number one -- this is an incredible
thing to say. We've been in business 51 years. Our highest record sales week in our
51-year history was 2 weeks ago. And I got to tell you, we are just getting started.
Now when I think about where we are today and the future of the company, we
clearly had to recognize that I'm 69 years old, and I'm long in the tooth, and it's time
for a new CEO. And so the Board, the search committee with Mellody leading theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

had an innate understanding of the heart and conscience of the company, someone
who had the entrepreneurial DNA in his blood and someone who could embrace
the vision of Starbucks in his own way. And I'm so proud to tell you that we found

So ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome Laxman Narasimhan to the stage.
So I don't want to embarrass Laxman. This is his ﬁrst time meeting you all. I can just
tell you in the time that he has been in Seattle, he's captured the hearts and minds of
our people. And I think -- thank you. You can't teach heart, but his deep sense of
humility, his understanding of the human connection at Starbucks, his understanding
of people who wear the green apron and work so hard on behalf of the company. I
just think he's the perfect person for the job. And so Laxman, I want to formally
welcome you to Starbucks and I have something for you.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}

And I know Howard said it, so I might just start oﬀ with just, I think, grounding us in
what the search has been about for a new CEO and Mellody, and Howard have
shared, we've been looking for a global citizen in entrepreneurial, a proven global
operator, a world-class strategic thinker. And we have found all of those things in
you. But above all, we were looking for humanity.
We were looking for a purpose-driven leader. And that is what you bring to
Starbucks. And so I want to start this conversation today around humanity. And as I
think about humanity, and I take this back to our origin story is one of the most
fundamental aspects of our origin are our name. So Laxman, can you share a little bit
with us about your name, your origin story and how that has shaped who you are
today?
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Well, thank you, Sara. And it's really an honor to be here, and it's a privilege to be
asked to lead this company. I haven't started yet. And so I'm really looking forward to
being in the audience with all of you listening to the ambitious plans that this
amazing team has put together. Firstly, you said my name right.
{BIO 20201199 <GO>}
I've been practicing.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Yes. You have. It's showing -- it's Laxman Narasimhan. Now by the way, I have a
barista name, and it's important for me to say it because I -- when I go to the stores, I
always tell them my name is Laks, L-A-K-S, and they write it down and they get it right
all the time. But Laxman Narasimhan. So Laxman is actually the brother of Ram in the
famous Indian story, the Ramayana. And I was named after my brother, Ram. Now
Ram unfortunately passed when I was 6 and he was 8. And so it's a real story of loss,
a real story of many challenges that have been thrown at me.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Laxman NarasimhanI came to this country with nothing. And so sitting in front of you, I truly am the
epitome of the American dream. I had many ladders given to me, much like I know
the latter that Starbucks oﬀers to its partners to get to a better place in life. So loss
challenges in life, but yet, the American Dream. And so it's not really what happens
to me, but how I respond to it that deﬁnes me. So Sara, at the end of it, resilience is
what deﬁnes me.
{BIO 20201199 <GO>}
And deﬁned by resilience, deﬁned by purpose, you've had a remarkable career. So
can you thread through some of those professional experiences and talk a little bit
about what you're going to be bringing to Starbucks.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Well, nothing could really prepare you to lead this beautiful special company. But I
hope what I can do is call on a combination of experiences that will hopefully I can
bring to bear on the company. The ﬁrst is, I'm as global as they come. I've lived
literally everywhere and worked everywhere, and I've had operating experiences,
leading businesses with large numbers of people in varying environments,
developed environments, developing environments, emerging markets.
I have led transformational journeys that have resulted in the creation of a signiﬁcant
amount of value. But I'm truly in my zone when I am leading, energizing, mobilizing
large numbers of people around a mission. Now I've been a CEO before, but what
really attracted me to the company is this mission? It truly inspires me.
{BIO 20201199 <GO>}
So let's talk about that mission because one of the things we've talked to these last
few days about is the impact that Starbucks can have on the world. Can you tell us a
little bit about how you see that impact and what you believe?
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
I think the best way to do this is to just tell you a bit of a story. I came here to Seattle
to spend a weekend with Howard, and he took me to a store of stairs. And I think all
of you met Neesha [ph]. Neesha [ph], you did a great job, by the way. Thank you very
much.
So I met Neesha [ph] and Howard said, Hey, can you ﬁx up something for my friend
here. So I asked what do you recommend? And Neesha [ph] said to me, I
recommend the Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew. I said, "Wow, I've never had that.
Can you make one for me? And she said, yes, I can. Actually did and it was amazing.
The Sunday morning, Howard said we've got to go to Pike Place. We've got to go to
the place where it all started. So we went there and the store opened. And
amazingly, Neesha [ph] was there. She looked at me and she said, I'd recognize you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Laxman NarasimhanNow it's possible that you recognize me because I was Howard's friend. But I said,
"What would you like?" I said I'd like an Espresso Doppio Macchiato, which is my
drink of choice with a bit of hot milk on the site." And she said, "Got it. I'll make it.
Now when I came here, I'm sort of looking for a place to stay, looking for care for my
mother, I thought I'd go to Pike Place with you." And we went there and sure
enough, Neesha [ph] was there.
And what did Neesha [ph] say? She said, "I know you well, the announcement came
out, I went to (inaudible) store, and I said, "I know this guy." I know this guy. Now it's
amazing how in that one moment. She demonstrated to me what the power of this
brand was. But the power of this brand is about connection over a cup of coﬀee.
And if we can get that to happen in a millions of times around the world always the
opportunity set for this company is limitless.

interactions with members of the Board.

looks at from an artistic perspective, that joy he has when a customer's order is
fulﬁlled and frankly, the joy he has when a partner responds and connects with
customers, just to joy. So I've got to see all of that.
So one of the things we did, which Howard and I did was we codesigned this
structured emotion. And it's going to mean certainly with Mellody, time with
members of the Board, but also it's going to be really a learning of the culture of the
company. engaging with the people of the company, understanding the brand,
understanding the secret source of this special company.
So there's time in stores, there's time in the roasting plants, there's time with
partners, they're time with investors, there's time observing customers. And so it's an

Howard Schultz{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
I've been an operating CEO. I've been the CFO of a large operating division. I've
engaged with investors. And I've recognize that the value creation model for this
very special company is very unique, and it's grounded in the idea that we have to
meet or exceed the partner experience. It's almost the second place for our partners.
And through that, we need to exceed the expectations of our customers. And we do
that with superior product, with innovation, with distinctive experience, across the
physical world as well as the digital world and so if we do a great job with our
partners, we're going to exceed the expectations of our customers, the third place as
we have deﬁned it.
And through that, we have an impact on the community. And we do that in a
sustainable manner. It has a very positive impact on the world. And so as I look at
value creation, this is the model that is core to the value creation model of the
company. And if you do it right, the opportunity set is limitless, and I know what it will
lead to is outsized returns for our shareholders.
{BIO 20201199 <GO>}
I couldn't agree more, exceeding the expectations of our partners is where it begins,
right, where it starts. Can you share just as we think about you joining the
organization and tell us something maybe that the world doesn't know about you.
Something that you want us to know as you join Starbucks.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Well, if you read about me, I think what you're going to see is a lot of right brain stuﬀ.
A lot of things, analytics, (inaudible) strategic and all that. But what's not really not
known is the left brain side, my love for Art, my love for design, the fact that I write
poetry, the fact that I care deeply about people and ensuring that what I can do is
provide ladders to millions. That really inspires me. And I hope what I can do is bring
both sides of this to bear to this beautiful brand to this beautiful company to the
beautiful and amazing people that work in it and help it realize its limitless potential.

Page 16 of 75I just -- I think in just a few minutes, I saw somebody who just has the natural
proclivity to be himself and so comfortable in his own skin and the kind of person
and leader that is a perfect person at the perfect time to lead the company. And so
over the next 6 months, as Laxman said, we'll spend time domestically and around
the world, and we'll be in a great position to lead the company, and I'll stay on the
board with Mellody and do my best to support him to ensure the fact that he's
successful.
I won't be up here for another few minutes, and I'm going to give it to my colleague,
Frank Britt.
But let me just say a couple of things about how I feel about this moment in the
company and why I came back and why I feel so conﬁdent and enthused about the
future. It's a word that's not used very often in business, and the word is love. I've
spent my life at Starbucks and my love for the company, my responsibility to our
partners is at the highest level possible. And when I came back over the last 5
months or so, I was once again reminded about the power of the culture and values
and guiding principles of Starbucks, how unique it is, how rare it is and how it must
be preserved and enhanced.
I mean we had a Board member for many years, Senator Bill Bradley, who was from
Missouri. And once we're talking about the future of the company and he said, "You
know what the motto is for the state of Missouri. I said, no, I don't know what the
state model is, what is it?" And he said, it's the Show-Me State. And so I want you to
think about that.
You're in for a really wonderful day, a world-class level of insight perspective about
the brand, the future of the company and our responsibility as a leadership team in
creating conﬁdence and trust with you is to show you. And we've got to show up
every day. We don't take for granted the responsibility that we have to our
shareholders and all of you. And I said something the ﬁrst day I came back in a
company-wide meeting, which I actually believe more today than I did then, and that
is the best days for Starbucks are ahead of us. It took us about 17 months to come
back in 2008.
I'll go on the record and say it's going to take less time this time around. And I think
you'll see that today with the quality of the people presenting, their understanding
of the business and the opportunity in front of us. I'm going to steal a little bit of
thunder from Rachel and just tell you some of the numbers that you're going to be
hearing about. Double-digit revenue, double-digit EPS growth, continued strength in
our comp store sales, record numbers of accelerated store growth and a signiﬁcant
return to shareholders in the form of dividend and a return at some point to buying
back our stock.
All of that will be framed for you in the strategy and how we're going to go to market
domestically and around the world and the plethora of opportunity that Starbucks
Coﬀee has. We are reinventing the company, but we're not reinventing what we do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 17 of 75Frank BrittWe're just reinventing how we do it. I'll remind you about something else. Given the
fact that there's been such a signiﬁcant change in consumer behavior, where there's
a diﬀerent level of pattern recognition post-Covid. You would think that the
relevance of Starbucks Coﬀee Company would be fading. It would make sense.
People are no longer coming to the store the way they would when they used to.
But the question really is, given the fact that there's been such a signiﬁcant change in
consumer behavior, how is it that we are in a double-digit comp state in which our
customers are using Starbucks in a diﬀerent way, but more than ever before. And the
level of transition that we've had is how quickly we have adapted to drive through
Mobile Order & Pay and meeting customers where they are. We didn't have a
delivery business 18 months ago. That delivery business is on ﬁre today and it's just
the beginning. You're going to hear so many new ideas today.
I worry sometimes when I sat through this yesterday, we're only giving you too much.
But you're going to see all the things we're working on, the excitement we have for
the future and the conﬁdence we have and how quickly Starbucks is going to return
to the kind of ﬁnancial performance that you've seen from us from the past. So thank
you very much. You've got a front row seat in terms of what you're going to see. I'm
excited and so privileged to be in front of you again. Thank you very much.
{BIO 16521499 <GO>}
Good morning. Howard, thank you so much for grounding us Laxman. We're so
privileged to have you join our team. On behalf of our 400,000-plus partners, our
gratitude for your commitment to us is has only begun, but we're looking forward to
the co-creation of the future that I think will be unlike any other. It has been said that
there are years when nothing happens and there are weeks when years happen. And
over the last 25 weeks, since our iconic founder has returned, he has done
something that is unique to a founder.
He has reset and rebooted Starbucks, a company of 51 years in duration, and he's
regrounded us as to what matters most at Starbucks. He's taken the ideas and the
values that it's always made Starbucks such a diﬀerent kind of company. And he's
brought it to life, and he's role modeled it, and he's inspired each of us to think
diﬀerently. In fact, he has challenged each of us. And he said, you will need to see
the world diﬀerently if we are going to become the next and better version of
ourselves.
You will need to think diﬀerently if we're going to become the next best version of
ourselves. And most importantly, you need to act diﬀerently. You need to lead in a
diﬀerent way, in a diﬀerent context and a diﬀerent moment in time, and we are ready
to do that. And so for today, we are going to provide you the most comprehensive
and operationally transparent perspective on Starbucks.
Certainly, this has been provided in the last couple of years. It's designed to give you
appreciation for the depth, the breadth, the reach, the potential of a company that
already has scale, scope and eﬃciencies unmatched by any other ﬁrm and ultimatelyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 18 of 75give you the conﬁdence, the conﬁdence you need to continue to support our very
ambitious agenda for the next few years.
So the agenda. The agenda is reinvention. And it makes sense, right? Because we're
a coﬀee house and the origins of all coﬀee houses are about stories. And so what
we're going to tell you today is about our new story. The story of Starbucks, past,
present and most important future and our themes around reinvention. It's premised
on the idea as Howard just noted in his own unique way, that the compass for
Starbucks remains exactly and appropriately pointed at creating experiences that
allow our partners to thrive and our customers to value our relationship uniquely.
However, while the compass is still right, the map must change. And what we're
going to lay out for you today is what is that map and how are we going to get
there? And what are the commitments and what are the capabilities and what is the
rationale for why we have such conviction about that happening.
A question we get often is, what does reinvention mean at Starbucks? We hear the
word, but give me the substance, what is it about? We think of it's about 3 things.
Firstly, and very importantly, an iconic company of global scale like ours, you can
only imagine it's unlimited opportunities. And the purpose of reinvention, perhaps
more than any other thing was to establish a clear mandate and agenda and
priorities.
We've gone through a rigorous frankly, ruthless process to prioritize what matters
most at this time in our history to allow for short-term improvements in performance
and partner experience and customer experience and set us on the trajectory to a
very diﬀerent kind of future. So part 1, prioritization. Part 2 is there are very tangible,
targeted substantive improvements that we are making in the P&L in '23 and '24
directly tied to the reinvention agenda.
It's about ﬁxing the fundamentals of the partner experience, the store experience
and the customer experience. make no uncertain facts about that. We are focused on
performance. And it's a process. It's a process designed to reveal insights to provide
stepping tones to discovery that you can only get through the application of the
work we're going to do. And so we are embracing this idea. We're embracing the
idea that discovery are really accidents that meet a prepared mind and we are trying
to earn the opportunity to have that prepared mind to put us in a position where we
can do our best work.
And so ultimately, we are a company has focused on improving the basics, future
prooﬁng and ultimately enabling diﬀerent kind of discoveries than we ever have
before. And then ﬁnally, in the theme of focus, just to be even more clear, this
reinvention plan, Phase 1 of the company reinvention is focused on U.S. company-
owned retail stores with a primary emphasis on the green aprons in the store.
That said, we have a very expansive agenda to take what we're doing here and
expand it around the world in partnership with our various license partners andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 19 of 75domestic partners in each of the countries and to expand to all of the partner cohort
to Starbucks, our plants, our distribution centers, our support centers and of course,
the folks that work each and every day in our stores on behalf of our customers.
And so that's kind of the master plan. For those of you who took a little bit of time
and listened to the last earnings call, you'll recall we introduced the components of
the reinvention agenda. Component number 1 and number 5, 1 being about mission
and 5 being about a diﬀerent kind of relationship with our partners.
We will not go through those in great detail today. But hopefully, you'll see that
threaded through all of our comments and all of my colleagues insights through the
rest of the day. And instead, what we will do is we will go deep, we will go deep on
the core components of the reinvention agenda, which is the partner, the customer
and the store. That will be the emphasis of the rest of today.
And so with that in mind, let me just say why that is the approach we're taking. The
premise is that these 3 elements need to work individually better and they need to
work as a system in kind. They need to be synchronized in service of ultimately an
experience that works best for our partners and best for our customers. And so what
we're trying to do in the next 90 minutes is to unpack each of these pieces in great
detail to give all of you the depth and insights as to what, the why and the how of the
reinvention agenda on these 3 dimensions.
Now as we do that, we are very mindful that coﬀee, the coﬀee remains very much at
the epicenter of who Starbucks is. And so all that we do is premised in the idea that
the heart and the soul of Starbucks is premium coﬀee. It's the DNA of the company,
and no one should be confused, whether it be local to global, farm to cup, partner to
customer, our reason for being is around coﬀee because coﬀee is the medium we
use to create human connection.
And at the end of the day, we're a human connection company these as coﬀee as
our medium to enable that to happen at scale. And that is the essence of the brand
of Starbucks. And that is why, that is why we are always quite declarative that we are
a premium coﬀee company. We are not a food company. We're not even a beverage
company. We're a premium coﬀee company because that is the soul of the
company. And we aspire, we aspire to continue to be the world's leader in premium
coﬀee in both the art and the science of coﬀee and coﬀee innovation, which gives us
permission and opportunities that are unparalleled for new kinds of occasions, new
kinds of channels, and, frankly, even more countries.
That is the essence. From a competitive strategy perspective, the Starbucks business
model is a competitive advantage that says from bean to cup, from bean to cup, we
have built a one-of-a-kind vertically integrated platform that combines sourcing,
blending, roasting and delivery at scale, with scope and with an unmatched level of
sophistication. And that is the reason why we earn the opportunity each week
around the world to enable 400 million occasions a week that Starbucks supportsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 20 of 75around the world. And yet, it's why we even have more conviction that the white
space for Starbucks ahead has never been greater.
So with that said, we have these 3 components. I'm going to take the partner section
and go deep, and then I'll hand it oﬀ to Brady Brewer to go through customer and
John Culver will go through store. So let's dig in. All the discussions today around
balance sheets and income statements will be quite robust.
But there's a purely interesting argument that says the most important currency, the
most important currency of Starbucks is actually not on the balance sheet or the
income statement. It's the currency of trust, the currency of trust we have with our
partners and our customers.
The reality is, and we are embracing reality, Howard has encouraged us to embrace
the ruthless facts in service of getting to a diﬀerent and better place. We have a trust
deﬁcit. We have a trust deﬁcit with our partners. Not all our partners, but for too
many of our partners, Green Apron partners in particular in our stores, we have not
lived up to the highest level of obligations.
Our historical aspiration of meeting and exceeding the expectations of our partners
and service of our customers. We have not done that consistently. There's a bunch of
reasons. Some are exogenous, but frankly, a lot of it is self-induced. And we accept
that, and we embrace that and we own that, and we plan to do quite a bit about it.
We also acknowledge this generational shift happening. There's an awakening.
There's a new dynamic emerging in the labor market at large, and we need to be
responsive to that as best we can. And so what we're going to talk about today is
what are we doing about our approach to reinventing the partner experience.
Now the good news is we start with a position of strength. And while there are
always skeptics, the reality is that we didn't follow a playbook relative to the creation
of new kinds of experiences for our partners, we invented the playbook. We
invented the playbook that companies around the world look to for what is best-in-
class standards, practices and ethos relative to partner experience with frontline
workers.
And so the ﬁrst reason we have conviction is because we've done it, we know how to
do it, and we believe it's an opportunity that's unlike any other. The second reason,
though, we have conviction, which actually might even be more important, it's
because we are not creating this by ourselves. Our partners are creating the future of
Starbucks.
Our line is we are creating the future by partners for partners. Our partners are co-
creating the future with Starbucks. This is not a project in some ivory tower. It's a
bottoms-up approach. It's a democratization of innovation at a company that has
unique scale, engaging the people who have a unique window into America, unique
window into America, who are most proximate to the challenges and the
opportunities that the marketplace provides us and coming together as one unit inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 21 of 75order and in service of helping improve the partner experience and the store
experience.
And that's why since April 4, we've committed over $1 billion, over $1 billion to
improving and elevating the partner experience, which we view as a signiﬁcant
statement of our intent and yet, as you'll hear through the rest of this conversation,
we're just getting started. So let's talk about if you just zoom out just for a minute.
Starbucks does not operate in a vacuum. It's part of a much larger context. So let's
talk about the context of the market in which we compete.
And in this case, it's the competition for talent, not the competition for customers. So
it turns out the category we're in, the frontline worker labor market is going through
dramatic changes, signiﬁcant changes, unprecedented changes. More than 50% of
the people that worked in this sector 3 years ago are no longer working here. If you
looked at last week's jobs report, there are 2.5 million open positions, 2.5 million
open positions. Now keep in mind, this is in a context where participation rates in the
labor market are about 62%, 63%, which are near historic lows, and unemployment is
nearing historic low at 3.7%.
Those challenges pale compared to the challenges of ﬁnding talent in the category
we're in. So that is the reality that we deal with, and we have to embrace that. Having
said that, companies like Starbucks have always led by example and need to lead by
example. And we have given deep reﬂection to what are the kinds of things we need
to begin to do diﬀerently as a company and that we excel. Many of our leading
company peers doing much the same.
So just brieﬂy, ﬁrst is a shift in orientation. We need to shift our mindset (inaudible), if
you will, from labor to talent, from thinking about people in a store as a cost center
to a value creation center, thinking about the idea that where we get talent can't only
be from the traditional sources. There are lots of other components of the labor
market we need to tap into. Those are the shifts we start to see in orientation.
Let's talk about the work experiences themselves. Well, ﬁrstly and most importantly,
people need scheduling empowerment. They need to deﬁne their life, not be
constrained by the company. And so you see companies like ours and others
embracing the shift from ﬁxed schedules to anytime shifts, thinking about wages as,
of course, important, but think about a total rewards program and then perhaps
most importantly, not viewing all Baristas as equals. Every person is unique in where
they are in their lives and where they are in their careers, and we need to embrace a
much more personalized journey and enabling them to achieve their highest and
best self or as Laxman say, giving them the ladders they need to meet their goals
and aspirations in their life.
And then ﬁnally, it's job design. The reality is the work we do in our stores today is
too physically hard. It's too physically hard. So you should see and expect and we'll
see (inaudible) today, implementation of workﬂow tools and automation tools that
allow the lower value-added tasks to be done and to free up time energy for the 2FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 22 of 75things that matter most in a Starbucks store, the craftsmanship of the production of
the coﬀee itself and most importantly, the connection to customers.
And so we are beginning to see a shift in what we do, and that shifts our mindset to
not just think about the productivity of a person, but what are their needs? What's
the whole person design that's important? And then ﬁnally, companies like
Starbucks, particularly need to think of themselves in the larger context of the labor
market is not talent takers, but talent makers.
In the same way we've embraced sustainability in the green energy context. When
you think about the sustainability of the talent market because the talent market is a
rate-limiting factor to companies like ours ability to grow, and we see tremendous
opportunities for us to contribute to grow the pool and move away from the zero-
sum game kind of model. So that's the context of the labor market at large for
frontline workers.
What does that mean to Starbucks? Glad you asked. Well, as you probably know, we
are typically and historically a top employer in the category. One of the things we
looked at very carefully is the Aon multinational company Aon, which is kind of the
Malcolm Baldrige award equivalent for beneﬁts. Starbucks is in the 100th percentile,
100th percentile, 5 years in a row relative to beneﬁts to which we say, very pleased
but hardly satisﬁed.
The reason we're not satisﬁed is this past year, in the last 12 months, we've added
183,000 people to the Starbucks Green Apron in the U.S. alone. And we have very
ambitious plans for the future. So we're going to need to continue to distinguish
ourselves and be thought of as a preferred employer brand in the same way that we
have thought of as a consumer brand. Let's look at some facts. We've taken some
data from across the category.
We've normalized it and index it for you. And what the data shows is, ﬁrstly, that
Starbucks is demonstrably better in relative terms for turnover or retention, which are
essentially the inverse of each other. So the data shows Starbucks is better than the
market by a lot.
You might say, well, that's interesting, but how about you compare Starbucks to
Starbucks because that's really the most important benchmark, we agree. If you look
at the data here, not surprisingly, turnover rates peaked during Covid. Remember,
this is all indexed, these are not absolute terms. The best and important news is the
actions we've taken in the last 25 weeks are already starting to have eﬀect. And you
can see the turnover rates on the far right side of the page are starting to go down
or said positively retention rates are starting to go up, and we couldn't be more
pleased. But we also are hardly satisﬁed.
And so the work we have ahead is to say, let's build on the momentum we've built
over the last 25 weeks, and let's see where it can take us. The reality is that is still a
very, very diﬃcult environment inside of our stores despite the incredible progressFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 23 of 75we're making as a company. And so what we wanted to do here is to give you some
sense that we accept empathetically that we have not lived up to our end of the
bargain complete with our partners. We need our partners to help us ﬁgure out how
to navigate to the future. And what this conversation then turns to is what are we
going to do about making it a better place to be in service of their needs and
ultimately in service of our customers.
The term we've been using is thrive. What does it mean to thrive? The word thrive,
by the way, means not just growth, it means vigorous growth. When you thrive in
your life, you're playing at a diﬀerent level. And we think that word matters a lot. So
as we talk about thriving and think about thriving for our partners, let's hear from our
partners as they think about this topic in their own lives.
(presentation)
So the notion of thriving is the architecture and the framework we're using to
evaluate and self-evaluate and design the future of the experience for our partners.
And as we think about that, we think it includes 3 components.
Firstly, how do they thrive at work in their jobs. Secondly, how do they thrive as
individual since their lives are much bigger than just looking into Starbucks. Then
how do they thrive as a team. And our intent is to architect a master plan that allows
each one of those components to be optimized and laddered up for each and every
person and ultimately allow the company to get a commensurate number of awards
as a result. And you might ask, well, why does an investment community meeting
have to talk about thriving partners.
We're interested in the P&L and the income statement, the balance sheet and all the
other components, we're with you. But we're going to kind of give you the argument
for why everyone in this room for all the right reasons, should care deeply about
what is thriving partners meet. And the reason is, it is the catalytic force that drives
the value chain of Starbucks. It's that simple. It is the ignition for the ﬂywheel of
Starbucks ﬁnancially and in terms of brand equity. And here's how it works. A thriving
partner therefore, has what we call higher partner engagement scores, which is the
Net Promoter Score equivalent for a partner. And when those scores are high,
empirically, it drives customer connection.
And when customer connection is high, well, that's when life works just as you want
because it drives top line growth, operating income, customer loyalty and brand
aﬃnity. And as if that weren't enough, if that's weren't enough, there's a set of
derivative beneﬁts as well, as you can see in the chart here, which is we spend less in
aggregate on partner acquisition because we don't need as many partners because
we have higher retention rates and ultimately, more labor leverage in the P&L. And
so thriving partners with the foundation of the company and really the most
important thing that aﬀects all other factors vis-a-vis performance, however one
wants to measure it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Page 24 of 75So let's take for a few minutes and talk about what we mean when we talk about the
thriving concept. The ﬁrst of the 3 is Thrive at Work. Now you know because you're
experts on Starbucks. We have a long history of education, healthcare, mental health
programs. We are the deﬁners. We invented things that didn't exist, like stock for
part-time workers.
And our list and our history is strong, but it's not enough. It's not enough. And that's
why since April 4, we've made a series of very bold and decisive commitments on
behalf of our partners. We've increased wages for all eligible stores, all eligible
people around the United States.
We have doubled the amount of training that we have in our stores because all
people want to feel competent and conﬁdent in their roles. We have brought back
our iconic program of Black Apron Coﬀee Master credentialing, which goes back to
the joy of coﬀee and acknowledges the unique skills and capabilities of our people.
And in the last 24 hours, as you probably noticed, we've rolled out 2 new programs.
One is what we call My Starbucks Savings program, which is designed to incent
people to save, we will pay you to save if you're a green apron at Starbucks and
mindful that student loans remain a tremendous complex challenge for many
people. We've built out a solution in partnership with a leading company to create
an expert-based coaching model to help you navigate student loan challenges.
Again, all of these things as part of the $1 billion commitment, we would say pleased,
but still not satisﬁed. So what other things should you be expecting from Starbucks
going forward? Well, we think they fall into 3 categories: wage, innovation, well-
being and recognition. On the wage innovation side, the most important thing is
actually scheduling to complement absolute wages. People need empowerment in
terms of their lives, and we need to move to a model that gives them more of that
opportunity.
In the well-being area, you'll see us announce relatively soon, a much more
advanced or progressive or generous sick time accrual model. You'll also see us roll
out extended mental health support and a whole new level of capability set to
empower people to take better control of their lives in terms of their mental health,
which we believe is essential. And then the third component is in the recognition
connection and there's some really interesting things happening there.
We're rolling out a whole new recognition program, which will allow people to
acknowledge each other in the stores and across stores and ultimately allow the
customer to do the same. We are rolling out what we call digital tipping, which is a
complement to the current model we have on the mobile app, which we think will
create more opportunities for customers to celebrate the great work our folks do.
And we're rolling out a whole new digital ecosystem that will allow us to connect in a
digital way with all our partners around the United States as a complement to the
relationship we have in the stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 25 of 75So that's one of the 3 components: Thrive at Work. Let's talk about Thrive As
Individual. The Drum Major Instinct Sermon argued that all people want to leave
their parade. We couldn't agree more. And we need to give people the agency and
the opportunity to do that. And how that manifests itself is people want to be able to
have a path that works with their lives. Because by deﬁnition, we're all at a diﬀerent
place in our careers in our lives, and Starbucks needs to embrace that.
So we started in the context of the Thrive model to articulate what our alternative
career path for barista. And then what do we need to do to create personalized
experiences much like we've done on the customer side to enable folks to get the
best and highest laddering and value creation for themselves out of their experience
at Starbucks.
Let me give you 2 examples. There's a cohort of partners we have, which we call
independent strivers and their needs are crystal clear. They want the same hours
every week. They need a steady paycheck. They want to bring the joy of coﬀee and
they want to be able to go back and meet their other domestic commitments, and
we should create a pathway that allows that to happen. There's another cohort, and
these are examples of some of the cohorts we've come up with of what we call a
passionate career builder.
This person sees Starbucks is the path to their greatness in their careers. And we
need to wrap services and capabilities in coaching and incentives that anything we
can do to help encourage and aﬃrm those behaviors and instincts they have. And so
what you should expect over time at Starbucks, if you join, it's not a one-size-ﬁts-all
experience but one that works for you. And when that happens, we believe that will
stabilize the store, improve retention rates and ultimately allow each person to
achieve their highest and best level of actualization.
The third and ﬁnal component of thrive is, Thrive as a team or Thrive as Together.
And I think an argument could be made that the most important group that needs
commitment, focus and intention at Starbucks is actually the store manager because
the store manager is the person that brings the love to the store. They are the heart
and the soul of the store. They build trust, they create equity in the brand, both as an
employer and a consumer brand, and we need to do even better at helping them.
So we're rolling out to complement the work we're doing for the Green Apron, a
new leadership model, new tools and capabilities and empower them to make
diﬀerent kinds of choices on scheduling, which is a very complicated part of their job
and one that really matters enormously to both the culture of store and frankly, the
ﬁnancial performance of the store. And then they too need career maps that work for
their lives. And the reason we think this is so important is because the data is
overwhelming that if you have a partner that is stabilized as a store manager over 3
years, it lowers demonstrably the turnover rate in the store.
It increases customer connection scores. Those are 2 key factors I cited earlier, and it
drives increases on a relative basis to an average store by plus 13%. So the storeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 26 of 75manager is the key to the whole master plan at a store level, and that means they
need to thrive in their work and in their jobs as an individual in the same way the
folks in the stores do. Final thought for you as you think about the architecture of
Starbucks and how we're rethinking ourselves, the notion of a partner as a source of
value and thinking about it as a lifetime value equation, the way you would normally
do in consumer marketing type context, we think applies to our partners.
However, while we are very preoccupied with the lifetime value per partner, we think
it's important to get the order of operation or the sequence right, which is what we
need to be obsessed with and preoccupied with is how to create more value for the
partners because when we create more value for the partners or to the partners, the
beneﬁts that come oﬀ that are enormous.
Firstly, we spend less money to acquire more relationships because we have a
higher retention, and we get more value from the partner over their lifetime. So this
idea of lifetime value per partner is very much in the new thinking of Starbucks
relative to the economics, the economics of talent in a store. And I think you'll see
over time a lot of diﬀerent innovations to come out of it because when you have this
kind of lens, it changes your aperture and it frankly helps illuminate why it's so
fundamentally important to drive retention by all the various cohorts we have of folks
who work in our stores, which takes us back to the idea of a thriving partner.
A thriving partner is the best way to increase the net lifetime value per person in our
store, and that is the center of the plate goal we have for the company prospectively.
So that's the current state where are we going in my last few minutes with you. We
are announcing today the formation of a partner experience innovation center. You
will all have the unique pleasure and opportunity to go through the Tryer Center,
where we do R&D on equipment and operations. We're going to stand up a
comparable capability set to the Tryer Center focused on partner experience.
If the partner is the essence of the experiential brand, and we know that to be true,
we need to devote the same types of capabilities and preoccupation we have for
that part of our business to complement the store operations side. And that means
new technologies, new innovations and really much more of a product management
approach to thinking about talent in the same way we've always thought about it as
it relates to beverages and beverage innovation. And that takes me back to the
reinvention agenda, partner, customer and store. And so the partner, customer and
store agenda is as important as it's ever been. And as we look at charts like this,
while we think this is accurate, we think it may underrepresent the real need and
opportunity.
While it's important to make the store better, make the customer better and make
the experience for the partner better. The reality is that it's an integrated system and
that the alpha of Starbucks prospectively is our ability not only to improve the store
customer and partner, but how we connect the dots, how we synchronize and how
we make that a high-performance engine in service of ﬁnancial performance, partner
experience and ultimately, the customer. And when we do that, well, that's actually
the deﬁnition of reinvention of Starbucks, a new way to bring a high-performing,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

ﬁnancial commitments we have as a company.
And when we do that, it will take us back to one of Howard's notions that the future
is not something that we enter, the future is something we create. And this is an
agenda for a reimaging of Starbucks against all the primary components of partner,
customer and store. And with that said, I appreciate your time, and we're happy to
hand oﬀ to a gear for Mr. Brady.

{BIO 17845948 <GO>}
Good morning. Let's start really with the realities of today's business and the
marketplace. We have a lot of challenges out there internally within Starbucks,
outside of Starbucks. How many of you are Starbucks customers? Anyone hands not
raised? Well, you see it ﬁrsthand. We have our fair share of challenges that you've
come here today to hear about the future of Starbucks, which leads me to another
question.
Earlier, Howard said the word ambition. And I want to ask you coming here today to
hear about the future of Starbucks, what do you still have to see today? What did you
come here to discover, to prove to you that our best days are truly ahead of us?
If you really look inward, what would it take to instill that absolute belief that even
after 50 years, 51 years of business at Starbucks that we are a strong brand, there is
place for growth. If there's 1 word you heard ambition, does anyone else want to
share a word this morning? You were all good students, I know it, I am sure, we could
get a word. Anybody?
Okay. No volunteers.
How about relevance? The relevance of the Starbucks brand, increasingly relevant
with a younger and more diverse generation, how about adaptability, the ability to
move quickly and adapt to fast moving market trends? How about diﬀerentiation, not
just diﬀerent, but an enduring strategic diﬀerentiation? And how about purpose,
oﬀering something genuinely meaningful in the world that the world needs more
than ever.
The marketplace is challenging, and we have our challenges, but I'd like to illustrate
that our best days are ahead of us. My name is Brady Brewer, I lead our marketing
organization as a Chief Marketing Oﬃcer, and I've been with Starbucks for 21 years.
You heard Howard talk about the vision. You heard him talk about ambition. You
heard Frank talk about how we're going to reimagine the partner experience and
elevate their experience with Starbucks. Really, for me, what I want to share today is
that we are a strong brand that is poised for growth, very strong brand poised for
growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 28 of 75And I'll cover that in 3 parts. Really, it's about elevating the customer experience, and
I'll start with the essence of the Starbucks brand, and how we are adapting and
evolving the third place, which you've heard so much about, about the Starbucks
over the years, a how we are adopting that for a completely new era. Second, you
will hear about the strength of our brand position and the incredible growth
potential that it represents. And I'll conclude by sharing some of the key accelerators
in our reinvention plan.
But let's start with the essence of Starbucks. Right in the center of the center of the
circle here. If you really distill Starbucks down to its essence, you'll ﬁnd 2 most
essential elements, and you've heard them repeatedly today, coﬀee and human
connection.
Now I want to focus on that sense of connection for a minute. Fundamentally, we
believe in the value of human connection. And we believe that there will be an
increasing premium on oﬀering genuine human connection in the world over time.
Now, at Starbucks, human connection means a sense of belonging with a sense of
kindness and care, someone seeking to get to know you and service that is deeply
personalized. That is what makes Starbucks, Starbucks.
Now for many years, you've heard Starbucks deﬁned as the third place, a place of
connection outside of work in home, and that's been the center of our success both
as a business but also as a brand.
And naturally, and we've seen this play out in headlines. Some people in this fast
pace, on-the-go convenience driven marketplace have wondered what is the role of
the third place now? What's the role of the third place in the future? So here's a
critical insight. As Starbucks continues to grow, the third place isn't going away.
We're growing it to more places than ever. We actually have more third places now
than ever in our history around the world, 97% of our stores have seating, but we've
expanded the concept of the third place and we're reaching people in new ways,
where they need us to meet them in places like drive-thru, pickup stores, delivery,
mobile order and in digital channels.
But let's go deeper than that. Let's really look at what the third place is. The third
place, yes, it is a place -- but what we've come to understand over 51 years, and
certainly, I have in my 21 years with the company is that the third place is also a
feeling. And that might sound a bit squishy, but we look at it very deeply. What it
means is thoughtful, caring service, someone making an eﬀort to get to know you.
We measure that. And here's the key point.
The third place has never been solely deﬁned by 4 walls or a physical location. It has
always been about that feeling. It's the relationships that we form in our stores every
single day. We call that the third place connection. And that feeling of that third
place connection is more valuable than ever. You can read any analysis of society
these days, and they all say the same thing. There is an epidemic of loneliness, inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 29 of 75isolation and disconnection. We are in desperate need of more human connection.
So we actually measure human connection in our scores. And what we see is that the
feeling of being cared for by a Starbucks partner drives our brand and drives our
business.
That feeling of care carries 3x the weight of any other factor at driving brand aﬃnity
and preference for Starbucks. Caring is what drives our business. So it is not some
squishy notion. It actually is what drives our business, and it drives our brand and
Starbucks leads the industry in care. But we're expanding that third place
connection. That connection is no longer constrained by the 4 walls of a store or any
physical location at all. We're serving customers across all of our channels. So we
increasingly do that in formats that allow us to connect with more customers and a
bigger audience than ever.
We're connecting with customers in their cars. We're connecting with customers on
their doorsteps. We're connecting with customers in digital channels. And truly, we
are building connections and loyalty at Starbucks far beyond anything we would
have thought possible when I started at Starbucks. Today, in the U.S. business, we
reached about 75 million individual customers each month. Those customers visit
multiple times a month. If we take that internationally, we see 100 million customers
a week.
If we add in our consumer packaged goods occasions, we are reaching 400 million
customer occasions a week around the world, a week $400 million -- it's incredible.
The more connections we create, the stronger our brand and the stronger our
business. The ﬂywheel of Starbucks begins with that connection. It is our
diﬀerentiation. It provides us scale and it provides us strength. Now the third place
and the third place connection is who Starbucks has always been and it's stronger
than ever.
Now we stayed true to who we are, throughout all these 51 years, but we've had
dramatic shifts in how we serve the customer. And I want to share some realities you
heard a little bit about earlier that illustrate this dramatic shift in our business over
the past 5 years. And again, I have a question for you, but you don't have to answer it
out loud, but I want you to think about this. If we went back in time 5 years and
shared a vivid picture of today's marketplace, and all of the challenges that exist,
how many would have questioned Starbucks relevance and is Starbucks could even
succeed?
So let's talk about some of those shifts. If we had said 5 years ago that the consumer
of the future would be primarily seeking a drive-through experience that many
consumers would expect to order through their phones, not at a counter. The 2 out
of 3 consumers would be seeking a cold beverage and cold coﬀee, not hot coﬀee.
How many would have declared Starbucks as less relevant or maybe very challenged
to succeed or losing its advantage.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 30 of 75Let's go a little bit further. If we had shared that the pandemic that there would be a
pandemic and that, that would have accelerated at-home coﬀee consumption that
oﬃces would still be at a fraction of their pre-Covid occupancy and that restaurant
spending, as we just saw in June was down year-over-year. If we had shared all of
that information. A vivid picture of those things probably would have been a
pessimistic outlook for Starbucks.
Here we are today, 2 out of 3, 70% of customers are seeking a cold coﬀee beverage
at Starbucks. We're seeing drive-through at 50% of our business. Mobile order is
25%. Delivery is growing 20% year-over-year. And a footnote, in June, we saw
restaurant spending down 3% in the U.S. Coﬀee shops were up 2%. What does that
tell you about the resilience of the coﬀee category and therefore, also the resilience
of Starbucks. Under these challenging conditions, Starbucks hasn't struggled, we
have thrived. Our business is more -- is stronger than ever, and our brand, as you can
see, is more relevant than ever.
How do we know this to be true. I want to share some additional information about
our U.S. business. Before I do that, earlier, you heard about the currency of
Starbucks. What is it that drives the Starbucks business?
The currency of Starbucks has proven all of those challenges that you have seen, the
currency of Starbucks is coﬀee, and the currency of Starbucks success is our partners
and the connections they create with our customers. That is what makes Starbucks,
Starbucks. It allows us to deﬁne headwinds that other businesses struggle with. It's
truly about human connection. We measure it. It's real. It's what drives our brand and
that's what drives our business.
Now I want to call out some important points about this. Over the past few years, as
we have seen these shifts, it has not been easy for our partners. Our stores were built
for a diﬀerent era, an era that didn't anticipate the volume and complexity of the
business that we would see today. And that is why we are reinventing.
We're reinventing to increase the capacity of our stores to handle the demand that
we're seeing and at the same time, reduce the eﬀort that it takes from our partners to
serve that business. And ultimately, what we're trying to do through our reinvention
is make some of those tasks and that burden go away to enable our partners to
focus on what they love to do. They tell us this every single day.
What I want to do is craft the world's best coﬀee beverages. I want to connect with
my fellow partners and I want to connect with customers. That's what we're here to
do. Now John Culver is going to share a lot more details coming soon about how
we're going to go and achieve that very soon after my presentation.
Now connection is who Starbucks has always been, and we have a heritage of
continuously adapting as you saw to those shifts. And one of the ways that we're
doing that is we're taking customers to the future is meeting an increasing need for
convenience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 31 of 75Starbucks has had to very quickly adapt to these convenient driven convenience-
driven on-the-go channels. It started with drive-thru years ago. We went to mobile
order. We've gone to delivery. We've opened up pickup stores and so many more.
And what has emerged for us is a very strategic intersection that is absolutely
packed with potential for Starbucks, and that is the intersection between uplifting,
third place connection and eﬀortless convenience.
Now that evolving intersection that is moving so quickly is something that Starbucks
owns globally, and we call it experiential convenience. Experiential convenience that
nobody else can deliver, experiential, not transactional, an uplifting, connected,
personal and personalized experience wherever the customer is on the go. Now I
want to talk a little bit about how we're delivering that, and I want to show this video
from a customer that she shared on TikTok.
(presentation)
I love that. I mean, that story happened in the drive-through, out the drive-thru
window. When we talk about experiential convenience, it's uplifting connection,
meaning eﬀortless convenience. We met her in her car and delivered that kind of
experience that made her want to share that story through TikTok. Now up on the
screen here, I want to introduce Malcolm. We did a store visits in New York City. A lot
of you probably came from New York, so welcome.
Outside of Penn Station and the Penn Plaza store, we wanted to go and understand
why there was one store that had such high customer connection scores. So we went
to the store, and I'll tell you right now, I could hear the music in the store before we
even went in. When we went in, all the partners were looking great. They had their
shirts, very cool shirts on. They all look the same with the shirts and they all had their
own unique hat that gave a little piece of their personality. There were no seats in the
store.
What I saw was incredible that led me to understand a little bit better about why our
customer connection scores were so high in this store. There were about 15
customers congregating around the handoﬀ plane, and you can see here the
number of beverages that have been mobile ordered, waiting to be picked up by
customers. Every single customer was smiling, and they were smiling because of
Malcolm, who was dancing every customer, their drink.
Now all the people who were in the store, not a single person was looking at their
phone. Beyond say was playing overhead, and I won't try and recreate Malcolm
dance, but it was very good. A customer came in and her name was Christen. -- she
was like, excuse me, I have a drink for and he was like, Kristen, I've got you. He goes
over and hands her beverage. And she said, "I also got and he goes water. I know
I'm on it, and he went over and grabbed her water and handed it to it. Not a single
customer was looking at their phone. Every single person was smiling and everyone
left feeling just a little bit better than when they walked in.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 32 of 75That is experiential convenience and partners like Malcolm are making that happen
today. And when we hear from customers about what that experiential convenience
looks like to them, we hear things like Starbucks is my secret superpower or you had
my back. And during the pandemic, what we heard from customers was literally --
this was a description from a customer. She said, Starbucks is my micro moment of
self-care. It's the one person I talk to outside of my home each day, and I speciﬁcally
leave my house to get some interaction.
Experiential convenience is about knowing you and exactly what you need right now
in this moment to take on whatever is next in your day. And that strategic
diﬀerentiation that Starbucks oﬀers of coﬀee, connection and convenience is more
relevant and diﬀerentiating than ever. So let's take a look at the U.S. business. How
do we know that, that relevance is true. Our weekly active customer base is the
largest in our history.
We have more customers than ever in Starbucks history. If we look at some of the
other dimensions of success, market share, number one, brand aﬃnity, the degree to
which customers love Starbucks, number one in the marketplace, and we maintain
the number one spot for Starbucks, for away-from-home coﬀee purchases, ﬁrst
choice. Starbucks is the ﬁrst choice for coﬀee away from home. Now what does that
look like around the world?
In China, same story. In Japan, same story. Brazil, same story. Turkey, I don't have
enough time to go through all 82 markets, but I will tell you that those things are
globally consistent. Brand aﬃnity leader, ﬁrst choice leader. And it just reinforces that
these strengths that we have are enduring and relevant, and they're driving our
market leadership. It is a very strong foundation for future growth. Now let's go even
deeper on why our best days are ahead of us.
The U.S. customer base is young. The majority of our customers in the U.S. business
are now Gen Z and millennials. I'd like to say that you kind of write the story in your
mind that Starbucks customers came in maybe with you've got mail, and then Devil
Wear's product kind of aged with the company, not true. The majority of our
customers are now GenZ and millennials. And the younger you go, the stronger our
brand aﬃnity gets. Gen Z has the highest brand love for Starbucks of any age cohort.
And as the U.S. diversiﬁes and we look at the brand strength of diﬀerent multicultural
audiences, among away from home consumers or away-from-home coﬀee
consumers that identify as Latin X, African-American, Asian-American, our aﬃnity
goes higher still. So when we think about Starbucks being a strong brand that is
poised for growth, our ability to adapt and innovate has earned a relevance and love
as a brand.
Our customer base is young, and the younger you go, the stronger the brand gets as
the U.S. diversiﬁes the stronger our brand gets. It all adds up again to a strong brand
that's poised for growth, a strong brand with massive growth potential. So how areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 33 of 75we going to unleash it? I want to share some of the accelerators that we have in our
reinvention plan.
Now customers tell us, as you probably tasted with your pistachio beverage.
Customers tell us they're loyal to Starbucks because in part, they ﬁnd a beverage
they literally can't buy anywhere else. And that beverage is coﬀee. And today, that
means increasingly, it is a cold, customized plant-based beverage. In the U.S.
business now, the majority of our customers are seeking a cold beverage, around
70%, and that peaks at 80% during the summer months.
Platforms like Cold Brew, Nitro, Iced Shaken Espresso, have elevated traditional
coﬀee categories. They're commanding a premium price, they're driving our sales,
and they are among our highest margin products. And they're also more frequently
customized. So when you think about that elevated handcrafted experience at
Starbucks. -- cold customized plant-based beverages is where it's at. When we talk
about customization, that's modiﬁers like adding espresso shots, adding ﬂavors. It's
increasingly customers choosing plant-based milks as well as new experiences like
cold foams like you had this morning.
That increase in customization has resulted in beverage modiﬁer sales of more than
$1 billion a year in our U.S. business. Now our unique heritage and capabilities in
handcrafting customized beverages, plus the range of our menu is perfectly suited
for the Gen Z social media, create and share, generation. As people discover a
beverage they love, they want to share it online. I mean, we literally have billions and
billions of views on TikTok of hashtag, Starbucks drinks. I know personally when I go
to the drive-through with my 3 teenagers, I have to turn, calm their menu items down
because I feel bad ﬁrst has to make it.
The customization is what customers want. Truly today. Starbucks is uniquely able to
deliver those beverages, and it's accelerating our growth. We've been in business for
more than 51 years, and customers are doing things with coﬀee, we never could have
even imagined. And here's what's interesting. We're growing from our core. After 51
years, coﬀee is what is driving our business.
As we look at espresso, now espresso, this is the ﬁrst beverage category we oﬀered
at Starbucks. Espresso is driving our business. In fact, Iced Espresso is now our
largest product category, and it's also our fastest-growing category. That's
something that most businesses strive for, especially after 51 years driving from our
core, cold, customized coﬀee, it's where the customer is going. It's where we're
taking them, it's where we lead, and that means the customer is coming to
Starbucks.
So where are we going to go next? We have an incredible pipeline of coﬀee
beverages, all based on Iced Espresso, Cold Brew, Nitro, we also have Hot Coﬀee
innovation. And you'll be tasting a lot of these products today. I know you've already
had a fair amount of coﬀee. But I want to talk about hot brewed coﬀee for a second.
You saw Howard talk about Clover Vertica.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 34 of 75Today, in our stores, we oﬀer a lot of diﬀerent coﬀees. But with the launch of Clover
Vertica, it's going to allow you to have a freshly ground, freshly-brewed cup of the
world's best coﬀee in 30 seconds or less. It uses proprietary Clover technology to
brew coﬀee in what I call high deﬁnition. It's the equivalent of a French press. It
brings out incredible nuances in each cup of coﬀee and it allows us to oﬀer some of
the amazing variety of Starbucks coﬀees all day long where customers can choose,
including decaf all day long, which is something that customers have asked us for
years to oﬀer.
Now whether the coﬀee beverage is hot or cold, espresso or cold brew, we're
increasingly using proprietary technology that Starbucks built in-house as only
Starbucks can to elevate the categories and elevate craft and elevate quality. These
are cutting-edge innovations that raise the bar on coﬀee quality, making it much
easier for our partners to not just craft incredible beverages, but serve customers the
highest quality coﬀee in the world. Coﬀee is at the center of who we are. And it will
continue to serve as a key accelerator of our business and our growth as Starbucks
takes the lead on what customers love and our partners are proud to deliver.
Now though coﬀee is our core. We also know that increasingly, customers are
seeking out food at Starbucks, and food is another growth accelerator for us. Again,
you'll see some of this downstairs in the trial lab. But increasingly, customers are
adding food as a complement to their beverage, enough so that it's driving today
20% year-over-year growth in food sales at Starbucks. It wasn't that long ago that
customers maybe 1 in 5 were adding food to their order. And today, 2 in 5, about
40% of customers now add food to their order.
And with a strong convenience-driven on-the-go customer of today, what they're
seeking is one-handed meals. That's what we've called it. one-handed meals
because often they have a phone on the other hand or maybe a steering wheel. So
breakfast sandwiches have been incredible for us with a success at 19% year-over-
year growth. Just to give you a sense of scale, our U.S. company-operated business
is on track to sell more than 300 million breakfast sandwiches this year, $300 million
and over 100 million egg bites.
So when you think about that scale and the expertise it requires, it's another
competitive moat for us as Starbucks scales and builds its business. But we're still in
the early days of food, whether in the U.S. or around the world, we have market tests
right now that are pushing the edges of what we plan to do with food. This includes
things like fresh baking pastries in our stores every day.
It includes things like portable salads, healthier options, more plant-based items and
egg products that raise the bar on quality in our stores. So we'll continue to innovate
on food, fresher, healthier, innovative, thoughtfully crafted food and food will
continue to drive our ticket as a craveable complement to our beverages.
Speaking of acceleration, let's talk about digital. So you've heard about experiential
convenience and Starbucks' unique ability to meet customers wherever they're at.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 35 of 75Our digital vision is that your perfect order is always just one tap away no matter
where you are. And in our reinvention plan, that is also at the center. We now have
more than 58 million Starbucks Rewards members around the world, $27 million in
the U.S. That's up 13% year-over-year or nearly 60% increase since -- before the
pandemic.
Another way to look at is 1 in 10 U.S. adults is a Starbucks Rewards member. More
than half of U.S. transactions are now from our rewards members, half. And as a new
member joins what we see is that they're spending with Starbucks and their
frequency with Starbucks increases signiﬁcantly. When they start to mobile order, it
goes higher still. The convenience of Starbucks Rewards is attracting and developing
our young, most loyal and aﬄuent customers. Convenience matters. Truly, it's driving
our business.
But we need to make important improvements to our convenience options like
mobile order. And so at the center of our reinvention, we'll be doing things with
mobile order to make it easier for customers to order, make it easier for our partners
to receive those orders and help reduce the stress of peak when they see so many
mobile orders coming in.
We're also extending the mobile order experience to more stores. Today, we deliver
an inconsistent experience between our company-operated stores and our licensed
stores. So we're extending Mobile Order and Starbucks Rewards to more locations.
In our U.S. company-operated stores, we oﬀer a holistic experience, mobile order,
more star redemption options and Starbucks Rewards. But when you think about
licensed stores and grocery stores, airports and other locations, we don't
consistently oﬀer that same experience. So we are committed to oﬀering the same
experience across all stores. And the technology we're going to use to do that is
called Starbucks Connect.
More than 1,400 stores -- licensed stores have adopted Starbucks Connect and what
that means is that they're oﬀering mobile order and Starbucks Rewards and the full
holistic experience and what we see as signiﬁcant increases in both rewards usage
as well as mobile order and all of that drives incremental spending in those
locations. So with roughly 80% of our licensed store portfolio yet to implement
Starbucks Connect, we see that as a signiﬁcant growth opportunity to drive
membership and also member engagement with Starbucks Rewards.
Now I'd also like to take a little bit of a wider look with our Starbucks Rewards
program and just share some other facts. So when customers are on the go, they
seek out Starbucks. In fact, Starbucks is one of the most searched brands on Google
Maps, more than McDonald's, more than Dunkin', more than Pete's and more than
many others combined, incredible. So if we can make it easier to order from within
mapping applications, we see that as a signiﬁcant opportunity.
When a customer wants to give a meaningful everyday gift, they're choosing
Starbucks. Starbucks is one of the most gifted brands in the world, so much so thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 36 of 75last December, Starbucks sold more gift cards than Apple, Google, Home Depot and
Target, combined. Starbucks in so many ways is a currency of kindness. It's one of
the most gifted brands in the world in the world, and we're making it easier to give
the gift of Starbucks.
And I'd like to point out something else under the surface. In the U.S. business,
nearly half of all customer spending is prepaid, prepaid. Think about the strategic
advantage and preference for Starbucks, when nearly half of all spending is prepaid,
customers paying for their future visits to Starbucks. Now there's one thing I haven't
spoken about much yet, and that is delivery.
I mentioned that it was up 20% year-over-year. Our delivery business is highly
incremental. What we've discovered is that customers are choosing delivery when
they can't get to Starbucks. The ticket is about twice that of our retail stores. Our
relationship with Uber has allowed us to reach more customers and even new
customers and new occasions than we could before.
And going forward, delivery represents a signiﬁcant growth opportunity for us that
we anticipate to double in revenue in the next couple of years. Now an accelerator of
that is alongside Uber Eats, we're bringing DoorDash to market. We just launched a
recent pilot, and we'll be taking DoorDash to national scale in 2023, which we
believe will signiﬁcantly accelerate this incremental opportunity for Starbucks.
Now honestly, whenever or wherever you are, Starbucks can now serve you, whether
it's in your car, on your doorstep, on the beach, wherever you happen to be,
Starbucks, wherever you want it. Starbucks is a very strong brand, poised for growth,
and we'll continue to build on these experiences and experiential convenience for
our customers. So creating opportunities for meaningful connection. I talked about
the importance of connection, but between our customers and our partners is
critical. And at the center of that is Starbucks Rewards.
Our member base is made up of our most loyal and engaged customers, and the
program has become one of the most reliable business drivers for Starbucks but we
see signiﬁcant opportunities to grow the program ahead. We know these customers
are highly engaged, and we're able to engage them in a very personalized ways, but
these untapped opportunities, some of them are just right in front of us.
Increasing awareness of the program, increasing perceived value and making it
easier to sign up for Starbucks Rewards are the top 3 ways, we can simply drive
growth of this program and attract more members. So I'm going to talk about how
we'll do that through a program called reward together.
So we've selected a group of the world's leading brands, and we've invited them to
link their loyalty programs with Starbucks. So this will enable us to reward members
of both brands, adding new beneﬁts and new experiences that were not possible
before, while increasing customer lifetime value. Imagine earning miles faster at
Starbucks with your favorite airline through your everyday purchases at Starbucks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 37 of 75Imagine earning Stars when you shop with your favorite retailer. Imagine joining
Starbucks Rewards so easily by just tapping one button in another brand's loyalty
program.
This is going to be a very powerful driver for us to drive membership growth as well
as engagement and help drive customer lifetime value. We're going to be
announcing one of our ﬁrst U.S. based partnerships in October coming right around
the corner. Now lastly, you might be wondering with Starbucks as a digital leader in
such strong reach among digitally savvy customers, how are we thinking about
Web3 technologies. You've heard about blockchain, NFT, Metaverse. How can we
put these technologies to use with the Starbucks brand with this brand?
I'd like to introduce Starbucks Odyssey. You heard about it yesterday. It is a
groundbreaking Web 3-enabled experience at Starbucks and our next big
innovation in loyalty. It is a very exciting extension of our Starbucks Rewards
program, and I want to share a little bit of preview before I share more about the
program itself.
(presentation)
All right. So here's how it will work. Members will go on Starbucks Odyssey journeys.
And the journeys will encourage customers to go deeper in their coﬀee knowledge.
They'll have quizzes, they'll have games, They'll have an opportunity to learn about
coﬀee. We'll engage customers in gamiﬁed challenges and will reward their
engagement with Starbucks, whether it's in our stores or in digital communities.
Through these achievements, they will earn digital, collectible stamps. Those stamps
are created with NFT technology. We'll also oﬀer opportunities for members to buy
and even sell those digital collectible stamps in a built-in marketplace within
Starbucks Odyssey. And whether you earn these stamps or buy these stamps, they
will unlock access to beneﬁts and experiences that were never possible before.
Now it was really important for us to align our approach in this space with our
environmental commitments. So we chose the Polygon blockchain technology. But I
have to say when I say that, that no customer will be required to know that. In fact,
many customers will not even understand that they are working on a blockchain or
with NFTs because Starbucks is easy and accessible for everyone. That is what we're
trying to do with this, just as we did with WiFi, just as we did with mobile payment.
Just as we did with mobile order, making leading-edge technologies accessible to
all of our customers and deepening their love and engagement with Starbucks.
No one will have to have a crypto wallet, no one will have to know about
cryptocurrencies to participate. Now importantly, Odyssey members will not just be
able to connect with Starbucks, but for the ﬁrst time, we're creating a digital third
place where members will be able to connect with each other in a dedicated digital
community. We're oﬀering this new game-changing way for customers to own theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

and in real-world customer experience.
We could not be more excited to bring this to life. Not only will this bridge digital
and physical worlds, it will start in the U.S. and a similar model will follow in China,
within China speciﬁc digital ecosystem. And in the weeks ahead, you'll hear a lot
more about this when we invite customers and potentially some of you into the full.
So just to close out, in our essence, we are in the business of uplifting people. That's
why I've been at Starbucks and have stayed at Starbucks for 21 years because I
genuinely believe in the mission of the company.
I genuinely believe in our promise to uplift the every day for customers. And I
believe that, that promise is more needed than ever. People are longing for
connection, connection over coﬀee. We do this better than anybody, whether it's in
our stores or whether it's in digital channels, the connection that Starbucks creates is
worth something.
Yes. It drives loyalty. It commands a premium price, but it's globally scalable, but at
the same time, relevant in the local community.
And it's more relevant now than 50 years ago. We are an exceptionally strong brand,
and we are poised for growth. All of that leads me in everything that you've seen
here, leads me to one conﬁdent declaration, and that is that our best days are truly
ahead of us. I'd like to turn it over to John Culver.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. It's great to welcome everybody back to Seattle, and I
realize that it's been a long morning. And so I appreciate your attention. As I talk
through how we're going to bring this to life in our stores. And I'm very excited to
have the opportunity to represent all the great work that our team has done around
the reinvention in the U.S.
Over the last 2 decades, I've had the opportunity and the great privilege I would say,
of seeing the best of Starbucks around the world. And it's during that time, I've had a
front row seat at witnessing many of the major milestones in this journey. Today, I
would say that we ﬁnd ourselves at another unique moment, a moment where we
can redeﬁne what a new era of accelerated growth can be.
In a moment that challenges us to reinvent and think diﬀerently about our futures.
Now Frank talked about our partners. Our partners have come to expect more from
us. Brady shared about our customers, and our customers have also come to expect
more from us.
And it's clear, and I'm going to talk about this, it's clear that our physical stores have
to change. Our physical stores were built for a diﬀerent era, and we have to
modernize in order to meet this moment. Now what is unique about this moment isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 39 of 75that this reinvention plan is the product of co-creation, co-creation with our partners.
We've held over 200 sessions around the country. We've held them in our stores.
We've held them in our roasting facilities. We've also held them here at the support
center. And for the ﬁrst time ever, we have a comprehensive plan on how we're
going to reinvent this company together as partners.
The pride product of all this work has been, we are deﬁning new ways of working.
We're focused on enabling smaller, more nimble teams, in order to drive faster
decisions and make us more eﬀective in the market. Frank shared, we're focused on
the most important work that we have clearly deﬁned for the company.
And I would say that over the 20 years that I've been with the company, that it has
never been clear on what our priorities are and more importantly, what we expect to
deliver with those priorities from a ﬁnancial perspective. But what I'm most proud
about around this work is that it allows us to tap into this next generation of
leadership and really set the momentum and set the course for this new era that
we're embarking on.
The goals of the reinvention are very clear. We will increase partner engagement. We
will increase customer engagement. We will drive accelerated revenue growth in a
meaningful way, and we will also drive increased margins as part of our plan. Now
the work itself is well underway, and we're beginning to see positive traction across
several key areas. We've improved retention in our stores. We've invested in training,
and we're developing our partners and giving them the conﬁdence to do their jobs
and the ability to connect with our customers.
And we've also invested a signiﬁcant amount in deploying new equipment
technology, which is helping us lead and drive productivity improvements. Now
there are other areas also that we're seeing improvements. We're seeing staﬃng in
our stores, come back to prepandemic levels. We've normalized hours of operations
across our entire store portfolio. And as Brady shared, we're also seeing our ability to
accelerate growth across multiple channels, whether that be mobile order and pay,
whether that be drive-thru, whether that be our cafes or whether that be through
delivery.
Now the reinvention itself sets the stage for this next phase of growth for the
company. And what I want to do is I want to share how we are reimagining the future
of our stores and what that looks like for our partners as well as our customers.
Today, in the U.S., we operate over 16,000 stores across the U.S. both company-
owned as well as licensed stores. And when we think about our investments for our
existing store portfolio, we think about delivering a few critical areas.
First and foremost, it's our ability as a company to reduce the complexity and make
work easier for our partners. Equally, it's important as we do that, that we allow our
partners the time to do what they do best, which is connect with our customers and
also at the same time, this notion of experiential convenience and delivering that
experiential convenience in a way that only Starbucks can do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 40 of 75It will be a true diﬀerentiator for us. Three key levers that we're focused on
simplifying the engine to drive greater throughput through our stores, leveraging
automation so that we can simplify the task and reduce the complexity of the work.
And for the future, as we think about our stores for the future, how do we design
more eﬃcient, more purpose-built stores to meet this moment.
Now it's also important to understand that as we reinvent, as we think diﬀerently, we
do so through the lens of our values of who we are as a company. Going forward, we
will increase accessibility in our stores. We'll do it in a way that creates an inclusive
environment for everyone. And we'll always build our stores with an eye and a lens
through sustainability and giving back more than we take. Now our existing store
portfolio represents our greatest strength. It represents our greatest deeds and it
represents the greatest opportunity that we have.
And our investments are squarely prioritized in this area. So let me go deeper on
what those investments look like and how it's going to help us simplify the
operations. In ﬁscal '23, we will invest an incremental $450 million in our existing
store base with continued investments in '24 and '25. The investments are designed
to help us become more eﬃcient, help us unlock capacity and also, at the same time,
help us increase throughput in our stores.
Now a key cornerstone of the reinvention are the investments that we're making and
continue to make on deploying more eﬃcient equipment. We've already made
investments in the areas of new Mastrena machines and introduce those across the
store portfolio in the U.S. We've added new warming ovens now out into our stores.
And we've also introduced a new proprietary Cold Brew system. And what we'll do
over the course of this year and into early FY '23 is we will have this equipment
package fully rolled out across our entire U.S. portfolio.
And I think it's important to note that what we see from this is meaningful savings of
time for our partners to do the work that they want to do and allow them to connect
directly with customers. We're seeing returns on the investments we're making in this
area. A proof point here is that in our drive-thrus, where we have deployed this
equipment already, we are seeing an improved out the window time. And it's clear
that this new equipment leads to increased revenue. And also at the same time,
allows us to more eﬃciently support the growing demand that we're seeing from our
customers.
These 2 early proof points, more time for our partners to serve customers, increase
revenues. Those 2 proof points give us the conﬁdence that these are absolutely
positively, the right investments to make at this moment in time to create a better
experience for everyone. And in addition, allow us to grow our margins over time.
Now the second area of the reinvention program centers around leveraging
automation to help us simplify the task and remove complexity. And there are 2
enablers to automation. First is how are we going to reimagine our supply chain for
the future. And second, how are we going to make the right investments in
technology to make that work easier.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 41 of 75Now later today, Deb will come up and talk about speciﬁcs around technology
investments. What I want to do is go a little bit deeper as it relates to supply chain. To
date, we've implemented automated ordering across all our stores for food as well
as our merchandise. This work that we've done on automation has enabled us to
reduce the time spent by partners doing manual counting of SKUs on a daily basis.
We've eliminated that, for food as well as for our merchandise.
In addition, we're leveraging our analytics and insights team, which has enabled us
to get the right products, in the right stores, at exactly the right time. We're seeing
beneﬁts from this. What it's done is it's allowed us and driven increased sales. It's
driven a higher food attach for us. And also it's given us the opportunity to drive
meaningful waste reduction in our stores. Now going forward, we're working on
automated ordering for our beverage category, which we intend to roll out across all
U.S. stores in the next few years. This is a huge unlock for us.
Now beyond automated ordering, we're also testing additional innovation like
automated accounting and receiving, new delivery capabilities for the supply chain.
And what this does, it allows the opportunity all these investments do to free up time
for our partners to connect with the customers and ultimately provide better labor
leverage for us.
Simply said, automation for our supply chain creates a triple win. It's a win for our
partners and simplifying the work they're doing. It's a win for our customers by
increasing product availability and it's a win for our business as we accelerate
revenue and expand our margins.
So now let me take a minute and let's shift to '24 and '25 and what you can expect.
Today, we're serving more customers than ever. And those customers, as Brady
shared are looking for more customization, ordering more items, with each order
and wanting to transact with us through multiple channels. That's why we have to
reimagine the store environment and put the foot on the accelerator on our plans to
design purpose-built stores for our partners and for our customers.
Now a key area of the focus in this redesign is new innovation in beverage and food
production. By unlocking beverage and food production, we will signiﬁcantly reduce
the complexity for our partners. And as you've heard from Brady, customer demand
for cold beverages are expected to continue outpacing hot beverage growth in the
coming years. Cold beverages are increasingly more complex. They are more time
consuming and the surge in volume has caused bottlenecks in our stores.
Now keeping up with this demand has challenged our partners and their ability to
balance speed, craft and connection. But it's not just about simplifying beverage
production. The time it takes for us to deliver our warm food has to also be
improved. And what I want to do now is I want to give you a glimpse to what the
future will look like and introduce you to a game changer. And by doing that, I want
to introduce our new faster proprietary Siren system. The Siren system is designed toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

been created, cocreated with our partners down in the Tryer Center.
It improves quality and consistency while creating the capacity to meet the growing
demands for customization across both hot, cold beverages as well as warming our
food. And to demonstrate the new Siren system, I want to take you live and in person
to the tryer Center and introduce you to Sarah Trilling, our President of North
America, who is joined by 2 Seattle area baristas, Jalan Procter [ph] and Lisa Cost

Wonderful, John. Thank you so much. It's fantastic to be here. Again, I'm Sarah
Trilling. I'm down in our tryer center, and you all are going to have a chance to join
us later this afternoon through a few rotation. So really think of this as a sneak peak
into some of the innovation that you'll be seeing later on. Before I go any further, I
think I need to take a moment and allow the partners I'm with, to introduce
themselves.
I am Jalan Procter [ph], and I'm a 7-year partner.
I am Lisa Cost [ph], I'm a 3-year partner.
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you, Both. All right. So here's what's going to happen next. We're
going to focus on cold beverage. We're also going to focus on food. And to get
started, Jalan is actually going to make us a Mocha Frappuccino, and she's going to
do this on our existing station, essentially, the way that we make Frappuccino and
9,000 of our company-operated stores today. I'm going to actually time it, I think.
Are you all right with that? Okay. So you got to give me one second. So let me get
oﬀ my timer here, and we're going to get going. Are you ready -- all right. Let's do it.
So what I want you to pay special attention to is the bending, the reaching, the
touching, the number of steps that Jalan is taking. And I'm actually going to go quiet
here for most of the cycle time because I actually want you to focus on all the activity
that goes into making our Mocha Frappuccino. All right.
You may think that she is about wrapped up, but actually there's more. She's got to
do the whip.
Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you very much. So that was about 83 seconds or so to
make the Frappuccino on our existing station. So here is what we're going to do
next. So I'm going to take you over. We're going to go look at our new Siren systemFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

why don't we actually jump in. Lisa, can you tell us what do you like about the new
station?
Honestly, I love how the Iced is suspend right here. It is super easy, super simple.
Currently, we have to use these big buckets to carry ice up from the back. It gets
pretty heavy. We get to do it about every hour or so and to do all day long. But the
new Siren system, we can get ice in the few -- click of a few buttons.
And this is so simple, so easy, I honestly love it.
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
Wonderful. We'd love to hear from Jalan as well. Jalan, can you share with us a little
bit about what you think about the existing station or the new Siren system called
Beverage Station. What is it that comes to mind?
Yes. My favorite part about the new station is that there's less movement involved. So
there is no bending. There's less turning in usually after a long day of doing all of
those movements. I'm pretty exhausted. So this helps prevent that.
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
Wonderful. Thank you both. Thanks for sharing. All right. So that is cold beverage,
but we all know in order to actually see the productivity enhancements that we're
looking for in our stores, we can't just sell for cold beverage. We have to sell for the
total system. And so what I'd like to do next is to introduce a few additional partners
who will help us by walking us through what's happening in food in terms of
innovation.

Thank you. Thanks to you both. And again, that gives you a sneak peek of some of
the innovation that's happening here in our Tryer Center. We are very much looking
forward to showcasing additional enhancements that we're making when you're
down with us later this afternoon. So I think we'll wrap it here.
And John, back over to you.
{BIO 15817924 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Sara. I told you it was a game changer for us, right? And truly, this is
the future for us as it relates to the Siren System, how we deliver both cold as well as
hot beverages and then complement that with food and food warming. So a huge
unlock for our partners.
It's a huge unlock for our customers, and it's a big win in helping us become more
eﬀective and more eﬃcient and doing our jobs to serve our customers every day.
And it clearly demonstrates our ability as a company to lead to challenge ourselves,
to challenge the status quo and to really reinvent for the future as we think about the
possibilities that exist. But beyond the cold beverage and food.
Our engineers have also been worked at work developing a new modernized
proprietary piece of equipment. A piece of equipment that delivers the freshest cup
of coﬀee ever, on demand, at a push with a button and oﬀers a broader variety of
unique ﬂavors any time of day.
Now the new Clover Vertica System, as I shared, is a product that is able to freshly
grind and brew a cup of coﬀee on demand in 30 seconds. And it really focuses on
that single touch of a button to deliver that freshly brewed cup of coﬀee. And this is
a game changer in terms of how we deliver brewed coﬀee to our customers.
Not only does it improve quality, but it also improves waste and allows us to reduce
the amount of coﬀee that goes to waste each and every day in our stores. But we
don't stop there. Another game-changing technology that we have worked on, and
the team has developed is our proprietary cold pressed, cold brew technology. And
this does both cold coﬀee as well as cold espresso. And let me put this one into
context. Currently, in our stores, Cold Brew is steep for 20 hours, and it takes more
than 20 steps to make across 16,000 stores, 365 days a year, it takes a lot of time,
and it's a pain point for our partners.
This new technology that I'm talking about enables us to deliver the same great
tasting cold brew product in a matter of seconds, a matter of seconds and in fewer
than 4 steps. It's a step change in innovation and it's signiﬁcant. And when you
consider that we spend over $50 million a year on labor to brew our cold coﬀee.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 46 of 75This is a signiﬁcant game changer for us from 20 steps to 4 from 20 hours to a matter
of seconds, we are completely reinventing the experience for our partners and for
our customers through how we're producing the beverages and warming our food
in our stores. So better beverages, delivered more quickly, less strain on our
partners.
You can see ﬁrsthand with the new Siren System, we'll be able to do to enhance the
experience for all. And you're going to get the opportunity a little bit later to see that
as you tour the Siren Center. So all 3 of these levers that I've talked through,
simplifying operations, leveraging automation.
I now want to get into how we're going to design more eﬃcient purpose-built stores
as we head to the future. and ultimately create a much more strategic advantage for
Starbucks to deliver the accelerated growth and the margin growth for the long
term. So as we've built the reinvention, we've built it for our stores, and we've
leveraged our insights and our market planning data. And that's important to note.
And what we see is an incredible opportunity, incredible opportunity to further
accelerate and expand our new store footprint across the U.S.
Over the next 3 years, we expect our net new stores to grow approximately 3% to
4%. That's up from 3% that we previously communicated at our last Investor Day.
When you think about the formats, today, drive-throughs make up 40% of our U.S.
store portfolio. And as we previously shared with all of you, drive-throughs, deliver
higher returns and overall stronger ﬁnancial performance for the company.
Now we'll continue to accelerate our growth and drive through. But we also see
tremendous opportunity to broaden our portfolio and to think diﬀerently to meet
our customers' needs, cafes, delivery, pick up only or drive-through only will be
formats that will continue to develop and evolve and put out in the marketplace. This
is going to enable us to further unlock our channels to ensure we are meeting our
customers' needs wherever and whenever they want.
Now regardless of the format, our new stores will continue to deliver best-in-class
50% return on investment, continue to deliver a 2:1 sales to investment ratio and also
continue to drive 25% cash margins. And moving forward, as we design our
purpose-built stores, we're absolutely laser-focused on increasing our customers'
accessibility to Starbucks and ultimately, driving growth for Starbucks and our brand
by increasing our share of the addressable coﬀee market. Make no mistake about it.
So Frank previously shared our focus on the well-being of our partners. Brady shared
the opportunity that we have to unlock demand with our customers. And now,
hopefully, you have a better understanding how we're reimagining the third place
and accelerating our growth for our stores.
Now when you look across the areas of partner, customer in store, it's going to be
critical for us that we track our progress and that we hold ourselves accountable to
delivering the growth in revenue and the growth in margins that we expect.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 47 of 75Partner retention and labor leverage are 2 key metrics that we will track very closely.
But the most important metrics of all will continue to be partner engagement and
customer engagement because our history has proven that by delivering an
elevated experience for our partners, they, in turn, deliver an elevated experience for
our customers. This has always been the secret to our success, and it does not
change. We get more laser focused on that.
Now with partners and coﬀee at our core, the reinvention plan unlocks and will
deliver sustainable, proﬁtable growth in the future. And when I'm talking growth, I'm
talking abundant growth. Over the next 3 years, we will not only accelerate our store
growth. We will increase our revenue by approximately 40%, and we will continue to
deliver strong margin expansion as we think about the future. This is best-in-class
performance for all of you, best in class. And this plan, make no mistake, is built to
endure.
The plan and the work we've done has allowed us to think diﬀerently. It's allowed us
to respond diﬀerently. And it's allowed us to challenge what was as we embrace
what will be. Now the possibilities are endless when we're able to sit down and co-
create with our partners and build the future for Starbucks collectively together.
Let me also share that our partners have been very clear with us about the challenge
of meeting accelerating demand in their stores. The impact that the pandemic has
had on them and on their lives and the things that we must and will do better. Now
make no mistake, we feel a deep responsibility to get it right for our partners.
And on the subject of unionization, here's how we see it. There are 2 paths. We can
work together as partners side-by-side or we can have a third party between us. Now
working side by side we can eﬃciently deliver solutions that support our partners in
their jobs as well as in their lives, supporting their physical, ﬁnancial and mental well-
being.
At the same time, let me be clear that we're committed to respecting the NLRB
process. And we are now and will continue to bargain in good faith, bargain with the
stores who have chosen to have a third party represent them. Now over the last 20
years, I've had the opportunity to serve partners across the globe. And I have never
ever been more inspired or conﬁdent in the future that we are shaping for the
company as we move forward. And I'm also incredibly, incredibly conﬁdent in our
partners' ability to meet this moment.
Now at the end of this month, I will step down as the Chief Operating Oﬃcer for the
company. And it's hard for me to leave something that I love so much, a company
that I care about, partners that I care about and think about what's next in the future
for me and my family. But this is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do
because this sets up the next generation of leadership for the company. And I'm
extremely optimistic about our future. I want to thank more than 450,000 partners
around the world for their commitment to one another and their commitment to our
success as a company.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Hello, and good morning, everyone. Starbucks China has been navigating
unprecedented challenges since the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020. But if
there's any silver lining in all of this, it has forced us to further strengthen our focus,
our muscle and our operations, and the digital innovation we have introduced is
enabling us to deepen our connection with our customers.
Starbucks' values and the Starbucks Experience we deliver to our customers have
never been more relevant. In the video we just showed, you can just see the joy and
the renewed moments of connection that Starbucks has brought to our partners and
our customers with the reopening of our stores. I could not be more proud of our
China partners for the incredible courage and resilience serving and uplifting our
customers, communities and each other during the adversity.
Today, with a partial lifting of Covid restrictions in diﬀerent cities, I am very pleased
to report that our recovery in China is well underway. However, given ongoing
restrictions under China's dynamic zero-Covid policy and the unpredictability of the
future outbreaks, we remain vigilant, and our recovery path will continue to be
nonlinear. But we remain focused on delivering our long-term growth aspirations.
In 2 weeks, we will open our 6,000 stores in China. 2 years of almost an imaginable
disruption has not interfered without delivering on the commitments we made at our
2018 China Investor Day in Shanghai. And it's just not the speed but also the quality.

Our mobile ordering capabilities have grown from nothing to now driving over 40%
of our business in less than 4 years and enabling and supporting our business is a
ﬂexible, resilient and strengthen supply chain and distribution network as well as our
family of over 60,000 passionate and engaged partners.
Despite our growth, China's coﬀee market is still in its early stages with huge
potential to expand the addressable market. Per capita demand for coﬀee in China
will grow further from 12 cups per year to 14 cups by 2025. By comparison in Japan,
per capita consumption of coﬀee approaches 200 cups per year and in the U.S.
here, close to 380 cups. China's urbanization rate is expected to increase to 75% and
the number of middle-class households in China is expected to grow another 70% to
$395 million within this decade.
China's coﬀee market is about to enter a new era of growth and no coﬀee retailer is
better positioned than Starbucks to capture and beneﬁt from the growth ahead.
Covid has accelerated profound ships in Chinese consumer needs and behaviors.
These changes have required us to examine and evolve Starbucks' purpose growth -
- purpose-driven growth agenda for the next chapter of our journey.
And I'm very excited to unveil our newly evolved growth ﬂywheel fueled by 6 key
growth drivers that are each highly synergistic and mutually reinforcing. By growing
our store portfolio and expanding our omnichannel at home and on-the-go coﬀee
capabilities, we will eﬃciently acquire new customers and drive accelerating
Starbucks Rewards membership.
In addition, our eﬀorts to enhance member engagement, coﬀee leadership, product
innovation and partner experience will elevate the Starbucks Experience we deliver
to our customers. This will drive greater demand and vacancy across all channels.
Underpinning these growth engines are our relentless eﬀorts to drive productivity
and eﬃciency through digitalization and technology enablement as well as our
investments to strengthen our supply chain and coﬀee ecosystem.
At the core of our ﬂywheel is our commitment to uplifting our customers and our
communities. We strive to contribute to the growth of China's specialty coﬀee
industry and help establish the standard of coﬀee excellence from farm to cup
customers to communities. All of these combine to create a very unique and
powerful ﬂywheel eﬀect that will propel our growth in the years ahead.
Let me take you through them one by one. Over the past decade, we have grown
Starbucks footprint in China nearly tenfold to 6,000 stores. Store development will
remain a key growth engine for us in the years ahead. Our ambition is to enter 70
more new cities as well as to expand our store count by 50% more to operate 9,000
stores in China by 2025. 9,000 stores, this is close to the number of company-
operated stores in the U.S. today. It means we will open one new store nearly every 9FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 50 of 75hours for the next 3 years. We expect our new stores to continue to deliver 2:1 sales
investment ratio with a payback period of less than 2 years.
How are we going to do that? In higher-tier cities, we'll optimize store portfolio and
density in key trade zones. We'll leverage data and analytics to build the right store
format and size at the right location with the right investment to fulﬁll omnichannel
customer needs. We will also accelerate the rollout of Starbucks Greener stores
framework in China with a plan to operate 2,500 greener stores by 2025. Our
reserve stores will deliver evolved, elevated premium coﬀee experiences, and our
new core stores will focus on fulﬁlling the need states of community, connection and
convenience.
Beyond growing our store footprint, there are enormous opportunities to expand
our business and share by meeting customers' needs wherever and whenever they
create Starbucks. Starbucks will be a more accessible than ever, putting us in an
incredible position to capture the rapidly growing customer occasions within and
beyond our stores.
By 2025, our portfolio of 9,000 retail stores will be complemented by additional
5,000 we proudly serve Starbucks coﬀee foodservice locations. 550,000 ready-to-
drink product points of distribution and at home coﬀee available to every customer
through ecommerce and leading premium supermarkets, giving us a level of brand
awareness and market penetration unrivaled by any other coﬀee retailer in China.
We're also leveraging the huge opportunity of Starbucks gift cards and merchandise
as gifting items by expanding our ecommerce footprint to include even more social
platforms. In addition, we're capturing increasing out-of-store demand through our
fast-growing delivery business, enabling us to serve more customers anywhere,
anytime for any occasion.
Let me share a bit more about our delivery business. Starbucks -- since the launch of
Starbucks Delivers in 2018, Starbucks has deﬁned and elevated the standards for
coﬀee delivery in China, bringing the same promise of premium coﬀee quality and
consistency beyond our stores and into the hands of our customers in just 19
minutes on average, 19 minutes.
Our delivery service features packaging innovations that include splashproof lids,
temper-proof packaging seals and a unique hot and cold delivery system that
maintains beverage temperatures and quality. Our service is supported by over
5,000 dedicated riders who ensure each order is delivered with speed and
experience.
Our delivery channel is driving signiﬁcant customer revenue and transaction
incrementally. Our goal is more than double our delivery business by 2025. And
which means fulﬁlling over 400 million orders in the next 3 years. Our ecommerce
channel is also becoming a focus of our growth agenda, projected to growth -- toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Page 51 of 75grow at a 30% CAGR rate, fueled by the tremendous popularity and opportunity of
our merchandise and gifting products.
Our ecommerce platform is a great extended engine for us to reach new customers
and drive incremental traﬃc to our stores and other channels. Our omnichannel
expansion will create new opportunities to reach and build meaningful relationships
with even more customers. Our aspiration is to double our active Starbucks Rewards
membership and with total registered members in China reaching over 170 million
over the next 3 years.
Members who engage with us across retail, delivery and ecommerce channels spent
10x more than those who visit our retail stores only. There's huge opportunity ahead
to drive engagement and incremental sales by cultivating cross-channel trials. We
also see opportunities to up level the Starbucks Rewards program, by leveraging
automated data and AI capabilities to deliver more personalized rewards and
experiences. In addition, just as Web 3 is opening up new possibilities in the U.S., is
also going to open up new possibilities in China.
Next is our coﬀee leadership. We'll leverage both our global and local expertise to
accelerate our innovation speed even further. We'll focus on developing new
products tailored to our new and young generation of Chinese customers. and we'll
continue to lead on both strategic platforms, hot and cold. We'll also be bringing our
omnichannel approach to beverage and food innovation by satisfying customer
need states across all channels with diﬀerent menus and products designed for in-
store on the go and delivery consumption.
We'll empower our partners to further elevate coﬀee craft, fostering pride and the
quality of every handcrafted beverage they serve and will bring customization to a
whole new level in China that will allow every customer to enjoy his or her beverage,
just the way they want it in ways no other retailer can. 2/3 of our retail partners are
Gen Z. Over the past few months, we have connected with hundreds of retail
partners who have provided us incredible insights and ideas. We're building a
culture of co-creation in China to ensure we understand, stay current and address
their needs, hopes and aspirations.
At the previous Investor Day, I highlighted our pioneering critical illness insurance
program for the parents of our partners. Fast forward to today, we're proud to be
pioneering another disruptive unprecedented beneﬁt, paying out a 14-month bonus
to all full-time retail partners on top of the 13-month salary they already enjoy
annually. Once again, demonstrating our commitment to sharing success with our
partners. We'll also continue to invest in coﬀee education by up-leveling our coﬀee
master program and creating new coﬀee career paths to fuel coﬀee passion and
pride.
Now let's talk about our productivity drivers. The ambitious investments we are

connection.
The deployment of IoT solutions, inventory and auto replenishment planning system,
our new digitalized foot safety management system, all great examples of
technology investment that will help us to manage at scale and drive improved
economics. All of these technology innovations will need to be powered by a robust
in-house technology and data infrastructure, and we're now ready for the next phase
of our technology advancement.
Over the next 3 years, we'll invest $220 million and launch a dedicated China digital
and technology innovation center to power our technology transformation journey.
Our innovation center will be a magnet hub to attract the best tech and data talent
and companies across China. Equally exciting is our investment in the Starbucks
China Coﬀee Innovation Park, a next generation facility that will revolutionalize copy
roasting when it opens in summer 2023.
Starbucks will become the only coﬀee retailer in China to fulﬁll all aspects of the
value chain from bean to cup from helping coﬀee farm and coﬀee farmers grow
better quality coﬀee through our Yunnan Pharma Support Center to importing the
ﬁnest green beans from around the world to roasting coﬀee locally at the Coﬀee
Innovation Park and to delivering the highest quality coﬀee and exceptional
customer experiences at our stores and across our other channels of distribution.
Our Coﬀee Innovation Park will house a state-of-the-art roasting plant.
Starbucks' largest outside the United States, but the capacity to rose 135 million
pounds a year. The Roasting plant will also incorporate cutting-edge technologies
that will make it Starbucks most sustainable grossing plant in the world. In addition,
the Coﬀee Innovation Park will feature an integrated distribution center that deploys
the most advanced automation technologies.
You'll also have an immersive experience center showcasing to the public,
sustainable practices at every chapter of the Starbucks bean to cup coﬀee journey.
We are super, super proud of the unique coﬀee ecosystem that we're building in
China. It will provide us with unique competitive advantage, the scale, the eﬃciency
we need to continue to win in the market.
Core to our China purpose-driven growth agenda is our commitment to further
developing China specialty coﬀee industry and uplifting our partners and the
communities we serve, bringing Starbucks mission and values to life in a meaningful
way in China is central to our growth strategy. Hence, I'm very proud to announce
that we'll be investing $12 million more over the next 3 years to advance our
Starbucks people and planet positive aspirations. We're more committed than ever
to build a brighter future in China with China and for China.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
Good morning. That was our beautiful store in Vale, our experience center, and I had
the wonderful opportunity to be there just a few weeks ago. My name is Michael
Conway, and I am a 9-year partner. And you just heard from Belinda how important
China is to the international segment. I'm excited to show you why our optimism for
the entire international segment is so high. And while interest from our licensees to
invest in the Starbucks brand will fuel our path forward.
Now since 1996, Starbucks International has grown to serve customers across 81
markets with more than 200,000 Green Apron partners and more than 18,000
stores, half of which are company operated and the other half are licensed. Today,
the scale of our business is tremendous, and we actually have more Starbucks stores
internationally than we do in North America.
Now when looking more deeply at our international portfolio, we have 4 markets
with well over 1,000 stores that include China, Japan, South Korea and the U.K. We
also now have 8 international markets with more than 500 stores, including
Indonesia, Mexico, Taiwan and Turkey. We have 4 fast-growing emerging markets,
including Thailand, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and India that will hit 500 stores in
the next few years, and we believe could extend far beyond that in the future.
In total, 24 of our markets operate more than 100 Starbucks stores. The reach and
scale of our footprint positions Starbucks as a global leader among restaurant
brands. In fact, from 2019 to 2021, Starbucks International grew our store base by
16%, which is faster than any other global brands in our segment. When others were
restricting investment, Starbucks, along with our licensees, seize the opportunity to
accelerate our global position.
This speaks to the strength of our brand and the power of our model. And we're not
just opening stores. We're winning in the markets that we operate. We are the clear
market leader in many of our largest international markets. And in a number of
cases, this lead is sizable.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 54 of 75Clearly, Starbucks is the consumer's choice around the world. So you can see a few
other global retailers have achieved what Starbucks together with our licensed
business partners have achieved in terms of number of stores, reach and market
leadership. All of this has translated into a tremendous year for our international
markets outside of China. This year, we're driving meaningful comp across every
major region. Total revenue, up 30% for the ﬁrst 3 quarters of this year.
Operating income is up nearly 50%, and we've opened more than 600 net new
stores, excluding the impact of the Russia market closure, all while accelerating
investments in many areas to enhance future growth. It's clear that customers around
the world are returning to Starbucks and our markets and our partners are
welcoming them.
Now an important facet of our success is our diversiﬁed business model. In markets
where we have signiﬁcant scale like China and Japan, the company-operated model
is a very deliberate choice and highly accretive to our earnings. We also beneﬁt
tremendously from our license model, which today represents 56% of our
international portfolio. Now let me frame why this is.
Licensing leverages strength and expertise of our business. It drives higher
operating margin. It insulates Starbucks from wage and inﬂationary pressures and
requires little CapEx, culminating in a higher return on invested capital. Furthermore,
by diversifying across multiple ownership structures and geographies, we minimize
risk and volatility, creating a win-win.
We invest in further innovation across the system that strengthens our model and
build our licensee capabilities, which, in turn, attracts more excitement and
investment from our licensees. As an example of why we prefer to operate in our
larger markets, I'd like to speak to Starbucks' third largest market, Japan, and the
enormous growth potential that exists. Japan will reach nearly 2,000 stores in the
next 3 years, and the momentum in the market has been steadily building. We can
see our success drivers playing out all across Japan, beverage innovation, beautifully
designed stores and the power of the digital ﬂywheel unleashed to drive growth and
connections.
Now while the digital ﬂywheel in the U.S. and China have been with us for many
years, Japan only launched Mobile Order & Pay 3 years ago. And over the last year,
we accelerated digital convenience through innovative MOP exclusive beverages,
customer campaigns and third-party partnerships. And as a result, digital is surging
in Japan, doubling this past year to 6% of transactions. And it's no coincidence that
Japan delivered record revenue and operating proﬁt in Q3. But trust me when I say
we are not celebrating 6%. We are targeting even higher goal on par with our lead
markets at 25% and 40%. The opportunity in front of us in Japan is enormous, and
we're incredibly optimistic for the future of that market.
Now let's shift from our company-operated markets to our international licensing
business. With accelerating momentum and the huge opportunity that's in front ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Michael Conwayus, we have great conﬁdence because of our world-class licensees. As you heard,
many of them are actually here in the room with us today. They are fully immersed in
Starbucks and our culture. They understand our mission and values, who we are and
what we stand for. Simply put, they are the best set of licensees anywhere in any
industry. Along with our proven keys to success in beverage innovation, store design
and the digital ﬂywheel, our licensees are a true competitive advantage for
Starbucks.
Now why do I say that? They have signiﬁcant scale in their markets. They are highly
capable, they are well capitalized, which allows them not just to run our stores but to
invest in innovation across partners, stores and digital to spark future growth. For
example, in digital in South Korea, SHINSEGAE innovated with Siren order in 2014, it
was actually our ﬁrst market around the world to roll out Mobile Order & Pay.
And today, they are continuing to innovate with solutions like MyDrive through Pass.
It allows customers to register their license plate and then it stands upon entry into
the drive-through, allowing them to pay for their orders, bringing contactless
payment to the next level of convenience.
Now the reason why our licensees are so motivated to invest in such a signiﬁcant
way is because we have one of the most attractive models in the industry. We have a
strong global brand and we generate high ﬁnancial returns. And this leads to
investment. Investment in stores like this. This is a store in Guatemala, and you can
see the transformation. It's a store in the downtown historic district. And our licensee
in Guatemala invested to transform it into this amazing store that just opened up
earlier this year.
Also, just last week, I was in Mexico with our partners, Alsea, as they were celebrating
their 20th anniversary, and they marked that commitment to the future by
announcing a $225 million investment in stores and partners. This is just one
example, which demonstrates our licensees are committed to the Starbucks brand
and to investing to accelerate growth in their markets.
And for the ﬁrst time, you're going to hear directly from 3 of our largest licensees
about working with Starbucks. They are Alsea, Alshaya and SHINSEGAE, all 3 of them
are long-term strategic partners that we've been working with for more than 2
decades. And together, they account for more than 5,000 stores across 27 markets,
representing 50% of our international licensee footprint. They are doing incredible
things in the markets that they serve.

Alberto MartinezThank you. Thank you for being with us. Good morning.
Thank you.
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
So please join me in welcoming Alberto Torrado, Chairman of the Board, Alsea
Group; John Haddon [ph], Chief Executive Oﬃcer of Alshaya Group; David Song,
Chief Executive Oﬃcer, Starbucks Coﬀee Korea, which is a SHINSEGAE company.
Thank you all for being with me this morning to share your views on Starbucks and
the future that you see in front of us.
So okay, this ﬁrst question, I'm actually going to ask all 3 of you, and I'll start with you,
Alberto. If you can talk about -- a little bit about the history of our 2 companies, as
well as the role that Starbucks plays in your portfolio and how you feel about the
business model?
{BIO 1963442 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you. Hello, everybody. Well, as you know, we started this company 30
years ago. And we started with other brands. And by the 10 year, we were really
aiming to get the brand. Starbucks was not as Howard said, in international markets.
So I was a ﬁnal Starbucks, which I love the brand when I travel to the United States
for several reasons. I love the product, I love the partners for more than anything I
really love the look and feel of the stores and the passion and the third space. So we
-- after a big competition in Mexico to get in this brand, we were choosing by
Starbucks to be developing the brand with them in Mexico.
So we started in our 10 year with the Starbucks brand. I remember opening the ﬁrst
store and trying to replicate exactly what I was feeling as a consumer in the United
States, having this beautiful store full of (inaudible), with a leather sofa with the
reading table and the ﬁreplace, et cetera, to really try to show to the Mexican market
what the brand was. And obviously, we were very concerned, as you can imagine,
because there was not this type of product in Mexico and the social economic level
in Mexico is -- and the income is not as what is in the United States, as you know. So I
how much is the people willing to pay for this quality of coﬀee and the price and
everything.
And I remember that the initial plan that we present to Starbucks was 350 stores.
And after we opened in the ﬁrst store, it was magical. What I can tell you is that
today, we have, as you saw, 750 stores in the Mexican market and more than 1,500
stores in all our geographies and we keep opening and open and opening. As you
said, what makes the diﬀerence, and you've been hearing this all day, but believe
me, it's the partners. The culture and the magical of this brand is quite unique. So we
believe that from those 350 stores that we originally planned, we are going toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

So...
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Thank you. John [ph]?
{BIO 1963442 <GO>}
Sorry. You just say what we had the business model, yes, which was the second part
of the question. Well, ﬁrst of all, as you heard and Alsea, around other brands and --
but the uniqueness of this business model is, of course, not only the passion that
happened in the stores, but it's so perfectly in terms of the unit economics, the loan
investment that you have to do, the small footprint that you need.
There are a few numbers of SKU, the limited menu that you have that you don't have
any key chance that you don't need a lot of labor to run a store, the frequency of the
customers, the return on investment that you saw and everything makes this brand,
very unique, at least in our portfolio, and it's by far our number brand right now
because of that.
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
Thank you. And it was an honor for me to be with you last week to celebrate 20 years
together with your partners. So thank you. So John [ph], same question, a little bit
about the history and how Starbucks ﬁts in place in your portfolio.
Michael, thank you for having us today. It's great to catch up with some friends. So
it's great to be here. So give you a bit of context about Alshaya. Alshaya is a Kuwait
family-owned business going back 50 years. And we operate 70 international brands
across 18 markets, from the Middle East through North Africa through into Europe.
And we started the journey with Starbucks just over 22 years ago.
So 22 years ago, we opened our ﬁrst Starbucks store, and I'm so proud to be here
today to see Howard as well. Because Howard Behar basically opened the store with
us, and I was there at that time back in 1999. And we signed a contract with 50 stores
because that's what we thought the scale and we thought the opportunity was.
And I'm so proud on behalf of the family and now trying to see here today is saying,
we've been a partner now of over 22 years. The partnership is as strong as it's ever
been. And we just see such amazing growth in terms of the future. And as we've
grown, and we've taken that stalwarts partnership, we've got into 13 markets, as I say,
through the Middle East, through North Africa into the likes of Kazakhstan to
Azerbaijan. And the partnership that we have with Starbucks is why we believe it's so
successful.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Alberto MartinezThe trust that we have with the brand unique economics that Alberto so rightly
talked about makes it very unique. As I say, we operate 17 international brands,
American brands, European brands and the unit economics that we see from
Starbucks is unparalleled. The investment, the margin, the return on investment, the
capital employed, everything against every other business we operate, whether it's
in home furnishing, whether it's in apparel, whether it's other food and beverage,
SBUX is unique. I think that's what gives us the conﬁdence to want to continue the
growth journey and the partnership we've had over so many years.
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you. We appreciate your partnership. David, same question.
Yes. So thank you very much for having me here. It's a privilege to be part of this
session. Just a quick background about the SHINSEGAE Group for those that might
not know, I actually started as the retail arm of the Samsung company, and it actually
broke oﬀ, and as the video mentioned, the aspiration of the group is to become a
customer lifestyle company. And so what does that mean? So they have businesses
across fashion retail on and oﬀ cosmetics, F&B, digital technology, residential,
construction, IT. And so it's only natural to have this strong relationship with
Starbucks that actually goes back 23 years now. And so after 23 years, we're over
1,700 stores.
We've grown double digits CAGR, both top line and bottom line. And we're
probably the only directly operated model of scale in Korea. And so what does that
mean from a business model and a ﬁnancial point of view?
It's continuing to generate high cash ﬂows and returns that is actually self-funding
now. And not only from a ﬁnancial point of view, but from a customer interaction and
a connection point of view, we have the highest daily interaction from a retail point
of view that's actually creating a lot of momentum and opportunities for the group to
continue to expand their customer lifestyle journey. And all of that's been possible
because of the trust, the relationships and the resources that both parties have
continued to pour into the business to continue to grow the brand, to be one of the
strongest lifestyle brands in Korea.
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
Yes. Great. Great. Thank you. Thank you. I want to turn now to talk about partners.
You heard earlier today how partners is so key to our success. And Alberto, I think
you shared how partners is part of what's made us so successful in your region. Can
you talk about some of the investments you're making in partners and how that is
positively impacting the business?
{BIO 1963442 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 59 of 75Michael Conway
Unidentiﬁed SpeakerYes. Of course. As you know, we have very ambitious growing plans. So talent is the
biggest concern that we have. And as you know, in this industry, I mean, recruiting,
training and retaining is the clue to success. And we are in a high volatility market
today with high rotation and turnover, as you said. So what we are doing, especially
in this brand is not only because the culture brings a lot of talent, but we need to
develop them in 3 ways.
We need to develop them personally, which we invest a lot of money in giving them
opportunities to go to school, to ﬁnish the universities, et cetera, with a ﬂexible
dayparts. We also develop them economically. We have to be the leaders in the
markets of how we compensate our partners and our collaborators in the company.
And the third one, we want to give them opportunities to grow professionally so that
we give them a complete role so they can grow not only in the Starbucks brand, but
internationally in our diﬀerent markets. We operate, as you know, 11 diﬀerent markets
for Starbucks, but also we give them opportunities to grow in the diﬀerent positions
of the company.
So today, in Mexico, just to give you an example, we have a turnover less than 30%,
and that's really based upon making them really partners of the company. And as we
call in Mexico, (foreign language), which is they own the stores. They are the owners
of the stores, and we love them. And if we love our partners, they will love the
customers and the business will be good.
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
So I appreciate the investment you're making in partners. And I just want to share it,
so last week, we were together and Alberto brought together every store manager in
Mexico, every support partner, over 1,000 individuals together to celebrate, to be
together, to immerse in coﬀee and to celebrate the success of the Starbucks brand.
And there's even an individual that started in the ﬁrst store who's now one -- running
one of your regions. So talk about partner investment and development. It's true
across all our markets. I know all of our partners are investing in our partners in that
way.
John [ph], I'd like to turn now and talk a little bit about stores. And you operate in a
fairly unique region. Can you talk about how design taps into some of the ways in
which customers are using the store and maybe some of the changes you've made
recently as it relates to the in-store experience?
Okay. Yes. We'll do that. Obviously, store design in our particular part of the world is
very, very important to our customers. Most of our customers are dining customers.
So as we've got quite a diﬀerent dynamic to the U.S. and other markets, that in-store
experience for us is absolutely paramount. And I think one of the things that we've
learned with Starbucks over the year is the power of the collaboration on the design.
And what I mean by that is our ability to listen locally, listen to the customers, listen
to customers' needs but not lose the essence of what Starbucks is all about.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 60 of 75Michael ConwayAnd I think one of the things that we're very proud of is our collaboration with the
Starbucks design team where they listen, they understand. They listen to our
customers, they listen to our partners, they listen to us, but then produce these most
wonderful, wonderful store designs. And I think you've seen today and on the
videos, collectively, there's some beautiful, beautiful stores across the rest of the
world, and that's really all about the collaboration that we have.
And as we've sort of gone through the pandemic, and we thought about the future
and what it looks like, I think we're in a position today now where we have so many
diﬀerent opportunities, so many diﬀerent formats. But that store design that we
come up with can meet that customer needs wherever they want to show up and
however they want to use this.
And when I look against the competition, I think store design is what makes
Starbucks so unique. As I said, we operate another 70 other brands. And also,
obviously, we look at the competition in the coﬀee space. And every single
Starbucks store that we see and we design is uniquely diﬀerent.
Now a lot of the equipment will be the same. A lot of it will be the same. But that
customer wants their own local store. They want to walk into it, feel comfortable,
interact with the partners. And what we've managed to do through store design and
especially over the last 5 years is collaborate to make sure that in-store experience is
unique for that customer but also is something that our landlords want. And that's so
true now more than ever.
Landlords want Starbucks. Starbucks is the coﬀee brand of choice, not just because
of the name and the brand integrity, but of the uniqueness of the design. And in
many, many markets that we operate in, and we have a shopping mall in Kuwait,
where we have 16 Starbucks in 1 shopping mall and every single one is a diﬀerent
unique experience. And best of all, everyone is proﬁtable.
So the ability to work with design, work with Starbucks to be able to do that and
engage with that is what, for us, makes the design so much more important. As we
evolve post pandemic, the drive-through piece, which for us has been much slower
than some of the other markets has really, really become true. And over half of our
stores, and we're opening over 220 stores every single year at the moment, over half
of those stores are drive-through.
So as we start to think about the future and inﬁll strategies and convenience, which is
what the pandemic has brought, not only are we able to oﬀer that in-restaurant
experience or in-dining experience, but also the drive-through convenience as well,
so.
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
Thank you. It's interesting. Early, we heard from Brady how the third place
experience is so important. And clearly, it's alive and well in your market in all of our
markets around the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Page 61 of 75David Song
Michael Conway
David SongDavid, I want to shift to technology and I highlight it and say I get a little bit earlier in
the innovation that you created. And I love the example of actually how you're
leading the way and driving innovation into some of our other markets. But can you
talk about some of the other ways in which you are using technology to innovate and
how that links directly to the Starbucks brand and your success?
{BIO 21001276 <GO>}
Yes. To talk about innovation and technology, you really have to understand where
Korea is on the map. And so if you look at the Asian map, you have 2 Asian
superpowers of Japan and China. And so innovation for Korea is not an option. It's a
necessity, not only to survive, but to try and at least play a role and be visible. And so
the government has continued to push in terms of investments in technology,
innovation, infrastructure. And so as a result, Korea is the number one country for
high-speed Internet connection, both wired and wireless. And so if you look at
mobile connection and penetration, we talked about high-speed penetration only.
And so as a result, the Korean customer is used to 24/7 connection and they actually
demanded across the board. And so it's only natural for Starbucks to really embrace
that right from the beginning. And so as you mentioned, we have our Siren Order
MOP, myDT pass. But because of the high penetration of mobile messenger service,
which is Kakao, we've been able to launch an e-gifting service, an ecommerce
platform. We have our own in-app delivery service.
And so as a result, the Starbucks app in Korea is ranked number 50 in terms of most
used apps in Korea. And so not from a coﬀee or an F&B point of view, but across all
ecomm players, ﬁnance players, portals, messenger platforms, et cetera, the
Starbucks app is number 50.
And so how are we going to continue to expand that? We're positioning our app to
be a stand-alone digital platform to really serve the purpose to continue to not only
connect with our existing customers, but really, really bring in and attract new Gen Z
customers to continue to expand our membership base in Korea. And so what's
next? Only time will tell.
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
Well, we're going to keep an eye on what you're doing in Korea because I'm sure
there'll be more innovation that we might be able to apply to our other markets
around the world.
So I want to close by talking about the future and talking about what's possible. And
so David, I'm going to start with you. And can you talk about what you see for the
opportunity of Starbucks in your market? And what excites you about that?
{BIO 21001276 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 62 of 75That's what excites me every day. We've had 23 years of fantastic growth. And you
can see Korea is a pretty mature market in general, especially on the coﬀee scene.
There are over 90,000 coﬀee retail chains or points of sale in Korea. But despite that,
especially through Covid-19, where it was diﬃcult for everyone, we continued to
grow. And so we see huge opportunities for future growth even in a mature state.
And so we'd like to bucket into 4 diﬀerent groups. And so obviously, the most
important part is our core business or cafe business. We've seen record number of
new store growth in the past couple of years, and we see that for the foreseeable
future, not only coming from the existing core cafes, drive-throughs, reserve, but also
from some of the new formats that are being developed globally and also locally.
We're starting to further accelerate our Starbucks Rewards members. So Korea has
over 9 million rewards members. And the speed of getting -- acquiring 1 million new
members is actually shrinking or getting faster each year. And so we have a long-
term aspiration to get to over 15 million rewards members in Korea. And it's not
about just acquisitions, we're just starting to activate our existing members through
personalization and customization to continue to drive that. And obviously, all the
automation and eﬀorts that we're doing around store development and store design
to make our partners feel more comfortable and better serve our customers is what's
going to continue to drive our core business.
The second bucket is what we consider kind of the new core, the business outside
the store. And obviously, it's digital innovation that's been at the forefront of that.
And so obviously, Siren Order upgrades, myDT pass upgrades. E-gifting, not only on
a third-party platform, but bringing that into our app, ecommerce with the ultimate
goal of really creating what we consider an on-demand platform. And so creating an
opportunity for our customers to connect with Starbucks wherever and whenever
they want, 24/7.
The third bucket is completely new businesses. And obviously, what we're -- what
Starbucks is moving into with Web 3.0, but we see that in Korea as well with
investments in Metaverse, NFT. And so that's online opportunities, but also oﬄine
with our group resources in terms of customer lifestyle, creating what we consider
customer lifestyle centers and with Starbucks as a key hub. And so that's a
completely new line of business in terms of really, really fully leveraging assets and
managing our assets.
And ﬁnally, on the aspect of sustainability, as with technology, Korea is at the
forefront, of sustainability in general. It's become a necessity to just to do business in
Korea. All our eﬀorts around adopting reusables with more plant-based options, our
investment in our partners to provide more opportunities for growth, investment in
the community store program to invest more in the community and provide
opportunities for underprivileged youth and community to continue to grow.
And so all in all, we see more opportunities for growth than we've seen in the past
23 years. So really, really...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Unidentiﬁed Speaker{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
That's great. Very exciting growth plan for a market that's quite mature, but there's so
much potential ahead. So thank you.
John [ph], talk about the future?
So if my boss -- my Chairman was here today, he would say, John [ph], the future has
only just started and the growth opportunity with Starbucks is literally from today. So
despite the fact we've been a 22-year partner of Starbucks, we believe we're only
just starting the journey. And that's one of the things that we try and get across to all
of our partners, the opportunity is so huge.
And there's various diﬀerent reasons for that. I think, ﬁrst and foremost, we operate
in 13 markets with Starbucks, and we have huge white space opportunities. So when
we look at mapping the markets, we look at the size, we look at the opportunity just
in pure real estate, we have the opportunities in the markets that we have to more
than double the store count that we have at the moment. And that's the commitment
that we've made and the commitment we've made to the family in terms of funding
is that we will double the number of stores we had over the next 5 years. And clearly
double the proﬁtability as well at the same time.
Why that is so unique for us with Starbucks is, and something that David talked
about earlier, format ﬂexibility. With the other retail concepts that we operate, there
is not the format ﬂexibility. They can show up in one way, shape or form. Starbucks is
very, very unique.
So whether it's a drive-through, whether it's a drive-through only store, whether it's a
kiosk, whether it's showing up in a retail mall, when we talk to our landlords and we
look at the space and we look at where the customer needs are, there is so much
opportunity because of the format ﬂexibility. So if we can still continue to grow the
business as we see, build on that format ﬂexibility, we think we've got huge
opportunity to grow more stores.
At the same time, we think we've got a real opportunity on our current store portfolio
because unlike David, we're a little bit further behind, both in terms of we've only
recently done Mobile Order & Pay and we've only recently started Starbucks
Rewards.
So when you start to think about all the digital initiatives that Starbucks are giving us
and we're able to work with, we believe also that there's a big opportunity to
continue to grow our LFL and continue to grow our like-for-like stores at the same
time, whilst growing new store formats as well at the same time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Alberto MartinezSo we couldn't be, as I say, more enthusiastic. We couldn't be more happy. And we
couldn't be at a better place to grow the markets that we have. And at the same
time, pick up new markets as and when they make sense for us in Starbucks
collectively to grow this business and grow this partnership for another 20, 30 years
and beyond.
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
I agree with Mr. Alshaya that the journey is just beginning. So thank you.
Alberto, we'll end with you.
{BIO 1963442 <GO>}
I'm going to try not to repeat what my colleagues said here, which is going to be
hard. But let me go back to -- because we had 2 very tough years. We all did. And for
the one of those that operate or the brands and operating so many diﬀerent
geographies, the way that Starbucks has come back and the resilience of the brand
as it was mentioned here is just incredible. We only compare our numbers with 2019,
so we can get real numbers. And all our markets are growing double digits
compared to 2019. So the comeback of Starbucks has been amazing.
We have invested in Starbucks as of today about $1 billion. And as you said, we
announced an investment of about $250 million. Just this year, we're going to invest
another $140 million, opening 170 stores. So we're going to be opening not 1 store
and be 9 hours like (foreign language) but we will be opening a store every 48
hours, which (inaudible) 36% of our stores, 32% of our sales, or 40% of our EBITDA.
So as we keep growing the brand, and obviously, it's a brand four-wall that has the
better return of investment from all our portfolio, we operate about 4,000
restaurants, Starbucks being just 1/3 of that. So the opportunity that we see after
what happened in the Covid is even bigger, not only because we can open
everywhere, as you mentioned, in the diﬀerent type of locations of that, but also the
omnichannel opportunity that we learned through the crisis is incredible with
Starbucks Reward, Mobile Order & Pay and delivery.
Today, for example, in Mexico, the liberty represents about 11%, 12% of sales already,
and we've seen that as an incremental with not necessarily double the ticket, but
30%, 40% more of the particular that we had before or that we have normal in the
stores.
So we do believe that in our market, where we operate today, we can at least open
2x the stores that we have today. So our next goal is to be able to reach 3,000 stores
in the next 5 years. I think when you help as always, we're going to be able to make
it. And really, I do believe that the opportunity of the brand with everything that just
happened is better than everything.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

{BIO 1963442 <GO>}
Thank you, Michael.
Thank you.
{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
All right. Once again, thank you, Alberto, John [ph] and David for joining us. So far,
we've talked about the signiﬁcant size, scale, momentum of our international
business. We talked about the strength and attractiveness of our business model.
And you heard here on stage that our licensees are excited for the future and ready
to invest. And now I'd like to turn to how all of this will fuel the tremendous
opportunity that's in front of us.
Consistent with the company's reinvention plan, our international growth plan is
squarely focused on our partners, our stores and our customers. Let me start with
partners. Together with our licensees, we've invested heavily in our store partners,
and we are entering this new phase of growth with a strong and engaged workforce.
We oﬀer beneﬁts design for what matters most locally for partners from mental
health to education to all women's stores in markets where this is forging new
ground like India and Saudi Arabia. And of course, coﬀee education is important to
experience our partners all around the world.
Starbucks Coﬀee Master program and Barista Championship display coﬀee
excellence and are a huge source of pride and accomplishment for our partners. In
fact, while we recently reintroduced the Coﬀee Master program in the U.S., today,
around 1 in 3 international partners have earned the honor of calling themselves a
Starbucks Coﬀee Master.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 66 of 75And that passion to create an incredible Starbucks experience carries through to
another opportunity, which is our stores. We are dramatically transforming the way in
which we approach our store formats to enable increased connections and
convenience, which is why drive-through is now a core focus for international
markets.
For example, in Japan, drive-through transactions have grown from 9% in ﬁscal '19 to
over 15% this year. And over the next 3 years, drive-throughs will represent nearly 2/3
of all stores of Japan and their openings. And in the U.K., which is Starbucks' fourth
largest international market, 75% of all store openings will be drive-through. As a
result of this shift, in ﬁscal '23, drive-through will represent 45% of international new
stores outside of China, a dramatic shift in our store portfolio. And what's really
exciting is, as we've seen in the U.S., these drive-throughs deliver higher AUVs,
stronger margins and a higher return on investment.
Acceleration of this drive-through format is fueling our international store growth,
and it's meaningful. Including China, we plan on accelerating total store growth to
more than 30% over the next 3 years to nearly 25,000 international stores.
Our third signiﬁcant opportunity is through customer-focused product innovation.
International is taking the best innovation from the U.S. like Iced Shaken Espresso
and refreshers, which are now oﬀered across every region. And we also tap into local
taste preferences with region-speciﬁc beverages like Chocolate Glazed Latte in
Korea and Melon of Melon Frappuccino in Japan.
Now the gold standard of innovation in the U.S. is our pumpkin spice platform, which
just launched in a big way a few weeks ago. But get this, the Melon of Melon
Frappuccino sold twice as many units per day during launch as pumpkin spice did in
the U.S. Product innovation is absolutely critically delighting our customers.
Now this leads to digital, which is the single biggest growth opportunity across all of
international. Our markets are embracing and seeing the beneﬁts of the digital
ﬂywheel. Delivery, which became essential in some markets during the pandemic,
now is worse, and exceeds 10% transaction mix in some key strategic markets.
Mobile Order & Pay, which also grew during the same time is now present in 59% of
our international stores.
While we continue to ramp -- is with our international license markets, where today,
we generate just over 1 in 10 transactions, which is well behind where we could be.
The good news is that where we have successfully expanded our digital oﬀerings,
we're seeing stronger frequency, higher engagement.
So knowing the power of our rewards members, combined with the convenience of
mobile order and delivery, we challenge ourselves to answer the question, how can
we dramatically accelerate the rollout of Starbucks digital experience? And that led
us to Starbucks Digital Solutions, a platform created exclusively for our international
business to deliver a consistent Starbucks experience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

Solutions across Europe and we're working to roll out in Latin America next year. Our
digital feature for international is now.
So as I conclude, you've heard me speak to the following: First, Starbucks has an
incredibly strong global brand. We also have scale and reach around the world. Our
momentum is every single region, and you heard ﬁrsthand right here that our
licensees are ready and excited to invest driven by the attractive. And all of this leads
me to be so excited about the runway that we have in front of us for growth. And
we've only just begun to realize the future for this.
And now I'd like to (inaudible) high-margin, high potential channel development
business. Chanda?
Hi, everyone. I'm Chanda Beppu [ph]. I am a 17-year Starbucks partner, and I'm
looking forward to sharing our channel development business with you today.
When Starbucks customers see our brand, they know that an elevated coﬀee
experience awaits them. This is the strategic brand role, the channel development
play -- for the Starbucks brand as we reach customers outside our stores where they
live, work and play.
We've talked to you today about the incredible plans we have for our stores. Now
through channel development, Starbucks plays across all -- food service, ready-to-
drink, whole bean, ground, instant and single serve. These segments represent 70%
of the global coﬀee opportunity.
No other cafe brand has the packaged coﬀee reach, the trend and meet customers
wherever they are with innovative ﬂavors. And no package coﬀee brand -- can
leverage a global cafe footprint like Starbucks to tap into rich real-time consumer
insights from handcrafted cafe trends and quickly bring them to life in a packaged
portfolio. This competitive advantage gives Starbucks -- speed, and it's how our
brand ecosystem drives parallel growth in both our cafe and channel marketplaces.
Starbucks reach might surprise you. We (inaudible). Brady talked about it. We now
serve 300 million consumer occasions per week. Let me say that one more time, 300
million consumer occasions per week. These moments show you all the ways that
Starbucks is the brand of choice in coﬀee moments, at home and on the go.
The uncertainty over the last few years, consumers reach for trusted brands and
experiences they could count (inaudible) 19% CAGR in system sales over the last 3
years for our combined at-home coﬀee and ready-to-drink businesses. And as weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 68 of 75look to the future, Starbucks currently holds a relatively small market share, leaving
us tremendous opportunity from (inaudible).
As we think about how we go to market, Starbucks global business partners are
world-class industry experts with strong local market capabilities and shared values.
Together, we have built a solid foundation to innovate for future -- competitive
advantage with our partnerships because of our complementary strengths, bringing
together the best of what Starbucks has to oﬀer in coﬀee equity and brand strength
with the exceptional market capabilities of our partners.
Starbucks has always been a brand of connection, and we're proud of both the
growing and long-lasting the business, including the number one and number two
global food and beverage companies. Nestle, our partner in the Global Coﬀee
Alliance has been in business for more than 150 years. And their global supply chain
expertise has allowed us to expand to 80 markets since we established the Global
Coﬀee Alliance in 2018. One of our longest partnerships, nearly 28 years has been
with PepsiCo. With this globally recognized strength, and after 28 years, we still have
a robust pipeline of innovation in the wings.
Our focus is having key partnerships with the right capabilities in the right place.
Starbucks brand equity is strong. And with our partnerships -- making our brand
reach, we can stretch to meet more customers with premium coﬀee experiences, all
the best Starbucks has to oﬀer.
Channel development success is driven by 3 elements: Brand leadership, broad
reach across global markets and our expansive premium portfolio. Let's talk about
the at-home coﬀee segment of our business. We have been able to signiﬁcantly
expand our portfolio and our reach with the Global Coﬀee Alliance. Starbucks has
been the number one in an $11 billion category for the past 9 consecutive quarters
where we have -- as we gained market share.
Since our last Investor Day, we have added 6 additional markets to now reach 73
relevant coﬀee markets with our at-home portfolio. Starbucks stretches across 14 key
at-home coﬀee platforms. This spans growth in our existing platforms, such as roast
and ground and K-Cup. And the portfolio expansion we've created in single-serve,
Starbucks ﬁne espresso and we've been successful in this expansion. Last year,
Starbucks Creamers were the biggest brand contributor to category growth with
24% growth in dollar sales. In just 3 short years since launch, Starbucks Creamers
have grown to a $200 million business.
In addition, Starbucks is now the leader in Nespresso compatible category in the U.S.
with 65% dollar share -- Nespresso Vertuo System since we launched in 2020,
delivering a compelling platform that oﬀers a variety of coﬀee cup sizes in your
favorite Starbucks roast proﬁle. You may have been able to try that just outside. Our
goal is to introduce consumers to more ways to enjoy their favorite coﬀee.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 69 of 75Looking to the future, we intend to bring products that highlight the strength of
Starbucks in locally relevant ways such as the recent launch of Starbucks super
premium mini cups in China, the launch of our Starbucks bland roast single origin
Guatemala on the Nespresso original line and Starbucks Reserve on the Nespresso
Vertuo System, furthering our coﬀee leadership.
Now turning to ready-to-drink. You might not know that Starbucks is the number one
global ready-to-drink coﬀee brand with 15% -- category. Like at-home coﬀee, our
reach is broad. We extend across 65 global markets. Our ready-to-drink portfolio is
robust, and we continue to innovate, introducing bold ﬂavors in 22 platforms that are
globally inspired and locally relevant.
Let's talk a little bit more about how ready-to-drink portfolio has evolved and
matured. Brady talked about growing from our core. Our iconic ready-to-drink
Frappuccino platform -- and we're expanding it into new oﬀerings that meet today's
consumer taste proﬁles, like plant-based Frappuccino in the U.S. and Frappuccino
mini in Asia. Our customers have always guided our approach, and we've taken what
we do best in cold beverages in Starbucks cafes to introduce new platforms like
daily brew and Oatmilk Frappuccino and Oatmilk espresso chilled cup in China and
Korea.
Our opportunity extends beyond coﬀee as customers seek out more choices in their
daily lives. We made an exciting move into the energy category with the launch of
Starbucks Baya. And we're going to continue coﬀee. In fact, we're excited to
announce that we're bringing a customer favorite to a convenient new ready-to-
drink format with the launch of Starbucks Pink Drink. Inspired by our popular
handcrafted beverage in Starbucks cafes, which ﬁrst began -- the customer.
As we grow our brand reach, we're taking advantage of the opportunity to extend
the Starbucks brand and ready-to-drink coﬀees in Latin America and Southeast Asia.
We'll meet new young -- with our portfolio of signature cold ready-to-drink Starbucks
favorites. We'll enter 3 new markets in Latin America and Southeast Asia this month,
with the 6 more anticipated for the balance of ﬁscal '23. Every new market entry
adds to our -- in the markets we already serve.
Finally, system sales best represents our business growth, and we're on track from
2020 to double system sales in this business by 2030 -- be a margin-accretive
segment to Starbucks, and we anticipate strong and consistent performance to
continue. But importantly, channel development will continue to amplify the brand
and create customer occasions outside our stores, reaching customers wherever
they are across at-home and on-the-go moments to deliver a premium Starbucks
Experience around the world.
Thank you. I'd like to introduce my friend, Deb Hall Lefevre [ph], who will highlight
our digital leadership in the industry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 70 of 75Hi -- the home stretch here. Hello. My name is Deb Hall Lefevre [ph], or as some are
starting to call me around here, DHL. I am a 4-month partner. And I want to say that
these past 4 months have been some of the most interesting -- career. I could not be
more humbled or excited to be here today to talk about the future of technology at
Starbucks.
As I'm new around here, it's probably worth a quick introduction. I'll go back to some
of the beginning where I'm a Chicago native. And I chose a career in technology,
largely thanks to our internship that I had with a little Chicago company called
Motorola. It was real enthusiasm that people had to bring technology to drive
business performance. It also helps me understand that technology was really
shaping how we live, how we work and how we play.
After -- a little at Chicago company called McDonald's. At McDonald's, I had the
privilege of leading teams that helped build and deliver on our digital agenda.
Those teams and that moment did the hard work of aligning 120 diﬀerent countries -
- so that we could deliver innovation a little faster.
That global perspective and alignment helps drive faster-paced innovation. Our
digital footprint soon grew to include things like digital menu boards, kiosks -- were
delivered in scale in rapid succession across tens of thousands of restaurants.
After 15 years, I left McDonald's and I joined Couche-Tard, the company behind
Circle K. Many of you are probably -- about 15,500 sites globally, about 125,000
employees and about $60 billion in revenue. I joined absolutely energized to join as
the Global CTO to help drive reinvention of the customer experience in an industry
that just had not done that before. And I love the scale -- this is our leadership team
was to become the world's preferred destination for fuel and retail. And one of the
leverage we were using was diﬀerentiated customer experiences. (inaudible) journey
of reinventing fueling and the C-store experience. And I never expected to leave
Couche-Tard.
However, Starbucks is a company that I've always -- for amazing technology and a
very special culture, focused on bringing people together around coﬀee. In short,
the mission, the people and the brand presented an opportunity that I just couldn't
pass up.
In just a few months, I have been -- and already, I've been inspired by the singular
mission that everyone around here shares and that is delivering kindness and
connection. I'm also impressed by the incredible technology and the incredible
technology team that's already here. But I'm also already seeing opportunities to
unlock greater speed at scale.
The insights are driven, ﬁrst and foremost, by the time I've been spending in stores,
working shoulder to shoulder with the -- our partners and our customers. I am seeing
an incredible team, an incredible ecosystem of technology solutions and suppliers
and alignment across all teams to deliver on the -- and Starbucks biggest globalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 71 of 75priorities. It is such a privilege to be here to help write the next chapter of
technology history at Starbucks.
Starbucks spent much of the past year reﬂecting on where we are and where we
need to go. It resulted in a clear articulation of what reinvention needs to look like.
And as you heard -- today, technology is fundamental to our plans. And the
technology foundation that we have today, it is absolutely strong. But what we have
today has not been built for our vision of the future.
Through my Starbucks learning journey, I've developed a clear analogy to describe
Starbucks' approach to technology, education. In the last 150 years, our approach to
teaching has continuously -- chalk and a board and oﬀ they went. As technology
evolved, so did education delivery. We began to publish textbooks, design learning
toys, incorporate computers, the Internet, Zoom and Teams most recently, all along
the way in. But all of those technology advances never took the teacher out of the
classroom -- our teachers to do their work at their highest caliber. Why? Because it's
the connection. It's the connection between the student and the teacher that makes
all the diﬀerence.
In technology at Starbucks, we aspire to the same goals (inaudible) our baristas, they
are the core of who we are, and they deliver that connection to our customers every
day. We are -- on how we enable our partners to bring humanity, kindness and
coﬀee to every one of those 14 million one-on-one connections that they make every
single day. Simply put, our job is to automate the work and simplify it so their job is
easier and more joyful.
As I mentioned, the Starbucks tech stack is impressive, envy of every retailer. We
scaled our commerce and rewards programs to support Starbucks' aggressive
digital growth. And with 24.7 million active reward members driving over half of our
U.S. company-operated sales, I'd say we've done (inaudible).
We're also data-driven. Our millions of daily customer interactions give us the ability
to use our data and our incredible data expertise to guide our business. We
integrate data and insights into every part of our -- use to provide the great
personalized customer experiences that surprise and delight, or micro level pricing,
or partner engagement moments and so many more. We possess the real-time data
on our digital and our physical footprint. This enables performance visibility that
propels our business forward with each and every passing moment.
As you've heard from John [ph], we've prioritized our partners. We're automating
store tasks, providing task management tools, building playbooks for shifts and
launching automated inventory ordering. That helps continue to underpin our
success, which is wonderful. We must also acknowledge that, that channel growth
has created a few challenges for our partners.
Those pressures are absolutely top of mind as we design the technology that makes
us to deliver the experiences of the future for our customers, wherever they may beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 72 of 75in our stores, in their living rooms, in their cars or as you heard from Brady, maybe
even in a Web 3 experience.
So as you can see, we have a lot more to -- building on our track record of
leadership success and delivery, we're planning to continue to accelerate innovation
to focus on value creation at the scale of Starbucks.
As we look to the future of technology, it's actually pretty simple, speed to market
with digital innovation at our global scale. Our approach to this speed at scale
agenda has 3 pillars. Stabilize. First, we must stabilize. What I'm talking about here is
store operations. Things just need to work. As many of you are aware, our mobile
app has had a few brief outages over the past few months. And with the core digital
channels, it's just imperative that the tech works.
So we know that even a few minutes of downtime can mean lost moments of
connection between our partners and confusion in our stores and, of course, lost
business opportunities. That's why our top priority is to have resilience in our digital
channels because reliable store operations is just a must for our customers and our
partners.
Second, we need to modernize -- increasingly modernized customer experiences.
And as we've been lighting them up, we've created a bit of complexity. We've
absolutely been making the right decisions for our customers, but that complexity
has built up a little bit in our tech ecosystem, and it sometimes slows us down. We
will modernize and set to scale new ideas in innovation faster, and we will unlock
ourselves from the shackles of multiple monolithic systems become more agile.
The good news is this work is -- a good example of this is what you just heard about
from Michael, our Starbucks Digital Solution. In EMEA, 67% of our store portfolio is
now live on this tech stack. It's bringing online new capabilities like mobile ordering
and scaling them much faster than we've been able to do in the past. And what's
truly exciting is that this not only creates a consistent customer experience -- it
started in Europe, is going to Latin America and the Caribbean and eventually to
Asia -- of enabling a consistent customer experience across store types is a solution
we call Starbucks Connect. You heard Brady talk about that earlier.
We've built a technical solution for licensees to participate in our Starbucks Reward
program, Mobile Order & Pay. With Connect, our customers will have a consistent
experience wherever they are. Connects attracts new Starbucks Reward members
and helps grow our licensed store business. It's a big deal, and it's rolling out quickly
-- in stores. And the value is clear. We see Connect stores quickly scaling from what
used to be zero to almost 1/4 of transactions coming through the digital like that.
Third, we will optimize. As we become speedier, we will also become -- The
opportunities to streamline and simplify are immense. We will eliminate
redundancies, and we will leverage the world-class technology that we already have.
This will provide cost savings that we can direct to future technology investments.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 73 of 75One area for optimizing is rationalizing the hardware we have in our stores. This
spring, we began to ask ourselves, where else could we go with the multitude of
digital assets that today almost -- how could we use what we already have to power
new experiences?
We launched a test that went live last August at the Microsoft Campus Learning
store, where we're testing diﬀerent digital experiences of the future for our
customers and -- important experiment. We're seeking to ﬁnd ways to extend our
digital assets, the ones we already have to do more for our business. We have an
opportunity to transform the partner experience if we take our customer-facing
digital assets and make them barista-facing as well.
Some of the highlights of the proof of concept that will -- include things like
multitasking, multiuse hardware, ﬁnding ways to equip our partners with devices that
enable a more modern experience to support key shift work through a single pane
of glass, customer usuals, all -- and add customer favorites to in-store orders.
Imagine how this could approve millions of daily customer interactions and enable
faster speed of service.
Nutritional information. Adding this information to ordering workﬂows, which stream
-- reusable technology, determining where we can make our tech more ﬂexible and
reusable. Hardware independent, if you will. We want any high performance
application to work -- this will maximize the value of the equipment we put in our
stores while giving us the ﬂexibility for future store designs and future customer and
partner experiences.
Accessibility. I'm especially proud that we are designing inclusive experiences that
support our partners' accessibility needs and ways of working. In our -- partner was
able to take orders with the help of a screen reader. Talk about being performance-
driven through the lens of humanity.
We have an incredible focus on reinventing the -- customers in our stores. You've
heard that all morning. The bottom line is this, tech is at the heart of bringing all of
these experiences to life. You heard me talk about stabilizing MLP a little bit earlier. Is
that in service of our customer -- of course, it's in service of all three. Our technology
cannot be designed for a single stakeholder. It must be built to support the holistic
Starbucks Experience.
It's about our 5 strategic shifts. Technology does not support those moves discretely.
It spans all of the reinvention plan, lighting up diﬀerent aspects of it. And we are
making unprecedented investments to fuel this reinvention. We're investing roughly
$200 million across all of our functions -- going towards technology.
Now when it comes to our customers, we're leaning into innovation and embracing
emerging tech solutions to deliver hyper-relevant, scalable customer experiences.
And we're converging our digital customer-facing assets with in-store tools to help
design these experiences of the future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 74 of 75As you heard from Brady with -- our transactions, making digital ordering eﬀortless is
a top investment priority. We're building the foundation to enable even more
customer personalization -- journeys by driving the next best action in our Starbucks
Reward life cycle and in our app, providing relevant event-based oﬀers and content,
simplify the process.
In addition, we're developing a frictionless payment program that will automatically
recognize and authenticate our customers as they pass the drive-through, helping
unlock a more personalized and eﬀortless experience for them and for -- more way
that we're improving the customer experience is making enhancements to our
mobile app. That means real-time updates. So our customers know the status of their
orders before they arrive to the store.
We're also load balancing across multiple stores to improve throughput and evenly
distribute peak hours. We'll also be using artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning
to really tweak and ﬁne-tune our wait time algorithm so that they take into account
changing customer behavior, more mobile orders and more business coming
through our delivery channel.
Now shifting to our stores and partners. We've got a number of things in ﬂight that
automate, test and streamline processes. One of the ways that we're optimizing the
experience for our partners is handheld ordering. Our partners have been using it to
expedite orders in the drive-through. And what they're telling us is that these tablets
are easy to use and easy to read. Whether that's on a sunny day in Florida, or it's a
little rainy here in Seattle, working on this partner app, which I think you heard Frank
talk about earlier.
We're starting to deploy it. And the whole idea here is to unite all partners as one
Starbucks. And as Frank said, it's one of these personalized tools that we believe is
going to empower our partners to thrive at work. It's really important.
We're co-creating the app with features that are important to our partners. And we'll
continue to learn and develop more of these features as we continue to roll it out.
And they're telling us that they would like things like viewing and managing their
schedule and pay, things -- fostering connections and then helping drive personal
career growth and even more. The launch of the partner app is a great example of
how tech is helping redesign what it means to be a partner.
And perhaps even more exciting -- we're doing to enable customers to reward great
service with tipping. Today, we enable in-app tipping for Starbucks Reward members
who use the store value card. And we're going to make that easier. And we're
making it easier for all customers to be -- no matter how they pay or where they pay.
Whether it's automated ordering, smart capacity planning, automated receiving and
counting or micro fulﬁllment, the tech team has the same job each and every day.
We're striving to eliminate task for our partners (inaudible), master making great
beverages and connecting with our customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-13

technology is one of continuously giving teachers more and better tools to deliver --
education professionals to build the trust-based relationships that they need to
inspire and nurture their students' minds.
As a company, we have spent 50 years inspiring and nurturing the human spirit. Our
partners do that every day -- that trust with our customers. And we are relying on our
partners to continue to foster those moments of connection.
So much like education technology, Starbucks technology does not seek to replace
our partners, but instead seeks to elevate -- century's worth of connections. I'm so
excited to be here on behalf of the tech team and to help power those experiences
at scale that only Starbucks can. Thank you.
