{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Good evening. Good afternoon. This is Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley's equity
research department. I run the Software research group here.
Very pleased to have with us to end my day -- I think we have one more presentation
after this -- day one at the TMT conference, Jason Zander, Executive Vice President of
Azure from Microsoft.
Deﬁnitely a topic that we talk about a lot, and investors are talking about a lot. So
we're really happy to have Jason with us this afternoon to chat through all things
Azure, what's going on in that business.
Before we get started, a brief disclosure for important Morgan Stanley research
disclosures, please be our website at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures.
One programming note. I do have a bunch of questions that we're going to be
going through. (Operator Instructions) So with that out of the way, Jason, thank you
so much for joining us from the control room. It looks like you're going to be landing
the next Mars Rover behind you right there.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
This is my den actually. I went overboard. My wife's in an oﬃce. It's our cloud
collaboration center here in Redmond. It's right on campus. We basically use this
place for hackathons, et cetera.
A little bit quiet because of COVID. But normally this place is packed -- and will be
hopefully once again.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. So Jason, again, thank you for coming to the conference. Azure and cloud
are deﬁnitely super high on the list of topical debates for investors. Azure isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

Questions And Answers
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Maybe to start out with, you could outline a little bit of your roles in responsibility at
Microsoft as EVP of Azure. What does that cover in total.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. So as EVP for Azure, my remit here, we're kind of like what you call the systems
team at Microsoft, our CEO likes the call us that. It means that we'll do everything
from the silicon and quantum computing, the operating systems, Windows and Linux
that we provide to the rest of the company. All of the cloud software for
infrastructure in PaaS. Data and analytics, IoT, we'll do the operational side of that.
And then we have a set of verticals that we actually help specialize in. And then more
recently, we've been doing a lot of work around some of the telco communications
operator space as well, and that's all part of the core strategy. So that's my job as --
day job as an EVP, and I'm also a member of Microsoft's senior leadership team. So
that's me in a nutshell.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Outstanding. So it's a great purview. So maybe to start out with a big picture
question, just on sort of the overall kind of public cloud space, we've seen a rapid
pace of innovation over the past 2 to three years.
We've seen Microsoft really see explosive growth in this category. Can you talk us
through some of the bigger changes that you've seen in the overall marketplace
over the past couple of years up into the sort of the crisis. And then we could talk
about sort of what type of change or pace of change you see coming out of the
crisis.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And leading up to the crisis itself, of course, we did have the big trend of people
moving from their data centers into public cloud. That, of course, continues. We can
talk about the pace of that in just a moment, maybe around the COVID-19.
But of course, that's been a huge amount of work for us. I would say some of the big
areas we're seeing in returns of changes now is a lot more focused around data and
analytics. Basically, how do I unlock all of the data silos that are out there, get more
understanding of it, get some insights to say, competitive that one's super important.
We're also seeing a whole bunch of adoption across areas like IoT. That's an eﬀort I
started ﬁve years ago on the team, but we do trillions of messages a day. And weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason Zanderhave just an unbelievably really great set of customers, lighthouse wins, et cetera. So
a lot of work there. And then AI and ML continues to be a hot trend.
I'd say one of the other big areas is, again, thinking about more vertical
specialization and working with folks in their industry because a lot of stuﬀ I talked
about this horizontal could be just considered supporting IT. I think you're seeing us
get more and more involved in vertical business value propositions as well.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. So that's great to hear. So more of those higher-value solutions really
coming to the forefront, becoming a bigger part of the story. As an analyst and
looking at it from a ﬁnancial perspective, we like to hear that those higher-value
solutions should be better gross margins.
As we kind of shift the focus to sort of what happened over the past year, calendar
'20, and then moving forward from that. A lot of people are talking about -- and I
think it started with Satya.
He came on the April conference call. And I think he's 1 of the ﬁrst to really talk about
the crisis accelerating the pace of digital transformation. You made a comment
about seeing like two years of digital transformation in the past 6 weeks.
Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the customer interactions you're
having. What does that mean to the customers you're talking to when they're
accelerating their pace of digital transformation?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And Satya's totally right. I mean, what we saw, of course, is everybody needed to
respond quickly. I got folks that need to work from home, they got to school from
home, whatever it looks like.
And we found that those that were already on the cloud path were able to react to
that very quickly, oftentimes in days as opposed to what might have been months if
you didn't have a plan in place for that. So that really proved out the point of this
digital transformation. It's hyperscale cloud, this SaaS services. So we saw a huge
amount of volume in that.
I think what we have seen since then is that people in often cases, have then looked
at it is, this is an opportunity for me to move faster. So I think for one thing, when
teams were able to say, gosh, I just did something in 2 weeks that we had originally
planned to go spend the next year on. It's like, okay, maybe I can actually move
faster. Maybe we shouldn't be taking that long. So we see that sentiment in there.
I also think that as companies have looked forward-looking at how can I also impact
my cost envelope. And so to the extent that the cloud is helping me get into a betterFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason Zanderoperational envelope, essentially, what am I spending, do I need to be doing
everything myself?
Could the cloud take care of that for me? Then that's actually helped with
acceleration for some of the migration workloads and some of the adoption for the
future pieces.
And the question is if the economy gets stronger than, of course, my hope and
expectation for us and everyone else in this space is that we'll be able to see
additional growth related to that.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. I just want to sneak in one tactical question. And this is something that I
think Mike Spencer, the Head of IR, had talked to us about. And we heard on the
conference call that as we went through the crisis, that Microsoft reached down and
helped some of your customers better use your Azure resources.
And they talk to us about kind of rationalizing some of their spend. Can you talk to
us about exactly what does that mean when you went through and helped your
customers, make sure that they're utilizing Azure as eﬃciently as possible?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely. I mean, so for one thing -- and I would say we even did the same
thing back in 2008. At the end of the day, it's about helping customers be as
successful as they can be and what is often could be a challenging kind of situation.
So what we want to be is somebody who's actually partnering with our customers.
What that means is we're usually looking for ways in which we can help them
weather the storm as well.
Now this one that turns out is just a core value proposition of the cloud. We actually
have tools that are built into the operational portals that allow our users to come
back, and we'll give you recommendations, and we'll actually come back and say,
you could actually be saving money on your bill.
Maybe you allocated a super big virtual machine to run the workload, but that
workload is only really using that maybe once a quarter, and quarter in close. You
can actually be downsizing it in between and saving money.
So we've actually built those things into the product systems itself. And so we think
that's just the value -- and honestly, what I generally ﬁnd is that if you help somebody
save money on their budget, then -- modular of the recession COVID-19 kind of
related stuﬀ, usually, what happens is they've got more projects on their backlog.
They'd like to get to them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason Zander
A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason ZanderThey may even be more strategic than what they're already doing. So if we can help
them free up that budget, it just unlocks the next set of projects as opposed to even
bringing it down. And then it's kind of a win-win at that point.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. And I guess on the other side of the equation, if you prove Azure to be a more
eﬃcient platform, then it's utilizable for more use cases because it will be
economical for more use cases. They understand that the real eﬃciency of the
platform.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
That's correct. And generally, what I ﬁnd is there is kind of a hockey-stick pattern,
right? I mean, you start oﬀ getting your operational environment in place. I start
ﬁguring out how to operate things.
I start training my staﬀ. Once you get the ﬁrst few workloads going, you start
realizing, wow, this is faster. It's more eﬃcient, to your point, it can actually help save
money. And then we start seeing the steep rise that kicks in.
So I think overall, it's actually a great optimization for the customer. And like you said,
it can increase usage when we do this in the right way.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So as we -- hopefully, not -- exit this crisis and get back into a more normalized
environment, do you think the -- and we talked about an acceleration of some of the
sort of shift to the cloud -- or an acceleration of some of the digital transformation
eﬀorts.
Do you see any fundamental changes in the way people are thinking about their
cloud architectures? Microsoft's always talked a lot about it being a hybrid
architecture. It's going to have on-premise and public cloud.
Does that shift at all on a go-forward basis? Does it shift more towards public cloud
versus on-premise, given what we went through? Or do you still think it's going to be
a relatively hybrid environment on a go-forward basis?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
I think it's going to be a hybrid environment. And of course, that's been one of the
tenants of our design since the beginning of Azure. There were cases where other
cloud companies, when they put up a hybrid slide that usually meant migration. In
our case, we meant no, you're going to have on-premises and edge, and you're
going to have the public cloud. You want a combination of both.
I think that's actually been cemented. And in fact, if you look at even from a
competitive perspective, you're starting to see even companies that they compete
with now start to produce what you actually call real hybrid solutions. So they seemFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)

A - Jason Zander
A - Keith Weissto have backed up the disk, that was the right strategy. Of course, the beneﬁt for us
is we have been doing it since day 1, so we've got a very rich product portfolio that
supports that going forward.
I would say another thing, too, that is, frankly, as we went through COVID, supply
chain and a bunch of other stuﬀ. I think a lot of companies started to realize just how
much they needed to keep track of where are my dependencies, where am I
deploying things.
And so even in a world in which you may even want more control, whether that's
your data center or it's a hybrid scale in your country, a hybrid cloud that is in your
country, but I want regulation and rules around that. Those are areas that we've been
investing in for, think of Oﬃce 365 over 15 years now. We've been investing in those
controls and that support and that kind of thing.
So I think the way we've built our products and the way we can run it actually lends
itself well to any trends that show up along those lines.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So we're talking about kind of deﬁnitions and sort of how we deﬁne various
kind of cloud architectures. And one thing that gets thrown around a lot, but I think
has diﬀerent deﬁnitions to diﬀerent people is the idea of multi cloud, right? We hear
a lot of smaller best-of-breed vendors talking about how their customers want to
have optionality.
They don't want to get locked into any one big cloud vendor. There's always going
to be a multi-cloud type solution. Given your conversations with large kind of public
cloud users, when a CIO of a large enterprise is talking about multi-cloud, what do
they mean by that? How is it -- what does the multi-cloud architecture actually look
like?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. In some cases, they have chosen strategically on their own to ﬁgure out how to

All right. Is that better?
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Yes. It's much better.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Okay. Sorry. That's -- even though I'm in a fancy area, I'm still using my laptop. So AB
problems are still mine. No, so sorry, so yes. So I apologize, we were just discussing...
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Talking about multi-cloud environments and what that means to the end customers.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
About the multi-cloud environment. Yes. Sorry, I'm just too busy doing tech support
here. Yes. From a multi-cloud environment perspective, oftentimes, what will happen
is people will make a decision around, I want to have more than one vendor that I'm
working with.
And of course, we're going to absolutely respect that. In some cases, they may
decide to make certain projects where they feel like we've got best-in-class solutions
with Azure Synapse, Azure Purview. And I really want my data and analytics to
absolutely be with you. Maybe I already started some infrastructure work with
another cloud. So we want to support that.
There's a set of things that I think folks need to keep in mind. One, there is a certain
amount of expense associated with that because I got to do my security controls. I
got to do all the management-related work. I mean if you're going to do it, like ISVs
do this, we do this all the time. ISVs will target more than one cloud. They have to
actually invest in that, and it can be expensive.
This is why we created a technology like Azure Arc, which is designed to allow you to
do things like security and policy protocols just once. That works hybrid. I can work
against the other big cloud providers. I can work on-premises, on top of VMware, et
cetera.
And we did the same thing with Azure Arc, but then also with our data discovery
tools with Azure Purview, Azure Sentinel for security. And so in a lot of ways, what
you'll see us do is produce a set of best-in-class technologies around security
management, deployment, et cetera.
Then we'll work with everybody, and that helps you at least get that top level, you
can still be multi cloud. We absolutely will continue to support open source. So if
you're worried about lock in, great, you use open source, it works with everybody.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason ZanderAnd of course, we still partner with a bunch of ISVs that are in a particular domain.
And of course, they run on all the big clouds. And we make sure that they have a
ﬁrst-class experience. SAP is a fantastic example of that.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about the available market, the TAM, if
you will, for Azure. A couple of years back, we had Dave O'Hara at the TMT
Conference. And he made -- he's not an executive that I would say, is known for
hyperbole.
And he made a statement on stage with me. He said like, "Oﬃce 365 is great, but
you're limited by the amount of knowledge workers that are on the globe. The great
thing about Azure is that like we target optimizing OpEx. It's like it's virtually an
unlimited market opportunity." Which sounds excited and exciting and sounds huge.
But it's hard for investors to wrap their head around all OpEx. Can you give us a
hand in understanding how Microsoft thinks about the market opportunity? Where
are some of the dimensions that you think about in terms of trying to size it, trying to
rightsize your investment in terms of where we are in the market opportunity today
and how it's growing on a go-forward basis.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And Dave's my CFO, works directly with me. And yes, you're right. He's not
prone to hyperbole. And so you're absolutely right about that. For those that know,
Dave, you know exactly what we're talking about. But he's right about the
opportunity. I would actually come top level for me.
The opportunity for TAM all up is probably more like ($4 trillion.) If you address
everything, everything out of the silicon, the hardware, the up and through the
vertical, et cetera. I mean, it's just a massive, massive, massive market.
Even if you bring it back down to it and you start thinking maybe it's $1 trillion, that's
still $1 trillion. And you can get down to the estimates of, hey, infrastructure as a
service, hundreds of billions of dollars, data, et cetera.
And so a couple of diﬀerent things on this one. As we go back to address all of that
TAM, we're, of course, going to start oﬀ with what you'd call like horizontal support.
So of course, we do all our infrastructure. We do the data. We do the analytics. We
do IoT.
Those can be used in any domain that's out there. I would say the big things you see
there, it's a combination of kind of like your migration. I have those existing
workloads, but I want to run them in a hybrid/hyperscale cloud. Of course, we get a
lot of folks that will leverage us for that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason Zander
A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason ZanderThen there's cases where people are actually modernizing. So I'm taking my Tier 1
workload, something that maybe was running in my own data center, but even with a
diﬀerent set of ISV software from 20 years ago, they're modernizing and they're
saying, I want this cloud thing.
And man, you guys have got mission-critical Tier 1 support. That's another
opportunity for us to go after that spend that perhaps was with diﬀerent ISVs in the
past. And now you can do both, the cloud and that vertical with us.
Then we do get into the verticals. And so if you see the work we've done, the
Microsoft Cloud for health care, cloud for retail, cloud for manufacturing was just
actually announced, agriculture, et cetera. I think you see more and more that the
technology needs to meet the needs of those particular industries, and that's where
it's TAM expensive.
Because we're not just the IT solution, where I can give you PowerPoints and Excel
and everybody can use it for your kids' soccer game or $1 trillion sovereign wealth
fund. Great. It can work for all of those. In this case, it gets much more vertical. So I
think those are opportunities for us. And we are going after them.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. So that's massive in terms of the TAM that you're describing. When we
think about the investment proﬁle, and particularly the geographic footprint of Azure
in terms of regions and data centers, that continues to grow.
How should investors think about that pace of growth on a go-forward basis in terms
of is there a lot of new geos you need to be in there? Is there a lot of expansion of
footprint that needs to be done? Or do you have a pretty good footprint right now,
it's more about kind of ﬁlling up those data centers on a go-forward basis?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And let me also just one more comment. When I say we're going after verticals, I
want to make sure I'm also clear on this. It is partnering with SIs, ISVs, basically, our --
we're not competing with our customers.
There are other clouds that do that. They actually think, gosh, I should just go
capture that margin, looks like good opportunity. In our case, we're going to
continue to partner. But I think there is a huge opportunity for us to go into that
space and help enable an ecosystem. So I just -- I want to make sure I'm clear about
that so I don't cause any confusion. Then to the question...
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
I have a whole another section on vertical clouds that we're going to dig into, we'll
be able to come back to that one.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason ZanderAll right. We'll be able to come back to that. So I just want to make sure I clarify my
statements upfront. So then, yes, from a global expansion perspective, our -- my goal
is to try and make sure that we are serving essentially the bulk of the world's GDP.
And if you look at the regions that we've got, there's over 60 of them, we are getting
pretty much great coverage from a worldwide perspective. And we'll continue to go
oﬀ and go do that. I think, again, this kind of increased thinking around sovereignty
government, privacy, et cetera, those sorts of things, those are always going to be
important.
I think that lends itself even better to a hybrid strategy because we can build
hyperscale data centers regions that can cost billions of dollars to go oﬀ and go
create. As you keep going through and providing worldwide coverage, that's not
always going to be economically viable. That's where having a real hybrid strategy
comes in Handy because I can still give you cloud assets and those sort of
availability.
So we added another 7 data centers alone in just Q2. We've actually increased our
eﬃciency on how fast we can go build these things out, get them ready, land them,
operate them, and we continue to increase eﬃciency across a set of these things as
well.
And so it's actually super important because if we're going to make the technology
available and so much is pivoting towards the technology, we really want to make
sure that it's available to the world's consumers and the world's business.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And then could we sort of take a little bit of a detour and talk about the
diﬀerentiation you can drive with the underlying infrastructure itself in terms of
whether it's geographic footprint or the way you set up your infrastructure or one of
the questions that we got from a client is whether you could diﬀerentiate with silicon
at all and whether you guys are working to diﬀerentiate with silicon. Can you talk
about any potential for diﬀerentiation on that core infrastructure layer, if you will?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes, sure. I mean the core infra layers still have a signiﬁcant amount of R&D eﬀort that
needs to go into it. I mean, obviously, we've done well with respect to eﬃciencies.
How fast can we build it out, fast time to operate.
That will impact, of course, your margin, et cetera. But it also impacts capacity for our
customers to make sure that they can keep growing and always rely on us to provide
that.
Then from a -- the other thing about this is when we build software that needs to run
on any number of hardware SKUs, and who knows what kind of locations. We have
that. It's called Windows Server, SQL server, we have a set of products that do that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason ZanderBut if it's going into my data centers, with my hardware and everything certiﬁed, I
can do signiﬁcantly more optimizations north, south through the stack from the --
everything from the silicon, the hardware, up through the hypervisor, et cetera. That
entire software, the hardware to silicon stack, we can optimize the entire thing.
And they also can then be pulled into the supply chain so we can ﬁgure out how to
get that, and we run at scale, which means I can aﬀord to go do this level of
customization. That allows us to support new workloads, keep bringing the COGS
down but then also continue to go after the kind of the price performance
requirements that are in the space.
That's something you can't do unless you're a hyperscale cloud. There's only a few
hyperscale clouds out there that actually can do this and have the scale to pull it oﬀ.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. So turning to the Azure growth opportunity on a go-forward basis. I
know Microsoft doesn't give an estimate of -- or it doesn't give a number on sort of
what the run rate is of Azure.
We estimate it to be about $30 billion revenue run rate right now. As we think over
the next several years, how would you stack rank the best growth opportunities?
What are you most excited about in terms of driving new dollars to the Azure
platform over the next, say, 2 to three years?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And then I'm actually quite pleased, of course, with our Q2 numbers that we did
for our cloud segment. The $16.7 billion in Q2 and the (50%) number that we did
mention on Azure, which, of course, is already growing oﬀ of a good-sized business.
So we're excited about that.
With respect to your concrete question, where do we see the segments? Look,
there's still a whole bunch of work that's in front of us and the industry with respect
to making the shift into our hyperscale data centers.
A whole bunch of data center deals we're doing, a whole bunch of folks that are
doing their migration work because they want that. Again, we talked about the pace
of that kind of accelerating based on kind of some of the some of the other
economic conditions that are out there. So that's still going to be bread and butter,
and there's still a whole bunch of work there.
I really do think that data and analytics is probably one of the biggest ones that is
popping right now as we speak. There's a need for people to be able to break down
data silos. You have to get into a faster loop of tying your systems of record to your
operational systems and being able to pull insights out of that to drive your
business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 12 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason ZanderAnd the tech's been out there, but I think we now have just awesome solutions with
Azure Synapse, Azure Purview, Cosmos DB. I mean we're seeing this pattern pop up
all over the place because it's actually a really great pattern to be able to actually
optimize your business.
So that's a huge area of addressable revenue as we speak. And then the ones that
I've got the longer bets on and is, again, trying to work within the vertical industries
and ﬁguring out ways that we can help and how would that actually continue to grow
going forward. So those are all part of that. And I think we've got really good plays
across all of them.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. So -- and maybe you could dig into each one of these kind of growth
categories a little bit deeper. When we think about sort of the core shifting of
workloads to the public cloud.
We do a survey every quarter, and I think twice a year when you asked the question
about what percent of your workloads are running in diﬀerent environments. And I
think in our most recent survey, we were about -- overall, cloud is about 24% of
workloads that include Software as a Service. You had Infrastructure as a Service,
Platform as a Service right around 10%, 11% of overall workloads.
One, does that kind of put to what you think the industry is at in terms of overall rates
of penetration? And two, what are the kind of key drivers to sort of pushing people
over there?
Are there like industries that have been stickier and just like having been able to get
over the compliance or regulatory, and now they're ready? Is there security concerns
are yet to be done? Like what are the incremental catalysts to driving that number
higher from your perspective?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And those numbers, they roughly sound right. And when I say that I feel like
there's still a lot of runway in front of us. It is what I mean. And directionally, if you're
saying around those numbers, yes, it kind of makes sense. Because if you think
about, it is big sets of projects for people to go oﬀ and go do.
The big thing that's really changed over the last few years is now just a matter of
when. It's not an if. Like when I joined the Azure team in 2012, it's kind of like, now,
you can prime my data center and my cold in hand, right? That was a diﬀerent kind
of era. So I think the fact that you're up to that number, and there's a lot of runway in
front of us, it makes sense, and people are really just coming, you have to have a
plan, you got to move.
The places I thought were stickier, even a couple of years ago. Financial sector and a
couple of other, some health care, some other areas like that. And again, it was down
to the regulatory systems, defense and other areas as well. And oftentimes, becauseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

A - Keith Weissthere is either specialization and/or there was a high degree of sophistication that
was present. I think the clouds have matured signiﬁcantly since then.
We run all of our -- we've been running SoCs workloads for Microsoft itself on our
cloud for years now. And so I think the more we've done that. And if you start seeing,
for example, defense adoption that shows up usually, the defense contractors in the
defense space are looking at ﬁntech, and the ﬁntech guys are looking at defense.
And all of those...
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Jason, I think we lost your audio again.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
All right. Hold on. I'm going to take that one oﬀ. Can you hear me okay?
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. Good. Right. At the risk of you looking at me right in the face, I'm not
going to risk that microphone. It worked for 2 hours nonstop. So (inaudible) my
laptop will pick me up.
But anyway, like I said, I think you're seeing that there was people that were waiting
for single lever that the security, the regulation kind of maturity. So that's there, and
we've been moving ﬁntechs, fans, et cetera, for quite a while now. And I think when
you look at most businesses, retail is a lot quicker. It's been there a lot longer. So I
think we're past some of those (inaudible).
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. So on the data and analytics side, we did a deep dive report on just
overall kind of where the market is in terms of data management on the on-prem
side of the equation, on the cloud side of the equation.
And I think most investors weren't too surprised to see the market share gains that
Microsoft has been making on the on-premise side of the equation. SQL server
database has been getting a lot more performant, and it's a lot less expensive than
some of the competitors like Oracle out there.
I think the more surprising part of the equation was Microsoft had, by far, the leading
share of cloud-based databases. Can you talk about kind of what got you into that
position?
I think the IDC number was something like $1.6 billion in cloud-based databases. Is
that SQL server database? Or is it Cosmos? Is it Synapse? Like where are you guysFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 14 of 28A - Jason Zander
A - Keith Weissseeing the strength? And how do you guys think about the competitive dynamic in
the cloud versus on-premise?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And our big thing is we want -- so ﬁrst of all, which solutions is it? SQL server's
absolutely a core part of the situation, but so is our open-source data business.
We oﬀer post -- and MYSQL. These are open source databases that are out there. We
run those as regular systems. And of course, we have licenses that people can run
other third-party databases on top of our platform, too.
But we've been investing in SQL as a Service, Server as a Service, et cetera, for the
last eight years, pretty solid. And actually changed how we built the product and
ship the product. In addition to that, that's kind of the relational side of the house. If
you look at Cosmos DB from an operational kind of database.
And then now with Synapse, we pulled the whole thing together so that we started
to blur the lines between those categories. And so we see huge amounts of
adoption across that. And that's why you're kind of seeing that adoption pull-
through, which we're super excited about.
And it really, again, this idea of taking your system of record with your operational
database in the Synapse link, pulling that together and getting a tight analytics loop
without having to do all the old-fashioned transforms and stuﬀ they just slow stuﬀ
down. That's diﬀerentiated technology. And that's also, I think, another good reason
why we feel like we've gotten some really good adoption related to it.
With respect to your question of like, hey, talk a little bit about kind of like the hybrid,
et cetera, environment or what does it look like? We try to be super ﬂexible there,
too, because like the truth is nobody just moves all their data at the cloud overnight.
There's combinations where you've got some of it on-premises, you've got some of
it in the cloud. You federate. You work workloads between them. Just because if
you're a big enterprise, that's your reality.
And even if you want to move it all in the cloud, you're going to take a period of time
for you do that. This is where Azure hybrid beneﬁts, so I can bring my license with
me. Like over 1/3 of the server users use our hybrid beneﬁts. That gives you the
ﬂexibility of being able to move workloads, having in one place or the other. And
then I can get the right kind of hybrid solution for that.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Can you just dig in real quickly on that Azure hybrid beneﬁts. It's something
that, Amy -- has called out to us a lot as part of the core drivers what kept the on-
premise serving tools part of the equation growing really nicely over the last coupleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

A - Jason Zanderof years. Can you -- what exactly is hybrid cloud beneﬁts? And why is it so important
to CIOs? Why is this such a good growth driver for you guys?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
The hybrid beneﬁts, basically, what it allows you to do is have ﬂexibility over where
you use your license. And so if you've got Windows server, SQL server, I can decide
to keep it on-premises or I can decide to actually put it into the Azure cloud.
And in fact, I can actually move those decisions as I go based on what my business
requires. Like I mentioned, over 1/3 of our Windows server, SQL server users are
actually leveraging hybrid beneﬁts, those licenses and that kind of mobility and that
ﬂexibility.
And the truth is, it can be up to 5x more expensive to run those applications and
other cloud providers. And so it's both cost economics is much cheaper to run when
you use Azure and that ﬂexibility of being able to decide, do I want to on-prem. Do I
want in the cloud. Maybe I'm going to change my solutions based upon more
projects, but that ultimate ﬂexibility is what we're looking for.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. I want to sneak in one question from an investor. I think is pertinent to the sort
of data and analytics story. Could new technologies like Snowﬂake, the very cloud-
based data warehousing vendor, commoditize the hyperscalers and does compress
long-term margins.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Snowﬂake is a partner that we have in this space. So ﬁrst and foremost, I will
absolutely always make sure that a company like Snowﬂake, SAP, VMware, there's a
whole bunch of companies we partner with. They may have alternate solutions.
Maybe I've got a solution in that space.
But ﬁrst and foremost, we're going to make sure customer choice is right (inaudible)
running Snowﬂake you can get it from the Azure marketplace. You're running it on
the platform. It means that maybe the data warehouse is with Snowﬂake, but I can
also put power BI and a whole bunch of other things in that ecosystem on the cloud,
that's actually also a customer-friendly and a good win.
So with that, we're going to make sure that we can run those workloads best-in-class
because, frankly, just I really wanted to work best-in-class, but even selﬁshly, if it
didn't, then people would pick a diﬀerent cloud where they could get that outcome.
So of course, we want to make sure it's in alignment with us and our partners. So
we're going to keep doing that.
Now with respect to the margin, again, there's multiple diﬀerent ways to think about
this because like in the end, if somebody has picked Snowﬂake, and that's their
choice. I'm going to talk about how to best run it on top of Badger and then theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 16 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason Zanderopportunities, like I said, for an extended ecosystem around Snowﬂake, that has
beneﬁts, and that's complementary to what Snowﬂake is doing.
If they have any pick no ﬂat yet, and of course, I'm going to pitch them on Azure
synapse and tell them what, I think it's the best possible choice, and let's let them
make the call.
So at the end of the day, I do think that the cloud is the big picture win, getting folks
on to the cloud, use my high order bid. Once I get within that, then, of course, I want
to diﬀerentiate with by products, but let's take you on the cloud. And from a business
perspective, that is a strategic win for us, and it opens up all sorts of other revenue
opportunities.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Another interesting investor question that we have here that I'm going to try
to sneak in. And he kind of talks to the pace of workload adoption but also brings in
sort of developers into the equation.
And the question was about Kubernetes and whether rising adoption of Kubernetes
and those container architectures, could that make it easier. Could that provide a
lubricant, if you will, to pushing more workloads to public cloud environments as
more developers and more of the sort of new application development takes place
in Kubernetes?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
It is absolutely a great opportunity. I mean, if nothing else, the container environment
makes it much simpler and more agile for a company to be able to take their
workloads and start getting them to be -- even for dev and test purposes. But then as
you point out, for like where do I want to go land it.
Once I get into the container world, then that allows me to leverage that. That does
include looking into the public cloud. So that can be just a good win from an agility
perspective, and it can help with the migration side.
The good news is the co-creator of Kubernetes is actually on the Azure team.
Brendan Burns was actually at Google when he was a co-creator of Kubernetes, and
then came over and he actually builds the Azure Kubernetes service in Azure. It's
written by the guy that co-created the standard in the ﬁrst place. And so we've got
an awesome set of technology that we have built out.
Again, we have solutions that work from a hybrid perspective on the edge but then
also in the cloud. And so we think that this development pattern, we use it ourselves
for our own software development. We think it makes a ton of sense.
And it's a good step towards even doing completely cloud-native and server-less,
which is another kind of set of technologies that's one step past containers. We'll seeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

A - Jason Zandersome additional adoption that comes out of those sort of things as well. So yes. The
modernization, it can be a really good productivity win.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. So I wanted to turn gears to cloud verticalization as something that you
mentioned earlier. I think last year, you guys announced some of your ﬁrst industry-
speciﬁc cloud oﬀerings, health care with last year. And you usually talked about
Microsoft Cloud for retail.
I think you guys did at the NRF show. There was a, I believe, an announcement last
week ahead of build this week about manufacturing cloud, I'm missing a couple of
them. Can you talk to us about what a verticalized cloud is on one side of the
equation?
And to your point, how is that diﬀerent from a Amazon saying hey, listen, we're going
to do a store, right? And your deverticalization actually come up with a solution.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And when Microsoft, we -- again, when we talk about vertical support at the
cloud health care, cloud for manufacturing was last week, et cetera. Know that those
are designed to be complementary with the ecosystem.
So again, works with SIs, works with ISVs, we are going to be more likely to partner
with someone who's in that vertical like a retailer or logistics or you're going to take
your pick.
We'll partner with them because we think what we're bringing is the software, the
platform, the edge capabilities, we bring all of that to the table. And what we want to
do is partner with the folks that are best-in-class at those diﬀerent areas. So that's
what those clouds are.
What do they provide? You will ﬁnd -- rather than saying, look, I bet Oﬃce 365, you
can do whatever you want with it. If you go on to cloud for health care, for example,
you will actually see solutions that are around patients in telehealth and things like
that do things like leverage Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Oﬃce 365 or Dynamics.
You'll see those things in a more integrated solution. So rather than having to go in
and build things from scratch, I can actually leverage that tech.
If I'm also using multiple ISVs, then one of the things that we've seen in especially
larger organizations is they also need to bridge between them. And so they may still
have a particular area where one of their partners is really their vertical solution, but
I've got another department that uses a diﬀerent one.
How do you bring those things together. Those are some of the solutions that we're
optimizing in our vertical cloud. And we think that the approach works pretty wellFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 18 of 28A - Keith Weiss
A - Jason Zander
A - Keith Weissbecause it's no longer kind of a chemistry set where I can -- I could do anything,
that's kind of hard to do.
We're making it actually more of a ﬁrst-class solution for that. It makes it faster for
adoption. And it actually is partner-friendly. Versus, again, setting up shop and
saying, well, that looks like a good industry. When you go look all the cookies and
just own it. I mean that's deﬁnitely not our (inaudible).
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So you give the end customer and the ISV or the systems integrator, a head
start in building out these solutions by having templates that ﬁt to the industry
templates that are already kind of aligned to some of the problems or some of the
business process is trying to be automated there.
Are there speciﬁc technologies that would align to -- like, is there like a commerce
technology in the retail cloud versus a I don't know, maybe a HIPAA type technology
in the health care cloud? Are there technologies that are speciﬁc to those verticals?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely. So let's take a couple of good examples. I think in health care, the
idea of being telehealth and the ability to go through. I mean, especially since we're
still in the COVID protocols, in most parts of the world, being able to come in and
leverage something like Microsoft Teams with some of the transcription and the
subtitling and all the rest of that work plus, of course, the communications, the IMs.
Like that's an example where health care that is super, super interesting. It's not that
you couldn't also use the universal comms for other industries. But that's a case
where it's very speciﬁc and very relevant.
If you think about manufacturing, this is a case where the lead we built up in Azure
IoT, the fact that we are already actually used by most of the big OEMs that are out
there that build, let's say, industrial equipment, there's things like buildings and
elevators and milling machines and lines.
I mean, we already have been in. So the fact that we can come in and help pull some
of those things together, we're looking at this as an accelerant for even our partner
ecosystem so that not every project has to turn into a start-from-scratch kind of thing.
And so those are examples. The IT manufacturing, the universal coms in telehealth,
et cetera. A good example. And there are several of those.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. And then when we think about maybe kind of wrapping this all up. You
talked about kind of machine learning and AI being one of the core drivers on a go-
forward basis.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 19 of 28A - Jason ZanderFrom my perspective, I think one of the things that we're learning more and more
we've lean more and more over the past year or couple of years. Is that machine
learning and AI's so dependent on the data side of the equation, right?
And I think the software opportunity as much of anything, is being able to make use
of all that data out there, whether it's IoT data, whether it's existing data that's taking
place in your legacy systems and being able to pull that out and being able to make
sense of all of this data when you put it together.
That's one side of the equation. And then putting the machine learning algorithms
and the underlying kind of compute together to solve a speciﬁc problem. Where do
you guys try to bring it all together, if you will, right?
You have such a broad set of technologies to put at, or how do you sort of weigh
that balance between like for a customer that wants the technology side of the
equation and just needs data integration and data manipulation tools, we have that.
But if we need the overall solution and saying, listen, here's how you do inventory
management, inventory optimization, here's the whole solution. How do you present
a go-to-market that spans that spectrum and those exactly like what type of machine
learning solution that the customer is looking for?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
You deﬁnitely capture the challenge. I mean, because the truth is everyone that we
partner with maybe at a diﬀerent layer of the stack. So if we think of it though as
more of a logical thing, starting oﬀ with the foundation, the stubs in the wall, the
ﬂoors, the ceilings, the shingles. If we kind of think of it in that particular way.
We, of course, want to make sure that ﬁrst and foremost, we have the best possible
infrastructure for anyone that wants to run AI. And that could be the most advanced
companies out there.
We have a deep partnership with OpenAI, and they're doing some of the most
advanced research anywhere out there, just massive -- a huge, huge compute huge
number of parameters and models like unbelievably big. In that case, we're going to
partner with them and make sure that they have that base and that foundation.
Now you can go up to stack, you can ﬁnd folks that are like, look, what I really just
want to do is add some kind of image recognition, and we do things like with IoT,
image recognition that gets trained cameras on a conveyor belt, looking at parts
being treated and picking out defects. It's probably, don't want to start from scratch,
and I don't want to go build my entire whole data center to go do that. I just want
some simple image recognition.
This is where we provide PaaS services that just provide those as simple API cost to
developers. They can just plug in some data, they can actually do some simple
training. And all of a sudden, I can get oﬀ and running. I don't have to have all theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 20 of 28A - Keith Weissexpenses. I don't have to have hire 18 data analysts to come work for me just to get
that value. So that's the other end.
And then of course, when you get it to the top level, we've integrated a lot of the AI
into our SaaS applications. And so this is cases where -- I mean, you'll see this with
Oﬃce 365.
Productivity recommendations, heck even in our developer tools, we have kind of in
telecode inside the visions to the inter developers. It analyzes your code as you're
running compares it to a whole bunch of code that's been analyzed and tells you
when you could have written better, cleaner, safer code, which is really freaking
amazing. And that's driven oﬀ from a whole bunch of data.
So again, I think that infrastructure layer, we got it. The APIs and the simple use, I just
want to get started. We have that the SaaS layer, we have that as well. So we think we
can pretty much help you with any layer of that. And again, the R&D, last thing I'll
mention on this one.
Our R&D eﬀorts around AI are massive. The work we do with OpenAI, just one
example. The other one I like using is the holographic processing unit in the
HoloLens when you think about what that sucker is doing, you have essentially
photons coming at your eyeballs, captured by a camera, augmented with
holographic images, and then they come oﬀ of that to your eye and your brain can't
tell the diﬀerence.
Like it takes one month to train the AI models that go into the holographic
processing unit that you put into the HoloLens, like, wow, like if you want to know if
Microsoft invested like wow.
So that's what people like oftentimes, people don't think about that, but we have
incredibly advanced AI. And again, that's just another example of -- given the
infrastructure, we give them the tools and the libraries. Anytime we do hard stuﬀ like
that, we try and make it available as a service oﬀering inside of Azure. So others can
do the same.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. I wanted to us a little bit to security. And it's such an interesting
conversation with security and Microsoft. If you go back 5, seven years ago, right?
Security was a friction to getting people to adopt public cloud, adopt Azure security
was perhaps something that Microsoft was working on to get people more conﬁdent
in using the software overall.
And on the most recent conference call, we've gone so far the other way to where
now security is a $10 billion business for Microsoft. It's not just that your underlying
infrastructure is secure enough for you guys to run your stuﬀ for ﬁrms like Morgan
Stanley to run within Azure. But your security expertise is now productized and
you're selling it out in the marketplace.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 21 of 28A - Jason ZanderCan you talk a little bit about where Azure security is, both in terms of where you've
gotten to in terms of the security of the infrastructure itself. But also, what are the
solutions that you're selling to the end market? I know we have Sentinel in terms of
Sim. But what are the security solutions that are now built on Azure?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And it's been a huge area, as you point out. We've always had to do this work
because we have to secure, of course, our own services. So Oﬃce 365, Xbox, you
name it, we've always had to go do that. And we built out systems that can handle
that. One of the things that we've done -- and of course, we've had Windows and
Window sockets, et cetera.
But what we've done is we've gone back to take the things that we've built for
ourselves and then actually pull them in that our customers, again, (inaudible) use
them. So it starts oﬀ with all the end points that are out there. And that's not just
Windows PCs. But also like Android, your iPhone and IoT.
We're actually doing security for IoT devices. So we can actually pull those in and
understand what's going on there and make sure your ﬁrmware's up to date, et
cetera. So that's part of the security regimen that we're doing.
Then you can come back on to the cloud side, you look at Defender, which is you
use apps Defender as well as Microsoft, Microsoft Defenderfor Oﬃce 365 and
there's other pieces that go in. That's super important because it gives you a look at
all those devices in historical.
And you mentioned Sentinel, that's actually a diﬀerentiated piece of technology. It's
a cloud-based seat, which basically needs that we've done it entirely in the cloud.
And we were already handling petabytes into unbelievable numbers of signals every
day, and we pull all that stuﬀ together.
So our expectation is that being able to use a combination of Defender, will the end
point -- the protection that we've got. Sentinel to be able to track what you're doing
and be able to use the steam based technology on that. All those things come
together quite well. And so when you see this business traction that's out there, and
that's what we're doing.
We think the value proposition and why the business, I think, is going to be super
valuable is that we can put much more simplicity in it because we're handling so
much more of the space.
You don't have to cobble together some of these solutions. And we build it in by
default into our own products, Oﬃce 365, Azure, the security things come together.
So we think it's actually a pretty powerful combination.
Then we can still plug-in and work with other vendors, other sources of data. You can
actually look at hybrid environments, too, like cloud based, like I mentioned, alreadyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. We have about 10 more minutes left in our session. I have a bunch of
investor questions here that I want to get into. There's a couple of categories. So I'm
going to try to kind of bunch them in. A lot of questions on the competitive
environment, particularly versus AWS and GCP.
So maybe sort of the question that I'll pose is how do you guys think about
competition? And does that -- with the other hyperscalers? And does that change as
you move from like Infrastructure as a Service level to the Platform as a Service level?
Is it a diﬀerent type of competitive dynamic there?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. I'd say on the infrastructure level, of course, what we compete on is the fact that
we've done the hybrid work, and we've really invested over the years from software
to even appliance-level solutions that we've got worldwide coverage. At the
infrastructure level, that's, of course, what we look at.
From a PaaS perspective, there's a few areas that we really have pushed hard for a
long period of time. I mentioned IT a few times. I think with the data analytics space,
Purview, Synapse, et cetera, we think those are diﬀerentiators. And those are super
interesting for us to be able to, again, compete against.
There's also just a Dynamic, again, of we're going to partner with you, not compete
with you. So that is still relevant in a lot of cases, for a lot of folks. They want to make
sure when they're picking somebody that's a technology provider that's helping
them. And not actually going into their business. And it's why that complementary
thing is just so important. So those are a few of the things that we do.
And again, the more that we can help our customers get to the premium services.
That's a higher-margin structure for us, which makes it a lot easier. And so that also
can be beneﬁcial to the business. So it's a very competitive environment. That's
good for customers out there.
But we think, again, a few of our big long-term strategic bets like hybrid have been
super important. And honestly, for a lot of -- especially enterprise customers, they
have probably been working with us as a vendor.
We probably have been their preferred vendors for decades. That does count. So
that trust also in delivery, that trust of the partnership that we've had for a long time
also goes into some of the competitive evaluations.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. That's helpful. I've been actually getting a lot of questions about silicon
and semiconductors. So one here says, are we entering a time where value/IP isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 23 of 28A - Jason Zandermigrating back to the semi layer to the hardware layer?
Are there interesting things that Azure can enable from a compute side that no
reasonable company could do on their own. And then there's another question
about your vision or your road map for ARM. And what portion of workloads do you
expect migrating to custom silicon over time.
So a lot of questions about value migrating back down to the silicon layer. How do
you address this?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And the cloud is going to often be diﬀerent than some of your kind of client
form factors. And so let's just talk about the cloud, that's my core remit. From a cloud
perspective, again, I am spending all the money. I'm buying all the equipment, and I
own the software stack as well, pretty much.
So that gives me ownership north, south. And so even when I partner at particular
levels like component vendors, the chips for CPUs, whatever, I'm still buying enough
of it, and I can still optimize for the entire stack, which means that we've already for a
long period of time, worked with even some of the silicon providers on
customizations that make sense for our environment. And some of those things
could be proprietary. Some of them actually go back and ﬁt in the core.
I'll give you a concrete example is conﬁdential computing. The secure enclave
technology that I think is going to be critical to a bunch of the forward-leaning
security work out there.
That's something we worked with Intel for ﬁve years that nobody else had. And
we've already gone deeper on it, and there's an AMD version, and there's actually
ARM versions of that same technology. So those are examples that if I just own a
data center, and that was an enterprise, I can go back and ask for that, but I'd never
have enough volume to probably be able to justify it, and I don't have a staﬀ of
electrical engineers.
I do have a staﬀ of electrical engineers since so we can go to that kind of work. So I
think you can and should expect that we'll continue to make those sorts of
investments. And again, it's not just the silicon, it's also the hardware form factor
around that.
The components integration, et cetera, I mean NVRAM and kind of distributed
memory, another great example of innovation in the industry that's showing up in
clouds is the ﬁrst and primary thing. So you get all of that beneﬁt and the fact that I
get to run the ﬂeet the way I want to run the ﬂeet means that I can make sure it's fully
optimized north, south.
You had -- I can maybe stop there if that makes sense. And then you had asked a
question about what -- which types of CPUs. So ﬁrst of all, any other -- the follow-upFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

A - Jason Zanderon that. Otherwise, I think I can answer your question around the ARM versus x64, et
cetera?
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Yes, let's go into the like ARM and ability to sort of customize more loads to that shift.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. Great. Yes. So if you look at this, I mean, like a couple of diﬀerent things. One,
we fully expect that you're going to continue to add more and more capabilities.
That's GPUs, (inaudible) so again, it's not just the CPU. There's other components
that are in there.
Networking gear and things like that are places where we've done a whole bunch of
customer work as well because we want fast times, we want more control, et cetera.
So we've done a lot of customer work around that. So you'll see more and more
there.
From a CPU perspective, I think the truth is a signiﬁcant portion of the existing
software, especially enterprise software out there is still x64 and I can and will be for
a long period of time. That's what you're optimizing for. So big database runs, big
kind of ISV software, et cetera.
The bulk of that stuﬀ that's running out there is x64 today. So of course, we had great
partnerships with intel. We have great partnerships with AMD, who are the primary
silicon vendors in the CPU space that do that kind of work.
From an ARM perspective, in server, absolutely. There's been a whole bunch of work
in many diﬀerent silicon vendors out there that have produced ARM parts that are
designed to do the big scale and not just the things we would put in our pockets,
but the things we've put it in our data center.
So I do expect that over time, we can and will continue to see a good distribution of
this. Always keep in mind the x64 workloads again are running the bulk of stuﬀ
today. I think that there's a lot of other workloads in the future. Especially if you start
looking at some of the kind of cloud-native solutions, some of those as well. Those
are all good candidates.
I think you'll see a lot of noise that's out there. The other thing I always keep in mind
is that the CPU is only one component of cost. It's not the only component. It's one
of the things you pay margin on, and you have to do design around. There's also
RAM, there's disks, there's a whole bunch of other components, networking, et
cetera, that go into a cloud.
So it's not all dominated by one thing. And I think it's important that as an industry
we don't hyper conﬂate price performance as just being a CPU thing because that's
only part of the equation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

A - Jason ZanderThere's a bigger broader thing. That's diﬀerent than trying to go oﬀ and drive scale
on something new you're bringing to market. I think we should just be careful we
don't conﬂate those things that have caused a lot of customer confusion.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. I think that's a good segue into the last topic that I want to cover in the
last couple of minutes that we have, which is the potential to drive more operating
eﬃciencies out of the plan.
Microsoft has seen a tremendous increase in overall cloud gross margins over the
past several years. You don't break out what Azure gross margins are in particular,
feel free to if you wanted to do right here. Michael will never forgive me.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
I have a next meeting with (inaudible) very awkward. I'll let her (inaudible) decision
(inaudible)
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
But Amy has said that Azure eﬃciencies are garnering increasing eﬃciencies within
the Azure plant has been a big part of moving those overall cloud gross margins
higher.
Can you talk to us a little bit about what's left? Like is there further room for
eﬃciencies? Can you squeeze more sort of out of the existing plant? Or does it
necessitate, it's got to be the higher value solutions unless we're selling a higher mix
of database, you're going to tap out pretty soon.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. No, I think there there's still opportunity. There's still work that we are doing. I set
targets from a planning perspective, every six months on the semester boundary,
new targets for eﬃciency for the team. And we continue to go oﬀ and go do that.
So even the stuﬀ we talked about, how do I even do more optimization? There are
several things we continue to work on. So supply chain, optimizing the supply chain.
How can I make sure that they get parts in faster, I get them up and running and
quicker to customers?
How do you make sure that you get a macular utilization on work that we're doing.
Those are things that we invest in. Basically making the software more eﬃcient, the
hardware, more eﬃcient, supply chain more eﬃcient.
We'll continue to do all of those. And I -- the bottom line, you should expect that the
Azure cloud is going to be competitive in this market. We're absolutely going to be
competitive. There's no other magic in there. Anything that's required, we are
investing will continue to do that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

A - Jason ZanderNow that said, from a -- my perspective is that it does become harder and harder
over time. Are we there yet? No. But it does become harder and harder. So there's a
bunch of low-hanging fruit. It's just takes a lot of hard work.
We've got to keep doing that. And I think it's also important to a Microsoft
perspective, that we continue to invest ahead of revenue so we can go capture
share. And so adding 7 more data centers just in the last quarter alone, investing in
our secret and top secret clouds for the U.S. those are examples where we are
investing so that we can capture share.
In some cases, highly specialized share that, frankly, only a couple of clouds in the
world can actually do. We are one of them. I mean those are examples continue to
invest, and we will.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And then I know ESG initiatives, and particularly carbon initiatives, has been
something that's very top of mind for Microsoft. Bill Gates' just published a book
talking about it.
You guys had some pretty aggressive targets out there for not just carbon neutral,
but sort of sticking back all the carbon that you guys have ever admitted over your
lifetime. Does that run counter to sort of driving these eﬃciencies? Does it get into
the way? Or is it part and parcel, listen, if you want to be more green, if you want to
be cleaner, you should be a lot more eﬃcient as well.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And they don't have to be mutually exclusive. And our stated goal is to be
carbon-negative by 2030, and we are an over 40-year-old company. So that's like
the lifetime of Microsoft back to Bill and Paul and 12 of the people all the way up to
the company we are today.
We're going to go negative. And that's technology. We announced this cool thing in
Europe called Northern Lights, which is carbon capture, where we can even use the
work we do for seismic and HPC work was in order to be able to capture carbon and
actually get it stored. There's all sorts of energies there.
Back to your point of, does it cost us? Well, the truth is there are areas of the world,
especially if I look at the Nordics, where actually, the renewable energy there is the
energy system.
The fact that you have fjords, you have hydro, et cetera, I have that in my home state
here in Washington, Washington state. But that actually is the system that's there.
And so we can, I think, the both green and go after the ESG goals, help with the
carbon work that's there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-02

A - Jason ZanderI think one of the things you'll see is Microsoft, we're trying to take a very deliberate
approach, and we recognize that you need a balance of all of these things, and we
also need to help the world get to where it needs to be. So we hope to be not an
exemplar.
We also hope to be a partner while folks that are generating the energy systems we
use today, but also innovating in sustainable solutions that we'll be using tomorrow.
How can we actually leverage those and do them.
And then by the way, when you get back into industry, we want to be able to come
back and help companies that they may have a big carbon footprint, ﬁgure out ways
through IOT, technology, carbon capture, whatever the tech is, ﬁgure out how we
can actually reduce that and then have them also be part of the ESG solutions that
are out there.
I mean, I think if you do it right, I think we can actually balance this all out. And no
one extreme is just going to win. It's going to have to be a balance of some pretty
practical stuﬀ if you want to pull them.

Excellent. Jason, you've been more than generous with your time. Fascinating
conversation. A lot going on within Azure and within broader Microsoft right now.
Thank you for sharing your views on it. Again, very much appreciate your time. It's a
fascinating discussion.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Thank you, so much. I appreciate you inviting me. Hopefully next time we can do it in
person. I'll be using your microphone and not mine.
