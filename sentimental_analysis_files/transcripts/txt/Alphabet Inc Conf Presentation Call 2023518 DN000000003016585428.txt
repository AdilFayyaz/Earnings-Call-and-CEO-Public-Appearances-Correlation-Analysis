{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
This is a treat and I am so excited for this next interview. Neal Mohan is here from
CEO of YouTube and SVP, Google. Thanks for being here. Before we start, I have to
read the Safe-Harbor, okay? So some of the statements that Mr. Mohan may make
today could be considered forward-looking. These statements involve a number of
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially. Any
forward-looking statements that Neal makes are based on assumptions as of today
and Alphabet undertakes no obligation to update them. Please refer to Alphabet's
Form 10-K for a discussion of the risk factors that may aﬀect its results, okay?
So with that, thanks for being here. Let me give people a little bit of a background
for those that don't know who Neal is. So Neal has been at Google for 15 years. First,
building out the Display and Video Ads business and then YouTube's product
operation. He stepped into lead YouTube when Susan stepped down as CEO, I
believe in March, and now overseas YouTube's content and business operations,
engineering product development. He previously served as YouTube's Chief Product
Oﬃcer and was responsible for YouTube's products, user experience, and trust and
safety and all platforms and devices globally. Prior to this, he held the role as SVP of
Display and Video Ads at Google, and before joining Google, Neal was Senior Vice-
President of Strategy and Product Development at DoubleClick, where he built the
company's strategic plan with the product team and rapidly grew the business. So
thank you so much for being here. This is the ﬁrst on the back of Brandcast last night,
(inaudible) couple of days. You were named CEO of YouTube in March and I thought
would be helpful for everyone here to walk us through the priorities you have in this
new role.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Sure, ﬁrst of all, thank you, Michael, for having me here. It's great to be here and
thank you everybody for making the time. You know I think, I will just start oﬀ by
saying, just repeating what our mission is at YouTube, which is, we like to say thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 2 of 15YouTube's mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world, and that
sounds very lofty but really fundamentally it's about the creators on our platform.
Everything at YouTube starts with our creators. They are incredibly talented. They're
all over the world. They are looking to build audiences, share their creativity with the
world, and build a business. And so by enabling our creators to build an audience
and build -- build a living on our platform, that's what brings their millions and
millions of fans to YouTube, and of course, that's what is attractive to our advertisers,
all our partners that support this incredible creator economy on YouTube, and so
that's sort of the big-picture.
And in terms of my priorities to enable that goal to really enable our creators, there's
four of them. And so I will talk about them and they have to do with what I think are
really some pretty fundamental seismic shifts that are occurring in our industry. And
they're about creation, they're about quality consumption, they're about
monetization, and they are all based fundamentally on our responsibility as a global
platform. So let me -- let me sort of unpack what I mean by that. So just starting with
the creation. So, creation of content, video content in particular, we are a platform
that's of course all things video, is changing fundamentally and it's changing
because we all have the power of a production studio in our pockets with our mobile
phones. So we are all creators in some sense, especially, younger Gen Z creators. I
think I saw a stat recently which said that's something on the order of three out of
four of every Gen Z in the US uploaded a video online in the last year.
So that's a pretty profound change in terms of creation of content, the
democratization of content creation, and so that's a big priority for us. It's mobile-
ﬁrst. A lot of it is short-form, YouTube Shorts, of course, we can talk more about. But
for us, it's really multi-format, mobile-driven, participatory in nature, and so really
making sure that we have the tools and capabilities from a creation standpoint. One
of those capabilities, of course, that I'm very excited about that's also going to
revolutionize creation of course is Generative AI, which we can talk more about. We
are investing there in terms of creator tools and really enabling our creator
ecosystem. So creation, mobile-driven creation, short-form, multi-format is a top
priority. A lot of our focus is there. The second area that I'll call out, which is changing
rapidly as well is consumption, quality consumption of video content. And for us, we
are a platform that is about young users, 95% of Gen Z say that they use YouTube on
a regular basis.
We want to maintain and super-serve our young users on our platform. And for
them, that means community, that means fun, so making YouTube more interactive. I
talked about participatory. You see all those changes in the App when you open up
the mobile phone by really just bringing the platform to life. So that's on the quality
consumption side. The second big thing on the quality consumption side, of course,
is the living room. So, the living room screen is the largest and fastest-growing place
where YouTube is consumed. So Connected TV, our investment there is a really big
priority of mine, that's about bringing the full magic of YouTube, the interactivity of
YouTube when viewers are consuming content, when they turn-on the television set,
they want to watch YouTube and that means all forms of content. Everything from
their favorite YouTube creators to blockbuster movies to football, which we can talkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18

Neal Mohanabout live sports what have you, and they all expect that in the YouTube app in the
living room. So quality consumption is the second really big priority for us.
The third that I will call out of course is monetization. This amazing creator economy
that exists on YouTube and that's what we want to really double down on.
Monetization for us, ﬁrst and foremost is driven by advertising, that will be a primary
driver of our business. Over the last 12 months, across all of YouTube products, we
generated revenues of nearly $40 billion and that's across all YouTube products, and
obviously, AVOD is a big part of that and the other part is a big part of that is our
SVOD business. And so on the SVOD side, we have YouTube Premium, 80 million
subscribers on YouTube Premium. We have YouTube TV, of course, ﬁve million plus
subscribers on that, and so monetization is going to remain a priority, especially in
our fast-growing products and surfaces like YouTube Shorts and Connected TV. And
then the ﬁnal piece, which I touched on in the beginning, none of this would be
possible in terms of creation, quality consumption, monetization without our focus
on responsibility. That it remains my top priority. And so that's living up to our
responsibility on behalf of our two billion users that come to our platform on a
regular basis and making sure that we are a safe platform for creators, for our
partners, for our viewers. So those are -- those are what our teams are focused on
and that's what I'm super-excited about investing in.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
Thanks, Neal. Over the past few quarters, YouTube's advertising growth has really
slowed down, what's contributing to that weakness and what types of advertising
verticals have you seen being hit the hardest?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
So, we've talked about this over the course of the last 12 months and kind of the
bigger sort of macroeconomic slowdown that's going on. We also mentioned, I
think, Ruth mentioned this in our latest earnings, that we've seen a stabilization on
that front. In terms of advertiser verticals, I think what I would say is, we've seen
growth in things like Travel, Retail, which has been balanced by slowdown, and
things like Finance and Media and Entertainment. Those are some of the verticals I'd
call out, but that's basically what I'd say about that in addition to what Ruth talked
about.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
So in your ﬁrst communicate [ph] as CEO in March, you really put emphasis on
creators, you've done that again here. I wanted to know what has YouTube done
diﬀerently in this area versus prior strategy, right? Has there been a strategy shift in
terms of embracing creators, anything you're doing diﬀerently now?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
No. I think what I'd say there, Michael, is, again what I said at the beginning, which is
creators really are our lifeblood. I mean everything that we do is about supportingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)

Neal Mohanour creator ecosystem. We are the original creator economy. These creators are
media moguls in their own right, not only are they incredibly creative talented
people that have subscriber bases and followers that are millions, 10s of millions of
fans all over the world, but they are incredible entrepreneurs too and so supporting
their businesses is our top priority, giving them monetization capabilities but also
giving them the creative tools that I talked about. And if we do that, that's what
creates this incredibly vibrant sort of ecosystem that brings billions of fans to the
platform. And then, of course, that's incredibly attractive that engaged reach if you
will, is incredibly attractive to our advertisers.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
And on the same theme, has there been any change of consumption patterns over
the years towards more creators? If you look at the composition of how time is spent,
is there anything you could say about creators' impact on consumption?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
The way I would -- I would think about that is, we really want to be a platform for all
things video and so that, of course, means our YouTubers are creators on the
platform, and for them, we want to cater to all of their needs. Some creators are
incredible at 15-second YouTube Shorts. They generate 10s of millions of views on
that type of content. Other creators have grown up on what we call long-forms, that
traditional YouTube format, 15-minute VOD videos, what have you. There is other
creators, gamers that will do hours long live stream, so everything from 15-second
Shorts to 15-hour live streams is our focus, and by building those capabilities for our
creators that's what brings their fans back to our platform. And so truly having a
multi-format approach is really the way that we go after. And just to make that very
concrete for you, Michael, as we -- just a couple of months ago, Meghan Trainor
released a single, one of her kind of hit singles called Mother. She teased it with a 15-
second short, generated an enormous amount of buzz around that song. She
premiered it through a live stream on YouTube, and then now it's racking up millions
and millions of views. The music video is -- as a traditional sort of long-form video on
the platform. So it's like that multi-format journey works incredibly well for creators
because their fans get a chance to experience that creator across all of those
diﬀerent surfaces.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
So, you tease Shorts for us, which started back in August '21. We have couple of
questions here. What engagement trends have been on Shorts and is it mostly
mobile product at this point in time?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
So, the way I think about Shorts again is that it's kind of one pillar in that overall sort
of multi-format story that I described, but it's an important one, and it's one that
really leans into all of those creation sort of paradigm shifts that I was describing at
the top of this conversation. It is mobile-ﬁrst in terms of creation and we are seeingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 15Michael Nathanson
Neal Mohanlots and lots of success among creators adopting short videos on YouTube. 80%
growth in terms of creators that upload short content daily to our platform in the last
year. So it's working as a creation tool, also you open up the app, you hit that plus
button on YouTube and you can upload a short from your mobile phone very, very
quickly that can rack up lots and lots of views. There is a creator that I was just with
yesterday evening at our Brandcast event called Airrack. He is a huge creator with
millions of subscribers. He does a lot of really innovative things on the YouTube
short-form and he also produces longer form content, so truly multi-format, but his
Shorts -- the Shorts that he uploads on average generate something like 22 million
views every time he does it. He's incredibly talented, but he is also, as I said, a true
entrepreneur.
So on the creation side, we're very happy with the progress we're seeing on YouTube
Shorts and creators are obviously incentivized to do it because it's getting lots and
lots of viewership. So, I think in Q4, the metric that we announced was 50 billion
daily views of Shorts content on our platform, up from 30 billion earlier that year, and
those views are generated by 1.5 billion monthly logged-in users on our platform,
over ﬁve trillion views over the course of the last 12 months. And so lots of success
on the viewer side. And then the third part of that sort of stool after creators and
viewers that I'm also very excited about, although it's very early days is monetization.
And so we're very focused on creating opportunities for our advertisers in this new
format that we have to augment what they're doing on YouTube generally, and so
those are direct response use cases. We have Shorts campaigns that are about direct
response objectives, shopping objectives. We are investing now in brand use cases
so that advertisers can get very eﬃcient reach through the Shorts format. And so
that's something that's early days but I'm excited about.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
Yeah. And the company has been very clear that it's early days, you can take some
time, and one of the questions we get, I'm sure Ellen gets too is, do you think short-
form video formats like Shorts can monetize at similar rates to other YouTube Ad
products right? So anything about the monetization? One of your competitors talked
about monetization triple-digit, but what's your take on the potential monetization of
Shorts versus other products (inaudible).
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I think I would say something similar to what I said about creators on
the platform, which is just like we want to provide that broad canvas to creators
across all formats, whether it's, as I said, 15-second Shorts, 15-hour live streams, we
recognize that that's what works for advertisers as well. Before my time at YouTube,
as you mentioned in my bio, I spent a lot of time over, a couple of decades, building
ad products for advertisers, for agency partners, and one of the things that I learned
through that experience is that advertisers really want to be where their consumers
are, and what YouTube gives them is, it gives them eﬃcient reach, gives them an
engaged audience because of this creator-fan connection that I'm describing. And
that's ultimately what turns into ROI, regardless of whether they have brand
objectives, direct response objectives, and that works across all formats. It worksFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Michael Nathanson
Neal Mohan
Michael Nathansonacross our traditional VOD formats, but it also works in Shorts, and so I view it as sort
of a complete portfolio that we can oﬀer to our advertisers. And that's why I'm so
excited in terms of investing in these ad formats on the Shorts feed as well.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
Okay. You said earlier about the living room, and that's one of our favorite area to
study, right, so it's YouTube Living Room is the fastest-growing surface and according
to Nielsen, YouTube CTV consumption is now larger than Netﬂix in the most recent
month within the US. And I think people don't really realize how large of a platform
you have at Connected TV. What improvements have you made to the service to
make it so popular? How you got it to be so sticky on CTV?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. No, I'm glad you brought that up. It really -- it goes back to kind of those four
pillars I said at the beginning and in terms of quality consumption, Living Room is
one of those things that's front and center because it's growing so fast. And by the
way, that's not just a US phenomenon that's a global phenomenon in terms of the
consumption we are seeing on living room screens, it just works for our viewers. And
so we're investing very heavily in it. And really the way that I would describe that is,
we're trying to bring that full magic of the YouTube product that people know and
love on their mobile devices to the living room. So that means in our activity, that
means all of our formats, that means our advertising products for brand for direct
response. So to give you an example of that, we talked a lot about Shorts. Shorts is
obviously a product that works incredibly well on your mobile device, but one of the
big sleeper hits in terms of products we launched last year was Shorts in the living
room and so we see lots of consumption of the Shorts format on living room
screens.
And it goes back to what I said about what viewer expectations are when they turn
on the TV. Young users, young viewers particularly when they turn on the TV, they are
turning on YouTube, that's what TV is for them. And when they turn on YouTube, they
want all of their content in one place and that means their favorite creators, Shorts
creators, long-form creators, multi-format creators, but also their favorite movies, live
sports, what have you, and that's the power of our presence on the living room, and
that's really what powers those numbers that you mentioned. We are the number
one streaming service in the US. I think just a couple of days ago Nielsen came out
with their latest numbers. Not only did we maintain our number one position as a
streaming service in the US, but we grew it while other streaming services were
either ﬂat or down. And so we're very excited about our growth in Connected TV and
that's why we're investing so heavily in it. And I think 150 million users in the US in
terms of our reach on Connected TV devices.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
It is before, but globally we have observed that CTV is more slower to develop, so
you talk a bit, ﬁrst, where you're in the US, where you have such acceleration, give usFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18

Michael Nathanson
Neal Mohana sense of the international opportunity for YouTube on Connected TV, what are you
seeing in -- anything you oﬀer internationally?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, I think that -- so a lot of the growth that we have seen here in the US over the
last few years is what we are seeing now in international markets and it really is truly
around the world and what I would say is that everything that we're doing to really
superserve our viewers in terms of this quality consumption concept that I'm
describing in the US is what we're doing globally. So we see the same trends in
terms of viewers, especially younger viewers, Gen Z viewers, wanting to watch and
engage with their favorite creators all over the world, whatever language, whatever
region therein, but also other forms of content. We obviously, are invested in things
like live sports here in the US with the NFL, but we've carried live sports in other
parts of the world as well, and where does that get consumed, oftentimes it gets
consumed on the largest screen in the house. And so those trends I think are
carrying forward, not just in North America but in other parts of the world as well.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
So another -- let's go back to the key pillar discussion you had. We always tend to
focus on the advertising opportunity on YouTube, which is so large, but can you talk
a bit about the opportunities that you see in subscriptions?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. So I mean, we always start with advertising because that is a big part of our
business and I think going to be the primary driver of our growth. As I mentioned,
across all YouTube products, we generated nearly $40 billion in revenue over the last
12 months, large part of that is advertising, but we're also investing in our SVOD
business. I mentioned both of them, YouTube Music and Premium, YouTube TV.
Starting with premium, the way I think about that is that it's really again a way for us
to truly superserve our viewers that love the YouTube product by giving them this
enhanced experience and that's why it's got over 80 million subscribers. So
everything from ad-free to background to downloads, and it really, particularly caters
of course to music lovers. And so that's why there is that close association between
YouTube Premium and Music. And so we're the way that we think about that is really
investing in the features and products that our users are expecting on those
platforms. So to give you a couple examples of that. We have a standalone YouTube
Music app. We obviously have the main app and we invest in products that are really
geared towards music lovers. So we built something called Radio Builder a couple of
months ago. That's the ability for you to be able to generate kind of like your own
personalized radio station based on your favorite artists and musicians.
So we want to keep investing in things like that. Investing through things like
machine-learning and artiﬁcial intelligence to make our recommendation so that
discovery of music across our catalog of 100 million-plus songs is delightful and fun
for our users. And so that's a big part of our premium experience. And we're also
building features that are just kind of great features to have regardless of whetherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 15Michael Nathanson
Neal Mohan
Michael Nathansonyou are listening to music or what you're doing as a Premium subscriber. So just a
few weeks ago, we launched the ability to queue video, so that you can have your
kind of your backlog to work through at your own leisure as a feature. We're
investing in things like you know just more optimized enhance bit rates around
things like 1080P, so that viewer experience is more crisp and high-quality, especially
in sort of very fast motion detail type videos and things like that to really just delight
our users. And so that's how we think about Premium, which is to really cater to our
viewer needs. Of course, that's a new revenue stream for our creators as well and so
and it gives us twin engine, so that nearly $40 billion is driven by, of course,
advertising revenues but also by subscriptions.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
So here's a question that's near and dear to our hearts here at MoﬀettNathanson. We
are students of Pay-TV. That's how we built our ﬁrm and we're intrigued about your
push into the virtual MVPD space, YouTube TV. I love the product. I'm a fan of the
product and I am hoping to get it. We wonder what do you see as a potential long-
term opportunity at YouTube TV?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I think that it goes back to how we think about product development in
general at YouTube and Google more broadly, but in this YouTube context, which is
about building something that we think is going to be really awesome for our users,
for our viewers, and that's how YouTube TV started, which was how do we reimagine
the television viewing experience in this case, linear television viewing experience
through the lens of YouTube. So that meant things like DVR and the cloud, unlimited
DVR, recommendations -- personalized recommendations powered by our
investment in things like machine-learning, innovation to the live sports experience
in terms of things like key plays or in-game highlights or dynamic scoreboards and
things like that. So really trying to bring that type of innovation to the viewer
experience and that's remain sort of fundamentally the way that we think about
YouTube TV. And so that's why we've continued to invest in that platform. It's got
over ﬁve million subscribers now. So we're very happy with that. And an area where
we brought a lot of that innovation that we developed on the YouTube TV side to the
main app is in something called Primetime Channels, which we just launched in the
US a few months ago, which is this kind of a-la-carte [ph] channel subscription
service on the main app. And so again, it sort of shows how the YouTube TV strategy
and kind of our core main app strategy ﬁt together.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
Okay. Another question I always wanted to ask you is that we've studied the market
for a while and believe that the opportunity is a skinnier bundle and the optimal
price is a skinnier bundle led by sports and news under $50 a month. So given the
leaking of more-and-more premium content to a program as an [ph] own service is,
and you've seen the content leaked that's good content, what do you think the
evolution of YouTube TV look like within this environment?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18

Neal Mohan{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, what I'd say about that is we are really happy with our channel lineup. It has
grown over the years and a lot of that has been in response to the direct feedback
we get from our customers on YouTube TV. They tell us what they think about our
features regularly. They love our features. This views feature that I was describing in
terms of key players, et cetera, just won a Technical Emmy. So we're very focused on
obviously product feedback that we get from users, but we also get content
feedback. And so our content lineup that has grown over the years is really driven by
a lot of that feedback that we get from our subscribers.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
Okay. I get a lot of content feedback by the way.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
All right. Keep it coming.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
Okay. So you mentioned Sunday Ticket, one of my favorite topics as well. YouTube
made a very big news in our world by agreeing to carry Sunday Ticket, what do you
see is the opportunity here (inaudible) a product that was mostly limited to Satellite
TV?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, I think that there is a few things that I'll say and I will start by just kind of
describing it from a YouTube standpoint why I think it really makes sense for us,
which is, of course, it will allow us to really, again back to super-serving our users our
YouTube TV subscribers as -- and will help us grow that business. I mentioned
Primetime Channel, so giving users choice in terms of how they can sign-up for
Sunday Ticket either on the YouTube TV side or a-la-carte through prime-time
channels, so that's kind of another piece. And then the third piece, of course, which I
think I am very excited about, but I know the NFL is also very excited about is
bringing the magic of YouTube to that football experience and that's about
engaging our creators. And so that's about allowing them to produce content that is
exclusive in terms of NFL content, behind-the-scenes access, you saw a lot of that
actually at the draft that just happened a couple of weeks ago. There were lots of
YouTubers there and the YouTubers were a huge hit, not just amongst all the people
at the draft, but by the athletes themselves that were getting drafted, many of whom
grew up on YouTube, right? And so that was -- that's some of the excitement that we
want to bring. And of course, so across all of those three pieces, YouTube TV,
Primetime Channels, that's about growing our subscription business. The creator
piece is, of course, is about growing our advertising business, and so that's what we
see together.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 15Michael Nathanson
Neal MohanBut the other thing that I'll say about that, that I'm very excited about, Michael, is just
the innovation that I think will be able to bring to the fan experience and so that
means you can get Sunday Ticket anywhere, so not just through YouTube TV, but if
you want at a-la-carte on the main app you can get it through Primetime Channels.
You can get it without a dish in your house. You can literally just get it with a couple
of taps on your phone, watch it on your television screen, so that accessibility that
consumer choice is a big part of the value that we want to bring to the table. The
second is just innovation. So again, I mentioned a lot of the features that we are
doing for sports lovers on YouTube TV, want to bring them to the main app. Just a
couple of weeks ago during March Madness, we launched our multi-view feature,
which is the ability to watch multiple games at once. It was a feature that was just
overrun with customer support request asking for that feature as quickly as possible
because we were doing a gradual rollout. So we sped it up to respond to that
feedback and I'm super-excited about bringing that to the NFL. And that's the
feature that works regardless of device, regardless of set-top television, what have
you, because we do it on the software side. So we're very, very excited about
innovation. And then the third thing which our fans on YouTube, especially our
younger fans is, what we're going to be able to do with creators and so -- and by the
way, all of these things, accessibility, product innovation, creator integrations are
things that not only are we excited about but the NFL is also very excited about.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
They're so excited that Roger Goodell came to your (inaudible) yesterday, is the only
upfront he visited this week, which leads me to my next question. How should we
think about YouTube's appetite to add other premium sports rights going forward
including an NBA (inaudible) package, which is the next big league that's being
negotiated?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
So the ﬁrst thing I'll say is right now I am very focused on making sure that the
Sunday Ticket experience is a great one for our fans, our partners, of course, our
creators and so that's the top priority. The other thing that I will say there is that,
there's obviously lots of attention around Sunday Ticket, but YouTube has been a big
destination for sports fans all over the world for a very, very long-time, especially we
are one of the largest sports platform, especially for Gen Z viewers all over the world.
We've carried live sports from soccer matches to other forms of sports all over the
world for years, sports leagues, federations, teams, athletes have all had channels on
our platform for many years. The NFL, of course, has a very big channel. You
mentioned the NBA, they're one of our closest partners and they have an incredibly
successful channel on YouTube. We distribute NBA TV, as you know, we carry League
Pass both on YouTube TV side, as well as on the Primetime Channel side, and all the
live games, of course, are on YouTube TV through our partners as well. And so that
has already -- that already has been a long-term sort of ﬂourishing relationship on
our platform. In terms of rights around content, we're very focused on the NFL and
Sunday Ticket and we look at everything on an individual basis to make sure it makes
sense for our viewers, for our business, and so that's how we would approach
anything.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18

As more as cord-cutting accelerates and leagues look for younger viewers this is
going be a constant question that you will get going-forward, because there is a
clear need from the leagues to ﬁnd a partner like YouTube to solve their long-term
problems on aging demographics, that's just an editorial you don't have to
comment, if you don't want to, but, okay, let's pivot to gaming. Again something that
you talked about on your ﬁrst communicate with all of us, we focus a lot on Amazon
and Twitch, what they have done on Twitch. Can you talk about your plans to
increase traction engagement among the gaming community?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, so I talked about things like music earlier, Michael, that's one of the kind of
long-standing big verticals on our platform. The other one that sort of comparable is
gaming. Gaming has been a part of YouTube's history from the very, very early days
of YouTube, well over a decade ago. And so it's a big part of our user's experience
on the platform on a regular basis, some of our biggest creators, most successful
creators are gamers on our platform. And for us, gaming means not just
livestreaming, that of course is a big part of the gaming experience on our platform,
but also VOD consumption that is also where a lot of gaming content gets
consumed across all titles, not just what's the hot titled today but really over the
entire core business and so that's what I would say at a high-level about gaming. The
other thing that I would say that's really interesting about gaming creators on our
platform and gaming viewers is that it's where a lot of the product innovation
actually happens as well. Some of the earliest adopters of our features tend to be
gamers and so we talked a lot about our AVOD business and our SVOD business.
Another area that we invest in is alternative monetization solutions for our creators,
things like fan funding, channel memberships, Super Chat, Super Stickers, the ability
for creators to make money through live streams. Well, a lot of that technology and a
lot of those products got seeded in the gaming community because there is this
notion of gamers and viewers really supporting each other, gamer supporting other
gamers, so the ability to gift a channel membership to a creator's channel was
developed with gamers in mind. And once we build it for gamers and we want to
make it available to the broader creator community and viewer committee, but a lot
of that seed of innovation actually happens on -- amongst our gaming community.
So it remains something that's very important to me, important to YouTube that we're
going to continue to invest in.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
Okay. You touched on this earlier with the NFL, your subscription opportunity, but
what does this mean taking (inaudible) in building out Primetime Channel space,
right? So can you talk a bit about maybe using that as a beacon to bring people to
your new launch of channels?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18

Michael NathansonYeah, so as I mentioned, Sunday Ticket will be available to YouTube TV subscribers,
but it will also be available on this new product called Primetime Channels in an a-la-
carte fashion. So it will be an important part of our lineups in Primetime channels, but
we've had Primetime channels now for a few months, it's really early days. We have, I
think over 40 channels now that our viewers are subscribing to and so Sunday Ticket
will be part of that line-up, but we're going to continue to grow that portfolio of
channels there. And again, our lens by which we look at all of these new products
and businesses is through the user Innovation lens, and so to give you -- so going
back to some of my core themes, in this case around quality consumption, the
expectation is that when a user comes to YouTube, they want all of their video
content as a one-stop shop on our platform. And so, what does that mean, it means
my favorite creators, of course, but now it might mean the channels I subscribe to,
whether it's Sunday Ticket, whether it's Paramount Plus, what have you, you get that
there. And by the way when you do that the recommendations for shows or videos
are now just going to happen seamlessly in that recommendation fee that you know
and love on YouTube already. So we want to bring -- we don't want to just create a
product for the sake of creating a product. We want to really bring user innovation to
it. That's what I think is our diﬀerentiator. And Primetime channels, in the way that
Discovery is going to work, integrated with your core YouTube experiences, what our
users expect, and what we're going to deliver to that.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
Because, again one of the major frustrations, if you ask anyone in this room or any
executives who have spoken in the past couple days is that lack of content discovery,
recommendation engines, and streaming world is incredibly frustrating for everyone
that you can't ﬁnd the content you want to and you see that as a major opportunity
given your Search credentials and giving YouTube?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, so just from all of our own experiences on YouTube here, a lot of that
quality engagement comes from the quality of our recommendations are
personalized recommendations. So when you open up the app, the feed of course
that you see is personalized for all of you based on your interest. And so in that
sense, we are a place where viewers come to consume video. We are kind of our
own unique thing, we are a video consumption platform, we are not a social network,
we are not sort of traditional media, and a big part of that is discovery of our content
that's personalized. And so that's the type of innovation that happens kind of on the
core YouTube side that we're going to bring to something like Primetime channels.
So when you subscribe to your channel, your expectation should be that you don't
have to think to go and ﬁgure out sort of where that show is. It should just show up in
your recommendation feed on the home feed after you're done watching a video on
the watch page, and so that's an example of how we aim to tackle this discovery
problem in a kind of one-stop shop type of experience on the YouTube app.

ﬁgure out what's the pattern of that, so to unify passwords management using your
Google login to basically do it would be really eﬃcient as well.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, as I said, the expectation is that, especially among young viewers,
when they turn on the TV and they are turning on YouTube, they want all their
content there and that's a vision.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
Okay. Let me ask you, some of that Philip [ph] has been saying on the calls lately,
which is, he is looking to bring more shopping features to YouTube. Can you give us
some examples of what you're doing on this front and how that drive grow?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, so shopping is an area that we have been investing in, as Philip's talked about,
others have talked about for the last few years, and again it goes back to what I said
at the very beginning which is, it all starts with our creators again. And so a big
opportunity for our creators to be able to connect with their fans and also obviously
to grow their businesses is shopping services and products. You see that already on
YouTube. I view it as a way to just kind of the augment that sort of connection that
exists between creators and viewers already on the platform. So much of our
verticals, whether it's fashion and beauty, whether it's electronics, whether it's what
have you, really across the spectrum, oftentimes it's creators talking about their
favorite products, talking about recommendations in terms of their favorite services,
where they went on vacation, what have you. And that is a shopping opportunity
from the standpoint of creators being able to oﬀer that to their fans in an authentic
way and -- but it's also an opportunity for their fans. Their fans want that. They want
the ability to watch something that their favorite creators are talking about and then
be able to transact, to be able to purchase that product, whether it's a hairbrush or
top or what have you. And so that's again sort of the product vision behind why
we're investing in shopping to connect the creators with their fans, not just in terms
of viewing content, but now this kind of shopping commerce experience on our
platform.
And the way I think about it is just like when you go to a mall in the real world, you're
not going because you have like the shopping list of stuﬀ that you want to buy, it's
part of it is in entertainment community experience, you are going with your friends,
your family and along the way you might buy a pair of jeans. And so that's sort of the
way the journey lives on YouTube and it's just kind of, I feel like as a core part of the
YouTube experience that we should build for our creators and our fans. And so we
are investing in it and of course, that's a great opportunity I think for our retailers, for
our brand partners. You see that, so you've probably seen a lot of that in terms of the
Shopping Cards that now show up below the videos on the Watch Page on YouTube,
the carousels that exist there, their Ad formats, the shopping cards are also organic.
We had -- we just had Coachella a few weeks ago. A big part of that CoachellaFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 14 of 15Michael Nathanson
Neal Mohanexperience, of course, were the live streams like the unprecedented number of live
streams that we did from all the stages that made it a truly global phenomenon for
music lovers. But we also had a lot of commerce opportunities that were merch from
your favorite artists, whether it's Bad Bunny or Blackpink or what have you, were
available on the YouTube app right then and there and that stuﬀ kind of sold
incredibly well because that's what the fans of those artists wanted. And so that's the
way that we think about the shopping opportunity. What I will say is that it's really
early days and we are investing in it, but we are doing it because we think it really
serves all of these constituents over the long-term.
{BIO 2009061 <GO>}
So, my last question is one that only can be -- is really a topic of 2023. Can you talk
about -- you've been using machine-learning AI for many years, so it's nothing new
for the people at Alphabet. But what could generative AI do at scale to contribute
either creativity on a platform or engage in YouTube. So when you think about the AI
opportunity for you, how would you quantify it?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah, so, ﬁrst of all, Michael, I'm glad you said that we have been thinking about it,
investing in it for a long-time. If you think about, again the YouTube product, I talked
so much here about personalization and recommendations and discovery. Well,
what is that, that's investment in artiﬁcial intelligence and machine-learning, right?
We build these classiﬁers that allow us to rank videos in your home feed, in our
search results. So we have been investing in artiﬁcial intelligence in terms of a
delightful user experience, but also in terms of living up to our responsibility. A lot of
the work that we do to detect (inaudible) videos, et cetera, is based on our
investment in artiﬁcial intelligence and machine-learning. So we've been doing that
for years and we intend to continue to do that. There's obviously been lots of
conversation around Generative AI and capabilities there. I do think that if you think
about our creator ecosystem, there is real opportunities there for us, for our
advertisers, there is opportunities as well. And so sort of to take each of those in turn
and I talked about some of this in my -- in my Brandcast remarks last night.
You can imagine a whole set of creator tools. So when you open up the app, and you
hit that plus button at the bottom of the app and you are ready to create a short or
another form of video from your mobile phone, well, you should be able to do
things like, change your hair color, change your outﬁt, maybe change the
background, maybe you're in a forest, maybe you're in a desert. And so a lot of that
will be powered by things like Generative AI. So you can imagine that those types of
use cases, sort of enhancing the creativity, making the workﬂow more eﬃcient to
really just superpower our creators and so that's one area that I am very excited
about. The other one, of course, is having those same sort of AI investments really
pay oﬀ for our advertisers. So, obviously, things like targeting in optimization,
measurement just based on our investments in AI over the last several years, but also
we talked a lot about multi-format and advertisers wanting to be across all of these
formats, well, AI will be able to transform your creative from a horizontal creative
that's suitable for VOD videos to one that's vertically oriented, for short-form videos,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-05-18

seamlessly and eﬃciently for advertisers to maximize their ROI. And so creator side,
advertiser side, there'll be newer features as well that will be powered by AI that I'm
very excited about.
