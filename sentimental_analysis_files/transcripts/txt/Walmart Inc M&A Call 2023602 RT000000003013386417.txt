Welcome, everyone, to our 2023 associates and shareholders celebration and to our
executive Q&A panel. Thank you for joining us in Razorback Stadium. We are
webcasting this, so I'm going to read our safe harbor, as a matter of procedure.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 2 of 23A - Doug McMillonToday's webcast is being broadcast and recorded, and during this session,
management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially from these
statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors
identiﬁed in our ﬁlings with the SEC. Please review our press release and
accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement, regarding forward-
looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP
reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com.
Thank you for your interest in Walmart, and thank you to our executive team for
joining us today. Doug, I'm going to turn it over to you, and we're going to start with
our positioning statement as well.
I'd just brieﬂy say thank you for being here, thanks for coming this week, thanks for
staying. I hope you enjoyed this morning session, if you're able to attend that, and
you enjoyed the store visit, and hopefully, you got to see the MFC as well, and you'll
ask us some questions about that.
We feel pretty good about our position. We feel like we're positioned to grow. We've
got opportunities with our stores to improve. We've got opportunities with pickup.
We've got opportunities with delivery that's around the world. So when I think about
growth, we certainly think about inﬂation and pricing and what's going on with
customers, but kind of to a degree regardless of the circumstance, we feel like we're
well positioned, because we oﬀer a good value to customers and members, and we
can serve them how they want to be served. And that's only increasing as it relates to
our capabilities.
Secondly, we still, as we mentioned in our investor conference, are excited about our
opportunity to grow proﬁtability greater than sales through a combination of
productivity improvements and business mix.
And then lastly, return on investment, we expect to go up over time as we improve
that proﬁtability and also continue to be disciplined with capital. We have that in our
plan. We are excited about these capital investments that are in front of us. And as
we get data, we'll make real-time decisions based on our ability to execute as it
relates to the pacing of that. But we're every bit as committed as we were when we
had you in Florida a few months ago as it relates to the automation opportunities in
front of us, including the one that you saw an example of this week.
With that, I'll open it up for questions.
Questions And Answers

(Question And Answer)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

It's Michael Lasser from UBS. And, Doug, I don't think anyone in this room has ever
seen a CEO run as fast as you did on stage, so it's great to see your many talents.
The question I have is, for those of us who've watched Walmart for a long time,
generating growth in top line and proﬁts has proven to be challenging, as there's
been a lot of investment cycles. Why is now the time when Walmart can pivot to
generating both growth in sales and proﬁt in excess of sales, especially at a time
where we're seeing all these pressures across retail and a lot of the strategies that
are intended to drive this outcome are arguably going to be replicated by others?
Thank you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
When you think about the four big areas of investment, and John David highlighted
them when we were in Florida, and he and others can add to my comments here,
let's break them apart. As you may remember, I'm sure you do, we made signiﬁcant
price investments over a period of years, and what we're saying about that is we like
the range that we're in, and we monitor competitive gaps, but we like the range that
we're in. As it relates to wages, kind of a similar answer. We made a lot of
investments, and we feel like we've gotten ourselves into a good range. There'll
continue to be increases in wages, and that's factored into our plan, but not as
dramatic as what we might have seen in previous years.
The third area is e-commerce, and we had a lot of investments to make to scale a
business, and the pandemic created some behaviors that created an acceleration of
what we expected to happen. And as those things happen faster than expected, that
puts us in a diﬀerent position as it relates to e-commerce and omni-channel.
And then the fourth one was technology, and Suresh and the team have done a
fantastic job, of making a lot of improvements happen top to bottom, as it relates to
our tech stack and capabilities. And so we're more in a run rate state as it as it relates
to that.
So those were the four big areas, and we just ﬁnd ourselves in a diﬀerent position
right now as it relates to those.
And as we talked about in Florida and maybe on the earnings call, those were
income statement investments. And this pivot that's happening is towards more of a
CapEx and balance sheet set of investments that have attractive returns. So, we think
we're in a diﬀerent phase. The external environment is the external environment, and
it'll continue to be ﬂuid. But as I mentioned a minute ago, we think we're well
positioned to deal with that as things play out.
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
I would add too, Michael, that, if you think about these areas where our initiatives
are, where we're growing, setting supply chain aside for a second, they're largely
digital, right? And if you think about a startup or a company that is trying to launchFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 23Q - Scott Mushkin
A - Doug McMillon
A - John David Rainey
A - Doug McMillon
A - John Furnersome digital eﬀort, one of your challenges is scaling that. And if you think about our
set of assets, we actually have that. Like this is an advantage that we have. And so as
we layer on these initiatives, these digital initiatives, we've got this backdrop of our
reach around the country and around the world, frankly. And so I think that's why we
feel we're at this inﬂection point, where we can begin to see the bottom line, begin
to outpace the top line.
{BIO 7138867 <GO>}
Perfect, because it goes right after what Mike was talking about. Scott Mushkin, R5
Capital. So to dovetail oﬀ of that, I mean, both of us have covered Walmart a real
long time at this stage. But I think a fear that we have is the plan you guys have put
forward, particularly in the U.S. but also internationally, is incredibly strong. We're
seeing things in the apparel business that I don't think anyone would have ever
dreamed of ﬁve years ago.
So if the economy really turns down in the back half of the year into next year, how
committed are you to kind of, hey, this is the right direction, we're going to make
these investments because the long-term ROIC is there versus some real potentially
signiﬁcant pressures macro?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Let's take automation ﬁrst, and then you guys comment on any of the components
that you want. The pieces of automation, speciﬁcally these automated storage and
retrieval systems that David Guggina and Chris Nicholas and Prathibha -- is Prathibha
here? I was just going to recognize her for her award this morning.
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
You might call her by her other name.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We are very conﬁdent in those, and we need to ﬁnish them oﬀ, and they've started.
And you want to ﬁnish them oﬀ because the beneﬁts that ﬂow through from the
complete system are greater than the individual parts. So a high level of
commitment as it relates to that. Do you want to talk about apparel a little bit?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Sure. I'd love to talk about that and just merchandising in general. As you've seen,
Scott, we're really happy with the new brands and the assortment, the way the team's
managing it. So, I think that's exciting, and they're great new lines and home as well.
The e-commerce team, just a few months back, Tom relaunched the website with a
much more, I would describe as attractive merchandise-ﬁrst, customer-ﬁrst view, as
people in, and we're happy with the results there.
But I think the other thing that is important is, this is a team, back here to our left, that
are really well qualiﬁed to manage just about any environment based on what they
can control, and our inventory is positioned well. We like the value, as Doug said,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 23A - Judith McKenna
A - Doug McMillon
Q - Karen Short
A - John Furnerthat we have in front of customers. And then the initiatives we've been sharing
between automation and technology that's in the supply chain, handheld devices
with associates. I feel like we're really making a lot of progress in making jobs more
eﬀective, more eﬃcient, and getting people what they need to be able to do,
complete the tasks they're working on where they are. So we're meeting our
associates in front of customers in a good way.
So I'm excited about it. I love it. We had some merchandise featured this morning in
the meeting, and it's just the ﬁrst thing we think about we wake up every day is top
line and merchandising.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it's -- I would echo that. Each individual market is thinking that way. In
addition, for us, the reshaping of the portfolio has really helped us. So we've got a
much more focused portfolio with a broader diversity of markets, all at diﬀerent
stages and impacted in diﬀerent ways. So in some ways, that gives us a natural
hedge across the international group as well. And because we're more focused,
we've been able to make the investments where it matters. And for us, one of the big
growth areas is e-commerce, but we're actually seeing that becoming improving
from a proﬁtability perspective as well. So it's both the portfolio and the businesses
that we're in are helping us in that respect.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Maybe lastly, remodels. We like what we see, as it relates to the customer response
to the remodels, not just apparel, but the broader set of changes, and we'll continue
those. The stores need to be remodeled. We've got an aggressive plan as it relates
to the count, store count, and I expect we'll see that through.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks for today. By the way, that was quite spectacular. Not like any annual or
shareholder meeting I've been to. And it's Karen Short from Credit Suisse. I wanted
to just ask a couple questions on vendors. So obviously it has come up in terms of
vendors seeing weak volumes, but that happens to also coincide with your very, very
strong growth in private label. So I kind of want to ﬁnd out, like, what is the tipping
point in terms of when the vendors have to realize that they can't pass on inﬂation,
just given how much more ammunition you have in private label?
And then I had a second question. During the tour, I guess there was a comment that
you had doubled the rollbacks in food speciﬁcally. So I'm wondering where you kind
of stand on rollbacks and philosophy on food speciﬁcally.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Let me start by saying, we'll just go back to value. We're happy, pleased with the
value that we're managing for customers, and we start there every week. We start
with NPS scores, customer satisfaction scores, what we're seeing in pricing, and
customers have been switching. We've been probably talking about that two to
three quarters now that we've seen a shift to private brand. Our strategy is to oﬀer aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 23A - Doug McMillon
Q - Simeon Gutman
A - John Furnerwide assortment to customers, and we don't have any metrics or goals or saying
we're trying to get private brand to a certain point. We have an assortment that we're
proud of that oﬀers value.
Inﬂation has been really stubborn, particularly in dry grocery. And that is the place
where we have seen the most switching to private brand over the last two or three
quarters. And that continues as we sit here today. Rollbacks are a great way for us to
be able to work with suppliers. Sometimes they're large suppliers, sometimes they're
medium suppliers, but situations where we can increase value for customers, tell
them what the value is and we're seeing a lot of response to that, and you'll continue
to see that on our homepage and in our pickup and delivery business that primarily
comes out of stores but across e-commerce.
So there's still a lot of inﬂation that we think is extremely stubborn, and customers
need value, so our team is going to continue to work on doing everything we can to
create eﬃciency. Supply chain has been a tailwind in terms of mix. Groceries been a
higher percentage of our volume, which has some mixed implications, although
switching with private brands also has its own set of implications on mix.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
It's encouraging that general merchandise pricing has been coming down, and there
may be an opportunity there for us to show a value, and we'll use rollbacks as a tactic
most of the time to drive more demand than we might be thinking we could drive in
the third and fourth quarter of this year. So I expect the whole store not just the food
area to have a strong representation of rollbacks.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Hi. Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. Short-term and then a little long-term. The
short-term is if we can talk about the tempo of the consumer. I know we spoke only
three weeks ago, but it seems like it's rapidly changing or evolving. Disinﬂation, the
speed of which it looks like it surprised retailers in the ﬁrst quarter, if the last three
weeks, if you can give a gauge?
And then the second question or the follow-up is proﬁt growth faster than sales
growth. There were some parameters on longer term on timing, a couple of years.
Curious, what is acceptable in terms of when we see that spread really widen out,
whether it's this year or we start in '24 and beyond? Thanks.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Sure, I'll start, Simeon, with consumer. No real update since the last time we spoke.
We know customers, they want value. That's clear. They're celebrating seasons and
holidays. We were pleased with the performance of the site with categories like ﬂoral
for Mother's Day, but they're still shifting exactly like we talked about in Q1 and Q4 of
last year. So that continues. Inﬂation is starting to lap, so you'll see the absolute
numbers this year, and inﬂation look like as though they're lower, but when you look
back at a two-year stack, dry grocery for example is in the 20s, and it remains high
and isn't really coming back that quickly. And that's led to the actions of the teamFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 23A - John David Rainey
Q - Bobby Griﬃn
A - Doug McMillonhave taken to try to get prices down where we can. And where we see value of
rollbacks that are great versus where we've been or versus the market, we see the
consumers moving right away.
I think the last thing I would add that I haven't said, and maybe you can take the
second part of the question, and we have talked about, is the ﬂexibility that the team
Walmart is oﬀering consumers is seeming to land really well. And there have been a
lot of expansions with the number of slots available for pickup, the app integration
that we did about a year a half ago is really coming to life. That feels much better.
And so regardless of the economy environment we're in, I think we are much better
positioned, we're really well positioned to be able to deliver customers ﬂexibly the
way they want to be served at the time they want to be served. And I think that's
helping us as well.
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
On the second part of your question in terms of the timing of proﬁt growth,
outpacing sales, our guidance this year implies that it's happening this year. I know
we're one quarter into the year, but it happens on a marginal basis this year. The ﬁrst
quarter, we doubled our sales growth in terms of proﬁt growth, and that was better
than what any of us had anticipated when we set our plan as well as when we set our
guidance for the ﬁrst quarter. So we're pleased with that. I think the ﬁrst quarter
came in pretty strong. We should be able to continue to maintain sort of what we've
talked about in our guidance. This next year we see a bigger inﬂection, and again,
when we talked about this at ICM, at our Investor Day. We framed this in a range of
opportunities, right? A lot of this depends upon how quickly we're able to invest in
some of the supply chain automation, a lot of other things, and all of this assumes a
macro environment, which your guess is as good as mine.
And so, but we think that we are positioned when you look at the structure of our
P&L going forward and where we're growing that we should be able to outpace
sales growth, and we hope by a sizable amount over the next several years, but it
begins to inﬂect more next year.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
Bobby Griﬃn from Raymond James. Thank you guys for the event and the time. It
was a lot of fun, pretty star-studded as well. So thank you. Doug, you mentioned, ﬁrst
question, kind of mentioned you're happy with the early signs from the remodels. I
believe in one of the videos there in Teterboro, they either mentioned a 20%
compost remodel or 20% grow. So maybe, can we talk a little bit about bit about
that, and clarify that for us.
And the second question's for Judith. Some pretty big goals to go from a $100
billion to $200 billion in revenue in ﬁve years. So maybe just can you unpack that for
us, some of the key drivers you see in getting to that target?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Judith, why don't you go ﬁrst?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 23A - Judith McKenna
A - John Furner
A - Doug McMillon
A - John Furner{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah, so, it is a pretty ambitious target that we put out there. And the markets that we
have today, have plans to be able to get there. Three main areas of focus for us. The
ﬁrst is scaled and leading omni-channel businesses around the world. It's a natural
advantage that we have from a leverage perspective in the businesses that we have.
The second is scaling our global marketplaces. We're right in the middle of
developing, with Suresh's team's help, a global platform. We already have
marketplaces in Mexico and Canada, as well as the U.S., of course. And we have our
Flipkart business as well, which is a really signiﬁcant marketplace. So that gives us
our second engine of growth. And then the third area is the ecosystems that we're
building around the diﬀerent businesses. Mexico is probably one of the best
examples of this because in addition to having payments we're also into telecoms,
and we've just recently launched into health as well.
So three very clear areas where we can see growth coming for the future. But as I say
the real trick of all of those is very few of those are we doing on our own. The real
secret of this is the Powered by Walmart piece which gives us the conﬁdence that the
technology is there, the knowledge there, and the capabilities are there to be able to
deliver against it. From a market perspective, a couple of our markets really help that
engine, Mexico being one of those. I think many of what a scaled business that is
already. But also Flipkart, as it develops further, will be another one of those key
drivers of growth. But every single one of the markets contributes to it.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And on the remodels, we're really pleased with the product that you see in
Teterboro. That prototype is iterated over about a year, year and a half in Elm
Springs, which you got to go to yesterday. It's a combination of a lot of exciting
things. New merchandising, the layout of the store has some improvements. The
sight lines are better. The signing is more clear. What's not in the Teterboro store, but
you saw yesterday, our digital shelf tags, which also help associates and will
eventually help customers be able to ﬁnd items and price more eﬀectively and
quickly.
The manager there, I wanted to highlight her. Her story is amazing, fantastic. I met
her a couple times over the last year or so. Her inspiration was, I think, came through
the video, which we wanted you to know the type of people that we have all over the
country. And the number is the growth rate in her store that is this year over last year.
Of course, stores vary as these come out, depending on the market and where they
are, but that was the number that reﬂects the growth in Teterboro.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Did you approve the video beforehand? Were you aware that she was going to share
the number?

{BIO 15034883 <GO>}
Good afternoon, Brad Thomas with KeyBanc. Thank you again for having us. I want to
ask a follow-up on automation. Clearly very exciting things happening there. Can you
talk a little bit more about some of the gating factors to rolling it out and potentially
the ability in the years ahead to accelerate and pull forward some of that rollout?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah, it's really exciting, great progress. We've been working with some of these
providers for years to get this point. Dave Guggina in the back. Dave, why don't you
grab a mic and just talk about the plan from here?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Dave, introduce yourself again if you would.
Dave Guggina. I lead Walmart U.S. supply chain. Don't want to get too close to the
mic. So -- Absolutely. Some of these technologies, as you know, we've been working
on for years. We start with proof of technology, we move to proof of concept, then
we pilot our technology, and then we scale the tech. Many of you were in Brooksville
recently. That's a technology that we've communicated, that we're scaling across the
entirety of our ambient network. So all 42 of our regional distribution centers will
have that technology. And it allows us to take a 1.2 million square foot facility and
shrink it down to 800,000 square feet and double the throughput of the facility
itself. And it's incredible, how it reshapes work for our associates as well.
It takes some of the most physically demanding jobs that we have in our supply
chain and allows our associates to use their creativity, their empathy for one another,
and their problem solving skills, as cell operators. So we couldn't be more excited to
continue to roll it out.
{BIO 22286943 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks. Michael Baker from D.A. Davidson. I'm wondering, is a recession good for
you guys? I think we've always thought of maybe you outperform and in
comparatively you're better in recession, but your business this year seems stronger
than normal while seems like the economy is slowing. So is there something diﬀerent
now that's making you pick up even more share now than in the past? And I guess
the second part of that question is, how do you hold on to that success if and when
the economy hopefully eventually gets better?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
None of us are cheering for a recession in any country where we operate. We want
our customers, families, members to have more money, not less money, and have
growth. That's what we want. We'd rather have that environment to operate in thanFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

A - John Furnerthe other. But value does matter in an environment where people are more price-
conscious, so we certainly care a lot about that.
Anything else to add?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Well, I would just to build on that, Doug. One of the things that we talked about at
ICM was this concept of liking our position. And to unpack that a little bit, like we, to
your point, Mike, like we're known as a company that when times get tough and
customers look for value we're going to gain share. But we also think that we're
positioned to succeed if things get better. And so we like our position almost
irrespective of what happens in the economy.
It doesn't mean that we're immune to some of the economic whims of the economy
and what can happen to us, but we like our position better than anyone else's. We
would take our hand and play it versus anything else.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Having an opportunity to serve all kinds of people, which is maybe even more true
right now, does give us the opportunity to potentially hold on to them. And I think
pickup, delivery, Walmart+, the store environment, get a bunch of these remodels
done and let them see those changes, all of those things give us a better chance of
having them come back in a year, two years, and three years than maybe they would
have in the past.
{BIO 16685675 <GO>}
Thank you. Kelly Bania, BMO Capital, and thanks also for letting us in on this
incredible event. So two questions. One is shrink. You've got solid competitors left
and right getting hit pretty hard with shrink. Maybe you can just help us understand
what is Walmart doing diﬀerent or what maybe you've done diﬀerent in past years to
set yourself up just to reassure investors that you're not going to have a shrink
moment and that it's under control at Walmart.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Well, ﬁrst, shrink is part of the overall mix we think about in terms of merchandising,
and mix has been aﬀected by a number of things. First, I would like to give credit to
the supply chain team because the improvements in supply chain this year versus
last year, given the inventory increases we had a year ago, has really helped us. Now,
those increases have been oﬀset partially by the change in merchandise mix, more
food, less general merchandise, percentages of total. A third, there is some shrink in
there that's up a bit this year. It was up a bit last year. It's not all over the country.
There are markets where we see it more than other places. And then there's another
positive beneﬁt of mix that's coming from the new businesses we've been building,
like our data business and advertising business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 23Q - Kelly Bania
A - John Furner
A - Judith McKennaSo I think it's important just to think about, like previous questions, there is a
portfolio of businesses with inside the U.S. business that we can use to be able to
manage value for customers really well. One big aid this year is inventory is down.
Any time inventory goes up, the chances of shrinkage tend to go up with it. Last year
was obviously an acute event when the supply chain is backed up in Q4 of '21 and
then Q1 of '22. So having that behind us has gotten us into a much better position.
I get into stores almost every week, not every week. Sometimes I can't get out. I wish
I could get out every week. It's great to see what our teams are doing, but I'm seeing
much better inventory control inbound and back rooms and distribution centers and
what is on the top shelf. So I think the overall process, what the team's doing to
manage the inventory well to know what we have and where it is and keep control of
it is, is a good thing to have, in terms of positioning for the long term.
{BIO 16685675 <GO>}
Okay. Another question on e-commerce. So, if I look back over the years, the
discussion on e-commerce was always, we've got to get to the right mix, right? And
whether it was general merchandise or 3P versus 1P, and you gave some interesting
stats, I think, a couple weeks ago on the number of SKUs you have on 3P. But can you
just give us any sort of KPIs on where you are in that journey of getting e-commerce
mix to where you would like it to be?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
It's a huge opportunity for us. The market continues to change, as you know. The last
quarter, Tom and the team should be proud of the results that they delivered. A lot of
strength at 27% growth. A signiﬁcant portion was driven from pickup and delivery
from stores. But there are other businesses that are growing digitally, like the
pharmacy, delivery to home. There's a nice growth, momentum I'd say is, a better
way to describe it with marketplace. We talked about 400 million items at the end of
the quarter and we're, there thereabouts. So we continue to ﬁnd quality sellers, who
are able to deliver broader assortments for customers. Customers have a lot of
choices, and we want to be there whenever they want to make those choices.
The other thing I would add is we've seen nice uptick with the sellers who are using
services like fulﬁllment services. The best part of that is we can give the customer a
shorter guarantee in terms of the time it takes to deliver when the inventory is in one
of the Walmart facilities and then that leads to better connection with Walmart
Connect to cohorts of customers that are relevant.
So all these things really work together. But if you really dial back to what's in the
middle of it, it's understanding what customers want, when they want it, and I just
feel like the opportunity to continue to serve customers better is right in front of us,
and we can keep improving.

Page 12 of 23A - Kathryn McLay
A - Doug McMillonhuge driver that enables us to really start to shift what the mix looks like within that as
well. We're still standing up stores from an omni-perspective as well. And one of the
things for us is if we can get much as the same as John and the team have done is
the entire store already on to line so that people can shop the GM and apparel side
of it as well as the food side, that's a big win for us, both in our sort of super center
formats but also in our Bodega formats right across Mexico. So that is part of the way
that we're thinking about it.
In a similar way, things like Walmart fulﬁllment services, the work that we're doing on
having a single seller experience. So if you're a seller and you want a list on Walmart,
you'll be able to ultimately choose which markets you want to be able to sell to.
That's a big deal and a big unlock, especially for us in international because many of
the great sellers that the U.S. have got, it means that we can switch them on from a
global perspective as well.
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
I think when we think about it too, we're thinking more eaches versus baskets. So it's
much healthier for us to sell a basket through a digitally enabled sale. So curbside
and delivery to home encourage baskets, and that's obviously a lot better economics
for us. So we are seeing our growth coming through curbside and delivery from the
club, which frees up the FCs to be a little bit more bit more selective about what we
ship out of those.
The other side of it we think about too is then, how many of those transactions, how
many of our transactions start with a digital engagement. So Scan & Go, we talked
about one in four or 25% of our transactions in the club start with or on Scan & Go
and then about 11% to 12% of our sales, like ship to home e-commerce. And so when
you kind of put that together, you have this really great platform to be able to
engage with our members diﬀerently, because the transactions happening on their
phone versus them walking oﬄine through the club.
And so just playing, as we're getting more of the transactions being done on a
person's phone or device, you have a very diﬀerent way of being able to engage.
And if you add the Scan & Go, as well as the e-commerce traditional type of baskets
or shopping occasions, you're getting a lot more of our transactions are happening
in that way, which gives us a much diﬀerent way of being able to engage with them
now than we have in the past.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I'd like to call out how our people have changed and grown. We were store experts,
and we recruited e-commerce expertise and technology expertise in a variety of
ways, including acquisition. And if you fast-forward to today and you hear how
people think and what they know, including the people that are here in our broader
group of merchants and operators, they are omni now. There's a digital language,
there's a diﬀerent mindset as it relates to how we build technology. It is truly omni.
And you're seeing that pay oﬀ in the way we think about 1P, 3P, pickup, delivery.
There's like real-time problem solving.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

well. And when you hear folks talk about the progress that we're making, we were
growing top line, the pandemic accelerated some things, and while all that was
happening, people were unpacking all these diﬀerent choices about app design,
how you get a product to a person, what's the trade-oﬀ between speed and getting
two orders, if one came from a store and it was fast and another one came from the
FC, what's the customer think about that? All those trade-oﬀs as you make them on
behalf of the customer member ﬁrst but then optimize to improve proﬁtability
underneath that as best you can given our assets, you get a diﬀerent and better
outcome.
So it's just so encouraging to me to know how much progress our leadership team
has made. We don't get any questions anymore about do you have or need e-
commerce expertise because it's now just become omni expertise across the Board.
{BIO 22151706 <GO>}
Rupesh Parikh, Oppenheimer. Thanks for taking my question. So just on health and
wellness, going back to your last report, tremendous momentum in that segment,
and we've been getting many questions there. How do you think about the
sustainability of that momentum? And if you look at what Walmart is doing, is there
anything that you got doing speciﬁcally that's driving even stronger momentum than
others?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes, let me take that. You know, ﬁrst, a few things. There has been consistent
momentum the last three or four years. We've opened a few more clinics. There was
some acceleration during the pandemic with vaccines, which helped us with a
number of capabilities that has led to other businesses in terms of like
immunizations and other services we could oﬀer, including some states or more
services. You can now do some acceleration, obviously, with GLP-1 drugs, and those
are drugs used to treat diabetes.
There's been quite a bit of uptake there. As far as the same momentum, we don't
know yet. It's growing at this point, but bit of a detriment in terms of mix because it's
a lower-margin class of drugs. But overall, the team has, I think, done a great job
engaging patients, new patients. And then the pharmacist is a person that most
customers, they'll see their pharmacist more than any other healthcare professional
in their lives. And Brian and Kevin Host and the team who run the pharmacy have
done a really nice job with NPS scores. They're amongst the highest we've ever seen.
So the personal contact, I think, is really helpful for a business that sells food and
sells apparel over the counter and the entire assortment that we sell.

Thanks, guys. It's Scott Mushkin again from R5. So just to follow up on a couple
things. General merchandise categories, obviously, a lot of emphasis on apparel, but

opportunities. And I was wondering if you want to scale those and where you think
those are. The second thing we can all or at least I can see the, probably a lot ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

advantage it is. What are your other big opportunities and kind of scale those for us
as we run through that? And then ﬁnally, ﬂagships like Springdale, how many can
you have?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Sure. Let me take the ﬁrst two and then Latriece Watkins is going to walk up and talk
about merchandising here in just a second. We're committed to the remodel
program. We are committed to the changes, Scott, that we've made with the ﬂagship
stores that you saw. Some stores will get elements of that depending on
conﬁguration, size, shape, but we like what we've done in apparel. We like the
layouts. We like the signing package. We like the navigation. We really like the areas
that we've invested in for customers and associates like breakrooms and restrooms. I
think those are all great, so those will continue to move forward.
The common thread that is really important with automation is the data and the
software. The automation itself, the installations and the 42 centers, that's just the
ambient network. We have another set of technologies we'd love to show you at
some point that are on our perishable networks, similar to what I showed this
morning. You got to see the MFC this week, but really what ties it together and
makes it all eﬃcient are the people that are leading and the tech that's powering it.
And we talked about that being people-led and tech-powered, that's a really
important layer.
So, the team has done a nice job with control systems and data layers, and I think
that progress will just continue, and we'll see more and more productivity come out
of all the investments as time goes on.
And as far as general merchandise, Latriece Watkins has been our chief merchant
now for a few weeks, so, Latriece, we'd love for you to give us your early thoughts.
{BIO 18795654 <GO>}
Good afternoon. I think what you've heard us say is general merchandise is
important to the mix of the basket for our portfolio, for everything that we've said we
wanted to deliver. And we know it's important to our customers. In discretionary
categories, we've obviously seen more pressure there than we have on the food and
consumables side at the core. But what we also know is we are famous for things like
seasons, and you can see, as we bring things to life in store, during key seasons,
general merchandise is an important part of those seasons.
I think the second thing that's important about general, excuse me, about general
merchandise is it is core to how we think about driving the business forward. You
would have seen, yes, apparel, but also home and the investments we've made in
home and bringing that to life in our new stores.
I think in total, we want to be a place that provides value to our customers across all

{BIO 16447261 <GO>}
Hi. Good afternoon. Aravane Rezai with Guggenheim. I wanted to ask about
advertising and maybe your aspirations of becoming a top 10 in the U.S. and maybe
what are you seeing with recessionary concerns? Like is there like a big point, sellers
pulling back on investments? And the second question I have about Flipkart. Can
you talk more about the market share? I know that the growth in India is projected at
a very high rate. And are you holding the market share? Like what's happening
there? Or anything additional on Flipkart would be super helpful. Thank you.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
I'll start with Flipkart. So it continues to be the market-leading and e-commerce
platform across India. And since we made the acquisition, they have continued to
meet our expectations every step of the way. What I'm really interested and excited
about is the way they're developing their merchandise capabilities, starting when
they were originally founded they started as a mobile phone. Business they
expanded that they're actually books, then they went into mobile phones, and then
they expanded that out. And today, they have real strength, not only across like your
core GM categories that they originally famous for, but they very much like Latriece
was talking about are building out a home business, which is very much in tune with
the Indian consumer, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities as they come online to
shop for the ﬁrst time, but equally have a very strong apparel business as well in
addition to the new business areas that they're building out.
Where we're now seeing some inﬂection point for them, is their contribution margin
positive. You've heard me say that previously, and they continue to improve on that
position. So I'm really excited about the business because not only are the strength
of engineering talent we have there and the infrastructure with the eKart distribution
platform that they have right across India but also the market opportunity continues
to look really impressive to us as well.
We recently made the move to split Flipkart and PhonePe into two separate
businesses. There's a number of reasons for doing that, not only does it help us set
up for long-term for a path to IPO for each of them but it also redomiciles our
Flipkart business into India as well, it's a heavily ﬁnancially regulated business. You
may be aware that we just did a fundraise on that business, which has got a $12
billion valuation. So in India, we've got these two great businesses. We've got the
Flipkart e-commerce platform, which is expanding and then we've got a payments
business as well, which is equally really thinking about how it now changes from
being a pure payments platform into insurance and into other areas beyond that. SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

weeks ago. We're doing a lot more things in India as well such as sourcing from
there. You heard me talk about some of the development we're doing as well. It
continues to be a very positive story for us.
Then Seth Dallaire, our Chief Revenue Oﬃcer, Seth you want to answer the question
advertising?
{BIO 18936201 <GO>}
Sure. In terms of demand, we're actually seeing demand quite strong on a couple
diﬀerent fronts and for a couple diﬀerent reasons. So 1P brands, as we see more
consumers mix into some of the private label products, they step in and want to
defend their category share and are oftentimes spending in that respect in
advertising. And the technology investments that we've been making and
improvements in the retail media products and ways that we allow brands to speak
to customers while they're shopping, they're not as has developed yet. And when we
ﬂipped our auction to a second price auction, from a ﬁrst price auction, essentially
things reset at a lower price. So now, if we have more advertisers coming in, there's
actually quite a bit of value for advertisers in our sponsor products listings, which is
where they can really performantly speak with customers and drive sales.
On the three-piece side of the business as well, on the marketplace, which we talked
about earlier, as we load more assortment into the e-com site and into the
marketplace, and more sellers participate with us, they want to bring their brands in
front of customers, as they're building baskets, particularly if they're new brands or
brands that Walmart customers haven't seen before, which is also bringing in quite a
bit of demand on the advertising side.
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Can I just -- go ahead, Kath.
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
I was going to say from a Sam's perspective. We've seen double-digit growth in our
Ads business, and we call it MAP. I think two things that are worth calling out, one, as
we stitch together online and oﬄine transactions, advertisers are able to see if they
present a digital ad to a member. If they put it into their basket online, that's what
they've traditionally seen, but then now they can see the next time that person shops
in club, did they also purchase it? That's giving a much more attractive return on
advertising spend to our suppliers. So, that's helping fuel the growth.
I think the other part is, as we build out kind of cohorts in our membership, we can
be very targeted around personalizing those oﬀers. So instead of a digital ad going
to everyone, it's very speciﬁc in who it goes to. And I'd say, we're just in the
beginning of that journey. So there's still a lot of upside in that area for us leaning
into the future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Q - Karen Short{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
I was going to build on that. Advertising dollars tend to follow where the eyeballs are
going. And if you look at our digital business, our e-commerce business, that was up
26% or 27% in the ﬁrst quarter. You contrast that to others that are actually seeing
declines there. So to build on Seth's point, we're seeing strength in advertising
because that's we're gaining share in a lot of these areas.
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
I'd just add from a global perspective, it's the same piece where we've got the
strongest digital oﬀerings. We're seeing really strong growth coming through from
advertising as well. And in fact, we're just about to put some of the Flipkart
advertising platforms into some of our other markets as well, to enable that growth
as our global platform continues to get built out.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Michael Lasser from UBS. One of the outcomes of this very cogent plan that you're in
the process of executing could be that you're going to put a lot of pressure on the
others in retail. And we've seen as others in retail experience their own pressures
and challenges, they tend to invest in price. We saw that with Dollar General, we saw
that with Family Dollar, we saw it with Target. So how do you think about the
possibility that you are so successful that it puts pressure on others, they invest in
price, and you have to use some of this outsize proﬁtability improvement to reinvest
back in price, and it stiﬂes the plans that you have?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. The investments in productivity, automation to drive productivity, and the
business mix changes, give us ﬂexibility. That's the way that we think about it. So we
just want to keep serving customers and members, keep the top-line going, be good
merchants in general merchandise, discretionary categories, manage that gross
margin mix, and then we'll see how things play out, and we'll react as we need to
react. We're going to be a price leader. We're based on value, but our newer
business model gives us even more ﬂexibility to make those kinds of choices if we
need to.

and two, the Remodels. So I guess the ﬁrst question is obviously the MFC is still very

outstanding, but could you accelerate annual remodel, I guess cadence?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

I'll take this in order. Excited about the MFC that you saw this week. It's the second
location with that type of technology. We acquired the company that produced it
and created it. So we've spent the last, Chris, six months or so working through
software, data, eﬃciency, and I think over time we'll continue to optimize it. While
there are many things we love about the site you saw, some of the areas need to be
bigger, some need to be smaller. So we've learned a lot from that ﬁrst unit and over
the next year, next few dozen that we'll probably do in the next year or so, we'll make
some improvements that'll make it even better for associates and for customers.
Ultimately though, it does have a signiﬁcant impact on the capacity and accuracy of
what can be picked at a store.
What we said back at the ICM, when we met a couple months ago is we're trying to
make sure that we have the most eﬃcient last mile that we can, and a shorter last
mile is a much better experience for the customer and for the cost of the business
than a long last mile. So having stores in 4,000 plus locations, 4,700 locations
enables us to consolidate really late, shorten the last mile, and what the MFCs are
doing is showing us we could have a lot more productivity and a lot more accuracy.
Early days, as we said in the ﬂagship stores, really pleased with the look, the
merchandising, the aisles, the items, as it all comes together, we're really pleased
with that. We'll do more remodels this year than we've done in the last couple of
years. We're on track to having a good year, probably around 700 remodels in total,
a signiﬁcant number of those. We're still working through how many will be, like the
ﬂagship, but probably close to 40% to 50% of those this year. We'll have that look
and feel. (inaudible). Chris.
I want to ask about AI. Curious, I know there's some application across the company.
Curious, the path over the next call it ﬁve or even 10 years, is saving money on the
cost side, being more productive, and then if there's any applications that are
already in your forecast, how AI is changing the business?

Favorite question of the time, right? So, a few things. The recent advances in
generative AI, it's very signiﬁcant, but it's only the latest of a long series of
advancements that have happened when you look at the general ﬁeld of machine
learning and artiﬁcial intelligence. And we have been using ML and AI through order
systems for a very long time. When you place an order online, and if we want to do a
smart substitution for you because, in your order, the recommendation actually
comes from ML. We use natural language in a lot of our internal applications, as well
as with customer-facing applications as well. A large fraction of the customerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

A - Doug McMilloncontacts are now automatically answered by our natural language processing
systems. Even internationally, Chile actually is one of the leaders over there.
So AI is deeply integrated into a lot of systems that we do. When we take a look at
the latest, the Generative AI capabilities, we are very excited about that by the way.
You can think of it in sort of two large categories. One is around customer
experience. So we think that these capabilities are going to really accelerate the
customer experience in a very meaningful way. It will help our customers be able to
navigate our selection better. It will be able to help our customers go through their
shopping mission if you would. We have given some examples before of, hey, I'm
looking for a cell phone for my daughter. What is the best cell phone that I want to
ﬁnd? These kinds of shopping journeys, I think generative AI can have a really
positive impact.
The other major area is internally around how our associates work, how we run our
business, how we get insights from data. All of these are areas, where I think as
generative AI becomes more and more mature, we will start seeing the impact of
that. And we have already started a number of initiatives, where we are pulling in the
latest developments that are happening outside, both for our internal tools and to
drive customer experience.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Will we partner with other technology companies to leverage generative AI, or will
we build our own large language models or both?
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Yes, both. There are a lot of foundational breakthroughs that have already happened,
whether it's OpenAI, whether it is on Google Sites or even Open Source, we want to
take advantage of all of the breakthroughs that are happening. But we want to do
that in such a way, where we take that and we make it uniquely Walmart, so that it
works on Walmart data, speaks retail. And so for those kinds of things, we will take
the developments outside and we will make it work within the Walmart environment
in a way that is going to be beneﬁcial for our associates and for our customers in a
unique way.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
So when you think about increasingly intelligent software, others will build it, some
of it will be open source, some of it won't. We'll build our own. And then the
question is, who's got the data? We have data, a lot of it. So we can apply our own
expertise. We have a great tech team these days, and we can partner with others,
where we should to try and put that to work in a way that we haven't before. And we
use data today much more than we have in the past. But what's happened in recent
months? We were on a trajectory before, but the breakthroughs of the recent
months have created new opportunities for us to do some things in terms of
personalization for customers and associates and ﬁnd eﬃciencies in the business
that we couldn't have done before.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

it relates to it? And ours is to be aggressive. There are risks and we are learning
about those risks and thinking about those risks, protecting PII, managing data sets

are other places, where we can be faster and more aggressive. And I'm excited
about the potential that our team has to take full advantage of this. And as we said

it certainly feels very real today.

I think, the exciting thing is a lot of our investments in technology have been focused
on our customer and frankly, the ability to serve our customers. And for the most
part, a lot of our technology was aimed at our very large frontline associate base,
which it should be. But when we think of the early opportunities with GenAI, it
actually will change and shape the ways of working for those that are frankly our
campus oﬃce associates and optimize their performance just like we've been
leaning in to optimize and make our frontline more eﬀective and eﬃcient. So the way
we would like to think about is people led and we can actually make our people
better by augmenting their work through GenAI. I think there's incredible
opportunities across each of the functions to actually leverage.
And from a people space in general, I think there's a disruption because we've long
talked about the need for self-service. Most individuals just want to ﬁnd things on
their own. They don't want to call someone. They want to ﬁnd it. And so in a world of
GenAI, its opening up the opportunity for individuals to self-serve. So we're really
excited. We're partnering with Suresh and his team, he's got a whole council set up.
And I think, you're going to see some pretty exciting things that we can do to
support our campus oﬃce associates, being as eﬀective, just like we're making the

every single quarter, meaning, outgrow sales with our proﬁt. There's going to be
quarters, where that's just not the case for certain reasons. But what we've talked
about, is over a multi-year period, we believe that can happen and we think that
we're set up very well for that to happen. We operate in a very competitive
environment. But given sort of the structural nature of what we're doing, we think
that that's the outcome.

Hi. Michael Baker from D. A. Davidson. Again, with a couple follow-ups. One, sort of
what Scott, just asked, but just more speciﬁcally on the promotional environment, a
lot of retailers missed in the last couple weeks. Are you seeing it any more
promotional now than maybe you thought it would be three months ago?
And then another follow-up, just on the remodels, remind us what the incremental
list you're seeing? And if you're willing to talk about the cost, the return on capital,
any of those things yet, or is it too early to discuss those? And actually, one more
there. You just said 700 stores. Prior, it was like 300. So I assume the 700 is over time,
but did I hear that right? And what's the time for the remodel?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Yes, let me clarify. In the total number of locations, about 700 remodels across the
United States, about half those, slightly less, are going to look like the ﬂagship stores
that you've seen. That's the plan. The ﬁrst stores had to be assembled, constructed
on-site, and what the team does that they're great at is engineer where we can move
things at pace and at scale so that they can happen faster with less cost. So I think
we'll see the cost of those remodels continue to come down, but what we're going
to be really careful to do is make sure that we maintain the same customer
experience in those stores as what you saw yesterday and what you've seen in the
Northeast. So the ﬁxturing is important, the look and feel, the merchandise look and
feel is important. And we know it's more attractive for more suppliers to sell into an
environment that comes together the way that did.
On product, I think I would just reiterate, we're focused on trying to keep prices as
low as possible. You heard the theme all throughout the morning. This stubborn
inﬂation, particularly in dry grocery is something that we want to continue to work
on. I think I said it earlier, but we start every week with customer satisfaction, net
promoter scores, and where we see our pricing, how it mixes out versus the market.
And that's a really important thing for us to always maintain. And this new business
model, if you will, that has a lot more options for customers is important.
I think, the question about is it automation or software? It will always be both
because the consumer environment that we operate in, and the consumers we serve,
they're dynamic. So we can't just automate the same process over and over and over
because customer changes. And the software, looking ahead at things like intent,
measuring demand all across the market, help us determine where the customer is
going and be able to use the more ﬂuid aspects of our supply chain dynamically to
get ahead of where the customers are going.
{BIO 22286943 <GO>}
One more, just to follow-up. You said, so what are the other half of the 700 going to
look like? Half going to look like the ﬂagship, what's the other half?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes, they'll be similar in nature. They'll have a lot of same colors, the same signing
program, clear tile, take the tile oﬀ the ﬂoor, great facilities for associates in the front.
They won't have all the assortment that you would see in the ﬂagship stores. And it's
really a matter of pace on how fast we can bring all these things to life. It's a large
footprint. And for suppliers, and that would include merchandise suppliers and
ﬁxture equipment suppliers, it does take some time to change the program as we
go.
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
And Mike, none of us are assuming that we see 20% lift in sales in perpetuity, just to
be clear, but we do like what we see. And you would expect an uplift when you do a
new remodel like that. And to be clear, we've only done a few, but given theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

experience, it gives us conviction around doing this at scale in our network.

We're going to leave it there for questions. Doug, I'll turn it over to you for closing
remarks.

Thanks again for coming. Hopefully, with the time we've spent together this year,
you're starting to get a sense for how the company has changed and is changing.
Sometimes people call us a big box retailer and I think that's really not the right
deﬁnition at this point, it's inadequate, and even brick-and-mortar is inadequate.
We're a diﬀerent company than we were. We have a diﬀerent set of capabilities. We
can serve people in a diﬀerent way. And the ﬂow through, as it relates to the income
statement and return on investment is diﬀerent as a result. And really excited about
our opportunity. We don't control everything happening in the external environment,
but we're built to adapt and have been adapting and will continue to do that based
on what the short-term circumstances are. The story we've been telling you this year
is about not just this year, but beyond this year. And we've got that kind of long-term
view. So thanks again for coming. Good to see you all.
