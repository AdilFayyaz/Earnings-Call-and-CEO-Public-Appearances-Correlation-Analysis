All right. Well, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Karen Short, and I'm the
staples and hardline retail analyst at Barclays. We're very pleased to once again
welcome Walmart to the Barclays Staples Conference. Obviously, to state the
obvious, with close to $550 billion in global sales, Walmart is the largest global
retailer, at this point, cannot be emphasized enough, but equally important, the list
of successful global brands is very short and clearly Walmart would be at the top of
the list.
With us from Walmart, we're very pleased to welcome Brett Biggs, Walmart's Chief
Financial Oﬃcer. As I think all of you know by now, the format will be ﬁreside with no
Q&A this year. You should see Walmart's Safe Harbor slide on the screen
momentarily. Please refer to this and their latest SEC ﬁlings for forward -- any
forward-looking statements that are made this morning.
On Tiktok, I would just like to point out and remind investors that Walmart is not
elaborating on the topic beyond the public statement the company made on August
27th. So if anyone is listening and thinks that I'm not interested in asking about it,
that's not the case. It's just we have 30 minutes. So we want to get as covered as
possible.
So this is obviously a very unique time for any essential retailer. Again, we thank you
very much for your participation and insights. So as the largest global retailer, you're
obviously in a very unique position to get the pulse of the consumer. So I wanted to
start oﬀ a little bit on whether or not you have any comments to make in general on
the state of the consumer, and then I do want to ask this in the context of top line
and market share in the US because this seems to be the biggest point of
contention, I guess, as it relates to whether you are or are not losing share. And then
I'll jump into some other questions.

Page 2 of 12Karen ShortYeah, you bet. Thanks for having me. Looks a little diﬀerent than last year, obviously,
again, to state the obvious. As we think about the consumer, so much has changed
in the last six months, so many dynamics. It's tough to peel through everything that's
going on. You've had such disruption end of our ﬁrst quarter, start of the second
quarter, but in the same way, you had stimulus, a large stimulus, particularly in the
US. And so understanding -- even in our second quarter results, I mean, some of that
was stimulus; some of that was people spending money on things. They are not
spending as much on vacations, gasoline, things like that, and so they would spend
more in a place like Walmart. So it's tough to peel all those things apart.
The economic numbers over the last few weeks have seemed to look better than
they have over the past. Again, it's hard to know how much of that is stimulus related
and we'll be watching like everybody else what happens in Washington in the next
several weeks around stimulus. But it's been a very interesting ﬁve or six months
certainly from a retail standpoint with certain retailers closed; certain ones like us
open.
When you look at the period of time overall, we feel really good about our business.
We have got a lot of questions about market share. We know we've taken market
share in certain categories, general merchandise, which is very good for us from a
customer perspective as well as from a margin perspective. Grocery and
consumable market share is a little tougher for us to read. There's a lot of things that
have gone on. We'd say there's a lot of noise around the numbers.
We signiﬁcantly pulled back on our operating hours, which you know. We started
closing around 8:30 for most of the second quarter. Now we've taken those
operating hours back to 10 o'clock. We know that impacted us some in the second
quarter not having those operating hours like we had them, metering stores, things
like that.
Price is still really important, but with the stimulus dollars that were in the market,
convenience became even more important. We think during the quarter now, we've
made a lot of inroads as far as convenience over the past several years and that
beneﬁted us, but I think people probably became a little less price sensitive maybe
in the second quarter. And from an out-of-stock standpoint, we had some struggles
as did a number of retailers in that second quarter. We're in better shape than we
were a few -- certainly a few months ago and we're getting better every week, but
there are certain categories that will take some time still to get back to where we
want to be from an overall in-stock perspective.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
On that note -- and I'm probably going to jump to Walmart+ fairly quickly, but on
that note, in terms of the actual hour reduction and then in terms of the inventory, I
think people may underestimate how much and how great the percent of sales are
actually done at Walmart, say, from call it 8:30 PM to 7:00 AM and most are probably
really understating the basis point impact on your sales. So maybe can you -- any
color you could give on that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Brett Biggs
Karen ShortAnd then on the inventory and the out-of-stocks, I mean, as you said in one of your
earlier meetings, you obviously have become unbelievably eﬃcient with inventory
and you have probably basically just-in-time inventory, while you have all algorithms
completely run out of whack. So is there -- could you talk a little bit about that? And I
guess the ability to override the algorithm that you've obviously been operating
under for so -- for decades?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. On the operating hours, I mean, we didn't -- we haven't quantiﬁed it externally,
but it was important enough that we mentioned it quite a bit in our second quarter
release. And I know there are times even as a customer, it's 8:30 and I wanted to go
to Walmart, and for a few weeks there, we weren't open past 8:30. And so you really
had to change your minds a little bit as a customer. I think we've got customers back
now to where it feels a little more normal for customers.
The other thing to mention too would be pricing. And our price gaps in a number of
categories actually widened in the second quarter. And so when you -- number of
our competitors weren't as promotional in the second quarter or actually raised
prices. We really didn't and that created some noise as well around on the market
share side would be on the dollar -- the dollar basis.
On inventory, store managers do have some ability to override, but it -- there's two
kind of large buckets of inventory. One will be short lead time. That would be food
and consumables. And we can make adjustments on that pretty quickly, but you've
got to have supply down the chain with our suppliers to be able to do that as well.
And that was a challenge for a little while, even though they're doing the best they
can as well. And there is longer lead time; think about holidays, Halloween,
Thanksgiving -- not Thanksgiving, much Halloween and Christmas, where we're
going to have to make bets a little further out. It's tougher to change those, so
merchants have to make some assessments there.
The store managers do have some ability, but we're -- our systems are such that they
can look at the demand by store and pretty quickly adapt to a shorter period of time.
Now, the algorithms over the last few months -- you're not going to -- want to repeat
those all the time, but they do learn pretty quickly.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Okay. So jumping to Walmart+, because that seems to be the number one topic,
maybe talk a little bit about -- sorry, I actually want to take a slightly diﬀerent angle
than some of the things that you've been asked in prior meetings. I frequently get
the comment that Amazon didn't break even until it reached a certain number of like
-- whatever hundred -- I guess, call, a billion in sales. And so the comparison is that
introducing this is going to only exponentially increase your losses. So I wanted to
maybe see -- get your framework on that a little bit. I guess, I would argue that the
Walmart behavior as a shopper is just very diﬀerent from how people shop Amazon,
but is there a risk that you train the customer to start shopping Walmart like they
shop (inaudible)?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-08

Page 4 of 12Brett Biggs
Karen Short
Brett Biggs{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, there is a number of things that we considered as we looked at
Walmart+. One, it's really important, we think, for us to oﬀer this for customers, and
now, members in Walmart+. Though the world has evolved -- customers evolved a
lot over the last several years. And we've had a membership, whatever at Sam's Club,
but people have got more used to using memberships, whether it's movies or
streaming or other things that they do and we felt like this was the right time to give
customers that option.
There is a number of things that we can do with this over time. So we've announced
three main beneﬁts at this point, but there'll be other things that we do over time. It
was important to get the membership at the right price point where we thought
would be good for our customers, which is under $100. So we feel good about that.
Customers are going to -- they're going to shop however they want to shop and we
know that and we've been setting ourselves up for that for several years. We still love
customers coming on to our stores and we think that's going be a big part of what
we do forever. And so having the opportunity to pick up in stores, making sure that
the Supercenters in particular, are a great place to shop. Those things are all going
to continue to be important.
Basket size matter. We think we'll continue to have basket size. We think basket size
will get bigger. We've seen that in grocery pickup where basket size are bigger than
they are in the stores. And so that part is very diﬀerent than what some of our other
competitors might have. And now the ability to get increasing mindshare with that
customer on the grocery and consumable side, and then be able to get more of
their general merchandise business, which is great for us from a mindshare
perspective and market share perspective as well as margin perspective, is a really
important part of this.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
So when you think about the demographics that this would appeal to, obviously a
question has come up that -- and I have had this question asked, why would people -
- why would a customer pay a fee when there's a minimum of $35. So maybe can you
just talk a little bit about the thought process behind that, but also just talk a little bit
about why you think this is something that will appeal to all demographics because I
think the perception is that it's only a higher income demographic.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, it's what -- yeah, we wanted to appeal broadly. I mean, Walmart has always
been kind of democracy for shoppers. If you look at the US population, we tend to
mirror, from an income level, racial, gender, we kind of mirror America, and that's
what we like and the same as we do in other countries. But getting that bigger
basket, the baskets we're seeing with most of our customers for delivery or pickup
have the $35 minimum wouldn't have seemed to have made that much of aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-08

Page 5 of 12Karen Short

Brett Biggsdiﬀerence, and it is a way for us to diﬀerentiate what we do from the way that we
fulﬁll as well. So it does help us from a fulﬁllment standpoint, but we think we give
the customers still what they want. So that, we think, is a win-win.
And it just -- we want to do things that ﬁt our customer base, and we don't think this
appeals one way or another to lower income or higher income. We do think it is
really broad reaching, and that's what we like so much about it. We think we've got
something in there for everybody and the price point is really attractive.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
And when you -- I guess, you obviously started testing this before you consolidated
the apps, but is there anything you could talk to in terms of the behavior and
attachment rate pre the consolidation of the apps from a general merchandise
perspective to currently? And then anything you could talk to in terms of what you're
seeing on the behavior -- now that the consolidation of the apps is done?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We won't talk about it speciﬁcally from a competitive standpoint, but you can
imagine anything you can do to make it easier for that customer to go across the isle,
so to speak, and buy general merchandise, the better. And that's why the
Supercenter was such a great retail invention. It's because it brings people on to the
store for food and consumables, but then as everything they need from a general
merchandise side and it mixes out in a way that makes sense.
I don't think online is going to be that diﬀerent actually, and as we continue to get
people in for top of the funnel with food and consumables and things like Walmart+
will help us do that, we will become more top of mind on general merchandise. And
we have really good, strong general merchandise business. We can make it stronger.
The second quarter was a great reminder to all of us of what that ﬂywheel really
looks like when it works. And so what we've seen so far is we have made it easier for
the customer to do that. There are things we'll continue to do that will make it even
easier. I feel certain it will become I think a year from now that where we've made
that easier than it is today.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Okay. And then you've commented a couple of times on the gap in price and our
price checks at least in grocery deﬁnitely show widening of the gap. So I guess the
question is, how do you think about when that gap will actually matter again? It just
feels like consumers are selﬂess with cash on all things that they're not spending on.
And if you're not necessarily getting credit where -- when do you think you will, I
guess?

Page 6 of 12Karen Short

Brett Biggs
Karen ShortYeah. There are some things that are a bit counterintuitive right now. The price gap
always matters and the customer, they notice it is not as formulaic as we make it with
the customer, the customer notices it. It still matters for sure. If we don't get another
stimulus package, which all of us are monitoring like you are, price probably matters
even more. We will get back to something at sometimes it feels a little more normal
than this, I mean, price will matter.
Convenience matters more than it used to, and I think that's here to stay. We've seen
some trends accelerate over the last ﬁve months that are here to stay; more people
on e-commerce, probably more people eating at home, things like that. Some of
those work and I think working to our beneﬁt now, but the price gap is always going
to matter and we're going to be thoughtful about it. There are price -- we want to
ﬁnd that optimal point where we're doing what we need to for customers, but also
ensuring that shareholders get the beneﬁt that they should see as well.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
So on that cash topic, I don't know if you could answer this or not, but -- it seems that
there may be a tax though coming for our many customers or many consumers who
got the $600 stimulus weekly, meaning that there wasn't withholding taken out of
that. I don't know if you've done any analysis on this at all, because it kind of -- I
would venture to say if there is a tax though on that, it will just be subject to regular
tax withholding, there are going to be a lot of shock to consumers in March. Do you
have a view on that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Nothing to speciﬁcally discuss. I think there are so many things right now that are
unusual or that could have impacts down the road, as you say, ﬁrst quarter, second
quarter of next year that we'll just continue to monitor. How they all work together in
aggregate to have an impact on the customer, I think we're just going to have to --
just to make our way through things like that as soon as that becomes an issue.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Okay. And then when you think about the 2020 holiday season, maybe talk a little bit
about how you're thinking about that from a competitive perspective because on
one hand, I could argue that the consumer is going to do anything and everything
they can to make it as special as possible because everyone's so bored.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
On the other hand, I could argue that you have Prime Day, combined with no real
Black Friday, obviously no Black Friday really. So how do you kind of think and weighFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Brett Biggs
Karen Short
Brett Biggsthose two factors?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. Our merchants -- we've -- basically the only thing we know so far is we'll be
closed on Thanksgiving Day, which is something new for us. Glad we're doing that.
And then we'll announce more as we get closer to the holidays. Thanksgiving is still
two and a half months away, which in, today's world, seems like a long time, but
there -- our merchants have -- on some of the long lead-time items we talked about a
minute ago, they've made bets of where they think the holiday will come out. It will
look -- holiday is going to look a lot diﬀerent than prior years, as you said. How
promotions from competitors workout over that period of time, I think, remains to be
seen, but we feel good about how we're positioned for the holiday. I'm with you. I
think people want to make this special and so I would expect things like -- I'm not
head merchant, but I would expect things like trim a tree and other things like that,
people want to decorate their homes, will probably be pretty big this year. We've
seen that in other times when there's been a downturn in the economy that people
really want to go all out for the holidays. And there'll be some places where it will be
more conservative. And our merchants haven't been through something exactly like
this, but we've had periods of time that have been either good or bad for the
holidays from an economic standpoint. They're pretty good at knowing how to work
their way through that.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Okay. And then maybe turning to e-com becoming less unproﬁtable, I guess, I think
people are trying to -- struggling a little bit with what you think is about - in terms of
what's structural in nature, in terms of more permanency or less unproﬁtable e-com
business. Maybe can you kind of talk a little bit about the puts and takes of how we
should all think about that going forward?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Sure. I think really over the last, I'd say, 12 months even, we've been talking about
some positive things we were seeing on the proﬁtability side from e-commerce. And
there is -- there are just several levers within there. One is sales growth obviously.
Two is increased -- or the increased rate of ﬁxed cost; then there is variable cost of
fulﬁllment, there's contribution margin. Those are four things that we watch really
closely. A lot of tailwinds for the e-commerce business in the second quarter, but we
have already seen some of those things in the ﬁrst quarter, which makes us feel good
that structurally we're making progress. Obviously, when you almost double the size
of your business in the quarter, that helps from a -- helps leverage expenses all the
way down the line. But the work that we've done over the past several quarters on
getting more brands online, particularly in home and apparel and higher margin
categories, it helps a lot with contribution margin, which, as you grow sales, and that
actually just starts leveraging your ﬁxed cost at a pretty rapid rate. And so that -- we
were seeing that already last couple of quarters, but it certainly showed up in the
second quarter. So it's those kind of things that structurally I feel good about where
we're going that won't maybe all look as good as the second quarter did, but it wasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-08

Page 8 of 12Karen Short

Karen Shorta demonstration to us that the way we're thinking about that e-commerce model is
right and we saw what that looked like in the second quarter.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Okay. And maybe on that, can you just elaborate a little bit in terms of what capital, if
any, would be required going forward with respect to Walmart+ fulﬁllment centers in
general? And also maybe an update on how many SKUs you have on Walmart+ and
e-comm, and whether or not those are all actually mirrored at all your FCs because I
think that was the -- one of the two big points pre-COVID for you.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We've made a lot of progress on mirroring. We have about 160,000 items that
would be next-day eligible on -- I mean, same-day eligible on delivery and a little
more than that on next day. So mirroring has come a long way over the last year. We
haven't updated -- we'd said 200,000 plus. We haven't really updated that number
in a little while and probably won't from a competitive standpoint, but that -- we feel
good about the ability to get the customer what they want when they need it.
As we've talked about what capital could look like over the next couple of years,
we've been kind of in this $10 billion to $12 billion range for a period of time. And I
think, most years, that's probably about right, and there's some assumption there
about increasing fulﬁllment capacity. Now what we've seen in the second -- ﬁrst and
second quarter, we can really get the e-commerce business ramped up if we wanted
to. Maybe we add capacity faster than we had anticipated; maybe a year or two, that
number goes up, but overall, I feel good about our ability to add capacity at a rate
that makes sense from a ﬁnancial standpoint.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
And with respect to the FCs that you have now, those all have the capability to fairly
meaningfully broaden the marketplace SKUs, correct, without incremental --
increasing the actual capacity or size of the facilities? That's my understanding.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. That'd be accurate. I mean, if -- as we continue, we had triple-digit growth in
marketplace in the second quarter and we're also trying to ramp up Walmart
fulﬁllment services, which would be taking third parties and running at their own
fulﬁllment, but to the extent that that grows dramatically, that will be a good thing for
us from a top of mind standpoint as well as proﬁtability when you can get 3P and
marketplace going more rapidly. So if that continues to grow like that, we'd be just
ﬁne adding fulﬁllment space. We'd be glad to do that.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Brett Biggs
Karen Short
Brett BiggsOkay. And then I guess in terms of overall margin structure, I mean, I think it's
obviously known and documented with every investor that we should always kind of
expect US gross margins to be down, and that's certainly what you get credit for.
How do you think about that though going into the second half just, again, given
that your price gaps are so wide and you're not really getting credit for it at the
moment? Maybe a little color on how to think about that.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We got a little bit of a shift in the second quarter of gross margins going up,
and a lot of that was mix, as I talked about. Yeah, I think -- you know what, I think I've
said to you before even, Karen, that we need to be able for margin -- gross margins
to go down over time. To some degree, markets and customers will determine where
that margin rate goes. And that's why I've been so focused on expenses, is being
able to get our expense and cost structure in a point to where gross margins could
come down some over time and our operating proﬁt margin maintain where we're at
or even potentially go up a little bit. That's -- that model works because if we can do
that and grow the top line, you get that -- you've seen we can do it at 3% and 4%
growth. It's just such big dollars that it leverages dollars. Even if the rate stays the
same, the dollars grow pretty dramatically.
Could margins go up? If we -- our general merchandise -- I mean, if our general
merchandise business performs like we hope it can over the next two to three years,
there's room for that to happen, but that also would give us the opportunity to invest
back in some other things that would help the business longer term. So there is a lot
of optionality, I think, we create with the focus we've had in expense leverage, and
it's still there, and that optionality is important.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
And maybe with respect to expenses, I guess, can you just remind us how we should
be thinking about COVID-related expenses into the third quarter or back half? And
then how are you thinking about wages obviously in light of Target's announcement
and just broader wage pressure?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. So on the COVID-related expenses, we had $1.5 billion roughly in the second
quarter and about three quarters of that were related to pay and beneﬁts. So we had
two special bonuses that were in that number, and then also some things we've
done around sick pay and time oﬀ for people who either are concerned about
COVID or have COVID emergency leave time. So there'll be some expenses that
continue, I think, probably for quite a while. Things around sanitation, maintenance,
anything we need to do for customer and associate safety, we'll continue to do that.
So there's some level of that that's going to continue probably for a period of time,
but not the level you've seen at Q1 and Q2. On the wage front, we're just always,
always watching it. We have to be able to recruit good talent. We have to be able to
retain people, really have to look at it geography by geography. I don't think looking
at a rate across the nation is -- ﬁrstly, I don't think is the right way to look at it. I thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Karen Short
Brett Biggs
Karen Short
Brett Biggs
Karen Shortyou've got to look at it by geography. And so there are places that are hotter than
others from a wage perspective, and we're being competitive in those markets.
There are certain types of positions where we're going to make sure that we are
really competitive to ensure we're getting the right talent in those areas, but it's
something that just -- it takes constant minding and paying attention to.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Right. Okay. And then I guess, thinking about capital allocation, I can think of one
retailer so far in this coverage -- my coverage that has announced resuming
buybacks, and I know where you stand currently, but maybe how should we kind of
think about that? Is that something that we should not expect until we're back to
whatever normal it is?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We haven't talked speciﬁcally about buybacks. You saw -- I mean, you have
seen that we didn't do any buybacks in the second quarter, but it's not something
that you're likely going to ever say we're oﬀ or on. It's -- we want to be more nimble
than that. The way we think about capital hasn't changed. We're going to continue to
put signiﬁcant amounts of capital into the business. And when you look at our
operating cash ﬂow over the last ﬁve years, there have been $25 billion to $30 billion
in cash ﬂow. And when you look at the capital we spend of, say, 10 to 12, and the
dividends of around 6, which we're very committed to that, still leaves you a lot of
room from a cash ﬂow perspective. We've been buying back signiﬁcant amount of
shares. And there's a number of things that go into that decision on a quarterly basis.
I still feel really good about the value of the company. So share buybacks is
something that is certainly mid to long term. We're -- I feel like it's an important part
of how we spend our capital.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
And just remind us, in terms of that, if there were a decision where you resume the
buyback, you have a grid in place in terms of how you proceed or maybe just to
remind people how that would work.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. That's typically what we do is we always have a share repurchase grid based on
buying at certain levels of price on the stock, which is pretty typical of what most
companies do.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Okay. And then maybe a last question just in terms of e-comm. Obviously, you've
indicated in the past that you're deﬁnitely willing to look at larger scale acquisitions
on e-comm that are transformative, but you've also been divesting some of the e-
comm assets. So I think Shoes.com, (inaudible) Bare Necessities. Obviously, Jet --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-08

Karen Shortwhat happened with Jet. Maybe just -- maybe end with how you think about that
from a strategic perspective.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think there is -- certainly, if we have opportunities to -- from a brand
perspective or from a technology perspective, people perspective, those are the
types of acquisitions that would -- they're enabling-type acquisitions, we will
continue to look at those. And we're just making decisions more quickly than we
used to. And so in the example of Bare Necessities and Shoes, both of those
acquisitions helped us make signiﬁcant progress in those categories from a brand
perspective, in stores, online. And so we beneﬁted a lot from those acquisitions. And
there is times where we're going to get the value that we think we need out of
acquisitions and it makes sense for someone else to own them going forward, and to
continue to focus where we want to focus, we'll make the decisions to not focus in
places where we don't want to focus, but those categories are critically important to
