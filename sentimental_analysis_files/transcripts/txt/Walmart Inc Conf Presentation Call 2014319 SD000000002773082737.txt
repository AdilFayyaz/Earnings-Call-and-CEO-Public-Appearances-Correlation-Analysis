By my phone it says it is 11 o'clock so that means it is time to go because with our
next presentation, it will be webcast again.
I am Greg Melich. I head up ISI's retail research eﬀort. It is my pleasure to kick oﬀ our
fourth annual summit with a real special guest, Duncan Mac Naughton, who is
Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Oﬃcer of Walmart US.
Now just so you understand, that sounds like a pretty important job. He is actually
the biggest buyer in the world of anything, period. And then on top of that, he has
also got marketing responsibility for the biggest retailer in the world, in the US.
So Duncan, it's a pleasure to have you. As I look around the audience I also see at
least a half-dozen of other great Walmart execs. If I tried to introduce each of you, I
am going to screw up so I won't. But thank you so much for coming and we will see
you all on the tour later. It is a new neighborhood market and so, Duncan, I hand it
oﬀ to you to take us through why it is so exciting.
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Thank you, Greg; it is great to be here. Good morning. I really, Greg, appreciate the
format today. What is really interesting I love the opportunity to share with you an
update on Walmart US and the key strategy which is obviously very important to us
and hopefully interesting to you but more importantly is the chance to interact with
our stores and as we talk about in our home oﬃce, we don't have any registers in the
home oﬃce because everything happens in the stores. So it is great that you will be
able to interact with some of our leadership that will be able to talk to you about
where we are making some big bets on innovation inside our neighborhood markets
and we are pretty excited about it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19

Page 2 of 13The store we are going to go to actually used to be a Food Lion before they left the
marketplace. So I think you are going to see some great merchandising on the ﬂoor
and I am pretty excited about it. So with that we are going to jump in.
I will be making some forward-looking statements today so rather than read this to
you and expire my shot clock down here, Greg, I am going to let you go to our
corporate website if you'd like to read more about this and you can ﬁnd more
information there.
So again, we are delighted to be here. So let's jump into business. Let's be real clear,
our number one priority at Walmart US is to drive positive comp sales, period. And
that is what we are focused on. And we are focused on doing that by building the
next generation of retail and what was exciting and what I just heard about from the
panel here is you are going to see some of the work that we are doing at Walmart to
connect all our formats to basically endless aisles and shop when the customer
wants to shop. We think that is critically important.
Our core mission remains the same at Walmart. It is about saving people money so
they can in fact live better and we do that by taking costs out of our business system
whether it is our operating environment, whether it is our cost of goods and then we
invest that in lowering prices and have price leadership across the country. And low
price leadership will always be a foundational pillar in the Walmart US strategy.
We take those great prices and we put them across a very broad assortment to fulﬁll
our one-stop shop commitment to our customers particularly as we think about the
Walmart Supercenter. It is about top brands, it is about innovative items and also as
we get into smaller formats, it is about localized assortment that resonates with the
customer. And you will see that particularly in a neighborhood market as food is very
local in nature and we will demonstrate for you that a couple of examples here but
also as we get into the store.
And you heard about the customer changing in that presentation this morning but
people are shopping diﬀerently and they want access when they want it and as a
result, we thought it was very important to accelerate the rollout of our
neighborhood market and our express stores and I will talk to you more about that
but on the chart you can see there by the end of the ﬁscal year this year, we will have
approximately 650 of those stores on the ground at Walmart.
What is most exciting is we think at Walmart we are in a unique position to win in this
convergence of physical and digital retail because we have that forward place
footprint, we have very strong buying power, great loyalty and price leadership. And
connecting that digital comp customer with that brick-and-mortar customer we think
is going to win and we think we are positioned for that and I will give you some
examples about that as we go through.
What gets those low prices is driving that productivity loop that I talked about. We
are always looking at ways to optimize our supply chain, our operations. As aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 13merchant we are very focused on our cost of goods savings, it's taking cost out of
the business and taking those savings and putting them back in price.
Last year we saved over $600 million in cost of goods savings and we intend to have
additional savings again this year. We take that again and put it into our price.
We have four platforms that we pursue as we think about how we work with our
suppliers. The ﬁrst one I will talk about is what we call our joint business planning
process which is a framework for us to have conversations with our strategic supplier
partners talking about where we are going to invest, where we want to grow, where
perhaps we are mutually going to invest to disrupt the marketplace, set growth
targets and it creates that environment of metrics, quarterly updates and holding
each other accountable for activities.
We now are working with about 200 suppliers which is almost double than what we
had in last ﬁscal year and just slightly over half our sales are now done with partners
that we use in joint business planning. We started this primarily with our grocery and
our consumables and OTC suppliers but this now is across the total store with
general merchandise and our softline partners as well which I think is critically
important.
The secondary focus for our merchandising team is now food upstreaming work and
we have had some great progress here. This is really about how we can decrease
product cost while we increase product quality. It is that simple, simple in concept.
But it takes some work to do. Some of the examples that we have done is we have
now have three wine warehouses across the United States in California, in Florida
and in Arizona. We are able to take cost out of the distribution center and then
reﬂect that cost back to the customer.
In produce which I am very excited about, we are able to use regional facilities to
start to centralize some of the produce supply chain activities, things like culling and
things like quality assurance ripening, cutting, packaging and even sorting across an
entire crop to say which stores should get which products. We opened our ﬁrst
facility in South Texas in the Third Quarter of last year and we plan to open ﬁve more
of these facilities in the coming years.
In global food sourcing, we are also adding some more locations that I will talk about
in a second. I will tell you, one of the other areas down here in global food sourcing
is about taking a strategic supplier matrix and looking at building stronger, longer-
term relationships that are more meaningful with our key strategic supplier partners
particularly in general merchandise and soft lines. That gives them an opportunity
and us to have multiyear commitments so we can invest in innovation and we can
invest in quality improvements.
The direct sourcing in both GM and softline has continued to grow. It allows us to
buy direct. It allows us to enhance our margins and it takes cost out of the supply
chain and also allows us to forward manage our inventory.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 13Some of the other global sourcing highlights would be for instance in our own brand
and in entertainments and accessories. We took out the middleman in electronic
accessories, went directly to the pilot to the factories and we are able to have in our
stores you probably see them in our Supercenters, the $4.88 accessory bins. It would
be phone cases, it would be ear phones. And great ways to create great value and
take cost out of the supply chain by working directly with our supplier partners.
Another example is the appliances there. We launched the Farberware brand again
dealing directly with our factories overseas and that allowed us to grow margins and
take supply chain costs out and actually have better quality product that is
comparable to leading brands at disruptive prices.
And then ﬁnally in the fourth plank for our merchants is the US manufacturing
initiative that you have heard us talk about and I know you have heard Bill talk about
before. We really are building on the foundation we laid last year to hit our
commitment to buy $250 billion of US manufactured goods by ﬁscal year 2023. This
is pretty exciting. As a matter of fact, we now are working with 150 suppliers. We
have 170 projects that are live today and we are actually going to -- I am excited
about our second annual US manufacturing summit that we will host this summer
with 500 suppliers and a number of state agencies and representatives to talk about
how do we accelerate processes and move this forward. So it is a critically important
initiative for us.
So we got those cost of goods, what do we do with them? We are very aggressively
investing in price and the way we look at it is across basket elasticities, we always
lead on the key volume items as you know but the key here is where can we invest to
get the best return on our investment across our shoppers whether it be a
Supercenter or a neighborhood market? What are the traﬃc driving categories
where we want to disrupt and make a diﬀerence? And you have heard us talk about
adult beverages for instance. It is a great example of how we can drive traﬃc and
also drive topline sales.
And then ﬁnally, localized customer needs particularly in food where it is a very local
marketplace so we look at diﬀerent geographies where we think we can have an
inﬂection point to drive topline sales and convert some traﬃc. And we are being very
bold about how we talk to our customers about it and you can see there on the left
side our March Rollback Madness event which is really exciting.
You can see an example of the tab that we have there. The products now between
March 1 and March 31, the front page has got some great local brands things like
Coca-Cola for $3 for example and we now have 20% more rollbacks in this particular
event than we typically would have. So not only having great everyday low price but
activating that across the store through our merchandising and our rollback sign
which really resonates well with our customer. So we will continue to invest
aggressively across the key commodities.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 13What is fun here is how do you innovate to make savings easier and you are
probably familiar with our Low Price Guarantee and we back that with an ad match. If
for some reason some retailer would beat us with their high low price, we match it at
the register as you may be familiar with as the customer checks out.
So what we are going to do here is a pretty exciting program we are calling Savings
Catcher and this is actually a way that a customer goes in the store, they buy their
product, they get their receipt, they take the number oﬀ the bottom of their receipt
and they can either go online or do it from a mobile application and type in that
receipt number. Then what we do is we look at all the ads across all of the
marketplace of the products that they bought in their basket and if we were beat on
any of those items, we automatically credit that savings to a Walmart gift card and
that will create a credit for them that they can come back and buy whatever they'd
like with it. And we are very excited about this.
We are testing it now in seven cities. We are in Charlotte, North Carolina, Lexington,
Kentucky, here in Atlanta this week, Minneapolis, Dallas, Huntsville, Alabama and San
Diego and we are also talking about it across diﬀerent weights with TV, with radio,
with in-store promotions, our smart network social and digital media. So we think this
could again be a great asset for our customers again giving conﬁdence to our
customer that we are in fact the low-price leader across the whole basket.
Now driving traﬃc and having our commitment to the one stop shop is critically
important and we do that with winning in new and winning with brands that resonate
with our customers. So making sure we have the top brands and that we are ﬁrst to
market and oftentimes exclusive to market and then how we bring that to life in the
store.
A couple of examples here on this slide is the ﬁrst on the upper left you can see Bud
Light's extension of their original Lime-A-Ritas. They have got some new products
out. Don't know if you have tried them. They are very good and they will be for sale
and where you are welcome to buy them and maybe enjoy them this evening. Mang-
O-Rita and Raz-Ber-Rita ﬂavors to the Bud Light Lime. We have a 41% and a 42%
share on these products nationally. So again, getting out in front of the marketplace,
having great prices, making it available to the customer and leading with innovation
with our supplier partners is really important.
You combine that with Lime-A-Rita and Straw-Ber-Rita and we will have a $100 million
business in these four SKUs. That is about being relevant with the customer.
The other piece you can see in the upper right there is we are launching a private
label price ﬁrst opening price point brand that we are very excited about. We have
got 55 SKUs in this line. We are currently in 400 stores. We are going to expand that
to another 240 stores. We call it ﬁt for purpose so it's product that will meet the
customers' expectation for the value that they pay for it and the packaging reﬂects
our commitment on that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 13So we think this is a great opportunity to make sure that we have the lowest price in
the marketplace and we can build this across the stores.
Other items that are exclusive. For instance I just highlighted the Red Lobster
cheddar biscuit mix. It is a great product that really resonates with our customers.
Crazy how well it sells. We have exclusivity there until June.
On the left you see the Urbini Hummingbird Stroller. Our customers told us you have
nice strollers but not good enough. This is a higher end stroller. It's seven pounds,
why we call it the Hummingbird. So you can hold the baby in one hand and you can
open and close the stroller. It is a fabulous value and we are very excited about it.
Then we are taking some of our existing brands and expanding them like the great
workwear product that we have in Dickies. We have now moved into high quality
workboots as well and that brand resonates with our core customer who shops with
us for their workwear. It is now into our work shoes.
And then the Flexees brand by Maidenform as you may know, the shapewear
industry has been growing quite quickly and we started with a pallet program last
quarter with Flexees and now putting it in our spring modular and it is a great
program where we will have savings for our customer 50% to 60% oﬀ the national
department stores.
We have a camisole that is $15.94 that would be about $60 in some of the national
department stores so shocking value as we like to call it at Walmart.
Some of the big bets and some of the mass merchandising ideas, you may have
read yesterday we announced that we are going to participate in the videogame
trade-in business. We are very excited about this announcement. We will actually
start it in 3100 stores a week from today and today actually we will start it with our
associates so they are able to bring in their games and it is across the great
platforms like Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Wii and as you may know,
this is a $2 billion industry that we don't participate in yet.
So we will trade them in and as we ﬁll our supply chain, we will then put those
products for sale. We assume we should be able to sell them by summer so another
great revenue stream. Paying more for games for our customers and selling those
used games for less, again creating access for our customers.
Other things like big bets on what we call consumables in our general merchandise
area like as the incandescent lightbulbs fade out, we are making a big bet on our GE
as well as our great value lightbulb business and the LED as well as the CFL business
where we have about a 30% price gap to our competitors.
And then on the bottom, this is a bit of what you expect from Walmart, item price
merchandising. It is the stock up and save events we started running last fall. We areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 13doing it again this March, you are going to see it in Supercenters. You also see it in
select neighborhood markets, things like Charmin and Bounty paper towels and
Pampers diapers at a signiﬁcant savings for the customer with big displays, again
showing the customer that we lead in price across all the core commodities.
We also continue to build on our improvements in our fresh food business. We see
this as a strategic pillar for us not only from investing in price but more importantly
for our customers in quality and we are going to build on the momentum that we
launched two years ago in our meat business with our choice beef program and
then last year with the work we did in produce and I will highlight that in a minute.
But we are adding some regional brands for instance our chicken brands, Claxton
Foods in the southeast part of the United States. Frozen patty brands that we didn't
have before like Guy Fieri and Herschel's Famous 34 and also adding more healthy
items within the fresh meat case particularly in the pork lines like thin cut chops and
petite butt roasts. So some of these items the customer has not been able to get
before to make sure we are relevant.
Also driving promotional activity to get customers to come into the fresh department
like a national fresh turkey program that we have with Jennie-O as well as Butterball.
And then improving the produce operation is really exciting. We had a great year in
produce as we shared with you with the end of the year. We grew 50 basis points in
share between meat and produce last year but when we started this program we
audit our stores and the ﬁrst time we did an audit in May of 2013, only 75% of our
stores passed our expectation of good quality produce. The last six weeks, the audit
was 95% pass rate. So the operators have done a fantastic job.
We have also worked with our supply chain to take two full days of supply out of the
produce supply chain so that means our customer is going home with a much higher
quality pressure product which resonates and is reﬂected in that share growth. We
are going to take that same focus and put it in our service deli and our bakery with
authentic baked daily products in the Walmart bakeries to get that engagement with
food and we are pretty excited about that. It is going to build -- and in fact customer
loyalty and trust some great items like you are going to get a chance to eat so make
sure you have some dessert at our store. Some market side chocolate chip cookies, a
three pack for $0.98. It is out of this world. So I encourage you to try that when you
get to the store.
The other key thing is we talk about how do we tailor our oﬀers to make sure that we
are relevant locally. So we are adding the regional brands like I talked about in fresh.
We are ﬁlling assortment gaps where perhaps we didn't have insight to items carried
in a local market before so we are leveraging our syndicated data from Nielsen and
IRI and NPD in the nonfood areas to make sure that we are in fact relevant.
In the store we are going to go to this afternoon you are going to ﬁnd products for
instance that you might not ﬁnd in Bentonville or Philadelphia, Southeastern Mills
gravy mix which is made in Rome, Georgia; Williams Brothers barbecue sauce that isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 13made right here in Marietta, Georgia; Rogers wood smoked meats that is made in
Savannah; and then a Vidalia brand onion ring batter mix that is made in Reidsville,
Georgia.
So not only having the right items but then having the right holding capacity. So we
have built demand-based clusters to make sure our modulars have holding capacity
for high velocity items but to make sure we are locally relevant.
You have heard Bill talk about the acceleration of our neighborhood markets and
our small store formats. We will add 200 Neighborhood markets this year and 100
Express stores. These are very much focused on the ﬁll-in trips. People expect us for
key traﬃc driving like fresh foods, you see pharmacy, adult beverages. It lives inside
the Walmart ecosystem where we are going to have fuel, where we have room for
fuel. We can tether products from the big stores to the small stores for meal
solutions and all the Walmart services like site to store you heard pick up today
talked about today and also our money services center. So we are excited about the
opportunity to take that small store and let it behave like a big store.
And that is all about integrating our digital and physical initiatives for our customer.
We are investing heavily in our mobile capabilities. You are familiar with the Walmart
app and all the features that it goes with. The customer choice you heard the panel
talk about people want to order it online, they want to pick it up in their store, they
can pick it up the same day, they can pick it up a few days later for free, they can
order online and pay with cash. We still have our locker test going on in Washington,
DC in 10 stores.
The exciting news here is on the bottom of the page which is what we launched in
October in 2013 in Denver was a grocery home delivery service which was the
second market after we started in San Jose. What is exciting about this is we are
delivering throughout the Denver market the same price as in store as online. We
don't have an annual fee. We have free for new customers and a very modest
delivery fee and we just launched in January pickup from the store for free.
So order online, have your groceries. You are on the way home, you want to get gas
or just pick it up and go, we now have that at 29 locations across the Denver market
and we have a 90% approval rate from our customers. And our brand with King
Supers and some great retailers in Denver, we feel really good about the opportunity
here and we have been growing market share in the Denver market and we think
this is a key opportunities for us to learn and grow.
Our customer is changing and we need to talk to them diﬀerently. So we are sharing
our message across with our customer whether it be in-store promotions on their
phone, through their social networks, online, in radio, on search media like you
heard from the Google folks and we are also investing signiﬁcantly in digital and
social media, increasing our investment this year 30% across these areas. From
Facebook, we're still the number one brand in the United States, Pinterest, Twitter,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 13Greg Melich
Duncan Mac NaughtonVine, Instagram; we also have content videos on YouTube that we are very excited
about.
And we are also launching some new innovative programs. One example would be
our weather FX program and this is working with weather FX to identify emerging
weather patterns and then triggering advertising direct to customer.
So for instance in Atlanta, you wake up maybe it is 55 degrees out this morning, 30%
humidity by this afternoon it is 70 and 90% humidity. That would trigger for instance
Gatorade ads or bottled water ads. It would go directly to the store's Facebook page
to mobile applications and to our in-store network.
Same thing with pollen count when it rises, we would immediately start to feature
over-the-counter medication as well as all the other things folks are looking for.
So priority is quite simple, drive comp sales by investing in price. We are very
focused on price separation and price leadership. Number two, deliver the best
assortment with top brands and innovative products and being local, using data to
be local. The convergence of digital and physical is really important and that is why
we are growing the small store format so quickly. We want small stores acting like
big stores combined with Walmart.com basically unlimited assortment.
And then customer connection with all the diﬀerent ways we can talk to the customer
in-store and then testing and innovating which you will see some of that in our stores
today.
So I am excited about the opportunity that we have with Walmart. We are all focused
all 1.3 million of us on driving topline sales and positive comp sales for the year. So
with that, I will take some questions.
{BIO 1507344 <GO>}
Maybe I will kick it oﬀ with one and then we will get to the group. This last holiday it
seemed like it started really strong and the initiatives and investing in price and TVs
and everything really came on and then of course weather and other things
disrupted it. Now that we can look back at that and go into this year, what do you
think we learned from this holiday in terms of getting that balance that there is
deﬂation out there and traﬃc is down, how much we reinvest and how we reinvest it
to stabilize traﬃc?
As you think into this year, should we expect gross margin you want to keep
investing in price as much as last year or do you think last year got a little bit
overboard by the Fourth Quarter?

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Duncan Mac NaughtonIt's a great question. We actually reﬂecting speciﬁcally on the Fourth Quarter, we feel
really good about the holiday activity. As a matter of fact, we are already planning as
you would expect us to do what we are going to do this holiday. I felt good about it.
As a matter of fact going at the end of December, we had positive comps.
What really hurt us was the January weather. It just really disrupted our place. You
can expect us to invest in gross margin and in price for the year because we believe
it is going to drive traﬃc and it will drive price separation in the business. So you will
continue to see that. That is why we have the cost of goods initiatives that we have.
We will always be working the productivity (inaudible).
{BIO 1507344 <GO>}
Great.
Questions And Answers
I have two questions actually the ﬁrst one is a real quick one. I have seen that 28 AGs
have asked a whole bunch of retailers including you to stop selling tobacco and I
just wondered if you could make a comment on that and then I will ask my other
question.
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Yes, we have gotten a few letters from some senators. Our role at Walmart is really
about providing customer choice and while a product is legal, it is similar to the gun
debate that we had not too long ago and as long as the product is legal, we will sell
it legally and we will still oﬀer the choice of tobacco for our stores.
Okay. And then in Denver, you've just recently started with the food test order online
and pick up in-store. Some of the studies I have read show or say that people don't
actually mind going to the grocery store. They just don't want to spend so much time
there. So have you seen yet people actually they order online but they come to the
store and they shop the meat and the produce and then they pick up the center of
the store on the way out because that is what actually they don't want to shop for.
Have you noticed anything yet?
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
My experience in the industry is exactly that. People actually, they are comfortable
with you picking their canned soup or their boxed dinners but they want to pick their
tomatoes. And that is why we are really excited about this Denver test so we can see
some of those learnings. I expect that to be the case and that is why we want to
make it convenient and that is why we are in 29 locations. I think this could be a big
win for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19

I can't resist given the tobacco question. You mentioned Denver. If it is legal. Are we
doing more local merchandising in Colorado?
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
No, sir. We are going to follow the Federal law.
{BIO 1507344 <GO>}
Thank you for that.
I want to ask about the role of pharmacy and gas station in both the Neighborhood
Market and the Express stores. I know they are both desirable maybe just out of the
200 Neighborhoods, the 100 Expresses, how many pharmacies, how many gas
stations do you think you will be able to build?
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
I will tell you that our goal is to build fuel stations and pharmacies in every store
where we can unless there is a restriction because of location of the store. Other
than that, we are going to put them on the ground. We think we can diﬀerentiate
because of the pharmacy, because of fuel, because of fresh foods that a lot of the
smaller dollar store channels can't oﬀer and we think that is a great competitive
advantage for us.
So where we can you can expect that which would be the majority of the sites we
have.
(inaudible) closer to 90 than 50?
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
I would say probably almost virtually almost all. It would be an exception not to have
those services. Is that fair?
Thank you.
Duncan, can you give us an example of a product that was very innovative that was a
big deal to you guys last year in your stores or something now that we can look at
today? I mean we see so many things but your eye is diﬀerent so an example or two
of really cool innovative products. Thanks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Sure. You bet. Some of the food innovation you saw some of the things in alcohol
that we really assuming -- do we have alcohol in the store? Beer, beer only. Okay so
beer and wine, which is for the most case what we sell a lot of. We sell a lot of beer
and some wine and some spirits based on law.
Innovative products, some of the things that we work with on our private brands for
instance where we co-branded some products with Pepperidge Farms both in our
refrigerated dough and also with Betty Crocker building some macaroni and cheese
products, some home meal side dishes that are borrowing oﬀ national brand equity
but are made by our third-party supplier and exclusive to Walmart at signiﬁcant
values to the customer.
And you wouldn't think center of the store would be one of those areas where you
could go but we had some great work and we can highlight some of that for you in
the store.
A question about the small format rollout. I think US Walmart stores do about $400
billion of revenue and if small format is successful maybe it gets to $16 billion or $17
billion in a number of years. Could you just talk about how you and other
management are spending your priorities trying to get 4% revenue growth? Is it just
noise and you are missing the core or how do you balance the two initiatives?
{BIO 6052579 <GO>}
Yes, that's a great question. Our US business is about $290 billion and so it would be
smaller than that in the smaller stores. We do see opportunities for thousands of
small stores, Neighborhood markets as well as that is why we rolling out the 100
Express stores. So we think we can be a big business tens of billions of dollars over
time without any problem.
We have a team that is dedicated to our small store rollout and you are going to
actually get to interact with them at the store today so that the bulk of the
organization can work on the $285 billion call it worth of sales that we do on the big
stores.
We do use the same buying teams because we don't want to fracture that leverage
so what we do is we rely on the experts of the format to tell us what they need
diﬀerently and then our buyers negotiate on behalf of the greater Company.
I had a quick question because there was a lot of information to take on. On the
Walmart to go trial, I know you are saying it is mostly click and collect but how does
the charging work and also are you going to oﬀer a delivery to home part to that as
well? Thanks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-19

Sure. The pickup at the store is free and then the delivery is a $30 minimum basket
and it is either a $5 charge or a $7 charge depending if you want a one-hour window
or a four-hour window. And there is no annual fee. And I think some other folks
might have a $35 minimum and a pretty substantial delivery fee.

That's great. Well, Duncan, I want to thank you very much. We could go on for an
hour with you. So we will have the chance at the store. You will be at the store along
with another whole group of great Walmart people so thanks again for coming.
