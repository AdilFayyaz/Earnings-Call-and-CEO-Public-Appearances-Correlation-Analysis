Good morning. Welcome back to Apple Call for our Second Event in just over a
month. At Apple, we are focused on creating innovative products and experiences.
Products that oﬀer our users new ways to express their creativity and to enjoy the
creativity of others.
So today, we're focusing on two important areas, Music and the Mac. Let's start with
music. Music plays such an important part in our lives. It has the power to inspire, lift
us up and bring us together. Apple has forever changed the way people listen to
and discover music, and we continue to make it better. Our deep integration of
hardware, software and services, lets you enjoy a seamless music experience with
amazing sound quality on all of your devices.
AirPods are one of the most popular music products we've ever created. Combined
with the revolutionary iPhone, they bring an industry-leading wireless music
experience wherever you go. Our powerful Mac and iPad multi-speaker sound
systems bring incredible audio to any space. HomePod mini is the best way to enjoy
your music throughout your home.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-18

Unidentiﬁed SpeakerApple Watch is a fantastic way to enjoy music right from your wrist, providing the
soundtrack you need to stay active and ﬁt. And of course, there's Apple Music, which
has over 90 million songs and 30,000 curated playlists in its global catalog. This fall,
we're taking the Apple Music experience even further. And here's Zane to tell you
more.
Today, Apple Music and Siri deliver an eﬀortless music experience. It lets you hear
pretty much anything you want by using just your voice. Already, you can ask for your
favorite songs, albums, or artists, but there are also times when you want to ﬁnd just
the right music for the moment. And we want to make Siri more helpful with that. So,
our music experts have created new playlists for hundreds of moods and activities.
Now, if you ask Siri to put on a playlist for your dinner party, you'll hear the perfect
selection from Leon Bridges. When you want to relax before bed, there's a playlist
for winding down, featuring one of my favorite artists Nils Frahm. And when you
need that extra push to take you further on your next hike, you'll need The Weeknd's
Take My Breath. These new playlists are available to every subscriber, and make
using Apple Music together with Siri even easier and better.
Naturally, we want to bring this experience to more people than ever before. So
today, we're excited to also introduce a brand-new subscription plan for Apple
Music, the Voice Plan. With this new plan, use only your voice and the power of Siri
to access every song, every playlist and every station in Apple Music across all your
Apple devices for just $4.99 a month.
This plan will be available starting in 17 countries and regions later this fall. Now,
everyone has three great ways to get Apple Music. There's the individual plan, the
family plan and now, the Voice Plan, where you can use the power of Siri to access
the full Apple Music catalog.
This is Apple Music. Back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
We're excited that even more people will be able to enjoy Apple Music, simply with
their voice. With access to virtually any song you want to hear, as well as expertly-
crafted playlists that are perfect for any occasion, Apple Music truly has something
for everyone and one of the best ways to experience it is with HomePod mini. To tell
you more, here's Dave.
HomePod mini is a powerful smart speaker that delivers amazing sound, the
intelligence of Siri and it's the foundation for your smart home. All while ensuring

HomePod mini will look great in even more places around your home, and it's a
fantastic way to enjoy Apple Music. When it comes to listening to music on the go,
AirPods deliver a magical wireless experience. And they'd become the most popular
headphones in the world. We've got some exciting news about AirPods. And here's
Sushmita to tell you more.
Our users love listening to music with AirPods and with spatial audio featuring Dolby
Atmos in Apple Music. AirPods have never sounded better. By moving music beyond
the simple left and right of traditional stereo sound and into three-dimensional
immersive listening, spatial audio embeds you deeper into the mix than ever before.
Spatial audio brings music to life with sounds that surround you to create something
truly multi-dimensional. It's a whole new way to experience your favorite music. Every
day, top artists like James Blake and Doja Cat are releasing more songs in Dolby
Atmos. Spatial audio goes beyond music when watching TV shows and movies, itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-18

action.
You can enjoy a spatial audio with dynamic head tracking on AirPods Pro and
AirPods Max across all of your devices from iPhone to iPad to Apple TV and Mac. We
want to bring the full spatial audio experience to even more of our customers.
So today, we are excited to announce the third generation of our most popular
AirPods. Let's take a look.
(Audio Video Presentation)
These are the new AirPods with spatial audio, featuring an all-new design inside, and
out with a four sensor for more control of your music and phone calls. To deliver the
best sound quality, we designed a brand-new low distortion driver, created just for
the new AirPods to provide powerful bass and crisp clean high frequencies. Whether
you're relaxing to Yo-Yo Ma or singing along to Lizzo. And to keep your music going
during your toughest workouts or a jog in the rain. The next generation AirPods are
sweat and water resistant. Since everyone's ear shape is unique. What you here, can
be diﬀerent from what you're intended to hear. We wanted to ﬁnd a way to make
sure everyone has the best audio experience possible and we achieve this in two
ways. First, with our new contour design that delivers sound directly to your ears.
Second, with adaptive EQ, a breakthrough feature in sound that we ﬁrst made
available with the AirPods Pro.
Adaptive EQ provides the best audio experience customized for you in real time by
adjusting frequencies in the sound to match what you are hearing to how it's
supposed to be heard. So, you can listen to Olivia Rodrigo's latest album just the
way she intended. The magical experience of AirPods makes it eﬀortless to enjoy
your music throughout the day. It begins the moment you open the case with the
one touch setup that automatically pairs to all of your Apple devices, making AirPods
always ready when you are.
And to extend your experience, we increase the battery life for up to six hours of
listening time; or if you're in a hurry, ﬁve minutes of charge time gets you around an
hour of use. And of course, the convenience of the charging case, giving you an
additional four full charges for up to 30 hours of total listening time.
To make charging your AirPods even more convenient, we added MagSafe and
wireless charging to the case. These are the new AirPods, featuring spatial audio with
dynamic head tracking, and all-new design. Our custom design driver with Adaptive
EQ and the magical experience that our customers love. We took the best-selling
headphones in the world and made them even better. All of this for $179. We will
start taking orders today and they will be available next week. The next generation
AirPods joined the world's most popular family of headphones. This is our new
AirPods line-up starting at just $129. Now, back to Tim.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-18

We can't wait for you to try the next generation of AirPods. And with this great line-
up, there is something for everyone. Now, let's talk about the Mac. The Mac has
always been an easy-to-use yet incredibly capable tool that empowers users to
create in new and innovative ways. The tight integration of hardware and software
provides a user experience that is simply unrivaled and with Apple silicon, that
experience is better than ever.
We're a year into a two-year transition, which started with M1. Our ﬁrst chip designed
speciﬁcally for the Mac. M1 is a breakthrough. It is transformed our most popular and
aﬀordable systems, redeﬁning what they can do with incredible performance and
extraordinary battery life. The response has been oﬀ the charts. M1 has propelled
back growth over the past year, outpacing the industry, where the Mac having its
best year ever. And today, I'm thrilled that we're bringing Apple silicon to even more
systems to tell you all about it. Here's John.
Our Pro users rely on the Mac and the one they choose most is the MacBook Pro.
They choose it to develop amazing apps that enrich people's lives to create music
that moves us, and to make movies and shows that entertain and educate us. The
MacBook Pro appeals to people, who want the most powerful Mac notebook, so
they can change the world. Well, today is the day that they've been waiting for.
Because today, we're completely reimagining MacBook Pro. And it starts with the
ﬁrst pro chip designed for the Mac. This is M1 Pro, the next chip in the M1 family. And
it's a game changer.
Now, let's hand it over to Johny for a deep dive into this remarkable new chip.
{BIO 19052877 <GO>}
The transition for Apple silicon is all about bringing its incredible performance,
custom technologies, and relentless focus on power eﬃciency to the Mac. And M1
has done exactly that. Not only has it transformed our most popular systems, it has
shocked the PC World. M1 has been amazing for so many of our customers.
However, there are some Pro users, who need even more and we wanted to build
something great just for them. That is what M1 Pro is all about. It's our next
breakthrough chip for the Mac.
Now building a Pro laptop has made using a power-hungry CPU and discrete GPU.
But the two-chip architecture requires much more power and cooling. It also means
the CPU and GPU have separate pools of memory. So, they have to copy data back
and forth over a slower interface. No one has ever applied a system on a chip
designed to ecosystem until today and we did this by scaling of M1's ground-
breaking architecture to create a far more powerful chip with M1 Pro. We started by
rearchitecting the chip fabric to inhibit this obviously to scale, while doubling the
width of the memory interface and using faster DR.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-18
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 15This lets M1 Pro deliver up to 200 gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth,
nearly three times M1. And its custom package supports up to 32 gigabytes of
uniﬁed memory. The M1 product is built using the industry-leading 5-nanometer
process technology and features a massive 33.7 billion transistors. That's more than
twice M1.
All those transistors deliver even more performance, starting with a 10-core CPU,
with eight high-performance cores and two high-eﬃciency cores, delivering up to
70% faster CPU performance than M1. For graphics M1 Pro features 16 GPU cores,
eight more than M1. This additional cores along with increased memory bandwidth,
give M1 Pro up to two times faster graphics performance than M1. M1 Pro has our
industry-leading media engine that accelerates video processing while using very
little power. And now, it pushes even further with 4S. It's one of the highest-quality
codex and professional video production. Adding 4S acceleration in M1 Pro to play
multiple streams of 4K and 8K 4S video, while using just a fraction of the power. It's
another key advantage of building our own silicon.
And ﬁnally, M1 Pro includes other advanced technologies for a complete Pro system
like a powerful engine to drive multiple displays and additional thunderbolt
controllers to deliver even more IO bandwidth and so much more. So that's M1 Pro.
Building on the M1 architecture, M1 Pro takes the amazing performance of Apple
silicon to a whole new level. M1 Pro is unlike anything else in Pro computer. Yet, we
wanted to push the performance of Apple silicon even further.
So today, we're launching not one, but two new chips with the Mac. I am thrilled to
introduce M1 Max. This incredible chip builds on M1 Pro and takes its amazing
capabilities to new heights. M1 Max starts with a much higher bandwidth on chip
fabric and doubles the memory interface once again. This delivers up to 400
gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth. That's twice M1 Pro and six times M1.
This wider memory interface lets the M1 custom package support up to 64 gigabytes
of uniﬁed memory, and -- has a staggering 57 billion transistors, that's 1.7 times M1
Pro and 3.5 times M1. It's the largest chip we've ever built by far.
M1 Max has the same powerful 10-core CPU complex of M1 Pro and doubles the GPU
to a massive 32 cores. Giving M1 Max up to four times faster GPU performance than
M1. And it has an even more capable media engine with up to two times faster video
encoding and two cores accelerators. M1 Max delivers all of this with industry-
leading performance per watt. For Apple silicon, power eﬃciency deﬁnes system
performance. That's why M1 is a breakthrough. When you look at its multi-core CPU
performance versus power curve, it continues to crash the latest 4-core PC laptop
chip. M1 is phenomenal. And when you add an M1 Pro and M1 Max, they deliver
dramatically more performance.
To put that in perspective, here is the latest 8-core PC laptop chip. M1 Pro and M1
Max have higher performance at every power level. At their peak, they deliver 1.7
times the performance of the PC chip in the same power envelope. And at the peak
performance of the PC chip, they deliver the same performance at 70% less power.
That's a big deal.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-18
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Craig FederighiNow, here's the GPU performance versus power curve of M1. And here is the
integrated graphics in that 8-core PC laptop chip. M1 easily outperforms it while
using signiﬁcantly less power. So, when we add an M1 Pro, it's a whole diﬀerent class.
At its peak, it's more than seven times faster. Now, many PC laptops added discrete
GPU for better graphics performance. So, here is a PC laptop with a powerful
discrete GPU. M1 Pro delivers more performance while using 70% less power, but
that's not all. There are compact pro laptops that have higher performing, yet very
power-hungry discrete GPUs that delivers strong performance, but they consume a
ton of power. And on a notebook, when you consume that much power, it means
more heat, noisy fans and less battery life. So, let's look at M1 Max. It delivers
comparable performance while using 40% less power.
Now, let's compare M1 Max to the chip running in the fastest PC laptop we could
ﬁnd. It's a high-end system that is much bigger and heavier than a compact pro
laptop. It delivers even faster graphics performance, but it also consumes a massive
amount of power. Here, M1 Max delivers similar performance while using a 100 watts
less power. This is unheard of and this remarkable eﬃciency means M1 Max
performance is outstanding, plugged in or using the battery. If you look at the
compact pro laptop on battery, its graphics performance drops signiﬁcantly. M1 Max
is up to 2.5 times faster. And if you look at the high-end laptop, when it's on battery,
the drop-oﬀ in graphics performance is even more extreme. M1 Max is over three
times faster. This is one of the huge advantages that Apple silicon brings to our Pro
users. So, that's M1 Max. Scanning up the M1 architecture even further, it's by far the
most capable chip we have ever built. Simply put its the world's most powerful chip
for a Pro Notebook.
Next, here is Craig to tell you how macOS takes full advantage of M1 Pro and M1
Max.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
These new chips are phenomenal. By designing macOS for our own silicon, we're
able to take the experience of using a Mac to a whole new level. Everything is
incredibly fast and responsive. Apps launch instantly. And my personal favorite,
instant wake from sleep.
For these new pro chips, we've made improvements across the system to provide
the best performance on the most demanding apps. For example, using pro app
workload data to help optimize how macOS assigns multi-threaded tasks to the CPU
cores. Advanced power management features intelligently allocate tasks between
the performance and eﬃciency cores, giving you both incredible performance and
incredible battery life. So, you can compile more code or edit more video on a single
charge and macOS is designed to take advantage of the uniﬁed memory
architecture in these new chips.
So, Pro apps can manipulate huge images or video streams, and move them
between the CPU and GPU with zero copies for breath-taking performance.

Philip Loschbetter performance. Thanks to Core ML optimizations, machine learning models
perform on average over three times faster compared with the fastest Core i9
MacBook Pro, with some M1 models performing over 20 times faster. And when it
comes to security, M1, M1 Pro and M1 Max are a major leap forward with industry-
leading protections like hardware-veriﬁed secure boot, runtime anti-exploitation
technologies and fast in-line encryption for all of your ﬁles.
Next, let's talk about apps. With Apple silicon users get way more of them and they
perform better than ever. Every app made by Apple is optimized for and runs
natively on Apple silicon. We also have Rosetta 2, so Intel based apps even pro apps
with plugins simply run without missing a beat and even running under Rosetta
applications invoking macOS technologies like Metal get a big speed boost from
our optimizations for Apple silicon. And you can run iPhone and iPad apps on Mac,
opening a huge new universe of possibilities to unlock the full power and
performance of these chips. Apps can be recompiled to run natively as universal. All
of our pro apps are universal. And today, we're launching some exciting updates
with new features and even faster performance on M1 Pro and M1 Max.
With Logic Pro, for the ﬁrst time musicians will be able to create massive spatial
audio mixes on a notebook. In Final Cut Pro, video analysis for the new object
tracking feature is up to 5x faster. And then compressor, ProRes video transcode is a
remarkable 10x faster, of course, this isn't just about Apple. Developers are moving
fast and there are now over 10,000 universal apps and plug-ins available, including
Lightroom Classic, Cinema 4D, Capture One, Sketch, and many more. We gave some
developers an early look and they were blown away by what they could do with M1
Pro and M1 Max. Let's hear from a few of them.

game, you're constantly iterated, you iterate again and again and again and again.
The increased performance of these new pro chips mean you can make more
complex scenes, bigger games, better games, all in your laptop.
Launching Premiere Pro feels super snappy. Auto-captions what used to be fast is
now like magic, like, it's super, super, super fast. We're seeing improvements every
step of the way, like scene edit detection and that's up to 5x faster now. Your
creativity can be limitless. You can be underwater, you can transition into outer space
into the redwoods. Creators can just get back to being creative.
There's never been a GPU with 64 gigs ever in a notebook. And it changes our entire

M1 Pro and M1 Max represent a huge leap forward in silicon for pro systems. And our
teams have been hard at work designing a brand new MacBook Pro that can take full
advantage of that incredible performance and capability and the result is something
truly special.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
This is the all-new completely redesigned MacBook Pro and it comes in two sizes, a
16-inch model and for the ﬁrst time a compact yet immensely powerful 14-inch
model, which shares the same remarkable features and capabilities. The new
MacBook Pro is a combination of groundbreaking performance with amazing battery
life, extraordinary display quality, and advanced connectivity. This is a Pro Notebook
that simply has no equal. It was designed with an intense focus on performance and
utility. The all new aluminum enclosure optimizes internal space for more
performance of features, and it is precisely machine around an advanced thermal
system. It can move 50% more air even at lower fans speeds. This thermal design
enables MacBook Pro to deliver phenomenal sustained performance, while
operating quietly. And because of the eﬃciency of Apple silicon, the fans never even
have to turn on for most of the tasks you do every day. And it's all in a design that is
just 16.8 millimeters thin and 4.7 pounds on the 16-inch model, and just 15.5
millimeters thin and 3.5 pounds on the 14-inch model. Now, this all new design is just
the beginning of the MacBook Pro story. To tell you more, here's Shruti.
The new MacBook Pro has been re-imagined in every way. Let's start with the
keyboard. Users value the full height function row on the standalone magic
keyboard, and we've brought it to the MacBook Pro. The physical keys replace the
touch bar, bringing back the familiar tactile feel of mechanical keys that pro users
love. The keyboard is set in a double anodized black well that elegantly highlights
the backlit cliﬀs on the keys, and it's complemented by our expansive industry-
leading Force Touch trackpad that's perfect for pro applications.
Now, let's talk about connectivity. Having a wide range of ports can make life a lot
easier for pros. So, I'm excited to share that we're adding ports to the new Macbook
Pro. On one side, there's an HDMI port for conveniently connecting to displays and
TVs, a Thunderbolt 4-port which connects to high-speed peripherals and an SD cardFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-18

advanced support for high-impedance headphones. And there are two more
Thunderbolt 4 ports for a total of three in the system. And yes, MagSafe is coming
back to the MacBook Pro. MagSafe 3 has a new design that supports more power
into the system. And you can still charge via the Thunderbolt ports.
Display support is better than ever as well. With M1 Pro you can connect up to 2 Pro
Display XDRs. And with M1 Max, you can connect up to 3 Pro display XDRs and a 4K
TV, all at the same time. That's over 75 million pixels of screen real estate and you still
have ports available to connect a high-ﬁdelity headphones and camera media, all
without a single adapter. This is the most advanced connectivity ever on a Mac
notebook. The new MacBook Pro also has a breathtaking display. To tell you more,
here's Kate.
{BIO 20311790 <GO>}
On the new MacBook Pro, we're taking the stunning retina display to an entirely new
level. We started by bringing the sides of the enclosure closer to the active area of
the display resulting in a 24% thinner border. We also expanded the display up and
around the camera making the top border 60% thinner, giving you even more
screen real estate. And macOS takes full advantage of this extra space by raising the
menu bar up and out of the way, automatically wrapping it around the camera to
give you more room for your content. And it looks great in dark mode, which our pro
users love. All together, it's a fantastic user experience.
With this new design, the displays are now larger. The 16 inch model has a 16.2 inch
display in nearly the same size enclosure. And along with a higher pixel density, it
has 1.8 million more pixels than before for a total of 7.7 million. That's the most ever
in a Mac Notebook. The 14 inch model has an expansive 14.2 inch active area, and a
total of 5.9 million pixels. That's even more pixels than the previous generation 16
inch MacBook Pro.
Next, we're super excited to bring ProMotion technology to the Mac, with refresh
rates up to a 120 hertz. ProMotion automatically adapts to the motion of your
content. So when your content is static, the refresh rate dynamically steps down to
preserve battery life. And it steps up to make tasks like scrolling through web pages
super ﬂuid and video editors can still choose a standard refresh rate when they need
to lock one in. The display now supports 1 billion colors for ultra smooth gradients.
And for the ﬁrst time, it's a liquid Retina XDR display.
So users can create, edit and review HDR content with exceptional precision. It was
inspired by the capability of the pro display XDR, and it features the mini LED
technology, used in iPad Pro which we've built into the impossibly thin display
enclosure of the new MacBook Pro. We did this by integrating the custom design,
mini-LED backlight, optical ﬁlms and diﬀusers and a cutting edge LCD panel into the
display housing and the display is uncompromising in its performance.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-18

controlled local dimming zones. This enables up to an astonishing 1,000 nits of
sustained, full-screen brightness. 1,600 nits of peak brightness and a staggering 1
million to 1 contrast ratio. This is extreme dynamic range, bringing HDR content to
life with unbelievable detail and shadows, brilliant specular highlights even more
vibrant colors and deeper blacks than ever before. This new display is going to be
amazing, whether you're adding ﬁnal touches to an image or just kicking back and
watching a show in HDR. This is hands-down the world's best notebook display.
To tell you about our new camera and audio system, here's Trevor.
Our users are relying on the Mac more than ever to stay connected. So we've
doubled the resolution of the camera to 1080P and used the lens with a wider
aperture that lets in more light. Together with a larger image sensor that has more
eﬃcient pixels, the camera delivers 2x better low-light performance. The camera
system also uses the ISP and neural engine for computational video, which enhances
video quality. So you get sharper images and more natural-looking skin tones. With
all these advancements, this is by far the best camera system ever in a Mac
Notebook.
Now, let's talk about the audio experience. First, we made our industry-leading
studio quality mics even better with an up to 60% lower noise ﬂoor, which means
you get crystal clear recordings that capture the subtlest sounds. Next, the new 16-
inch pro has an even better six speaker sound system that features two tweeters and
four force cancelling woofers. The tweeters are nearly 2x larger, purifying the sound
on mids and highs for a clear sound stage.
The woofer diaphragms are also larger and have an increased range of motion. So
they can now displace twice as much air. This allows them to deliver 80% more bass.
It also means, they go half an octave deeper, revealing a range of notes you
previously couldn't hear. And we've brought this sensational six speaker sound
system to the 14-inch pro as well. The new sound system also supports spatial audio,
which creates a sophisticated, three-dimensional sound stage. So when you're
listening to music or watching a movie with Dolby Atmos, you get a theater like
experience with studio-quality mics that have an even higher signal-to-noise ratio
and a spectacular six speaker sound system with spatial audio, there's never been an
audio system this good in a notebook. We can't wait for you to hear it. Back to you
Shruti.
Let's talk performance. The new MacBook Pro pushes the limits of what a notebook
can do. The 16 inch model with M1 Pro and M1 Max has up to 2x faster CPU
performance than the previous generation with the Core I9. This is a tremendous
performance boost for compute heavy tasks, like, compiling a project in Xcode. And
when it comes to graphics, M1 Pro is up to 2.5x faster than the prior 16 inch model
with the fastest GPU and M1 Max is up to 4x faster. This boost is dramatic for graphicsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-18

Page 13 of 15intensive tasks, like, rendering scenes in Cinema 4D. And when it comes to machine-
learning, you'll get up to 5x faster performance. So things like selecting the subjects
within images in photoshop are faster than ever.
Now, let's look at the 14 inch model, which is also conﬁgurable with M1 Max, our
most powerful chip. Compared to the 13 inch model with a Core i7, the 14 inch Pro
has up to 3.7x faster CPU performance. For graphics, M1 Pro delivers up to 9x faster
performance and M1 Max is up to an astonishing 13x faster and ML tasks are up to 11x
faster. So whether you're stitching a massive panorama in Lightroom Classic or
rendering a complex scene with Redshift, the 14 inch MacBook Pro absolutely
crushes it and it goes even further. The uniﬁed memory architecture enables
workﬂows that were previously unimaginable on a notebook, even the latest Pro PC
laptops top out at 16 gigs of video memory. MacBook Pro has up to 64 gigabytes of
uniﬁed memory, so apps have dramatically more memory for the most demanding
graphics tasks. No other notebook even comes close.
So this means that on MacBook Pro, 3D artists can now easily work with extreme
geometry and textures and seems that the latest Pro PC laptops can't even run. And
with the enhanced media engine on M1 Max, you can edit up to 30 streams of 4K
ProRes video in Final Cut Pro or up to seven streams of 8K ProRes. That's more
streams than on a 28 core MacPro with Afterburner. And video editors can now color
grade in HDR on 8K ProRes 4x4 video on battery when they're miles away from the
edit bay.
Finally, storage is getting even faster. The Superfast SSDs deliver up to a jaw-
dropping 7.4 gigabytes per second of read speeds more than 2x faster than the prior
gen SSDs. These are by far the most powerful Mac Notebooks ever. The magic of M1
Pro and M1 Max is that even though they're extremely powerful, they're also
remarkably power-eﬃcient. So pro users beneﬁt from super fast performance,
whether they're plugged in or not and they beneﬁt from extraordinary battery life, so
they'll get so much more done on a single charge.
Photographers, who go from capture to publish on the go will get up to 2x longer
battery life Lightroom Classic when editing images. And developers working in
Xcode will be able to compile 4x as much code. And battery life is unbelievable for
everyday tasks, like watching your favorite movies.
The 14 inch model delivers up to 17 hours of video playback, which is seven
additional hours, and the 16 inch model gets up to 21 hours of video playback, which
is 10 additional hours and the longest battery life ever on a Mac notebook. And the
new MacBook Pro now supports fast charge for the very ﬁrst time on Mac, so it can
charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes. And when it comes to the environment, the
new Macbook Pro raises the bar yet again. The enclosure is made with 100%
recycled aluminum, which brings us a step closer to our goal of using only recyclable
and renewable materials. And it is free of numerous harmful substances,
manufactured using even more renewable energy and meets Apple's high standards
for energy eﬃciency. The new Macbook Pro is simply extraordinary. It has a
combination of phenomenal performance, incredible battery life, andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-18

So that's the new MacBook Pro. We couldn't be more excited about what this
groundbreaking system can do. It allows Pros to unleash their creativity in ways that
were previously unimaginable and it is for anyone who simply wants the world's best
notebook. When you compare the 14 inch model to the previous high-end 13 inch
MacBook Pro, you get a giant leap in performance, up to seven more hours of
battery life, a larger display with XDR, an advanced camera, high fatality audio and
more ports, all for $1,999. And when you compare the new 16-inch Pro to the previous
model, you also get a massive boost in performance and capabilities for $2,499.
Both models are available in silver and space gray. You can order it today and it will
be available next week.
Today, we've completely redeﬁned high-performance Apple silicon with M1 Pro and
M1 Max. They are by far the most powerful and capable chips we've ever created and
there's never been anything like them. Together with M1, they form an incredible
family of chips that leads the industry in performance and power eﬃciency. The new
MacBook Pro joins the 13-inch Pro with M1 to create the strongest line-up of pro
notebooks we've ever oﬀered. And with this introduction, we've taken another huge
step forward in the Max transition to Apple silicon. Now back to Tim.

What a huge day for the Mac and our Pro users. These are the most powerful Mac
Notebooks we've ever built. And the best example yet of the extraordinary
performance and capabilities we can deliver when we combine our most advanced
Apple silicon with the power of macOS.
Today, we focused on two areas, very dear to us, music and the mac and the creative
spirit fueled by each of them. At Apple, creativity is so incredibly important to who
we are and what we do, designing products that empower users as well as enable
them to be inspired by the creativity of others. It helps drive our teams to continue
pushing things forward to create products and experiences that enrich people's
lives.
I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone here at Apple for their unbelievable
eﬀort this year and to everyone watching, thank you for joining us today. Please take
care, stay safe and have a great day.
