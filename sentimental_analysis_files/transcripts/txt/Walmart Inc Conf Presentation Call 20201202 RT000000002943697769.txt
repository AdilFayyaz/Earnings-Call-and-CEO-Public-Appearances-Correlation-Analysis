Hi everyone. This is Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley's Hardline, Broadline and Food
Retail Analyst. It is my distinct pleasure to welcome Walmart represented by Doug
McMillon, President and CEO to this virtual ﬁreside chat and to our virtual
conference. I think this maybe Doug's ﬁrst time attending. So, thank you very much.
We're grateful. I going to read a quick disclaimer and then we'll start into the
ﬁreside. Please be aware, there is a side-by-side Q&A session or webcast. You can
submit questions, which I have up on my screen. And I'm happy to bring them into
the discussion.
First, for the disclaimer for important disclosures, please see the Morgan Stanley
research disclosure web site at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. If you
have any questions, please reach out to your Morgan Stanley sales representative.

(Question And Answer)
With that, we will begin. Doug, I'm going to ask, I don't know if it's the elephant-in-
the-room question of the day, but I guess we were fortunate that there was some
news about Walmart Plus this morning. Wanted to ask about the change in the free
shipping threshold from $35. I won't load up the question I'll just leave it open-
ended to talk about why the change? And why now?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Thanks, Simeon. Appreciate you inviting us to attend. We were looking for ways to
reduce friction as we are all the time. And as we launch Walmart Plus, we heard loud
and clear from customers that had purchased a Walmart Plus Membership that theyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

A - Doug McMillondidn't expect to have a minimum for e-commerce orders and so we were pleased as
we got through the month of November that we had the outbound shipping in such
a place that we felt comfortable, we could remove it and still deliver with speed
between now and Christmas. So we've got the capacity to do it, because we hired so
many people to work in our e-commerce fulﬁllment centers in the last few months
and so we thought the timing was good and we're excited to add that additional
beneﬁt to Walmart Plus.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Great, thanks for that. So this is a two-part question if you think about the evolution
through and I guess during this pandemic which still not done, what could be have
Walmart done better or had in place either before the pandemic or during the
pandemic?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
There are two things that come to mind are inventory levels and capacity for pickup
and delivery orders through our stores. We've been building capacity for pickup and
delivery as you know for years, but the surge that happened here was beyond what
we were prepared for. The team did a nice job playing catch-up. We still need to
build even more capacity and we're working on that. But they innovated with our
pick algorithms and they hired a bunch of people. The last number we shared
publicly is year-to-date, we've had hired an additional 500,000 people and most of
them are in the U.S., and a lot of them are picking orders inside of our stores.
And the other thing that we would do diﬀerently as we would have built up
inventory. We run a really lean inventory position as we try to drive inventory returns
and in stock at the beginning of endemic was in good shape, but we weren't able to
sustain in-stock levels and that not only harmed our store experience in the early
stages of the pandemic, but it harmed our ability to do pickup and delivery. We've
improved as we've gone through the year, there were times when you couldn't ﬁnd
an adult bike, there were times where are the beef counter was really pressured, we
obviously saw that in sanitizers and paper goods and some other grocery categories.
As we sit here today, that's in much better shape. We have some pressure based on
what's happening with case counts in local towns and states where we are seeing
sanitizers and paper goods under pressure, but beyond that, we're in a much better
position than we were. As we released results last quarter, you saw that our inventory
levels are back up.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Can I ask a follow-up on that? It sounds like, the reason for the light inventory is just,
Walmart's been a well-oiled eﬃcient machine with regard to turns and that makes
sense. Does your philosophy around the amount of inventory to hold does that
change or no? I mean, you just can't really plan for these type of situations and you
just have to go with them?

Page 3 of 16Q - Simeon Gutman
A - Doug McMillon
Q - Simeon Gutman
A - Doug McMillonI don't think our philosophy changes. I think on the other side of pandemic, we'll be
right back to managing in stock and turns at the same time.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
So I'd like to maybe jump a little bit further into what I was going to ask because
there's been some market share discussions in the past couple of quarters that you
may have lost some ground and a couple of categories maybe in grocery, maybe in
some other hardline categories. Can you talk about that? I think maybe a ties into
inventory. I know we've discussed with you publicly about store hours. Can you talk
about share loss? Why hasn't Walmart, I guess, kept pace? I mean you're clearly
gaining share relative to, let's say, consumer spending, but in certain categories over
the last couple of quarters?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes, it was down to food and consumables. Our general merchandise business has
been really strong in absolute terms and in share terms which we feel great about,
and it's nice to have so many GM categories where we're growing share. But food
and consumable out of stocks were big issue, our store, our limitations are another
one. But, I also think customers were just wanting to stay safe, so they were looking
for stores that were closer, stores that were smaller, stores that might not have as
much traﬃc and kind of avoiding people. And when we ran out of stocks in the early
phase, they had no choice, but to go try and ﬁnd it somewhere else. So, all that
contributed to what happened with share. I'm not really bothered by it, I don't think
that's something that's a long-term issue and I think they understand what
happened, in absolute terms, it's been a really strong year ﬁnancially. And so I think
that speaks for itself.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yes, and look realizing, right. It's hard to look into the crystal ball for next year. But as
you think about that, I guess does it help you cushion or let it at least, think about
laughing some of the surge that occurred, the fact that you should be better in-stock
in certain categories or some of these categories that you didn't have full inventory
position and maybe those were one time shift from goods from services that you
may not be able to sort of recapture in 2021?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. We've never left a year like this, so we won't be able to predict it perfectly. But I
do think that improving in stock levels will be one of the things that will help us that
better than we would have otherwise, it'll be across the box, it won't just be in food
and consumables, but we had a lot of general merchandise categories that were
sold out. If you had asked me to describe a scenario before the pandemic started
where we would have been sold out of puzzles and fabric. I don't think I could have
come up with one, I mean it's just such an unusual situation.
So no doubt we'll have weird comparisons as we go through next year, but the
underlying strength of the business and the positioning of the business, we feel
good about and pickup and delivery are going to continue to grow word moreFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Q - Simeon Gutman
A - Doug McMillonadvanced forms of delivery, like Walmart-in-home will grow in time. And so we're
positioned well and as in-stock gets better it will help not only store experience, but
will help those newer parts of our business, too.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Thanks for that. So one of the key things that we think about I think is a key investor
debate is a customer base and look Walmart's largest retailer in the U.S. both
physically and then if you combine digital presence, your core customer, if you look
at the demographic tends to spend almost all of their disposable income and we
think Walmart gets a large share of that. And therefore, some of the incremental
revenue growth that Walmart has experienced over the last several years both in-
store and digital seems to be coming from new customers since you're growing,
taking market share. So can you talk about how the customer base is expanding? Is
this a key success factor for you? And then in any evidence that you can point to of
how that customer base is expanding?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We have seen expansion so much of if you just focus on the U.S. just remind
everybody, we operate in multiple markets. But if I just focus on the U.S., a lot of
America shops at Walmart and know I'm still kind of blown away times. I was just
recently looking at what percentage of U.S., households were physically inside of a
Walmart store in the last month or the last 90 days and that's still a really high
number and they're using pickup and delivery, but just actually come into the store
it's pretty incredible. So a lot of existing customers, so growing share of wallets,
obviously a priority and we've seen that happen not just this year, but beyond this
year, it's great to have the general merchandise shared growth that we've had during
the course of this year. But we're also attracting new customers and we saw that
really start to happen when we launched pickup and delivery and started to scale it.
You may remember we've shared with you before that when people rate our stakes.
They actually rate us is having a higher quality stake when they use pickup and
delivery than they did when they came in the store. When they came in the store,
they had to do work. They experienced our store environment. They went to the
checkouts. When they just did pick up a delivery, it was more pure delight and so
everything tasted better. I mean, it's just a reality that people's perception changed.
And so I think that, the more aﬄuent customers certainly people that are really
focused on time are taking advantage of some of these newer things that were
doing and that's going to enable us to continue to expand in terms of new
customers along with just our pure e-commerce business.
And those customers may have a slightly higher amount spend from a discretionary
point of view, but it is a little just wrap up by saying it's a little challenging when you
think about the Walmart customer to characterize us. Anyway, that's diﬀerent than
how you would characterize America. Our bell curve is it relates to income level, our
bell curves as it relates to other or distributions as it relates to other characteristics,
they pretty much match the United States. So we've got a lot of wealthy customers
just as we have other customers that are so focused on their budgets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Great. And related to that, there was a point consistently that Walmart was making
acquisitions especially brands adding to the e-commerce platform, some of which
have been sold, some of which were still part of the platform. Was the strategy there
to add assortment or was it more to add these new customers and I'm sure it's a
combination of both, but I'm curious where the sort of the priority there was?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
The priority was to add assortment and the acquisitions that we made that were
speciﬁcally aimed at that, we're more successful than some of the others. We were
trying a number of diﬀerent things and learning from them and not all of them
worked, but the assortment acquisitions like in shoes with shoes.com, hey needle for
home those really worked. So we picked up a team. We picked up some volume,
which meant the suppliers cared more about us. We picked up brands that we didn't
otherwise have. And overtime, since those acquisitions, we've migrated the teams
and the assortment and the brand's over to walmart.com and strengthen that brand,
which is what we were trying to do.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Great. I have some questions in the webcast. I see them, I just want to let the
audience know, they'll get asked. I'm just going to continue because I think this is a
good transition. I want to start transitioning into e-commerce. And I wanted to ask
Doug, if you can talk about the third party and ﬁrst-party marketplace and a little bit
of a chronology? Because I covered the business at a time in which Walmart was
more committed or at least thought maybe making a bigger bet on the 1P business.
Now, it's evolved to a large event on the 3P business. So curious about the thought
process there the transition? And then how much do you think especially during the
pandemic or in general, do you think your e-commerce growth has been held back
by not having a full or as big of a -- big three third-party marketplace as some of your
competitors?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes, well to act third-party sellers, you need volume and to get volume, you've got to
build a one ﬁrst-party business. So I think sequentially, we did a number of things in
parallel, but if you look at this aspect, it was sequential to say let's go build a ﬁrst-
party business. And as that volume grows and that traﬃc grows, which really
accelerated after we bought jet, then the third-party sellers are going to want to
come. And the team, a few years ago started building out some very basic
marketplace capabilities for sellers, nothing fancy and not a lot of volume, but they
came anyway and they really wanted to have a way to sell the people that was
beyond what they were currently doing. They don't want to be married to just one
platform. They want to have diversiﬁcation.
So there's been a lot of demand from sellers. We curate more than some other
people do people do. We qualify sellers. We care about that quality. We care about
the shipment time. We care about the customer experience. And so, we've metered
out kind of the expansion of that marketplace based on that and some other things.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Page 6 of 16Q - Simeon Gutman
A - Doug McMillon
Q - Simeon Gutman
A - Doug McMillonAnd now, we're to a point where we've got scale in ﬁrst party. We've got some
capacity from a fulﬁllment point of view that enabled us to create a fulﬁllment service
for marketplace sellers, which helps them and helps the customer experience
improve, because more often, we're able to put things in one box and more
frequently, we're able to ship it fast.
So, now, we're getting to a point where this marketplace has really become big and
is a good customer experience and getting better, and we have a lot of runway as it
relates to not only fulﬁllment services, but other types of marketplace seller tools,
because we're so far from being excellent at this yet. So we look at that as headroom
as expansion space and are excited about it. And then this year accelerated all that.
Last quarter, we shared that our marketplace grew triple digits and that's on our
relatively small number in Walmart terms, but not a small number in absolute terms.
So it's really starting to become a big business. So we'll keep adding ﬁrst-party
brands, we'll keep adding some ﬁrst-party assortment and in parallel will build out
the marketplace including the services to support it, which will help customers be
able to ﬁnd what they're looking for more often at Walmart.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Is there a timeframe in which certain capabilities still need to be added? Whether it's
digital or supply chain. So that you can say, hey, we are putting our best foot forward
with our third party or is it just is it an evolution? And we've heard in the past around
the assortment that, hey, we want to get bigger and there's a certain, the 80/20 rule.
Certain 1 million SKUs can capture a certain portion of sales is your philosophy
around that changing? Is it more important to make sure that you're fully assorted on
a longer tail of merchandise?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes, I think it's more of an evolution to answer your ﬁrst question. It will just keep
getting better all the time and capacity will continue to expand from a supply chain
point of view. Now the 80/20 rule in life still applies to an extent, but it's an 80/20
rule against a much larger population. So, we do want to sell more than what centers
force and we can build a really big torso and tail business from a 1P and 3P point of
view, which will be helpful with margins and give us room to make sure we can
deliver value while delivering for shareholders at the same time.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Is there any update, and this is from the audience, is there any update on next day
SKU availability? I think, at launch, it was 220,000 or the extent of the progress with
third-party merchants broadly within e-commerce, which I think you partially
answered.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes, I think, I can't remember if we recently shared the ﬁrst answer, but both continue
to grow. It's important that we add to the number of items that we're doing same
day and next day. I think, maybe the kind of part that was missed in that question, is
the signiﬁcance of learning how to pick general merchandise SKUs in a supercenter.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Q - Simeon Gutman
A - Doug McMillon
Q - Simeon GutmanSo, we've got about a 120,000 items in the supercenter. And for a long time we were
just picking food and consumables because we could pick it accurately. It was harder
to pick toys and apparel and other things, but we've learned how to do that in a way
that's really satisfying to customers. So in the last 12 to 24 months, that's really
changed. So that capacity in those GM items including an ability to do pharmacy
delivery and pharmacy curbside have all ﬁt together in a way that we've been able to
serve more customers eﬀectively.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Great. I'm going to transition a bit too, I guess I called a proﬁtable growth. So some
of the ﬁnancial framework that has guided Walmart over the past few years. You've
been delivering against it, which is this balancing of growth and margins following
the big investment what was in 2015, I think it was. Can you share the debates that
you still or you currently have regarding this whether or not to invest faster or more
or letting more ﬂow to the bottom line?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes, it is important to manage earnings as we grow the top line, of course and I think
you characterized it well, it is just a large set of choices, a lot of variables that we can
play with to try and deliver the combination of top and bottom line and return that
we ultimately want to deliver. What's changed this year is because of the e-
commerce growth we've been able to reduce losses in the e-commerce area
through the combination of apparel and home ﬁrst-party really growing and the
contribution proﬁt of apparel and home being positive and improving combined
with the marketplace growth, which helps with proﬁtability.
And then thirdly the leverage of ﬁxed cost that you get when sales grow this much.
So that's like oxygen pouring into the room that gives us even more ﬂexibility as we
look ahead to decide what we want to go do next and what the pace should be. And
sometimes the constraint is human bandwidth do we have all the right people in the
right jobs to go get it done. Financial investments can also be a gating factor as we
try to manage earnings, I think as most folks would probably realize Walmart thinks
long-term, we're trying to position this company for the next generation of retail. So,
if we feel like that we should be investing more to try and accelerate that positioning,
will do it and we've demonstrated that over time. But I think we've also
demonstrated that as we make those investments, we can deliver, will communicate
as we go and if you're in Walmart stock for a longer-term horizon, you'll deﬁnitely be
rewarded from that.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And I asked the regarding this proﬁtable growth. When we were in the beginning
months or so of the pandemic and it looked like, the cost of operating was going up
at least temporarily. There are a lot of, I guess visions of how retailed margins could
evolve. And even a post-COVID world. Curious about how you thinking about if that
thought process has evolved, our retailers, and I say broadly obviously speaking to
the land of Walmart, should be more proﬁtable post this episode and balancing all
the diﬀerent forms of fulﬁllment which seemed somewhat more eﬃcient versus labor
costs and operating stores and curious, I know you haven't commented about this,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 16A - Doug McMillon
Q - Simeon Gutmanbut has it thinking sort of evolved throughout the pandemic and what the future of
sort of retail proﬁt looks like?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. How precisely I can answer it. Let me try to describe components and then we'll
ﬁgure out ﬁgure out what that adds up to. I think, the headline I would start with is
the business model of Walmart is changing, we drive the top line diﬀerently and we
drive the bottom line diﬀerently. We start to see the company make money in
advertising income, we're building a fulﬁllment services business, ﬁnancial services
are an opportunity for us, health and wellness is an opportunity for us. I think, the
composition if you just look at a bar chart of revenue and proﬁt of Walmart will look
diﬀerent in ﬁve years time than it looks diﬀerent now than it did ﬁve years ago.
Walmart Plus membership income and other things will come together to create that
diversiﬁed view of proﬁt and revenue in GMB, so that is interesting.
So now, if you've got these other income streams building, how much of those do
you ﬂow through to investors? How much of it do you reinvest to make sure the
company's position for the future? Those are the kinds of choices we're making and
will continue to make. I do think, we'll see wage inﬂation continue and we want to
pay our people more. I mean, I don't think any of you would argue with us that our
frontline associates deserved to be rewarded and have delivered during the course
of this year and that's really important to us. And they have been courageous and
they have shown up and stepped up every day during this pandemic in this country
and in others. So some level of wage investment. Although, productivity activity
through structure change in automation is also in this equation. So when you net it
all out the way that we feel about it is we're kind of in control of that choice like we
can decide how much we ﬂow to the bottom line with this set of choices and how
much we invest position for the future.
And I don't think it should be in Walmart's, it shouldn't be our goal to maximize
proﬁtability in the next two years or the next three years. Our goal should be to have
a sustainable model that delivers a lot of cash over time as we position the company
for the next generation of retail and that's what we're trying to do. So not every
retailer is going to be in that position, but the way we feel about it is we'll get to
decide what that proﬁtability looks like. If it is short-term or long-term.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yes. And related to that, and this is also conceptual, Doug, is that Walmart's
productivity right sales are growing and you really haven't changed the asset base,
right, the number of stores principally the Supercenter, the number of those aren't
changing. So you're sweating in theory the assets more than you have in the past.
You are building supply chain infrastructure to support this added demand, and I
guess at some point, that gets optimized, which I think we talked about in an earlier
meeting today, and that gets optimized. So, it would seem that at some point there
could be some upward pressure on the margin line as that continues to occur. And
let's say, if large companies, large retailers would scale continue to sort of gain share.
Curious, how you think about that. Obviously, tying into your earlier response around
balancing growth and returns.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

A - Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
And I agree with what you said conceptually. I think between here and there, we've
got work to do to automate some of the things what we do. There are investments to
be made in robotics there at store level, near stores, depending on where centroid
thinking drives us to place up many fulﬁllment center for example.
In automation within our distribution centers and our fulﬁllment centers, so things
are happening in parallel, you've got an evolving business model that makes money
in diﬀerent ways. You're running the core business, and innovating within that, and
you're investing so that the economics continue to improve overtime. So this
mutually reinforcing ecosystem that we're building this connected ﬂywheel, I think is
a more attractive business model as it relates to earnings and return. But we haven't
built it all out yet. And we kind of had a timeline and then the pandemic happens
and something's really gets accelerated, so now is an interesting moment in time to
think about what kind of pace do you want to keep going forward and as you would
guess that's what we're talking about.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Open-ended question on fulﬁllment. The way I wrote mine out is, what is the future
of fulﬁllment? We have two from the webcast that are tied into this. Doug, you
mentioned, you're going to be building fulﬁllment business. Will this include
building a logistics network that delivers all the way to the home? Another question
is part of this is Walmart U.S. testing micro fulﬁllment centers are dark stores for the
grocery business. I want to put all of this in there. I wrote many DC's, (inaudible) to
me last miles of very interesting question because your biggest e-tail competitor has
their last mile network. It seems like, you're going towards that, but you're also
partnered with third-party. So realize this is an evolving question based on the
volume that you do, but where does the fulﬁllment picture look like and call it ﬁve
years?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. I do think it'll be hybrid for us as it relates to the last mile like we do with our
private ﬂeet today. There'll be some services that we want to provide and Walmart
homes and example we're having an associate involved is going to be important and
necessary to get the experience that we want. But to scale fast and to have excessive
bandwidth when you need it, I think having third-party relationships will also be
helpful.
And there'll be a degree of automation that will happen back in our big centers and
in some markets closer to customers that will help enable inventory management
and speed in a way that works in a more cost eﬀective way than what we've got now.
I think all those pieces are coming together and you can see them. It's going to be
exciting to see how technology autonomous vehicles come to mind, because we're
talking about last mile, but it'll be computer vision. Obviously, we're putting AI to
work more often within our business than we were before, the tech modernization
eﬀorts that we talked about back in February have continued we're a little ahead ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

A - Doug McMillonplan as it relates to the multi-year plan we shared with you in February those critical
enablers are moving along, so that some of the stuﬀ above the surface can happen.
It doesn't mean that we had to wait for it all like I think what John and the team have
done with drones has been fun, and we've got several experiments and several
partners happening right now when we're learning and all those things are going to
be possible and work economically, whether it's a basket being delivered all the way
into your refrigerator or a set of boxes being dropped at your doorstep or a drone
bringing in each or a couple of each has to you fast. I think, all those things are going
to happen and it's not going to be a long time from now.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Just press on that, I guess is -- it could be a good thing. Let's say you don't have your
own last mile, your own internalized last mile ﬂeet at this point. But you're mixing in a
lot of things, you're testing a lot of things you mentioned drone and autonomous. I
mean is this a good thing? You're sort of taking maybe as a pay or steady-as-she-
goes type of approach. I don't know if that's the way to look at it or you say, look I'd
rather have a last mile logistics, in place today so I can deliver even -- higher level of
service?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I don't know. I don't know which one would have been better. If we try to do it all on
our own, we would have made mistakes and over-invested in some places. I'm sure
by going fast and scaling and we have scaled a lot of deliveries are happening now
via third-party. We know what the demand looks like, our limit on demand has been
more related to in-stock levels and picking capacity through the supercenters than
the customer. So we know what demand looks like now and we can work on
optimizing it and ﬁgure out which components we want to own and which ones we
don't want to own. And we like partnering with people. We do some things on our
own, obviously. I mentioned, our private ﬂeet as a great example, but we also work
with common carriers and on last-mile, I think we'll be working with a number of
people and have diﬀerent ways to go about solving a problem for the customer and
that feels smart to me. Can't perfectly predict the future, but you can position
yourself to react to it.

Going go back to our Walmart Plus, we have a question from the audience and I
have one as well and I think I'll just wrap them into one. Look there's Walmart Plus
ever looked like and I'll say it Amazon Prime. I think, there's been a lot written given
the construct of what Walmart Plus is that look Walmart is sort of staying in its lane
right now and being prudent, right? Leveraging your asset base and leveraging the
strengths and grocery and not playing, out of its territory yet. But given your upscale
and your capabilities, it would seem like you would have a pretty viable solution to
what's out there or competitive solution to what's out there in the market what I so?
It's about like my long-winded question and open it up?

A - Doug McMillonYes, it's -- I supposed never a good thing to do to copy someone else's a strategy.
You've got to use your own assets. Your own capabilities. Great strategy is driven by
what you have and who you are and what you're capable of doing and we've tried to
launch Walmart Plus leveraging things that are related to Walmart. Obviously people
want delivery from supercenters and this membership lets them by unlimited
deliveries in bulk. The scan-and-go feature I think is going to be super interesting to
watch particularly as we get through holiday and started to teach more customers
what that's like, we've had scan-and-go at Sam's for a longer period of time and
members love it. It's a great experience and I think that will be an increasingly
important feature to customers as we try to remove all the friction related to the store
experience.
And then we own fuel stations and we have relationships with fuel providers that
have enabled us to have a nice amount of coverage for the fuel discount. So, I think
those three things make sense. Will add other things over time that broaden the
appeal of Walmart Plus. Our goal is not to in the ﬁrst year ﬁgure out how many
Walmart Plus memberships we can sell. For one reason, we don't have the capacity
that we would like to have through the stores for pick and delivery of the entire
supercenter assortment and we don't want to let anybody down. So, the one of the
worst things we could do would be to sell a bunch of Walmart Plus memberships
and then have them be dissatisﬁed because they can't get fast delivery times or
slots.
So we'll be investing in that capacity, adding features to walmart.com to expand its
appeal at a pace that enables that NPS score to stay high. So I realized we're going
to face some pressure to share numbers into the scale this really quick. This is not a
Disney Plus or Netﬂix membership for streaming, it requires capacity, it requires
humans, this is a diﬀerent product, but it'll be a Walmart product. And I think it'll be
important over time, it'll be an important piece of the puzzle. But, we'll still be EDLP
on the shelf or still have all these other things that make Walmart, Walmart.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yes, I think that's great answer and it's reasonable. I mean, I will say I might be one of
those who would want to hear some of the membership statistics, but in reality,
right? We don't hear what your Sam's Club membership looks like. So and I don't
think we're going to -- I guess it doesn't seem important at this stage, but I guess the
question I would ask then is Walmart Plus, basically if you're selling or you're getting
memberships from an existing customer, or are you are you happy with the level of
newness that's bringing and is it changing the complexion of the basket size with the
initial members?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes, it is as you would guess a combination of existing customers and new
customers. I think it's important to realize, Simeon that, online grocery when we
initially launched it attracted a lot of new customers. So, when we say new today, is it
somebody that's been doing business with us for a year or ten years. We have a lot
of people that in recent times have joined us because of the ability to pick andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

A - Doug McMillondeliver from the supercenter. So there's been this expansion of new customers on
top of a really large existing customer base that's already happened.
And now, you layer Walmart Plus on top of that and the people that love it are the
ones that are heavy consumers of delivery from supercenters which again now
includes general merchandise not just food and consumables. So that's the killer
app within Walmart Plus. It's the delivery component from the supercenters. But we
can bolt on top of that and add to it with things like fuel discount, scan and go and
other things in the future. And as we do that, I think we'll have other waves of new
customers that join retaining them is the key the high NPS score for these types of
services has got to be there so that people were new.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Great. So we have 10 minutes. I'm going to go to the webcast and knock out a
couple of these, some of them dovetail with some topics we're going to cover. First,
this is more of a shorter-term question. Have you seen anything surprising in terms
of customer behavior or changes that they're shopping around Black Friday, Cyber
Monday given that the holiday began foremost in mid October?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
No, I can't think of anything that's that surprising. We did see the thanksgiving meal
purchasing move forward a few days because I think people were worried, they
might not be able to get everything they need for their thanksgiving meal. So, there
was a shift there. And not surprising, we don't have enough PlayStation ﬁves for
people like you, but we knew that was going to be pace.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yes, I can ﬁgure out how to play those things anyway. I asked about health care
there's a couple questions in the queue about it. Mine would have been very open
ended. Just what is Walmart healthcare look like post-COVID? And I don't know, if
your strategy really has to change at all?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
You know, I think it looks like an omni oﬀer. Meaning, it's going to be digital and
physical and that's the magic of what we've got. We got these big boxes with big
parking lots and room to put preventive care in place, and because we're a large
seller of groceries, I think over time, we're going to enable people to opt-in to get
some advice on, what am I eating? And how do I get access to preventive care at an
aﬀordable set of prices and an aﬀordable pricing menu. And with the clinics that
we've opened so far, demand has been strong and people are coming to get their
teeth cleaned that weren't doing that before, and they're accessing a medical doctor
in a preventive way and they weren't before, and it's clear and transparent pricing
when you walk in and one of the most frequent questions we're getting is people
enter our clinics is, is that the whole story? Like is that actually the price and are there
other hidden fees? And we're able to say no that's the price and they're pleasantly
surprised and they engage.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

Page 13 of 16Q - Simeon Gutman
A - Doug McMillonIs that relationship develops when you end up ﬁlling cavities and not just cleaning
teeth? There's more margin there and the whole thing works together. So I think
what you'll see from us, we've made an acquisition of (inaudible) already, you'll see
us build out our product roadmap with capabilities that include digital capabilities
that will marry up with the physical locations that we have in a way that builds an
important healthcare business and it'll be a nice additional magnet to supercenters.
So, overtime will people still come in stores, we think yes and speciﬁcally
supercenters, because it's the best format you can do so much in it.
So all this property we own and all these buildings that we have are still an
advantage for us and we're going to play to that advantage. You combine that with a
great perishable oﬀering fresh food, that gets better in presentation, that continues
to improve and compelling general merchandise like right now if you win our stores
you'd love going in the Christmas shop. It feels like Christmas, it looks like Christmas,
it smells like Christmas, it sounds like Christmas people are loving that, we're still
human. Put all that together and I think you end up with a really strong omni-channel
business.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
So from healthcare to international, because that's logical, when you started Doug, I
remember, you talking about the international footprint and I think, methodically you
said, you would slowly step away from certain things or do have footprint and more
asset light ways to narrow the focus and that's exactly what's happened. Can you talk
about, if that process is largely complete? It seems like it may be based on the assets
that we've discussed? And then secondly, this is an unrelated part of international
but India, Flipkart. Why invest in India the way in which you have? And has anything
changed? And notably for us, we followed it closely, Amazon does seem to be
investing more some of the ﬁnancial regulations change maybe how Phone Pay can
operate or how much share they can and ultimately take, but sorry two part, open-
ended question.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. Well, we've got to do a few things. You know, when I think about the opportunity
that we've got during this window of Walmart's history and what we're trying to get
done right now. Being in good businesses positioned well and having the culture
and way of working for innovation and speed and productivity are kind of the two
things that I think we're working on. And as it relates to being in good businesses,
there are decisions like Voodoo or the decision to not invest in Jet and then transfer
all those assets over to Walmart or to exit certain countries.
And as you said, bet on a big opportunity like India, that all ﬁt into that positioning
headline. So the opportunity that we have in India is enormous. Contrast that with
the opportunity in Argentina. It makes sense that sense that we would spread our
energy over a place that it's got tremendous subsidized. So in India, you've got this
huge population, overtime growing income levels, e-commerce is a percent of total
was tiny, Flipkart and Phone Pay are really well run with strong leaders and we're
going to take e-commerce share.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

A - Doug McMillonSo we've caught waves, the India wave and the digital wave or e-commerce wave
including payment that are just going to carry somewhere. And you can debate you
think Walmart be number one in the market given what Amazon and Reliance are
doing or whether we'll be number two in the market. Hey, we'll work to serve
customers better than everybody -- anybody else and hopefully be the biggest, but
we've caught two waves here they're going to result in really valuable businesses
regardless of whether we're number one or number two in the market. And I don't
mean to say that we haven't got our site said, hi there we do, but those are really
good businesses and they done just what we thought they would do since we made
the investment and there's nothing that's changed that causes us to be concerned or
to have changed our view on the investment.
And did we know that Indian regulation would ﬁgure in, yes, we've operated in India
for more than a decade and have experienced that. Did we know that Reliance and
Amazon and I'm sure many others will be super aggressive, absolutely, but we are
two and this company is becoming increasingly digital and a we're learning how to
put data to work. We're learning how to build digital products. And so it's interesting
for me. I'm kind of over my skews now, but when you think about the really long term
of Walmart, we've gone through this period of time where we focused and that still
needs to increase some. I think, Simeon, we're not completely done with that.
But as you build digital products that can scale globally and across boundaries.
There may be expansion that in the longer term that happens, but done in an asset
like digital fashion. Mean, people ask me sometimes. If you took the skins oﬀ of
Walmart and Amazon and Kroger and Target and Facebook and you just looked at
our looked at our assets. We've built a digital omni-channel business or in the
process of building one and if you look at that and look at what it's capable of, the
business model is really diﬀerent and the way we would view the world in the future
is diﬀerent. We're under construction right now in a way that I think sets us up for the
future and obviously that's not all done, but it's really exciting to think about it and
the team's done a great job of getting us to the point that we're at.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Related to that, and this is also driven from the webcast, and this is going to be
somewhat of a quick hit, since our time is running out. How big is the opportunity
said to your advertising & media group business? Is this big untapped opportunity.
Advantages Walmart do, Walmart have relative to the open internet and we haven't
said the word TikTok, it's sort of tangential to that question. But it is it connects the
advertising world not let's say the revenue world, but to your business, so I wanted
to put that all together and at least mentioned TikTok, so we can go out with some
(inaudible).
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I will try to be brief, but yes, we've got a great opportunity with advertising and it's
growing, but we will constrain that in a way that doesn't harm the customer
experience, like we can't let too many banner ads and other things happen in store
digitally that harm the customer experience, so that's the only constraint there.
We've got an opportunity with digital front ends to get to greater level of ad incomeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-12-02

those.
So when you think about what we're building that e-commerce back in and set of
capabilities can be exposed to people through a number of digital front-ends and if
we have good partners, we can design that in a way that it's very seamless and
intuitive to use and that's what we are hoping to do with not just TikTok but others as
well.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Great. Last question from the audience in this last 30 seconds private label
penetration is taking a big step back this year to what the attribute this and how do
you expect it the trend going forward?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. There is nothing happening there other than out of stocks. I think private brand
continues to be really important. We want to sell brands because we want people to
compare prices and that's easier with brands. But, we want private brands that are
really special and cause you to just want to come to us whether it's Walmart or Sam's
Club and that hasn't changed.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Great. Okay, I think we'll leave it at that. Doug, I don't know if there's anything you'd
like to say in conclusion. I can pause for a second, and if not, we can close it out.

I think you covered it, Simeon. Thanks for the time.
