Good morning. Welcome. And thanks for joining us for Facebook's 2017 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders. I'm Dave Kling, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate
Secretary and Chairman of this annual meeting, which I now call to order.
Here's today's agenda. First, we'll focus on the formal business set forth in our proxy
statement. Mark will then spend a few minutes talking about how Facebook is doing
and we'll then conclude with a Q&A session.
Before we begin the formal business, I'd like to remind you to please turn oﬀ all
mobile devices and of the rules of conduct that were handed out when you entered
the meeting, including the rule prohibiting photos and recording of any kind. To
conduct an orderly meeting, we request that you follow these rules. Thank you for
your cooperation.
Let me start by introducing members of our Board of Directors who are here today:
Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Erskine Bowles and Sue Desmond-Hellman.
I would also like to introduce 2 other people who are in attendance: Alex Bender of
Ernst & Young, our independent registered public accounting ﬁrm; and Kris Veaco,
who will act as the Inspector of Election for this meeting and who will tabulate theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

Page 2 of 25results of the voting. Ms. Veaco has previously taken the oath of Inspector of
Election.
Turning now to the formal business. I have a copy of the notice, together with the
declaration as to the mailing of the proxy statement made available to all Facebook
stockholders of record as of April 7, 2017. I also have a list of stockholders entitled to
vote at this meeting, which is available for inspection by any stockholder present or
by any proxy holder representing a stockholder and which list will be ﬁled with the
records of this meeting. I'm advised by the Inspector of Election that the holders
representing at least the majority of the outstanding Class A and Class B common
stock voting together as a single class are present and represented by proxy here
today and the requisite quorum for each proposal is therefore present. Accordingly,
this meeting is authorized to transact the business set forth in our proxy statement.
We have 7 proposals to consider at this meeting, each of which is described in the
proxy. We will discuss these proposals momentarily. However, ﬁrst, I remind you that
the voting today is by proxy and written ballot. If you've already sent in a proxy and
do not intend to change your vote, there is no need for you to cast a ballot today.
Your vote will be counted automatically without any further action on your part. Any
stockholder present who has not returned a proxy or who wishes to change your
vote may cast a ballot at this meeting. Does any stockholder wish to cast a ballot
today? If so, please raise your hand. And one of our volunteers will bring one to you.
All right. Keep your hands raised high, please.
All right. It is now 11:07. And the polls are now open. You may vote at any time during
our discussion of the proposals on the agenda. Once you ﬁlled out your ballot,
please just raise your ballot in the air. And our volunteers will come and collect it.
I will now review the proposals to be voted on at the meeting. The ﬁrst item of
business is to elect our Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal. The director nominees are: Marc
Andreessen, Erskine Bowles, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Reed Hastings, Jan Koum,
Sheryl Sandberg, Peter Thiel and Mark Zuckerberg. The qualiﬁcations for each
proposed director are set forth in the proxy statement. No other director nominees
have been properly submitted for election pursuant to our bylaws or SEC rules,
therefore, no other nominations may be accepted at this time. The Board of
Directors recommends a vote for the election of each of the nominated directors.
The second item of business is to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our
independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for the year ending December 31,
2017. The Board of Directors recommends a vote for this proposal.
Finally, we received 5 stockholder proposals that complied with the requirements of
our bylaws and SEC rules and therefore, are eligible to be voted on at this meeting.
Proposal #3 is a proposal regarding a change in stockholder voting. Proposal #4 is a
proposal regarding a lobbying report. Proposal #5 is a proposal regarding falseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

Page 3 of 25Abigail Shawnews. Proposal 6 is a proposal regarding a gender pay equity report. And ﬁnally,
Proposal #7 is a proposal regarding an independent chair. The Board of Directors
recommends a vote against each of these proposals.
The proponent of each of the stockholder proposals may now make a statement in
support of their proposal. I will call you up one by one to one of the 3 microphones.
Please limit your statements to no more than 3 minutes. First, for Proposal 3, Abigail
Shaw will be speaking on behalf of NorthStar Asset Management. Ms. Shaw?
Good morning. My name is Abigail Shaw from NorthStar Asset Management in
Boston, the beneﬁcial owner of over $5.4 million of Facebook common stock. Fellow
shareholders, I am here to represent Resolution #3, a good governance proposal
about equal voting rights. Facebook's management and board have consistently
minimized our input as shareholders by reducing our voting rights. When
shareholders of common stock do not have an equal right to weigh in on signiﬁcant
governance matters, we subject ourselves to greater ﬁnancial risk.
Facebook's voting structure is heavily weighed to favor insiders given that class B
shares are granted 10x the voting rights of Class A shares. Last June, matters were
made worse when Mr. Zuckerberg and other Class B insiders voted in a brand-new
class of stock with 0 voting rights. This is particularly remarkable because 71% of
Class A outside shareholders voted against this measure. How is it possible that an
overwhelming majority of shareholders voted against a change in company
governance. And yet this creation of Class B shares was still implemented? Well this
is because Mark Zuckerberg, who owns only 14% of the outstanding shares of the
company, has 53% of the voting power.
While it is certainly easy to ignore this reality when proﬁts are up, this voting
structure constitutes a considerable risk to governance and shareholder value. Our
company's own 10-K states that Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares in his
own interests, which may not always be in the interest of our stockholders generally.
Furthermore, the 10-K notes that in the event of his death, the shares of our capital
stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he
has designated. The board is quite aware of this risk. In fact, when news came out
that Mr. Zuckerberg intended to give away a vast amount of Facebook stock in his
lifetime, the board scrambled to create the 0 votes shares so that he can give away
those shares and not his voting rights. We seek to remedy this problem before it
becomes an unmitigated disaster for the ﬁrm.
It continues to be impossible for outside shareholders to have any meaningful input
on company decisions. Mr. Zuckerberg has brought this company into fruition and
led it into proﬁtability. But the company's decision to oﬀer common shares of the
company in public exchanges, making Facebook a public company, brings with it a
responsibility to shareholders to practice good governance. Shareholders, we urge
you to vote for Proxy Item #3.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

David Kling{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Thank you. Next, for Proposal 4, Maureen O'Brien will be speaking on behalf of the
City of Philadelphia Public Employees Retirement System. Ms. O'Brien?
Good morning, fellow shareholders and board members. My name is Maureen
O'Brien. And I'm here to move Proposal #4, which asks Facebook to fully disclose the
company's political spending. There's a large group of institutional investors that has
been engaging with companies on political disclosure and accountability for many
years. The results of that eﬀort, which the Pension Funds of Philadelphia is a part of, is
that there's over 300 companies that now disclose their political spending on their
website. So you can go to their website and see their donations.
The second piece of that is the accountability piece, which is making sure that the
board is aware of how the company is spending its money and that decision-making
is centralized. As we all know, there's many ways you can inﬂuence public policy.
One of those ways is through direct donations. Another way is through lobbying.
And the company does not disclose that piece of information. So companies can
lobby in their own name at the state and federal level. And all of that information is
required to be reported. So we're simply asking that the information that's already
compiled be also disclosed on the website.
The more concerning piece of lobbying, which there is no disclosure of, is through
political intermediaries. So for example, we know that Facebook belongs to the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and we know that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has spent
$1.3 billion in lobbying spending. They are the largest lobbying spender. We don't
know how much of that Facebook underwrote. There's absolutely no disclosure of
that. There are 68 companies now that disclose that piece of information. You can go
to their websites. You can see which trade associations and other groups they
belong to. You can see the amount of money that they give to those associations and
you can see the portion of that sum that is used for political purposes. We're asking
Facebook to also provide that disclosure.
A second way to address that problem is by asking those trade associations and
related entities not to use corporate dollars for political purposes. There's a large
pharmaceutical company that's going to make an announcement that they have
decided to do that soon. I assessed the proxy adviser has recommended that
shareholders vote in favor of this. And they have pointed out that lack of
transparency and that big portion of the company's political spending. So we urge
you to vote in favor of it. We think that the most clear way that Facebook's stance on
political issues, the most clear expression of that, is what they're funding, which
candidates and which issues. And we think that transparency is good for the
company and it's good for shareholders.

Capital. Ms. Lamb?
{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board and fellow
shareholders. My name is Natasha Lamb. And I'm here to move Proposal #5 on
behalf of Arjuna Capital and Baldwin Brothers clients, asking the board to publish a
report on public policy issues associated with managing fake news and associated
hate speech, including the impact on the democratic process, free speech and a
cohesive society. To be clear, we are not talking about -- we are talking about content
that is posted and disseminated with the intent to mislead, not the mainstream
media, which the President refers to as fake news.
Of note, research has shown that fake news has aﬀected elections in the U.K., France
and the U.S. Pew conﬁrms broad misperception caused by fake news, noting 64% of
U.S. adults say fabricated news stories cause a great deal of confusion about the
basic facts of current issues and events, confusion that cuts across political lines. Fake
news is not about spin or conﬁrmation bias, it's about fabrication. And when
fabrication is disseminated so easily at scale, the way we have seen through
Facebook social media platform, it represents a threat to our democracy. And while
our company deﬁnes Facebook's business as a neutral technology platform, it's
simply not. With nearly 2/3 of adults getting their news from Facebook, it's clear
Facebook is a media platform which now controls the conversation, a conversation
that can be manipulated at scale through the propagation of fake news.
While our company has recently announced some steps to deal with the problem,
they are a bit too little and too late. Facebook is at risk if it maintains a platform of
confusion and distortion. In doing so, it could lose the trust of its users, who may
simply move on to the next thing. Indeed, Facebook's challenge is how to deal with
fake news without curbing freedom of expression for billions of users around the
globe. A lack of self-regulation could also invite government regulation. Investors
seek assurances that fake news, fabricated content and hate speech is being
handled responsibly over time. We do not expect it will be solved through a simple
algorithm tweak or better user education, although those are important pieces of a
larger puzzle.
Fake news is a complex issue that needs to be managed systematically with
transparency and accountability to investors and users. Investors need to understand
the full scope of the issue. We expect annual reporting on public policy risk, impacts
on free speech and analysis on how fake news is impacting a cornerstone of our
democracy and informed electorate. Thank you. So much for your consideration of
this proposal.

Capital.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

David Kling{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Again, my name is Natasha Lamb. And I'm here to move
Proposal #6 on behalf of Arjuna Capital and Baldwin Brothers clients, asking the
board to publish a report on gender pay equity. This is the second year we have ﬁled
this proposal and it's gone to a vote. The median income for women working full
time in the United States is reported to be 79% of her male counterpart and forecasts
indicate that women will not reach pay parity until 2059, more than 40 years. Of
note, the gap for African American and Latino women is wider at 60% and 55%,
respectively. Gender pay disparity is not only one of the biggest social justice issues
of our time, it poses a risk to company's performance, brand and investor returns.
This issue is particularly salient to the technology industry, which struggles to attract,
retain and move women into positions of leadership. A 2016 Glassdoor study ﬁnds
an unexplained 5.9% gender pay gap in the information technology industry after
statistical controls for things like position and seniority, noting that many tech jobs
topped the list for the largest gender pay gaps. And while Facebook has not
reported its company-wide pay gap, Pay Scale reports the company has a mean pay
gap of 18%, over $20,000. Research indicates gender-diverse teams are more
productive, innovative and drive better results. So clearly, a failure to attract and
retain qualiﬁed female employees is detrimental to Facebook's ability to innovate
and compete.
Facebook has disclosed that 33% of our company's workforce is female, yet only
27% of our management team is female. Our company is best served by a proactive
approach to addressing the structural biases, including pay inequities, that prevent
women from moving into positions of leadership. Given the material business risk
gender inequity presents, investors expect quantitative, transparent and honest
disclosures and goals. Employees expect a new level of structural support that
addresses root causes and empowers fair negotiation, promotion. And ultimately,
equal pay. Implementing the proposal would represent a proactive step towards
closing the gender pay gap. We believe the company would beneﬁt from taking a
leadership position on this issue, along with technology peers, including Intel, Apple,
Expedia, Adobe, Amazon, Microsoft, GoDaddy and eBay.
As research indicates, attracting and retaining diverse teams yields strong ﬁnancial
performance beneﬁts. Proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, agrees, they
state, "A vote for this resolution is warranted as Facebook lags its peers in
addressing gender pay disparity at the company. By not keeping pace with its peers,
Facebook is put at a competitive disadvantage in the recruitment and retention of
employees." Thank you, again for your consideration.

Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, shareholders. First of all, I'd like to say that
the fact that our company's lead Director, if I understood correctly, Susan Desmond-
Hellmann, is not present today. Is that correct?
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
She is present today. She's in the front row.
Thank you. My name is Lisa Linsley. And together with my colleague, Reem Solomon,
representing proposal 7, the shareholder proposal for an independent board chair.
The chair who's not also the CEO. On behalf of our organization, some of us. And
our 12 million member global community, which includes over 1,500 individual
Facebook shareholders and 1,600 individuals who wrote to their pension and mutual
funds regarding this proposal. The Board of Directors is supposed to represent us,
the shareholders. And oversee management. So it does not make sense to have the
top manager, the CEO, also chair the board. Evidence has proven that when the ﬁrm
separate the CEO and board chair roles, it eliminates the conﬂict of interest that
inevitably occurs when the CEO is responsible for self-oversight. 48% of S&P 500
companies have separated the roles of chair and CEO. We don't think you should be
your own boss, Mr. Zuckerberg. And we're not alone.
Proxy advisory ﬁrm, ISS, says, "Shareholders would beneﬁt from a more independent
board oversight in the form of an independent chair. The company has a multi-class
capital structure, which is not in the best interest of all shareholders. The board is not
substantially independent and there is no formal nominating committee. An
independent chairman would serve as a more eﬀective counterbalance to the
current leadership structure and provide unaﬃliated shareholders with a stronger
form of independent board oversight and leadership."
Mr. Zuckerberg said in his February manifesto that, "Facebook stands for bringing us
closer together and building a global community." Building community requires
trust. So what kind of a community can Facebook really build if Facebook has all the
market power and one person has all the power within Facebook? Having a CEO
who is not his own boss is especially important as Facebook faces mounting criticism
that the company sensors human and civil rights advocates when they are critical of
government actors, including police oﬃcers, while failing to prevent violent threats
and harassment by white supremacist hate groups and calls for our company to be
regulated as a publisher.
Last year, Mr. Zuckerberg used his superior voting rights to approve yet another class
of stock to perpetuate his outright control of the company's voting power for the
remainder of his lifetime without maintaining his economic interest. This marks a new
low in the corporate governance of our company. And if there were ever a time for
an independent board oversight and implementation of best practices, that time isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

to adopt this policy. Thank you.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. The company will not be providing responses at this meeting as
the company's position on each proposal is already set forth in the proxy statement.
We'll now collect the remaining ballots. Please raise your ballot and our volunteers
will come around and pick them up. A couple more in here.
Great. Okay. All votes have been cast in the proposals to be considered at this
meeting. We've got 2 more -- 3 more. And as of 11:28, the polls are now closed. We
can take that one, sir. I will now confer with the Inspector of Election and report on
the preliminary results of the voting.
The vote required to approve Proposal 1 is a plurality of the voting power of our
Class A and Class B common stock voting together as a single class, which means
that the 8 nominees receiving the highest number of aﬃrmative votes will be elected
to the Board of Directors. Based on the results tabulated by the Inspector of Election,
each of the 8 nominees has been elected to the Board of Directors. The vote
required to approve Proposals 2 through 7 is a majority of the voting power of our
Class A and Class B common stock voting together as a single class. Based on the
preliminary results tabulated by the Inspector of Election, Proposal 2 has been
approved by at least the requisite majority of the votes casts. And each of Proposals
3 through 7 has been rejected by at least the requisite majority of the votes cast.
Final results of the voting will be ﬁled with the SEC on a Form 8-K within 4 business
days. There are no other items of business on the agenda. So this concludes the
formal part of the meeting. The annual meeting is now adjourned.
Now before I ask Mark to come to the stage, I want to remind you that his remarks
and the Q&A that follows may contain forward-looking statements regarding future
events and the future ﬁnancial performance of the company. We caution you to
consider the important risk factors that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially
from those in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors are more fully
detailed under the caption Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q ﬁled
with the SEC on May 4, 2017. In addition, any forward-looking statements we make
today are based on assumptions as of this date. And we undertake no obligation to
update these statements as a result of new information or future events. Mark?

All right. Hi. everyone. I'm taking the podium. All right. Thanks for all coming out
today. So we've had a pretty intense year and have gotten a lot done since the last
time that we were all here last year. We now -- our community is up to 1.9 billion
people, who actively use our services every month. And more than 1.3 billion people
who use them every day. Last year, the business performed really well. And weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 9 of 25reached $27.6 billion in revenue, including in the last -- the First Quarter of this year,
we reached $8 billion in revenue. So a lot of good progress on a lot of fronts.
Now this year, we also just celebrated the 5-year anniversary of our IPO, which some
of you remember was pretty rocky at the time. It's been a pretty good journey so far.
I appreciate all of your support along the way. We have a lot more ahead that we're
looking forward to doing. And reﬂecting on the ﬁve years so far, I had a chance to
read the shareholder letter that I wrote when we ﬁrst went public. And a lot of the
principles that we were talking about back then are still the principles that we care
about in running the company, giving everyone a voice, connecting people with
friends and family and the people they care about. But one thing has, I think, shifted
in our thinking which is, for the ﬁrst 10 years of the company, we really focused
primarily on connecting friends and family. And now I think we have this growing
realization that, that is very important but is not enough to bring the world closer
together.
In addition to connecting friends and family and trying to give everyone a voice, we
also have to proactively work to build communities and bring people closer together
to make it so that the discourse that we have is positive and that people, over time,
aren't becoming more divided. But as we have the chance to share more, can also
come together, in our view, is to make progress together as a society. So I wrote this
letter in February, that some of you may have had a chance to read, that tried to
outline some of the things that I think Facebook can do to help build communities
around the world. And my point in that wasn't to say that Facebook is going to be
the only company or institution doing this. Of course, we're not. But the job of
building communities around the world is one that is shared by everyone and that --
but I do believe that we can play a role in this and have a responsibility to do our
part.
So I laid out a few things that I feel like we have a particular opportunity and
responsibility to help do. So one is around helping people connect with supportive
communities. All right. So there's a lot of people on Facebook today who joined
communities that are important parts of their support structure, right? So whether
you're a new mother who just had a child and joined a group with new mothers. Or if
you're a spouse of someone in the military and you want to connect with other
people who are spouses of military folks when they're away. Or you're suﬀering from
a rare disease and maybe there's no one in your community, physically around you
who you know has that disease. But there are people -- maybe thousands of people
around the world who have that, now you can share that experience with people. So
what we found is that there are more than 100 million people on Facebook who are
members of one of these meaningful groups and communities. And we've set a goal
internally that over the next 5 or 10 years, we want to see if we can help a billion
more people or more connect to meaningful communities to them. And we think
that if we can do this, that can help provide people with more people with a support
structure that they need in their lives.
A second important part of building community is helping to keep people safe,
right? That's a real cornerstone of any community is that we all come together toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 10 of 25look out for each other and make sure that when things are going wrong, whether
it's an urgent short-term crisis or ongoing issues that we have, that we look out for
each other. And I think that Facebook and online communities have a unique
opportunity to help people come together in new ways. So whether it's -- after an
earthquake in 2015 when our community came together to raise more than $15
million to support people rebuilding in India and Nepal. Or more recently, there are
a number of issues and cases that we have seen with video where our communities
come together to help save people who are thinking about suicide and get them the
support they needed. There's a lot more here that I think that we can do. And
recently, we announced that we're going to add 3,000 new people to our
community ops team so that we can respond more quickly when we get reports from
people that someone might not be safe in our community or someone might need
help or someone is thinking about harm or there's some violence that is going on.
We want to make sure that we can respond to that really quickly and we're going to
continue growing the team that works on it. It's already thousands of people. But
we're going to almost double it over the next year to continue working on this to
keep people safe.
A third pillar of building community is making a -- is helping to create a well-
informed community. And that's a theme that I know a lot of us are thinking about,
right? The quality of discourse that happens in the world and -- there are billions of
conversations that go on on Facebook. And making sure that people have access to
good information is a really important part of what we care about in terms of making
sure that there's good discourse, while making sure that people have the freedom to
share what's important to them, right? Now a lot of opinions people may not
disagree with. But we still think it's important that people have the ability to get that
out there.
Now we do have a special focus on trying to reduce the prevalence of false news in
the system. And there are a bunch of diﬀerent ways that we're going about this. A lot
of the folks who spread hoaxes and false news aren't actually doing it for an
ideological reason. They're doing it because they basically spammers who are trying
to make money. I'd say they know that what they're saying isn't true, they're just
trying to come up with the most outrageous thing that they can so that way they can
post links to it and get you to click on it because it sounds crazy. Then you click on it.
And they show you ads on the landing page. So we have focused a lot on disrupting
the economics for these folks. If we can make it so it's no longer proﬁtable for them
to do this, then they'll stop. And one of the things that we can do is making it so
when this content gets shared, it gets shared a little bit less in news feed, that we can
make sure that these kind of spammers aren't using our ad systems and
monetization tools to make money. And those things are already having a pretty
good result in terms of cutting down on the amount of hoaxes and false news.
There's a lot of other work that we can do by people who, I think, often mean well
but are sharing content that is inaccurate in the system. So one of the things that
we've done recently is made it so that when a number of people ﬂag that they think
that something might not be true, we send it to fact checkers. And if a couple of fact
checkers say, this isn't true, then we'll also append a notice to some of the content
saying that fact checkers dispute it. Again, because we care about giving everyoneFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 11 of 25the freedom to share what they care about, we don't want to block that content from
being shared. But we do want to -- I believe that the right way to go about this
problem is to try to ﬁght information with more information, right? And the best way
to make sure that people are informed is by getting more information out there so --
make it so people share what they want. But also share the information that credible
third-party fact checkers think that the story isn't accurate.
Then there's a lot more that we can do. There's a lot of research that shows, as I
wrote about in my letter in February, that one of the best things that you can do to
help people understand the full breadth of a topic is to not just show them a
counterpoint. But show a whole range of diﬀerent opinions, right? So if someone --
take any issue that you might care about. A lot of people say, "Hi. if they're going to
see an article on one side of the issue, why don't you show them something on the
other side?" But there's a lot of research that actually shows that if you show them
just the opposite opinion, that just entrenches people's opinions further. And the real
thing that you need to do, if you want to help people get a broader perspective, is to
show a number of diﬀerent opinions along the spectrum and let people decide for
themselves. People are smart, right? We can ﬁgure this out when we have access to
the full story. So I think the big issue that we face today is having just one side of the
story at a time or false information at the time. But when there's -- we have the
opportunity to see the whole side of the story and lots of diﬀerent perspectives, I
think we ﬁnd that we'll often come to the right perspective. So we're working on a
number of diﬀerent things there around informed community.
The fourth pillar around building communities is civic engagement and making sure
that the community can be very engaged civically in the issues that matter to them.
One of the things that we're doing there, in addition to just giving people the
freedom to share what they care about is helping people connect with local oﬃcials,
right? There's -- in our society, a lot of attention is paid to national and broader
elections. But a lot of stuﬀ happens at the local level. And people tend to connect a
lot less with people at the local level, who may actually aﬀect some things in their life
even more. So one of the things that I've been proud about recently is after the
recent U.S. elections, we gave people an option. In one click we sent a notiﬁcation
that said here are all your elected oﬃcials, from the President down to your school
board members. And in one click, you could connect to all of them at once so you
can receive updates and communicate with them and comment. And overnight, we
doubled the amount of connections that people had to their elected oﬃcials. And
that was just one program. So the idea is that we can continue doing this around the
world, not just in the U.S. and not just in one election. And dramatically increase the
amount of civic engagement and communication that happens between people and
the electorate and the oﬃcials who serve them.
So that's one part of what we're focused on now around building community. That's
an increasing part of our mission and what we care about doing as a company to
make sure that our service lives up to its responsibility to help build community and
bring the world closer together. In terms of our strategy in building product, I often
talk about this 3 time horizons of the diﬀerent investments and products that we're
building. So I talked about products that are making a big diﬀerence and driving the
business now and over the near term, the next few years. We talk about things overFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

Page 12 of 25the next ﬁve years that are already products at scale, like Messenger and WhatsApp.
But aren't really contributing meaningfully to the business today. They're not driving
a meaningful amount of revenue. Then there are things that are 10 years out, like our
investments in Internet connectivity to help make sure everyone has accessed
opportunity through the Internet, things like artiﬁcial intelligence and virtual and
augmented reality. And the goal there is to develop foundational technology that is
going to be necessary to, over time, realize the mission of helping everyone share
and connect in all the ways that they want. Inventing foundational technology that's
not possible today.
So when we talk about, over the next few years, right, what's going to have the
biggest impact, the thing that I'm most focused on now is video. It's just the -- it's this
huge trend as mobile networks get better, as cameras on our phones get better, we
can all have the opportunity to take videos throughout our day, upload them without
a big lag, click on a video to watch it without having to take a couple of minutes to
watch. And because of that, video is just absolutely taking oﬀ in lots of diﬀerent
formats, right? People taking videos with cameras on their phones, people
consuming videos and news feed, people sharing stories. That's a new important
format that now -- on Instagram there are more than 200 million people who look at
and watch stories every day.
WhatsApp is not far behind that. And Messenger and Facebook Stories are growing
quickly, too. That's an important part of video consumption going forward. And that's
going to be just an important part of the strategy that I'm sure we'll talk more about
over the coming years.
Over the next ﬁve years, probably the thing that I'm most excited about is
messaging, right? So WhatsApp and Messenger, there are already tens of billions of
messages that people send every day through these services. Messenger and
WhatsApp both have about 1.3 billion people using each of them every month. And
they are growing really quickly.
So these are some of the largest networks in the world. And we're only in the very
beginning of starting to turn them into businesses. And I'm really optimistic about
this because I know that most people don't like calling businesses for support, right?
They want to message them. They want to not have to sit there and wait for a
response. But just get pinged back when the business has the answer that they
need.
So I'm very conﬁdent that this is going to be a big business and something that is --
that's going to be a really good user experience for all the people who are using
these products. And there's just a lot of passion and excitement inside the company
to build that out. I think the best -- just one of the most exciting opportunities in the
technology landscape when I look out and see what's out there.
Then of course, over the longest period of time that we focused our strategy on the
10-year period, one of the things that I just remain extremely excited about is gettingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

have the opportunities that come with being on the Internet. And for a lot of us who
probably live in the U.S., that's probably not a reality that all of us have to confront
every day because most of the people you know are probably on the Internet. But
around the world, more than half of the people aren't. And the Internet's not just
about accessing your friends. It's also, for a lot of people, the primary way that they
get access to education information and health information and opportunities about
jobs and ﬁnancial information on how they should manage their families' ﬁnances.
This is incredibly important.
And as a company, we're one of the organizations in the world that I think is well
positioned to partner with telcos and governments around the world to make sure
that billions of more people can get access to all of those opportunities over the
next decade. So we're doing a lot to do that from working with operators on
diﬀerent business models, to supporting local entrepreneurs and selling Wi-Fi and
building the technology that they need to have hotspots. And we've already
connected 50 million people or more to the Internet through these programs over
the last few years alone. And there's a lot more that we can do that I'm excited about.
So there's a lot more that I could talk about. But I know we have a Q&A that we're
trying to get to. So let's go to that. And as always, thank you for coming out to the

Let's start oﬀ over on this row.
The annual report talks about average revenue per user being about 8x higher in the
U.S. and Canada than Asia Paciﬁc. It cites as a primary factor, the size and maturity of
the app market. But it doesn't necessarily explain some of the other factors. You're
going to focus on video in some geographies where the Internet speed isn't as high.
That's going to be a factor. So -- and even just between like Europe and North
America, it's 3x higher in U.S. and Canada, the average revenue per user. So why is
there so much variance? And how do you see that looking in the 4 buckets over the
next few years?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes. Sure. I'll take that. There's a -- one of the big reason. And we mentioned that in
the ﬁlings, is that in the North America segment, you've got just U.S. and Canada. So
it's really only very developed markets. If you look at our European segment, that
includes both Western and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, some of the areas
where we're seeing higher growth in users. So you've got a basically diﬀerent mix ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 16 of 25A - David Kling
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Sheryl K. Sandbergsort of ad market size per users, per population in those markets. So that explains a
lot of the diﬀerential. But then you also look at the U.S. and it is a -- all of our ARPU
are on an MAU basis. The U.S. has the highest DAU to MAU ratio, U.S. and Canada.
So that brings up the amount of engagement and the amount of ad supply that we
have. Then as well, there's more time spent in the U.S. and Canada relatively. So I
think those things are a function of a lot of diﬀerent things cultural. But also just
speeds of the networks in the diﬀerent areas. So there's, I think, opportunities to
grow certainly outside the U.S., both the supply and the size of the ads business in
those regions. When you start to look at APAC, Asia Paciﬁc and the Rest of World,
you've got some things that are going on that will actually work against ARPU
growing because a lot of the growth that we're getting in users in areas like India,
Indonesia, those are markets that are growing more quickly than the developed
markets in APAC like Japan, Korea and Australia. So those are generally lower ARPU
users coming on. And that actually will kind of weight down the average ARPU in
those regions. And similarly, with Rest of World, you've got growth in Africa, which is
lower ARPU that is going to bring down the mix. So we're kind of working to
obviously grow the ads business across all of the diﬀerent regions. And we see a lot
of growth opportunity in regions outside of North America. But then we've also got a
lot of great user growth. And a lot of that's coming at a lower ARPU level. So we're
kind of pursuing both of those things. And those kind of blend out in the ARPU
calculations that you see.

Thanks, Dave. Let's hit the center aisle.
In particular, I was interested in the thoughts for Sheryl and Mark regarding this
Hillary Clinton at the recent Code Conference was discussing her thoughts in terms
of social media and Facebook and the role in the election. And Facebook has a
mission that is very important in terms of bringing communities together. But in
terms of where certain communities might actively seek to attack and delegitimize
other communities and that weighting between freedom of speech and the integrity
of democratic institutions, I was curious what your thoughts are in terms of the
revelations of the election and these recent developments, how that aﬀects your
perceptions of the mission of bringing communities together, in context, certain
communities wanting others to be delegitimized and attacked?

communities come together and the right of free expression, all of which we believe
in very deeply. We also know that false news goes against what people want to see
on Facebook. People want accurate news on Facebook. That's what we want them to
have on Facebook. And so we're working across diﬀerent media companies, with
classrooms, with everyone from academics to the people who produce the news to
our own teams, to make sure that people see accurate news on Facebook. It is going
to be a long-term process we are working in. And we've had several

Thank you. (inaudible)
Good morning. My name is Mark Simon [ph]. I'm here today as a representative of
the Southwest Carpenters Pension Fund, beneﬁcial owner of 175,907 shares of
Facebook common stock. Let me also say I have a terrible cough. And if I get into a
coughing ﬁt during this, I apologize to everybody. But give me a minute, I'll get
through. And what I'm going to say is, I -- we believe, very important. We are long-
term owners who applaud the success and direction our company is headed. Today,
I want to raise somewhat of a dark issue with you that is a growing cancer in the
construction industry, harms workers and local contractors and can occur on most
any project, including the construction of data centers. And as you know, those
projects are multibillion-dollar projects determining the quality of life, standard of
living of many people who live in communities and who use Facebook. What we are
seeing is an epidemic of payroll fraud across the construction industry. Payroll fraud
is wage theft, illegal tax avoidance and workers' compensation premium fraud to the
underreporting of payrolls to insurance carriers. On your upcoming project, west of
Omaha, Nebraska, Facebook will be using a subcontractor named Allied, who often
uses labor brokers to supplement its workforce. We have information that workers
have been paid in cash and denied proper overtime on Allied projects. The
Nebraska project is your project. You can take steps to ensure that it is free and clear
of payroll fraud. You should know recently the local Omaha carpenters approached
another owner of a large local project, this is Creighton University's dental school,
with similar information about this contractor. The university took the very positive
step of mandating that Allied not use any labor brokers on the project, that workers
will be direct employees of Allied. Will Facebook take the same step? And
furthermore, you should know that your general contractor, Turner Construction,
does have language enabling it to ﬁre subcontractors for cause. So that tool is there,
too, to ensure that the data center project is free and clear of payroll fraud. We
would love to follow up with you talking to the appropriate people about this issue.
Thank you very much.
{BIO 16033194 <GO>}
I'll take that. Thank you very much for your question. We take the issue really quite
seriously. We view our locating of data centers as an opportunity to demonstrate
economic growth and create economic opportunity in the regions around the
country and around the world where we do such construction. We take quite
seriously the selection of the general contractor, in this case -- in the case of The
Papillon Center, Turner -- very seriously. And we have great expectations and impose
great obligations on them, including to perform due diligence. More -- and more
speciﬁcally rather, as part of that due diligence, we expect them to examine for each
of their subcontractors, whether there's any litigation, open or closed, as part of their
review. And yes, if it's determined after the fact that they have not done adequate
due diligence, they have the opportunity to terminate a subcontractor relationship
for cause. The points that you're making are clearly a source of concern. And my
understanding is from -- because we knew you were here and you reached out, that
we want to understand better. And I think we're in the process of trying to scheduleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

Come back to the near side.
This is Reem [ph] from (inaudible). My question is, with the majority of Americans
consuming news through Facebook. And now we're in a point where oftentimes
news breaks on Facebook with the onset of Facebook Live. My question is, how can
Facebook continue to insist that it's a neutral tech company as opposed to a
publisher? And what are the implications for shareholders if the FCC decides to
regulate it as such?
{BIO 16033194 <GO>}
So I'll take that, too. As a regulatory matter, it's not clear that our obligations are legal
obligations as a publisher versus as a host. I think the question that you're asking,
though, goes to how do we determine what content is appropriate or is not or how
we value the content. And there, we do make what others might call editorial
decisions. But we call those decisions based around our community standards and
our community guideline. We want to have a service where people -- our mission --
to go back to our mission, our mission is to give people the power to share and
make the world more open and connected. You heard Mark earlier on talk about
giving people a voice. It's really important for us to do that. But at the same time, it's
essential that we do that in a manner that makes people feel safe and secure. And
that's why we have community standards that are designed to protect those. And
that's why we've been working aggressively to make sure that we have the capacity
of people to review reports, to review the content that's there, to make sure that any
content that makes people feel unsafe, that creates an unsafe environment, is either
reported to us, is reported to law enforcement and comes oﬀ of our service. So I
think, from a practical matter, our focus is not to be in the business of being an editor
in the sense of determining what people should see that some things are more
important for people, some content is more important for people than others. It's to
help people share what they want to share, an environment that's safe, an
environment that's secure. But that lets people express their opinion.

Hello, everyone. I learned from one of the website statement from Facebook's
display, for each outstanding Class A and Class B share held by our shareholders,
Facebook intends to issue 2 new class C share as a onetime stock dividend. If I am
not mistaken, it has been approved. Could you please let us know the status of the
approved proposal? When will it take eﬀect?
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Yes. I can take that one. So we have currently agreed not to implement the new Class
C structure while there's litigation that's pending in the trial court. The trial for that is
currently scheduled for the end of September. We're also currently working on the
implementation plan for how that would actually be implemented across our
systems. So realistically, I think the earliest that we would think about implementing
the Class C and paying the actual 2 for 1 dividend would be sometime in 2018. And
of course, that's all subject to change depending on what happens with the litigation
and other factors.
It's to [ph] Oculus. I see many advertisements out there for other virtual-reality
companies. Is Oculus up and running? And are they making any money for
Facebook?
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
It is up and running. We have a couple of products that we've built. One on the high
end, it's called the Oculus Rift. We manufacture that ourselves. It connects to a PC.
And it oﬀers just the highest quality of virtual-reality experience that is available
today. The other product, which you've probably seen more ads for is one that we
built in partnership with Samsung called Gear VR. We've actually shipped 5 million
of these. And a lot of people are enjoying it. They've made it so that when you buy a
Samsung Galaxy phone, you can get one of these either for free or at a really
aﬀordable price in order to start getting those virtual reality experiences out in the
world. Our strategy for VR is not to try to sell the products for a very large amount of
money in the near term. But to try to get virtual reality to be something that 1 billion
people or more use in the world. Then once we get to that place, we think that there
are going to be a lot of good business opportunities for us on top of that building
experiences that people want to use. But as a shareholder, you will not really see us
monetize this very aggressively for the next 5 or more years. This is very early
technology. 5 million units, I was just talking what Gear VR is, early success for them.
Still very long way away from 1 billion units, which is I think where these platforms
need to get before they really are mainstream. But I'm conﬁdent that between virtual
and augmented reality, we will eventually get there may be a decade oﬀ. But that's
what we're playing for, not to try to make a lot of money in the near term but to build
this experience for the world and have the best position once it's possible.

{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Sure.
Mr. Zuckerberg, you say you want people to be safe. And that's part of what
Facebook's doing. If safety decisions are made by minimally-trained moderators.
And it's in second window as detailed recently in The Guardian. It's no surprise that
many users feel unsafe and targeted by hate speech. Will you lay out how you will
address this problem?
{BIO 16033194 <GO>}
So I'll certainly respond. I think the disclosures in The Guardian were not complete.
We have multiple systems for how we review and follow up concerns about hate
speech. One of them, an important one comes from the direct reports from users.
But we also have special dedicated support lines. We have a safety advisory board,
which also alerts us to content that we should be particularly concerned about. We
have relationships with the law enforcement that often reach out to us with respect to
concerns. We have the dedicated teams around the world. We have, in fact, our
employee base, often identify stuﬀ that we turn out. We have technical systems that
are used, including a growing body of machine learning that helps us identify stuﬀ
very, very quickly. Now we acknowledge that we have more to do. It's been very
clear that the products we make, the products we deliver and the services we
provide have become increasingly popular. And as a result of that, they get more
and more used. And frankly speaking, we have not been able to keep pace as much
as we thought we would be able to. And that's why we announced just in the past
couple of weeks, as Mark mentioned, the idea that we would hire an additional
3,000 people, almost a substantial increase in our community operations force. So
that we would be able to review the content in cases where people don't feel
conﬁdent to evaluate in a short period of time, they escalate it to a more senior
experienced reviewer. And we are in the process of trying to improve our service.

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantYes. And I mean, I would just add to that, that there are tens of billions of messages
and comments and pieces of content that are shared through our services every day.
So long term, the only way that we will get to the quality level that we all want to is
not by adding thousands or tens of thousands of more people to help review. But by
building AI and technical systems that can look at the stuﬀ more proactively. And
that's something that we're starting to work on. It -- the technology is not 100% there
yet. But to some of the questions that I think a lot of folks are asking about, "Why do
we see ourselves as a technology company?" A lot of that is because the primary
thing that we do is build technology and a lot of the problems that we need to solve,
the primary answer to that is by building technology. And I think that that's going to
be the answer here, too, over time. It's just going to take a little longer than I think

three years ago. But for the revenue point of view, like the 90% of the revenue is
coming from the ad -- advertisement. So WhatsApp, like, I know if you added so
many users and the community are everything. But as a Facebook, how actually do
you have a plan to add revenue from WhatsApp?

Sure. I can -- oh, go for it. Finish your question.

industry. But it's very diﬃcult to move inside into the start something like Facebook
because to add value idea to help to the company. Because whenever we apply
through the website, it's just going into the garbage. So what is the best way? This is
true, actually. I'm sorry. But this is true like because not all the -- like the brilliant
minds, we are not coming from Stanford or like Harvard. They are from diﬀerent
universities because of some reason. But they have a brilliant mind. So how they canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

All right. So on the recruiting question, I can assure you that when people apply, that
does not go in the garbage. I mean, this is one of the biggest challenges for the
company is getting the best people in the world to join us. And we look everywhere.
We have internal referrals. We look for people who are showing initiative by applying
to us. So we can follow up afterwards on what the process is there. But I want that to
be clear that -- and I view this as one of the most important things that we need to
do as a company is to get the best people to join. We're going to recruit a lot ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantpeople over the next 5 to 10 years. We need to get -- we need to draw some very
diverse pools in order to get the talent that we need into the company to build the
things that we need to serve our community. WhatsApp. So the business strategy for
WhatsApp is -- we have the standard playbook for how we build services. First, serve
and build the community and get to scale. Second, allow businesses to come in. But
not in a way that they're paying just make it so that people can interact with
businesses in a way that's organic, right? So if people want to message a business to
get customer support or message a restaurant to make a reservation or whatever
they want to do allow that. Then step 3, is once you have a community at scale and
you have a lot of businesses on the platform at scale, then you can start to make
money from the businesses by oﬀering for them to pay to accelerate and just -- and
grow more of the interactions that they're having with people on the platform. So
when WhatsApp joined us, they had a little more than about 400 million people in
the community. They were charging $1 a year to some people in the community to
join and that the slowing down the growth rate. So we made the decision that the
most important thing to do was actually grow the community really quickly. So we
actually -- we took away the $1 charge. That way it could grow quickly on -- with the
belief that $1 charge is going to slow down growth. And over time, we hoped to
make much more money than $1 per person through it. But ﬁrst, we need to build
the community. So we took that away. And now WhatsApp has 1.3 billion people
using it. So in just that three years or so since they've joined, we've added almost 1
billion people to the service, which is, there aren't too many examples like that in the
world of that happening. So we're very happy with that result. There are a lot of
businesses that are starting to organically use WhatsApp. And that's the next phase,
is starting to build that out. Then after that, build tools that those businesses can pay
to have even more interactions with people. I would expect a lot more here over the
coming years. But the most important thing is to do this in a high-quality way so that
way we can keep on growing the community from 1.3 billion to 2 billion to 3 billion
over time because that's the opportunity, right? Is serving people and building this
community at unprecedented scale and then allowing businesses to come in. We're
not going to ever, in any part of what we do, sacriﬁce that long-term opportunity or
sacriﬁce serving our community the best we can in order to make a little bit of
money in the short term. So we're going to focus on this for the long term. And I
think this is one of the most exciting opportunities out there.

Far out.
My name is Stephen Leigh [ph]. I just have a quick question on like a single aspect of
the business, just a quick question. And that's on Instagram and the new recently
Facebook Stories. And I know that platform originally came from Snapchat, where
they had their Snapchat stories. And so when I originally saw people posting these
stories, they were posting their Snapchat user names for people to go follow them
on Snapchat and it was kind of counterproductive. And now I rarely see stories. I see
a couple of stories from like celebrities or just a couple of people here and there and
I was just wondering what your plan was. Do you have a competitive advantage over
Snapchat in Stories? And is there any, like, legal issues that you guys can run into
with Snapchat?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
So Stories has actually grown quite well, right? So this all ﬁts into the video strategy
where -- and what we found is that in feed, a lot of the videos that people want to
take -- or that you take on a day-to-day basis, you just take like a 5-second clip of
something where your dog does something funny, your kid does something funny,
your friend does something funny, you capture it. But it may not ﬁt just a short, like
3-, 5-, 7-second clip. It may not ﬁt as well in the feed when you're going through and
you're looking at links or photos, stopping and looking at that. We decided it wasn't
necessarily the ideal way for that to go. And we think Stories is actually a better
format for some of this content around video because you can create a slideshow
throughout your day of all these diﬀerent moments and then people can go
consume them whenever they want, right? So you could just stack them together.
That's why we've added Stories to a number of our diﬀerent products because we
think that just like feeds, our pretty fundamental social format at this point. So pretty
much every social company that's building an app has taken this idea of News Feed,
which we started back in 2006. I think that there's going to be a lot of the diﬀerent
stories and video formats across these diﬀerent apps. I don't think that that's -- that
there's an issue with that. In terms of succeeding in getting people to use it,
Instagram and WhatsApp are now the #1 and #2 most used story products in the
world. So it's not that everyone in the world who's using Stories for video are using
Instagram and WhatsApp. There are certainly people who are using Messenger and
Facebook and Snapchat and I'm sure there are others, too, especially in other
countries. But we're actually pretty happy with the growth there. I mean it's been less
than a year since we launched them and they've quickly scaled more than 200
million people, consuming stories a day. Many tens of millions of people are sharing
stories through this platform. It's growing very quickly. There's clearly going to be
more that we can do, both in terms of improving the quality of the cameras. But
there's network eﬀect around these things in a community dynamic which is that the
more people that you see sharing, the more likely people are to engage. So early on,
some of the content may be public content from public ﬁgures who want to take
advantage of the increased distribution that they can get from having 700 million
people on Instagram who could see their content. But as more people get used to
seeing stories and interacting with -- there, we're seeing more people sharing it as
well. So let's check back in a year and see how we're doing.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
All right. We're overtime so we're going to take one more question. I know there's a
number of people out there. So if we didn't get a chance to answer your question,
please feel free to grab one of the Facebook volunteers in the red shirts. Write down
your question or you can email investor@fb.com and we'll work to get you guys an
answer. Let's take the last question.
So I'm Chai Gosen [ph]. This is a question for Mr. Zuckerberg. I know you are learning
Chinese. Do you have any plans to get Facebook into Mainland China market? If you
do have a plan, how do you think you will win over WeChat users, which is the most
popular social media in China?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-01

Over the long term, I think this is something we will need to think about. I mean
when we talk about our mission of connecting everyone in the world, clearly, we
cannot achieve that mission without also, at some point, connecting people in China.
In the near term, there are a lot of other challenges to focus on, too. We also cannot
achieve the goal of connecting everyone in the world if we don't help connect
people who are not currently on the Internet, which is more than half of the world. So
there's a lot of stuﬀ that we need to go do. The regulatory rules in China are quite
diﬀerent. We need to ﬁgure out a way over time that we would be comfortable
operating there and that's something that I think it will be an important thing to
ﬁgure out. But we're also patient. And as I've tried to express in a number of the
answers here, I think the most important thing for us is doing things in the right way
that is going to set the community up to be best served over the long term. And we
will wait to get the opportunity that we think is the right one here. In terms of how to
compete once we're there, I think we'll ﬁgure that out -- over the long term. But I
mean without knowing how we would go in the ﬁrst place, then it's hard to know
how we would compete once we were there.
