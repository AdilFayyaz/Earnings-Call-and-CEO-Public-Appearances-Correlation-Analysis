I'm Sara Senatore, Bernstein's restaurant analyst. And I do feel very fortunate to be
joined up here by Howard Schultz, Starbucks' Chairman and CEO. We have in the
audience Starbucks' CFO, Scott Maw; and also JoAnn DeGrande, who heads up
Investor Relations.
I will introduce a company that really needs no introduction. But I'll say a few words
about Starbucks and about Howard. Then he is going to give us his vision for
Starbucks. And I think what I'd like to ask people to do is to ﬁll out some of the
question cards while you're listening.
So formed in 1985, Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer. And retailer of
specialty coﬀee in the world, operating in 65 countries. Starbucks purchases and
roasts high-quality coﬀees that it sells, along with hand-crafted coﬀee, tea. And other
beverages. And a variety of fresh food through nearly 12,000 company-operated
stores globally.
Starbucks also sells a variety of coﬀee and tea products and licenses its trademarks
through other channels, such as nearly 10,000 licensed stores, grocery. And food
service.
In addition to the ﬂagship Starbucks coﬀee brand, Starbucks also sells goods and
services under the Teavana, Tazo, Seattle's Best, Evolution Fresh, La Boulange,and
(Ethos) brands.
Howard is Chairman and CEO. He ﬁrst walked into a Starbucks in Seattle's Pike Place
in 1981. And in 1982, he moved from New York and joined Starbucks, as Director of
Operations. He left Starbucks for a short period of time to start his own coﬀee
houses but returned in August of 1987 to purchase Starbucks with the help of local
investors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

Page 2 of 19Howard SchultzHe's been Chairman since 2000. But he resumed the role of President and CEO in
January of 2008. And since his return -- I think we all know -- he's led a
transformation of the Company. Howard is also the best-selling author of For Love of
Country, Onward. And Pour Your Heart Into It.
So I know that we're all very interested to hear what Howard has to say. And I hope
to have a very robust discussion afterwards. So thank you, Howard, for being here.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you very much.
It's always humbling to hear someone describe what you've done and who you are.
In my own words, let me share with you where Starbucks is today. And probably
most importantly for all of you, where we're going.
As we assemble here today, there are approximately 22,000 Starbucks stores in 67
countries. Last week, over 80 million people passed through Starbucks stores.
We are employing over 300,000 people who proudly wear the green apron. And I
think the market cap of the Company today -- I'd asked Scott and JoAnn -- I was here
two years ago. And I think the market cap for the Company in the last two years is up
about -- over 60%. So we're pretty proud of that.
No matter how you look at the Company in so many diﬀerent ways, we've tried to
build a diﬀerent type of business -- not better than anyone else. But really diﬀerent.
And that is, trying to balance, in a fragile way, proﬁtability and shareholder value with
conscience and benevolence.
As many of you know, we're the ﬁrst company in America to provide comprehensive
health insurance way before the Aﬀordable Care Act to all of our employees; equity
in the form of stock options in this past year alone; the ﬁrst company in America to
provide free college tuition, ﬁrst for juniors and seniors. And then we came back
about four months later and opened it up to freshmen and sophomores.
We do all these things because we strongly believe that what we're trying to do is
really elevate the equity of the brand. And to do it in a way that demonstrates
authenticity and truth. But above all else, we've come to the conclusion over many,
many years that our brand is deﬁned quintessentially by the experience in our stores.
And our stores come to life by our people.
The last few years have been remarkable years for the Company. I've spent the last
day and a half, though, just looking at real estate and meeting with principals in New
York. And I can tell you that I honestly believe that our best days are ahead of us, in
terms of the growth and development, the social impact we can have, the equity of
the brand; and obviously, we strongly believe that we can maintain at least for the
next ﬁve years a minimum of 10% revenue growth along with 15% to 20% EPSFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

Page 3 of 19growth. And at the same time doing everything we can to create the kind of
innovation that is customer-facing and really, I think, diﬀerentiates us from everybody
else.
I think a good example of the innovation and what we've done in the last few years
has a lot to do with mobile technology and what we've been able to do along those
lines. Let me share that with you and speciﬁcally get into what we announced last
week with regard to our new relationship with Spotify and why that is a proxy for
what's to come.
When I was here two years ago, I began to outline a strategy of recognizing that we
were installing 2D printers in our store to be able to interface with smartphones and
speciﬁcally be able to create a mobile-payment transaction in our stores.
Not only were we one of the ﬁrst companies to recognize that opportunity. But
moreover over the last couple of years, demonstrate the velocity, the relevancy to
the fact that that is a changing component of what is driving the velocity and the
robustness of our business.
To put that in perspective, almost $2 billion was loaded either on someone's phone
or their Starbucks gift card in the Christmas quarter ending December 31. And then
over $1 billion in the quarter that followed. Nineteen % of all tender at Starbucks is
happening through mobile payment.
I don't think there's a company in the world that's doing a million mobile payments a
week. And we are approaching 20 million mobile payments a week.
Now, those numbers don't mean anything unless you can really demonstrate that it is
having an incremental eﬀect on your business. And I can guarantee you that it is.
And the reason it is, is that we cracked the code on integrating mobile payment,
mobile transactions, with a very interesting and relevant rewards program, which is
embedded in everyone's phone, which internally we call Stars as Currency.
Those Stars and the rewards of those Stars have created a level of relevancy and
stickiness and (incrementality) that we can measure very distinctly, that is driving our
business.
And if you just look at last quarter, when we had 7% global comps and 3% traﬃc,
those numbers on our base of stores is almost unparalleled. And that is also taking
into consideration that we're cannibalizing in the US about 25% to 30% of our stores
in terms of our A locations; and those stores are doing extremely well -- so much so
that in the last three consecutive years, those class of new stores are performing
better than the year before. And this last year's class of new stores is the best new
class we've had in our history.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 19But getting back to mobile payment and Stars as Currency. We believed that once
we got to scale that Stars as Currency would have as much relevancy outside of the
ecosystem of Starbucks that it has internally.
And what I speciﬁcally mean by that is that we can demonstrate to a prospective
partner that if, in fact, you rewarded your respective customers with Stars, that your
business would probably go up. And if you were in the subscription business, you
would have less churn. And you would get more customers.
So last week, we announced the ﬁrst of what I believe will be many, unique
partnerships in which the ecosystem of Stars as Currency will be external to like-
minded companies and brands whose customer base is analogous to us.
The Spotify example is this. Spotify will be buying Stars as Currency at a wholesale
level, which will provide Starbucks with a new source of revenue -- not the kind of
source of revenue that's going to move the needle. But a new source of revenue.
Those Stars will be rewarded to existing customers. But the big idea is, there will be
an incentive for new subscribers to sign up and receive Stars as rewards. The
incrementality will come as a result of the fact that the only place in the world, at
least up until today, that you can redeem those Stars is at Starbucks.
Over the next 12 to 18 months, I would suspect that we will be announcing a number
of partnerships that will be emblematic of what we did with Spotify, that will create
this external ecosystem of Stars as Currency and that also will bring added value to
those new customers in their representative relationships to that company, as a result
of being a My Starbucks Rewards member.
So this is the beginning of leveraging the ubiquity of Starbucks, the relationship we
have with millions of customers who are in our rewards program and are using their
smartphones. And obviously the iconic nature of the Starbucks brand and the
relevancy of Starbucks Stars.
New, domestically, we are still opening up many, many stores. There were many
people in this room probably a number of years ago who thought, perhaps, we were
reaching saturation. I can tell you that is not the case. Our US business is as strong as
it ever has been.
But perhaps the biggest headline for Starbucks in terms of growth and development
is what's happening in Asia-Paciﬁc and speciﬁcally in Japan and China.
I highlight Japan because we acquired that business back from our JV partner after
15 years. We have over 1,000 stores in Japan. We believe Japan can be a much,
much bigger market in terms of number of stores. And also we believe that we will
create new channels of distribution which we could not do under the relationship
with the existing partner.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 19And since we bought back the business, we are accelerating the (unit) economics of
that business. And just in the last few months, our comps and the numbers are better
as a result of our ownership.
But the big idea is what's happening in China. We've been in China now over 15
years. We have over 1600 stores in 80 municipalities. With no exception, every
municipality in which we've opened Starbucks stores has worked. The unit
economics of Starbucks China, I think, are best of class of any company doing
business in China.
And as I said to a group just a little while ago, as strong as our business is in China --
and we will have thousands of stores when all is said and done -- we have not yet
cracked the code on the (morning) day part, which is beginning to come. We are
changing behavior and educating local Chinese. And the morning day part will
certainly evolve into the business in China.
If you look at Asia-Pac as a separate business unit, in terms of the growth and
development, we are in the nascent stages of what we believe will come.
The innovation that Starbucks has had as a Company that's been in business for 40
years and public for over 22 I think has been the engine of the Company. The
innovation of store design, segmentation, identifying new need states and new day
parts as a result of what we've been able to do has given us average unit volumes
that we never believed were possible, approaching $1.5 million now.
When we went public in 1992, the average volume was $500,000. The market cap
was $250 million. And we thought we hit the lottery. I think today with 22,000 stores
and the level of innovation, the iconic nature of the brand all over the world. And
what we've been able to do, we believe that we have the license and the capability
to do many things that are beyond the four walls of our stores.
What do I mean by that? Well our CPG business is having another very strong year
domestically. We are extending that business to multiple channels of distribution
outside of the markets that we have not been in before.
As a result of the tea category, which is a $100-billion global category -- as many of
you know, we acquired Teavana. We're now integrating Teavana-branded beverages
inside Starbucks. It's the fastest-growing product segment inside Starbucks. We
believe Teavana stand-alone stores will be a big idea, not only in the US, where we
have about 330 stores, or so. But a much bigger idea in Asia, over time.
The relationship that we're building with customers as a result of Mobile Order &
Pay, which is a new idea -- we have now have 650 stores in which customers are
ordering ahead and getting their Starbucks coﬀee -- that will be nationwide before
the end of the calendar year. That's proving to be incremental, as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 19Q - Sara Senatore
A - Howard SchultzBut the information and the data that we're getting from that and what's happening
with just mobile transactions -- and then we're bringing delivery, ﬁrst to the Empire
State Building in New York City and areas of Seattle -- these are all areas that we
believe will drive incrementality into the business.
When I say our best days are ahead of us. And you think that might just be a line.
And here's the CEO standing up talking about that -- I've been in this business more
than half my life. I've never been more passionate, more enthused about what we're
doing and what I think is possible.
I also realize more than ever that we have a responsibility as a Company to not only
provide you with the shareholder value that you deserve but also to do everything
we can as a Company to bring our people along with us on this journey, to do
everything we can to support the communities in which we're doing business. And
to have signiﬁcant social impact and to demonstrate, unfortunately, that Washington
is not providing leadership that we all deserve and that businesses and business
leaders need to do more for their people and the communities we serve.
So on one hand, we are very, very proud of what we've been able to do over the last
couple of years in terms of providing shareholder value -- and we think that our best
days are ahead of us. But we also believe on a personal level that we have a lot to do
to bring our people along with us on this journey and to do everything we can for
the communities we serve.
And that goes back to the original business plan of Starbucks to achieve the fragile
balance between proﬁtability and benevolence. Thank you.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Thank you, Howard. So much ground to cover. But let me start with Mobile Order &
Pay because I think that's the thing that I get the most questions about because it's
certainly the initiative that New Yorkers are most eager to see, because -- well, the
demand is so high for Starbucks. Should we think of it in terms of the magnitude of
incrementality similar to My Starbucks Rewards? How transformative is it. And where
are you seeing the beneﬁts? Is it traﬃc, is it ticket, is it new customer adoption? Just
talk about it broadly.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
So we basically have been in two markets, Portland and Seattle. The interesting thing
about Portland and Seattle -- Seattle is performing at a higher level than Portland.
And Portland was meeting our expectations.
But the interesting thing about both those markets is, unlike New York or Chicago or
LA, those markets do not have the density in which Mobile Order & Pay would really
be a primary vehicle of satisfying the needs of our customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 19Q - Sara Senatore
A - Howard SchultzSo our own research strongly suggests that Mobile Order & Pay is going to be much
more relevant and much more incremental than it even has been in markets that
we're now in.
We have our own internal metric of what Mobile Order & Pay will do. We are
exceeding it. And it clearly will be an incremental driver of traﬃc, of throughput and
speed of service. And fun for the customers.
If you haven't seen the app -- one of the beauties of the app is, when you do order
through your phone, it prompts you and asks you whether or not you're driving or
walking. And if you're driving, it'll tell you exactly how many minutes you have to get
to the store you just ordered by. And if you're walking, it'll do the same.
It has been fun for our people. We've had no operational glitches whatsoever. It's
actually been easier than we thought. But we've been planning this for a year.
And I should also say that -- I noticed that there are other companies within the retail
food-and-beverage space that are jumping on Mobile Order & Pay and things that
we have been doing.
Without criticizing, I would just say that -- in many cases, they are bolting that on to a
system that is not integrated into the foundational IT of the company.
The beauty of Mobile Order & Pay is it sits on the IT stack foundationally of what
we're doing with mobile payment and rewards. And so will delivery.
So all of this is seamless for the customer. And we are already working on the next
evolution of innovation that will come after we roll out Mobile Order & Pay nationally.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
So when you talk about the integrated -- because it does feel like Starbucks has
certainly been ahead of the curve in restaurants, in particular, on this kind of
technological innovation -- ultimately one of the things that we saw with My
Starbucks Rewards is people -- you can use the card or you can use the app. And
people like using the app -- when we think about now -- everybody who has the app,
is this going to be seamlessly integrated, it's just going to be -- you know, we don't
have to download something new, we don't have to use it diﬀerently --?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
No. It's a seamless transaction with the customer. But I think the rhetorical question
with regard to the app and things like Spotify is, what else we're going to be able to
do to integrate Mobile Order & Pay, My Starbucks Rewards. And Stars as Currency
into a number of ways in which we're going to incent and reward our customers.
And also create unique partnerships that will beneﬁt as a result of our customer base
and the relevancy of who the Starbucks customer is.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

Would you consider partnering -- I mean, you mentioned, right now the only place
that accepts Stars as Currency is Starbucks. Is that something that you entertain the
idea of making it a broader currency and expanding it to other retailers, partners?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
I think it's a very interesting question. I think we have been very fastidious over the
years in protecting and preserving the equity of the Starbucks brand.
I think it's a natural question as to whether or not we would open that up. And if we
did -- and I'm not saying we would -- it would not happen for quite some time.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Okay. So this is -- the next (18) months, we should expect to see more things like
Spotify?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Yes. There will be a number of partnerships that we will announce that will, I think,
demonstrate the unique opportunity we have to beneﬁt from the partnerships that
are emblematic, like Spotify.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Let me shift gears just a little bit. You mentioned you've been able to seamlessly
integrate Mobile Order & Pay. And I think that's one thing that's been very
impressive at Starbucks. As the sales layers have expanded, as the technological
development has arisen, the throughput seems to keep getting better. Is there at any
point a risk -- and maybe in this context, let's talk about the food and the expanded
day parts -- is there any operational risk, or how do you ensure that this stays such a -
-?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Well it's a good problem to have, to have stores so busy. But it's not good customer
service to see lines out the door and then see some people leaving.
So what are we trying to do? I think Mobile Order & Pay is a remedy. But it's not the
total answer. The overall answer is that we have been able to develop a number of
diﬀerent types of stores, diﬀerent sizes, shapes, that meet the customers where they
work, where they live. And where they play, that in a sense has cannibalized our
stores physically. But has not cannibalized our stores in terms of business.
So a great example of that is, we were visiting -- Scott, what's the exact address?
(inaudible) -- 14 Wall Street. So we were all marveling at a new store we just opened -
- internally it's called an express store. That's not the external name -- of could weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 19basically self-cannibalize stores within Wall Street that are so busy. And what would
happen?
So we opened up this store that's less than 500 square feet 30 yards away from a
core Starbucks store. And we modeled that we would take maybe 10% to 15% away
from that store. But it was worth it to provide the service to our customers.
Now, the store has been opened, like, three weeks. I saw it for the ﬁrst time this
morning. I looked at the numbers. And I can't believe the volume and the
transactions in that store in a space that small. I had to see it myself. But the big
headline is, we've had zero cannibalization from the store 30 yards away.
So the answer, I think, is that we have been able to demonstrate in cities all across
the world that the market is much bigger than we once thought, that the demand for
Starbucks coﬀee is greater than what one store can fulﬁll. And that diﬀerent
customers have diﬀerent need states -- and the need state in the morning on Wall
Street is speed of service and throughput. And we are fulﬁlling that need.
On the other side of the equation -- many of you were in Seattle for our investor day.
And you saw the future of the Company, in terms of retail. And that is the Roastery.
For those of you who have not seen it, it's approximately 15,000 square feet. That's
10 times larger than an existing Starbucks store. We are roasting coﬀee in the store.
And we basically said, we want to create the Willy Wonka of coﬀee. And we want to
take our customers literally on a magical carpet ride.
But what we're doing in the Roastery is building a new super-premium brand called
Starbucks Reserve -- not unlike the wine industry, the fashion industry, the
automobile industry, we think we can create this super-premium experience.
It's a coﬀee-forward experience. It's more expensive. But the drama, the theater, the
romance, everything that happens in that space is at a much, much higher level.
Literally, it's like a Disney ride.
That store opened with great fanfare. It's been open over six months. The volume of
the store, the customers -- it is on ﬁre. And as a result of building the Roastery, we've
identiﬁed global cities around the world, including New York, that we will bring the
Roastery to. But we're also going to create a new business unit within Starbucks
called Starbucks Reserve Stores.
These stores will be about 3,000 square feet. We've identiﬁed about 500 units that
we can open. This is at a higher level. And we're also going to integrate Starbucks
Reserve beverages and coﬀee by the pound inside existing Starbucks stores as we
make those premium artisan coﬀees available.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

Page 10 of 19Q - Sara Senatore
A - Howard SchultzSo on one hand, you've got a 500-square-foot express store in Wall Street; on the
other hand, the other extreme is this 15,000 square-foot Roastery that is a retail-
merchant's dream in terms of the experience and the theater that's going on. And
we think that this is an opportunity to use our scale and our ubiquity for good and
demonstrate the innovation.
It also -- the Roastery is an innovation engine for other beverages, other products,
other store designs that we think will help the mothership, because it's a giant halo
on the brand. The next Roastery will open in calendar 2016. And we'll announce that
city in the months ahead.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
I think that's a good segue to a question, which is -- actually addressing the internal
process -- you know, Starbucks is a constant innovator. Can you describe how the
idea of Stars was created, discussed, ﬁnalized? Give us a little bit of -- did it spring
fully formed from your head like Athena, or was it something that was more of a
collective or over time? I guess, just give us a little window into how Starbucks
remains so relevant.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Well let me say at the outset -- I said on a conference call, probably two years ago,
that we were all witnessing a seismic change in consumer behavior. And those of us
that are in the bricks-and-mortar retail business are going to face challenges the likes
of which we've never seen, primary as a result of E-commerce and mobile shopping
-- less people in malls, less people in the street. And as a result of that, we have to
drive traﬃc.
Now, way before we talked about that publically, we were anticipating and
beginning to see it. And we have to drive innovation at all levels of the Company --
product innovation, store innovation, new concept innovation, all kinds of things.
And I would say that the innovation of Starbucks is not one person. It's not one
group. The entrepreneurial DNA of the Company, despite -- we've been in business
over 40 years -- is embedded and imprinted in who we are and what we do.
Stars as Currency came to life as a result of the fact that we wanted to create a loyalty
program that had real relevancy to our customers. We used mileage-plus and those
things as a commodity-based thing. And we said, we don't want to be -- we don't
want to create something that is commodity-skewed; we want to create something
that has real value. So if you get a Star as a gift, or you get Stars, it has a greater value
than the face value.
And I think these things just came up as a small group of people leaning in on what
we have to do to recognize that every one of us. And everyone in this room -- if we
embrace the status quo as an operating-business principle, we're heading on a
death march.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 19Q - Sara Senatore
A - Howard SchultzAnd we have to recognize that as good as we've been and as strong as our business
is, it is very fragile. And it's not an entitlement. We have to earn it and earn it every
day. And one of the ways in which we're going to overcome these challenges that
are coming as a result of consumer changes is innovative ways in which we can
exceed the expectations of our customers.
It's not one thing. It's not one group of people. It's everyone at Starbucks. And not
everything works. I think -- you know, we have failures. We fail fast and move on.
I was asked in a meeting earlier today about Flat White, where did Flat White come
from and what a great success -- and I raised my hand and said I got to be honest
with you. I was not that thrilled with what Flat White was going to be. I didn't think it
was a big idea.
I was wrong. Flat White has been a runaway success for the Company, primarily
because of the pride and the artisan nature of our partners being able to create and
customize the milk and the steaming of the milk and what they're doing with that
beverage. I underestimated what it would do. And I think there's a unique
opportunity to leverage Flat White in other ways for the Company.
But it's not one person. It's not always me. There's lots of people at Starbucks with
big ideas. And we are trying to encourage, as large as we are, a very strong
entrepreneurial aggressiveness to really doing things that people don't see.
I think one of the things we have to do as business people is, we have to see around
corners and be as curious as hell. And then having the courage and conviction to
make big bets.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
I'm glad we're talking about culture, because there are a couple questions here
about risk of succession. You've been such a, I think, very visible part of the
transformation. Can we talk about that? Do you feel like you've now entrenched
something that will allow Starbucks to remain great when and if you decide to leave?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
I think the quarterback always gets too much credit. And perhaps maybe too much
blame. But there's such great talent inside the Company.
I am deeply committed to the Company. I'm not leaving it any time soon. I'm here for
many, many years. And I've said publically before that if I had to describe Starbucks
in terms of my own relationship with the Company, it's second to my family; and if
my wife was here, sometimes she'd say, no not exactly.
But it's about love and commitment and the passion we have for what we're doing
and trying to build a great, enduring company. And we think we're just getting
started.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

And as we talk about the Company and management and the culture -- you just
brought on Kevin Johnson as the COO. Can you just talk a little bit about what he
brings to the table, how you think about the role relative to what you do for the
Company. And just some insights?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Sure. I've known Kevin Johnson for over ten years, when he was running Microsoft's
largest business. I personally recruited him to be a board member of Starbucks
seven years ago.
As a board member, he had tremendous insight and perspective about IT and
technology and was deeply involved as a board member, helping and guiding our
internal IT team and digital team on how to create the seamless interchange about
mobile payment and what ultimately became our rewards program.
As President and COO of the Company, we are very fortunate to have him. He was
the COO of Juniper. And as I said, ran a very, very large business at Microsoft.
What he's bringing to the Company is something important. And that is, whatever
business we are in, everyone in this room has to recognize that technology is driving
how our customers and consumers respond to what we're doing. He's bringing a
level of insight and perspective to IT and technology that we've never had before.
And I think in the coming months and years ahead, you will see tremendous impact
from him.
Above all else, I think we are a values-based Company and culture. He understands
the guiding principles and values of our business, as a people person and as a great
leader.
His oﬃce is connected to mine. And what I mean by that is, we have two oﬃces with
a hallway that connects our oﬃces. We're talking many, many times a day. We're co-
authoring the strategy of the future of the Company with a number of other senior
leaders.
He's traveled around the world already and immersing himself in the business and
meeting leaders and is bringing great maturity and strategic thinking to the
Company, along with another very senior person named Matt Ryan, who is the Head
of Strategy at Starbucks, who we recruited two years ago from Disney.
That combination with Scott Maw as our CFO and other people at Starbucks -- you
know, we are -- I think we recognized earlier, maybe three or four years ago, that we
had a higher ahead-of-the-growth curve, that we had to invest ahead of the growth
curve. And these things are paying oﬀ for us now, especially on the senior-talent
side.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

A - Howard SchultzThese are people who have managed and been in businesses much larger than
Starbucks and understand that growth is not a strategy but an outcome, that growth
and success can cover up mistakes and we have to do everything we can to be
anticipatory of that and drive innovation and drive the kind of growth that balances a
good strategic discipline.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Let's -- if I may, there's a question here that would I like to go back to, the Mobile
Order & Pay. This one is asking, could it have the same impact as drive-throughs
have had in the suburban markets. And I guess I'll add, are there other cities globally
where you see this as a real opportunity?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Let me go to the latter. And then I'll come back.
I think one of the real sea changes in the Company that is taking place is that,
despite the fact that we have been a global business, we pretty much manage the
business through a US lens.
With the growing nature of Asia-Pac at 5,000 stores and Europe turning around and
our business in Latin America and the opportunities we now have in India with our
partner with Tata, it quickly became obvious to us that we had to recalibrate the lens
in which we were thinking about and managing the business. And speciﬁcally, start
managing the business through a global lens.
So in practical terms, what I mean by that is, a new initiative, like Mobile Order & Pay,
or Stars as Currency, or even a new product, for that matter -- we are assembling a
group of people around the table to ask the question, how can we thread this new
initiative globally, as opposed to three years down the line start thinking about that
because it's a success?
That's going to give us great leverage, that's going to give us great local relevancy.
And that's a real sea change into the Company. So Mobile Order & Pay and mobile
transactions is now moving around the world in a way that could not have happened
a number of years ago.
In terms of comparing Mobile Order & Pay incrementally to drive-through, it's not a
fair comparison. Drive-throughs at Starbucks in many cases grew revenue by 50%
incrementally when you put a drive-through window or built a drive-through store, as
opposed to a classic retail Starbucks store.
But I do believe that Mobile Order & Pay will be a signiﬁcant driver of customer
satisfaction and incrementality. And we are so early on in terms of the features and
beneﬁts of what we will integrate into Mobile Order & Pay going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

A - Howard SchultzMobile Order & Pay in many ways is just a blocking and tackling of the opportunity.
We want to bring some bells and whistles to it and real value. And also obviously
layer on Stars as Currency and unique partnerships.
In going back to the partnerships -- just if I wasn't clear, the beneﬁt to the
partnerships is that by partnering with Starbucks, Starbucks customers will get a
value proposition as a result of their relationship with the other company, as a result
of being a My Starbucks Rewards member.
And so what we're really doing is creating separation in the marketplace not only
between us and other coﬀee retailers; but what we're doing is creating an
opportunity to drive incremental traﬃc and relationships with other companies that
make being a Starbucks customer and Rewards member much more valuable and
much more relevant going forward.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
If I may, let me weave together two themes that I think we've talked about, which is
the seismic change and how consumers consume and shop. And the growth in
China. Because I was just there. And if anything, it looks like that transformation is
happening faster in China than the US. The percentages of retail transactions online
are higher there than they are here. So how does that inform your growth strategy
there, or the extent to which you have physical locations versus the roll-out of Mobile
Order & Pay and that modality?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Well ﬁrst oﬀ, remember we've been in China more than a decade. And we've had
the opportunity to watch other companies enter and leave China and not do very
well.
The ﬁrst thing we had to do to succeed in China is ensure the fact that the leadership
in China were Chinese nationals. And so Belinda Wong, who runs the China
business, understands consumer behavior, understands the real estate, understands
the China landscape, understands government relations. And we've had many, many
years of being able to evolve Starbucks.
However, the beauty of what we're doing in China in terms of our success is, you go
to China and you walk into a Starbucks store. And it looks and feels like just like a
Starbucks store here in America, except for local relevancy on food.
We are educating and changing behavior and teaching the Chinese about coﬀee
and espresso and all the beverages that we are engaged in. And they're coming in
ways that we did not plan on.
As an example, our physical stores in China really is a third place. There are things
happening in a Starbucks China store that have surprised us over the years, because
there's no meeting places, they're living in places that are small, they have a longFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

Page 15 of 19commute. So the relevancy of a third place and the sense of community and the
iconic nature of Starbucks in China has changed the way people perceive the brand.
Twenty years ago when we went to Japan in 1996, people told me, no Japanese
person will ever carry a cup of Starbucks in the street because they would lose face.
You cannot walk through any city in Asia where Starbucks is located and not see the
ubiquity of Starbucks cups. And as a result of that -- and the reason for that is
because of the status of the brand.
Now, we have to earn that. And we have to keep making a deposit in that reservoir.
And we do that by doing everything we can. So let me give you one example -- I
know this is long-winded. Because of the one-child policy that has existed in China
for many years, the relationship that the parents and grandparents have to the child
is very, very unique is very special.
About seven or six years ago, we were having trouble not only hiring people to work
in the stores. But maintaining their tenure. And the reason was that the parents were
starting to think that perhaps this is not the career that you went to college for. Over
80% of everyone who works at Starbucks in China is a college graduate.
And so we started thinking, what can we do as a Company to tell our story and to
make sure that the families understand who we are, the values of Starbucks? So in
terms of innovation -- innovation is not only customer-facing; innovation is
employee-facing, or as we call it, partner-facing.
So over the last four years, we have done something in China that I don't think has
been done before. And that is, I go to China every year to hold annual meetings of
parents and grandparents . You've got to see it to believe it. You're laughing. But it's
no joke.
So we can't -- the room -- this room that we're in right now is too small for the
meetings we have in Shanghai and Beijing. And we will have one in (shindu) in
September. It is a giant ballroom with thousands of Starbucks partners, parents,
grandparents, who are coming to be part of the culture and values of the Company.
Now, we do that because we're trying to recognize that we need to describe who we
are and pay deep respect to the heritage of the family unit and to tell our story and
make sure the parents and grandparents know what we're trying to do to grow the
Company and take care of your people -- take care of your children.
And this has been something that the government has singled out as something
positive and that Starbucks is doing things in a very diﬀerent way than most
companies that are just there to ring the register.
That's not just what we're there to do. We want to make a diﬀerence everywhere we
do business. And we want to be as locally relevant as possible. And that is a greatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

strong and I think is going to endure.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
In China, among other countries, one of the biggest -- I think one big diﬀerence is
delivery is exploding. Could you talk about that opportunity globally. And also how
do you have quality control? Because coﬀee is simply more perishable than some of
these other products that are being delivered.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
So delivery has been something that people have asked for from us for many, many
years. And we didn't think we could get it right ourselves. We didn't know how to do
it. How do you keep it hot? But the demand for delivery has become ferocious. And
as a result of that, we started trying to ﬁnd how we could do it.
And someone discovered at Starbucks that Postmates was already delivering
Starbucks coﬀee in many cities around the country where we're located. But we were
not participating in it.
So we got involved with Postmates and did a number of tests with them. And we
ﬁgured out a way through our own technology and theirs that we could co-author a
new foundational way to deliver Starbucks coﬀee in real-time. And we also ﬁgured
out that elasticity of charging for it is something people will pay for.
So we'll launch Starbucks with Postmates in the Northwest. Then secondarily in the
Empire State Building, we're building a remote mini-commissary in the Empire State
Building where we will deliver Starbucks coﬀee ourselves and on a parallel basis will
test both Postmates and our own delivery.
I suspect that you will see us do delivery in many cities around the world as this
evolves. And we're working on ways in which we can keep it warm. We're designing
vessels in which the coﬀee be maintained in a unique way. And I can tell you that we
wouldn't do this unless we could assure ourselves that the quality and the integrity
of the product would be assured for the customer.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
I can tell you, trading desks across New York are eagerly awaiting delivery, for sure.
Since we don't have too much time, I do want to talk about channel development, K-
Cups, single-serve. And in particular is the K-Cup market (still) a growth market? Is it -
- and what other layers, maybe geographical, do you have to maintain what has
been a healthy pace of growth in that business?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Well it's no secret that we've had this wonderful partnership with Green Mountain
and Keurig?in the US. I don't know the exact statistics. But I think we have the lion'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

Q - Sara Senatoremarket share of K-Cups in America. We've shipped way over a billion K-Cups since
we've started.
That business continues to grow. And we view it, despite some of the things that
have been said about Keurig?and Green Mountain, we still view it very positively as a
growth vehicle for Starbucks in terms of Starbucks-branded K-Cups in the US.
Clearly, Nestle and (espresso) have done a wonderful job in capturing the lion's
share of that business in Western Europe. But the big prize for single-serve is going
to be Asia.
And here's the proposition. Why would somebody in any country buy a single-serve
machine if there's no brand aﬃnity to the coﬀee? And as far as I can tell, the only
global brand of coﬀee that exists at the premium level is Starbucks. The only super-
premium brand of coﬀee that exists in China is Starbucks.
And I can check oﬀ the box in all these countries. The more stores we open, the
more market share, the more quality experiences we have, the greater opportunity
we have to build a single-serve business in that part of the world.
The question will be, who are we going to build it with? And we haven't answered
that question publically. But we view the single-serve opportunity in Asia as a big
prize that will come -- and we think we're in the driver's seat because of the equity of
the brand and the aﬃnity that people have to Starbucks.
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
And is it the case, could Asia be as big a market for channel development as the US
is?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
I think Asia over the long run will be a bigger -- are you talking about single-serve
speciﬁcally?
{BIO 16508078 <GO>}
Single-serve speciﬁcally. But even more broadly, roasting (ground), you know --?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
I think single-serve will be a very, very large market. I don't know how to compare it
to the markets in Western Europe and the US. But clearly the rising middle class, the
aﬃnity they have to Starbucks, the success we've had in every market in Asia, from
Japan, to Malaysia, to Korea, to Singapore, to China, to Hong Kong, to Taiwan --
every market we have done extremely well. And all this bodes well for our ability
when, not if, we get into that business.

Page 18 of 19A - Howard SchultzRight. So let me -- we have just a minute left. I'll ask you the kind of question that I
always ﬁnd very intriguing to hear the answer. Five years from now, can you give us a
sense of what Starbucks will look like, whether it's geographical mix of the footprint,
or what your day parts look like in your existing stores, volumes -- any kind of sense
of the evolution a few years out. And I guess I'll tack on another question, which is, is
the next CEO of Starbucks working at the Company today?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Okay. Let's go back to 1992. I don't know how many of you -- probably not many
because I'm older than most people in this room -- how many of you would have
thought in 1992, when we went public -- we had 125 stores, we had one quarter of
proﬁtability. People could not pronounce the Italian words on the menu. People said,
what is a Grande? What is a Venti? What is that?
How many people would have thought that from 1992 to today we would achieve
this kind of recognition and respect in terms of the equity of the brand and the
global nature of Starbucks footprint? I suspect that -- probably not many of you.
So how did we get here? We got here literally by creating a very, very unique
experience. I mentioned earlier that -- we're in a unique business because this
beverage is inside you. It's not a piece of software. It's not a garment. It's inside you.
It's very personal.
We also demonstrated and kind of created personalization. There's 80,000 diﬀerent
ways that our people can make a beverage at Starbucks, 80,000. And so people
began customizing beverages and creating a language at Starbucks.
And you could say that in a way, we've altered the culture of food and beverage.
And for that matter, maybe the country as it relates to what Starbucks has
represented. All of this has given us the license to play and participate in diﬀerent
ways in which our customers live their life.
What we have to do as a Company is continue to make an investment in the core
foundation of the Company, which is our retail stores and our people. And the
customer experience. We do believe that there are signiﬁcant adjacencies that we
could participate in, as long as it adds value to the core experience, as long as it
makes our people proud.
When I say I think we're in the early days of the growth and development of the
business, there's obviously going to be thousands more Starbucks stores around the
world. We have a tea business that is in its infant stages. We have a vehicle in terms
of technology and mobile payment that we think will alter the state of retail and
change the way that people interact with Starbucks and other companies. And we
do believe that we have the creativity and the innovation and the entrepreneurial
spirit to do other things.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-05-27

A - Howard SchultzBut I think we should make no mistake -- we get up every single day to do one thing.
And that is invest in, preserve. And enhance the equity of the Starbucks brand. And
recognize day in and day out our ﬁduciary responsibility to meet and hopefully
exceed the expectations you have of us as principals of the business.
We are deeply, deeply excited about the future and the opportunities we have. But
this is very hard to do. At our scale, to move the needle, we need billion-dollar ideas
to move the needle.
We were doing an exercise earlier. And I think I got this number right -- so, 1%
increase in traﬃc is 10 million new customers a year -- that is right, Scott? (inaudible)
So we added 3% traﬃc last quarter. We added 30 million new customers year over
year to Starbucks.
Here's another factoid. In the US alone, we have less than 12% share of the overall
coﬀee market. We have less than 1% share of the global coﬀee market. That's how
big the opportunity is for Starbucks within our core business, not to mention the
other things we're dreaming about.
The last question -- I would hope that the next CEO is at Starbucks. But I am not
going anywhere .
