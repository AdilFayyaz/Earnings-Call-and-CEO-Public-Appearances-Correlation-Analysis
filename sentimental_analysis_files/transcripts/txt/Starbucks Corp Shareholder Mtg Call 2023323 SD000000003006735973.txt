Presentation
A green apron every day. My name is Diane Terry. I'm a 20-year partner and currently
serve as the Vice President of Beverage Research and Development and Innovation.
I'm here with my team of partners who create new exciting beverages that exceed
the expectations of our customers and our partners. We have the pleasure of kicking
oﬀ this meeting with how we start all meetings at Starbucks of coﬀee tasting.
For more than 50 years, coﬀee has been at the core of everything we do. We aim to
always honor our coﬀee heritage, while also looking ahead to what's next. Just last
month, we introduce a revolutionary new beverage platform that brings together the
unexpected, an alchemy of Starbucks coﬀee deliciously infused with a spoonful of
Partanna cold pressed extra virgin olive oil.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23

Laxman NarasimhanThe result is a velvety smooth, delicately sweet and lush coﬀee that uplifts each cup
with an extraordinary new ﬂavor. Today we're tasting Starbucks Oleato Golden Foam
Cold Brew.
Here you go Diane.
Thank you, Rosalyn [ph]. We can't wait for you to try Starbucks Oleato soon. Cheers.

Thank you Diane for that excellent coﬀee tasting. Good morning. I'm Mellody
Hobson, Starbucks independent board chair. I'm going to turn the meeting over to
our new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan here shortly. But ﬁrst, I want to take a moment to
reﬂect on my last year. This time last year, we announced Howard Schultz's return as
interim CEO while we searched for our next global leader. The entire board and I
want to sincerely thank Howard for answering that unexpected call.
Howard selﬂessly stepped back in and help reset the company leading in the service
of our partners while putting aside his own personal pursuits and doing so without
any compensation. In this last year, with Howard, we have launched a reinvention.
We've continued investing in our partners, our stores, and the experiences for our
customers. The over $1 billion in partner investments alone is paying dividends and
retention and engagement from our most important partners on the front line.
The company saw a 47% stock price increase between our Q2 FY 22 earnings call
through the Q1 FY 23 earnings call. And we saw market cap growth of approximately
$40 billion during that same time. We also delivered 50% in total shareholder
returns in this time period, far outpacing the S&P 500 while remaining one of
Fortunes most admired brands, Howard, you helped drive this and on behalf of the
board, thank you for this work and for your love of our company.
Thank you for the passion and your visionary leadership, not the least of which is the
new innovation in Starbucks Oleato being brought to the U.S. this week. Everyone is
very excited. We are forever grateful. You will always be connected to our company.
You will always be our founder. With great enthusiasm and optimism for the future of
Starbucks, I now turn the meeting over to our new leader.

Page 3 of 28Unidentiﬁed Participantwelcome and thank our over 400,000 partners around the world who serve over 100
million Starbucks customers every year.
Over the past six months, I've enjoyed a unique CEO transition of spirits. I came in
with no P&L responsibilities, no direct reports, no budget, no power, nothing. It was
liberating. My sole focus has been on immersing in the business and the culture of
Starbucks with our partners and stores, with a geographic and licensed partners, our
supply chain, our farms, and our support centers around the world.
This unique emotion has given me an opportunity to really understand what it means
to wear the green apron. I'm proud to say I've oﬃcially learned how to make a great
French press. And even a triple tall, blonde, extra whip, pumpkin spice latte. And
along the way, I received some invaluable advice.
(Video Begins)
I got to train that upcoming CEO of Starbucks. They're like, oh really, like how was it?
He loves interacting with people. He loves laughing and making people laugh. And
he just wants to learn and be the CEO that's there for us.
I trust this company and I trust my partners,. When I get to meet Laxman, the ﬁrst few
minutes, seconds that I saw him that he gave me the big hug is not someone who
might just want to give me hug. He gave me a hug to say I got you. You know, we got
to (inaudible).
He's curious and coming out this with understanding and like seeking to like
understand his role even in all of this. I think that's what we're all doing, you know. So
I think that's cool to see that, like, we're going to make mistakes, but we're making
mistakes as a team. And like, if we have wins, we're making wins as a team.
The new leader of our company understands what supply chain needs to do. So, I
can feel a bit relaxed and so can my team, that our voice is at the table and he said it
wasn't for free. He said to us that in return for an investment and the understanding
and giving us the tools that we need to succeed, we need to be better. And I love
that. And then he told the team that that's what he needed from them and that's
what he was going to hold them accountable for. And that accountability is really
important, really motivating for me and exactly the sort of thing my team want to
hear.
And he wanted to get straight into making lattes. And it reminded me of all of my
ﬁrst day partners who are curious and do want to go ahead and want to take a step
ahead. And, you know, it all comes with time and scheduled chips, but I deﬁnitely
saw that he was excited to be here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23

So lovely. Just so lovely. The immersion has been an incredible journey for me, a gift
really. Working with Howard and our partners to learn the strengths of the company
and the possibilities ahead. As the new CEO of Starbucks, I am conﬁdent that I know
our business and our people well, but I will continue to learn. And I'm excited to
continue earning my green apron every day.
These past six months have enabled me to listen, to learn, and to think about what
the future of Starbucks looks like, and what we need to do to get there. I've spent a
lot of time with Howard and our leadership team in Seattle, in our origin at Hacienda
Alsacia in Costa Rica, in Europe, in Japan, and most recently, in New York, in our
Empire State building store.
We talked about why we exist as a company and what we were looking to build
together. We explore the extraordinary impact Starbucks has made over the last 50
years and the many opportunities that lie in front of us. Here's what I've observed in
the process. First, we have limitless potential, but we need to address what limits us.
Second, our performance is strong, but our health needs to be stronger. Third, we
strive to be a diﬀerent kind of company, and that is unchanged.
But we now operate in a diﬀerent kind of world. We know millions of people around
the world feel isolated and feel alone. If you've socially excluded, they crave
meaningful connection. At Starbucks, it's always been our mission to create
connection, to create human connection over a cup of coﬀee. And I believe even
after 50 years, we've only scratched the surface. We will continue to embrace the
humanity that guides Starbucks.
We will imagine, we will innovate, we will iterate and we will fought for the scale. We
will honor our rituals. We will learn, we will grow. We will teach. We believe, and we
will embrace rigor with vigor. In our journey to become limitless, our leadership
team is looking at that which limits us.
The idea of Starbucks is to bring people together over a cup of coﬀee. It's that
simple.
I think what Laxman brings into the organization is he continues to bring forward the
culture and the heritage every single day. But he's also asking the challenging
questions. He's pushing the status quo and making us really revisit and think about,
are we doing everything that we can to support our partners every single day? Are
we solving the things that matter most that will uplift the experience of our partners?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 28Over the last year we've embraced this idea of reinvention and I think it's helped to
reboot the company.
And we've seen across our business proof points. We've seen our turnover reduce,
our stability increase, we've seen sentiment start to turn in a more positive direction.
Tech is more stable than it was a few months ago. We've put in things with our
operation partners like tipping, which allows our customers to reward amazing
service by our partners.
We announced over $1 billion in investments in the overall partner experience. That's
shown up with the introduction of new beneﬁts, that shown up with increases in their
pay.
The thing that I'm most excited about is Clover Vertica. And the solution was really
developed with partners who helped us come up with the system. For many of our
customers who fell in love with Starbucks originally because of a great brewed cup
of coﬀee. This is going to be a real moment for us to invite them back or help them
remember, you know, what it was from the very beginning.
People will think of us as a coﬀee house, but they don't realize that we actually
design and work to inﬂuence the whole equipment industry for food service. Our
customer for us is actually the barista. The barista is our number one. Working in the
store is very diﬃcult and we're really trying to help that out.
Last year they brought us a new coﬀee machine into our store. It's called the Clover
Vertica. And we were very much excited to not have to have that timer clip to us, to
not have to batch and brew every 30 minutes, to not be wasting an entire urn of
coﬀee. We were able to oﬀer a variety of coﬀees to people that normally wouldn't
get that opportunity. I just went to Costa Rica and got to experience the origin
experience and I saw how hard it was to harvest coﬀee beans. People are the heart
of Starbucks. We have harvesters. We value their eﬀorts. And the Clover Vertica is
going to ensure that we can give a great cup of coﬀee without the waste.
So just last year, we were fortunate enough to win a couple of pretty major industry
design awards, which we're super proud of, because we had a really meaningful
problem to solve. How do we keep the feeling of coﬀee craft and the sensory
experience? How do we eradicate a lot of waste at the scale that Starbucks is? You
know, we're eliminating 200 million paper ﬁlters a year, right? We're reducing waste
overall by 70 percent. That's our goal.
This is the fastest bean to cup brewer in the industry. So now we're getting to a point
where we're going to be rolling this out to thousands of stores across the nation.
We're really proud of the impact that we can have festivals [ph] for a partner
experience, for customer experience and how this really highlights kind of coﬀee
leadership and craft borrows [ph] as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 28We push the industry to do certain things that they're not comfortable doing right,
because they always make the same coﬀeemaker. We don't push for what our goals
are as a company. You know, environmental impact accessible, make things simple
for the partners, it won't happen. So that's why we do this, we push.
We just announced more grants to uplift a million women and girls around the world
in origin countries. We've just put into place outreach workers in the U.S. to support
our stores, keep them safe and help on the mental crisis that's happening in
America. We will half our water consumption by 2030. In green coﬀee, we will, you
know, carbon neutral company.
The renewal of coﬀee masters where all of our partners have the opportunity all over
the globe to get deeply intimate with coﬀee on their black apron and really be part
of our future. It's incredible. This year has been the return to origin experience.
Almost a thousand partners that have been to Costa Rica and are heading on to
Sumatra or Rwanda, to put their hands in the soil. So they come back sharing their
experiences their love for coﬀee, the responsibility that they feel to the company, to
farmers, and to the future. And it's a really powerful moment that we're in right now.
And the momentum is with us on coﬀee.
'The biggest takeaway I have from this trip…
We brought Starbucks partners from across the U.S. and Canada to our farm,
Hacienda Alscacia, to immerse them in the story of coﬀee.
Most of my time with Starbucks have been inside stores. So being here and seeing
what the ﬁrst 10 feet looks like, really kind of closes the loop as far as my whole
journey.
I'm an SCAP student studying sustainability, and being here really means that I get to
see from the production standpoint and the sourcing standpoint, how we do what
we do, how we do better for the environment, how we do better for our partners,
how we do better for our customers.
Meeting Carlos and it was just so amazing. In the same way that I built my
community, my store (inaudible) I see Victor [ph], building his community here.
I think the other thing that's really sticking with me, is just how bold this whole idea
is. The open source agronomy idea, and the way that we're giving so much out
doing so much for the sustainability of coﬀee and so many people who are thinking
25, 30 years out.
Reinvention was taking a lot of the feedback that we have from our partners and
truly trying to bring us into a place of how do we get back to level.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 28When history is written it will be looked at as really the down payment and the step
that we needed to take to now move towards the idea of being limitless.
We are now in over 85 markets. We have about 18,000 stores and internationally we
actually have about 200,000 partners. And what people may not realize is that
actually more stores outside of the U.S. and in the U.S. To be a limitless company
means to unleash the full potential of what the company can be.
We are ready to hire 35,000 more new partners to join us. We will be oﬀering
thousands of promotion opportunities to existing partners. Our partners will be able
to develop their career and realize their aspirations with Starbucks China.
It's a signal both internally and externally that a new Starbucks is poised to begin.
We start always with deep gratitude and appreciation for our partners. They are the
catalytic engine that makes this place work.
This is ours to look forward to and to create the future. So, it's honoring the heritage.
It's honoring the past, but it is absolutely recognizing that the path forward will be
diﬀerent.
It's about using our skill for good. It's about reaching as many communities as many
people across this planet as we possibly can to uplift them.
Being open minded and listening across our partner base, across our customer
base, across your shareholder base.
To be limitless is continue to ﬁnd ways to innovate in the partner experience to
unlock and enable our partners to reach their full potential within the organization.
A limitless Starbucks to me would look like, you know, walking into a store and
meeting each and every customer where they're at.
For us in technology, it means powering limitless innovation and being able to scale
all the great ideas that are going to take us into this limitless future faster and further
than anyone else in the globe.
I think for long corporate aﬀairs, people see us as the department of no, N-O. I really
want us to be the department of know, K-N-O-W. And so it presents opportunities for
us to really just open up and take on diﬀerent risks and see where things can lead.
Coﬀee can be rich to bring diﬀerent cultures together. Starbucks China has limitless
opportunities to share our coﬀee passion, with many more new customers in China.
That's going to mean huge and massive business opportunity to impact the world
through human connection.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23

Page 10 of 28Limitless. What it's not about is asking our partners in retail to work harder or faster.
It's about what more is it that we could be doing really to create an environment
where our partners can be at their very best.
What limits us today may vary from store to store, country to country. But
consistently, what I have found is that our stores were built for a diﬀerent era. So
much in our business has changed. New digital channels. More customers are on the
go. They're increasingly coming to Starbucks through a drive thru or through mobile
order and pay or delivery. They're increasingly customizing their beverages. They've
shifted from more hot beverages to cold beverages. And with all of that comes
complexity.
We know if there's even a moment of disruption or you can't place your order for
your favorite Starbucks beverage on your mobile app, it's going to be a
disappointment to our customers and of course disruption in our stores.
In my profession, they go to budgets limit us or ﬁnancials limit us, but I actually
disagree with that. Because if we really look at our strategies, and if we execute well
on those strategies then ﬁnancials come to life,
As we have grown, it's become a little more siloed and one thing that I found really
exciting about the last six months in the last 12 months is going back to the notion
that we can do things better together as a team.
And now we're ready to re-found this company, and to really truly bring the essence
of all that we are in the abilities that we have to bear into a new stage for a new
world that we all are seeking to lean in.
I think re-founding is about really carrying forward what is unique about Starbucks,
which is our culture and our heritage and our rituals. But it also is about challenging
ourselves to ask the tough questions. Laxman says, did you earn your green apron
today?
There was a renewed optimism, a renewed commitment to what we're doing. So it's
not just about the new products, but it's about how we engage in the communities.
It's about how we use our stores. It's about the combination of the products in our
stores that create connection. And so the limitless potential for international is about
the impact and reach that we can have in every community around the world.
When I look to the future, it's really all about, you know, our support partners,
thousands of them really working on behalf and in collaboration with our retail
partners to solve the problems that they're experiencing. And really, you know, the
most succinct way I can't articulate that is to make the job easier to support them and
serving customers and to have fun while they're doing it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 28When I think about limitless, I think about in society, the biggest most consequential
things happen when we work together and when we come together as people in a
common goal. And at Starbucks, limitless to me means human connection, ﬁnding
new ways to connect people and unlock the magic of what happens when people
connect genuinely.
In many respects, what people look for Starbucks and more important the salary to
represent is a connection point to the greater things that are ahead. And if we as
people who are leading this company can truly ensure that others are able to
embrace what it means to be a founder that you are a holder to the keys of the
future, and to allow for us all to run in the same direction, it is my hope not only that
limitless comes to bear, but that becomes the standard in which other companies
will measure themselves against too, as well.
Wherever you work in this company, you are a part of our future, and you're a part of
the success we'll all enjoy together. But for all of our partners, this is a new journey.
This is a new adventure, leaning to it because there's so much fun ahead, there's so
much excitement ahead. And it just takes up all leaning in together.
When we are at our best, we work closely with our partners to make their lives better.
At our best, we uplift our customers every day. At our best, we contribute positively
to our communities around the world. At our best, we ensure the future of coﬀee for
all with our farmers. At our best we give to the Earth more than we take.
And it's this balance that the science stands for. And it is this balance that results in
us generating long term returns for our investors. This is our promise. The work of
the re-founding of Starbucks is well underway. With every cup, with every
conversation, with every community we nurture the limitless possibilities of human
connection. So, with all of you, here we go. Thank you
Hey, guys, how are you? How are you? Thank you for coming into Starbucks. David,

commission a report examining any cost to Starbucks reputation and any impact on
its projected sales incurred as a result of its ongoing upcharge on plant-based milk.
The report should address the risks and opportunities presented by the shift in
public opinion regarding dairy versus non-dairy options, including but not limited to
the aforementioned issues. Given the urgency of the matter, the board should
summarize and present its ﬁndings to shareholders by the end of the third quarter of
the current ﬁscal year. The report should be completed at a reasonable cost and
omit proprietary information.

since the 1970s and this downward trend is expected to continue.
The non-dairy milk market however, is projected to grow from over $25 billion in
2022 to over $61 billion by 2029. Factors driving this growth include taste, lactose
intolerance and environmental concerns. Research shows that 82% of people who
consume plant-based milk do some because they prefer the taste. Many individuals
cannot tolerate cow's milk. Between 50 to 100% of the non-white population suﬀers
from lactose intolerance. Non-whites currently comprise nearly 40% of the U.S.
population and that segment is growing, meaning that more and more people may
not visit Starbucks or avoid drinks that include milk because of the current upcharge
on non-dairy milk.
More than half of surveyed individuals choose non-dairy milk for environmental
reasons. Starbucks admits that dairy milk is the biggest contributor to its carbon
footprint and the second highest contributor to water usage. Cattle, including dairy
cows account for roughly 40% of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, and it
takes 144 gallons of water to produce just one gallon of dairy milk.
In comparison, plant-based milks produce less than one-third the CO2 emissions
and require up to 90% less water to produce. Given the escalating popularity of non-
dairy milk, it is reasonable for shareholders to request an analysis of the potential
cost or accompany of the current upcharge on non-dairy milk with regard to public
relations and lost sales. Accordingly, we urge all shareholders to support this
resolution.

Thank you, Jacqueline. For the reasons outlined in our proxy statement, the board
has recovered ended a vote against the shareholder proposal. Starbucks is
committed to a resource positive future and to expanding our plant-based in plant
forward menu items globally. The price for plant-based milk customization varies by
market, with certain markets already oﬀering plant-based milks at no extra charge. As
with all of our product oﬀerings, Starbucks continuously evaluates the market for and
the price of our plant-based menu items, including plant-based milk customizations.
We believe commissioning a separate report on the impact of our pricing strategy
for plant-based milk customizations would divert resources from our ongoing eﬀorts
to expand plant-based options for our customers.
The sixth item of business is the shareholder proposal regarding a CEO succession
planning policy amendment submitted by SOC Investment Group and Leo Martin

Group to present the proposal.

Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 16 of 28Jennifer KraftGood morning. My name is Cynthia Simon. On behalf of the SOC Investment Group
and our co-founder Leo Martin, I hereby move proposal six urging the board of
directors to strengthen its CEO succession planning policy. While the board has
adopted several provisions requested in the proposal, they have left out two critical
components. The proposal requests that the board begin succession planning in
earnest at least three years in advance of an anticipated succession.
This gives the board time to take ﬁnal steps to prepare an internal candidate, recruit
and perform due diligence on outside candidates and ensure there is time for the
outgoing CEO to help onboard the incoming CEO. We note that our proposal does
not prevent Starbucks from beginning succession planning earlier than three years,
but as a minimum standard aligned with best practice.
The proposal also asks the board to develop metrics or standards to annually
evaluate the succession planning process, having some measure by which the board
is assessing its performance to be beneﬁcial in ensuring the eﬀectiveness of its
process. These metrics might include for example, percent of leaders with a ready
now successor, promotion rates, career path ratio, and diversity rates.
Succession planning is one of the most important responsibilities of our board of
directors. Several indicators in the recent succession point to a deﬁcient process.
They include the mere three week notice to investors of Kevin Johnson's impending
retirement, the lack of any internal candidates with the requisite skills, the need for
Howard Schultz to return as interim CEO, and launch of the reinvention plan prior to
Mr. Narasimhan start as incoming CEO.
The board had several years of advanced notice of Johnson's impending retirement
and yet seemed unprepared, waiting until only a year before Johnson's
announcement to begin its search. We believe the board would have beneﬁted from
starting this process sooner. A more robust succession policy that includes a
requirement that planning begin at least three years prior to an anticipated CEO
transition and metrics to annually evaluate the process helps ensure that the board
will focus more on succession planning going forward. These requirements are not
overly onerous and would enhance the board's process. We therefore urge
shareholders vote for proposal six. Thank you.
{BIO 18885037 <GO>}
Thank you, Cynthia. For the reasons outlined in our proxy statement, the board has
recommended a vote against this shareholder proposal. As referenced in our proxy

Page 17 of 28Paul ChesserThe seventh item of business is the proposal submitted by the National Legal and
Policy Center regarding an annual report on company operations in China. We will
now hear from Paul Chesser, director of the Corporate Integrity Project, a
representative of the National Legal and Policy Center to present the proposal.
Good morning. Corporate Integrity is exactly what our proposal, proposal number
seven is all about. We're asking for Starbucks to provide shareholders a simple
report that discloses a signiﬁcant risk it bears as a consequence of its extensive
presence and its aggressive plans for expansion in oppressive and dictatorial
communist China. The company opposes our proposal by pointing out that it
already provides enough risk disclosures in its boilerplate, jargon riddled 10k annual
report that reveals the minimal amount possible.
In opposing our resolution Starbucks claims and alleged commitment to human
rights by pointing out that it follows statements that are toothless, published by fairly
worthless organizations like the U.N., the OECD, and other ineﬀective NGOs. So
needless to say, these so-called disclosure steps are insuﬃcient in light of one, what
we're asking for, and two, the seriousness and severity of what we are witnessing the
geopolitical menace that is communist China.
If our fellow shareholders check the SEC ﬁlings for Starbucks, they will ﬁnd a report
that we submitted on March 7th, which provides extensive justiﬁcation for our
proposal, and I daresay discloses far more about the risks to Starbucks from China
than what the company itself discloses anywhere. But of course, the company has far
more internal information about its business in China than we had to go on and they
just don't want to share it with you. They also don't want to upset the Chinese
government and dictatorial Chairman G. as Howard Schultz has spent decades
genuﬂecting before the CCP in order to earn the right to do business there.
If you doubt their corporate America needs to ingratiate itself with loathsome
dictators in order to do business in communist countries, just ask the NBA, which
was banished from China for a time when one of its team executives simply tweeted
in support of Hong Kong. You don't dare cross Chairman G.
So, a report like what we request almost certainly wouldn't be received well in
Beijing. Perhaps it's no accident that the U.S. State Department released its annual
human rights report for China earlier this week, which found, quote -- genocide and
crimes against humanity occurred during the year 2022 against predominantly
Muslim leaders and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in
Xinjiang, China -- end quote.
I will end my remarks with a question. Why did Mr. Schultz close all his stores ﬁve
years ago for a half day for racial sensitivity training for all employees and overturn
Starbucks common sense restroom use policies over an isolated incident in
Philadelphia, but he in the company remains silent over a pervasive and proven
human rights disgrace in communist China. Thank you for your attention.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23

Thank you, Paul. For the reasons outlined in our proxy statement, the board has
recommended a vote against the shareholder proposal. Starbucks does not believe
that the report requested by the proponent would beneﬁt our shareholders as a
publicly traded company. Starbucks is already subject to comprehensive and
ongoing disclosure requirements to our shareholders, which include disclosure
about our operations in China to the extent that they are material to our business.
Given our existing disclosure obligations, current public reporting and our
enterprise risk management program, we do not believe a separate report, as
proposed by the proponent is beneﬁcial to or in the best interest of our
shareholders.
The eighth item of business is the proposal submitted by Trillium Asset
Management, the New York City Comptroller Brad lander, PIRC and SHARE together
on behalf of various shareholders regarding an assessment of worker rights
commitments. We will now hear from Michael Frerichs, Illinois State Treasurer who is
representing the shareholder proponents to present the proposal.
{BIO 16702325 <GO>}
Good morning, Madam Chair, members of the board, and fellow shareholders. My
name is Michael Frerichs, the Illinois State Treasurer. I'm here to present proposal
eight which requests a worker's rights assessment commissioned by the board.
Proposal was submitted by Trillium Asset Management, the New York City Retirement
Systems, the PIRC and SHARE.
Proposal eight is not only about workers fundamental lights, it is also about the
board's responsibilities. Speciﬁcally the responsibility to make sure Starbucks
operates in accordance with its own stated policies and values. As Chair Hobson has
expressed and I quote -- the board's role in ensuring compliance with company
policy cannot be overstated. It is the board's responsibility to set the tone at the top
and ensure that the company operates with integrity and in compliance with all laws
and regulations. This means developing and implementing eﬀective policies and
procedures -- end quote.
To its credit, Starbucks has strong human rights policies. It is committed to the U.N.
guiding principles on business and human rights, the women's empowerment
principles, the ILO core labor standards and other relevant frameworks. These
commitments are central to Starbucks mission to be people positive investing in
humanity and the well-being of everyone we connect with.
Recent events have called into question whether Starbucks is actually living up to its
commitments speciﬁcally its explicit commitments the fundamental rights of
employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining. This includes the
right to form or join a union without management interference. We note that amongFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23

Just weeks ago, a judge now Starbucks 4 [ph] and I quote egregious and
widespread misconduct demonstrating a general disregard for the employees
fundamental rights. Investors are not only concern about the many serious
allegations, the company has violated U.S. Labor Laws, there were also concern that
Starbucks has violated its own fundamental human rights commitment.
The apparent misalignment between Starbucks public commitments and its
reported conduct creates material, reputational, legal and operational risks to the
company and may impact the company's long-term value. Proposal 8 oﬀers the
board an opportunity to prioritize compliance that hold the company's commitments
to its employee's fundamental rights and address increasing risks to the company
and shareholders.
Chair Hobson has tell [ph] you that she understands ﬁrsthand the importance of
unions and protecting workers rights and ensuring they're treated fairly. With the
leadership of Chair Hobson and support of the entire board, Starbucks can
demonstrate to shareholders that it takes its human rights commitment seriously,
adheres to them and is focus on the company's long-term success. Thank you.
{BIO 18885037 <GO>}
Thank you, Michael. For the reasons outlined in our proxy statement, the board has
recommended a vote against the shareholder proposal. We believe that our partners
are the heart of the Starbucks experience. The board works with management to
invest in our partners health, well-being and success to create a cultural belonging
which is centered around putting our partners ﬁrst and where everyone is welcome.
Starbucks partners’ voices and concerns are top priority for both management and
this board. We continue to believe that together with our partners, we can build a
company deﬁned by dignity and respect for each other and our planet. Starbucks
has commenced eﬀorts to perform a human rights impact assessment which will be
conducted by independent third-parties including those with appropriate subject
matter expertise with respect to the deeper level of review of the principles or
freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
We expect to make the results of the human rights impact assessment available to
shareholders, stakeholders and other interested parties by the end of our 2023
Fiscal Year, subject to privileged considerations. The ninth and ﬁnal item of business
is the proposal submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research
regarding the creation of a board committee and corporate sustainability.
We will now hear from Scott Shepard, Director of the Free Enterprise Project, a
representative of the National Center for Public Policy Research to present the
proposal.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)

The company's opposing statement underscores just how much it needs a board
ﬁnancial sustainability committee, one that will review and questions Starbucks's
political and social commitments to see how they undermine company proﬁtability
and growth. Starbucks other so-called sustainability commitment supporting the
company's revenues and prospects at risk to advance executives and directors’
personal policy preferences.
This puts our company's executives and directors at risk of personal liability as well,
so you really should listen up. The company, again, asserts that it's using shareholder
assets to advance racial and social equity. For employees, this means that the
company is actively discriminating in hiring and promotion on the basis of race and
ethnicity in plainly illegal ways, justifying its conduct by relying on the assurances of
the hardly objective and unbiased Eric Holder, former Obama administration
Attorney General.
This discrimination is occurring even when the group is being discriminated against
are already statistically underrepresented at the company. This is illegal and its
dumb. It violates the directors and executives ﬁduciary duties and it shrinks company
value by hiring on basis other merit and by creating reputational and litigational
risks.
The company's quest for equity has also led it to open its shops to be America's
public bathrooms and to support left wing social policies that reduce policing and
increase incentives for criminal and dangerous behaviors, both in the communities
where Starbucks dumb policies are implemented and in stores themselves,
especially the bathrooms. This has cascading negative eﬀect on company's
sustainability.
Employees must clean up drug users needles and other dangerous artifacts. They
must deal with and try to work around the often disrupted and dangerous non-
customers who have settled in its Starbucks shops. Customers are driven to safer
and cleaner places to buy overpriced coﬀee. The company claims that these
initiatives advances its third-wave [ph] vision for Starbucks but in truth they
undermined that plan.
Starbucks stores can't be a third place for customers if they don't come, because the
stores are dangerous. And they can't be a third place for anyone, if they closed,
because they become too dangerous for employees and therefore potentially too
damaging to the company. In fact, the stores can even serve as the national
bathroom under those conditions. The company pooh-poohs our proposal by noting
that it has opened 100 of stores while only closing about two dozens so far.
But CEO Howard Schultz has admitted that there will be more closing exactly where
the social policies he's pushed or playing out. There are also quasi-closes as when
chairs and tables are removed from stores to combat the eﬀect of Schultz's policies,
thereby totally undermining the supposed third place justiﬁcation for those policies.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23

behind an Orwellian sustainability label it has desperately needed.
{BIO 18885037 <GO>}
Thank you, Scott. For the reasons outlined in our proxy statement, the board has
recommended a vote against the shareholder proposal. Starbucks is committed to
creating a welcoming and inclusive environment in advancing racial and social
equity.
Because the Starbucks board of directors and its nominating and corporate
governance committee have eﬀective oversight over sustainability issues and have
disclosed our commitment to further our eﬀorts with intention, transparency and
accountability publicly, we do not believe that establishing a separate corporate
sustainability committee is necessary to properly exercise its oversight of this
important area nor was such a commitment at the Starbucks existing commitment to
corporate sustainability.
That concludes the matter we voted on as outlined in the notice of annual meeting.
In accordance with our bylaws, I hereby declare the polls for voting at our 2023
annual meeting closed. Our board will carefully consider the results of all
shareholder voting. In addition in connection with the annual meeting, we engage
numerous shareholders representing more than 25% of our outstanding shares and
receive feedback on a variety of topics including those presented for consideration
by shareholders today.
We look forward to continued engagement with our shareholders in the months
ahead. The results of voting on the proposals are still being tabulated by Broadridge
and are not yet ﬁnal. We will report the ﬁnal voting results of today's meeting on the
Form 8-K ﬁled with the SEC without four business days following this meeting. That

Thank you, Laxman. We received some great questions for the group today. Many
were around similar themes, so we pulled the ones that were representative to make
sure we got everything covered.
So, Laxman, the ﬁrst question is for you. How was the transition to CEO been?
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Well, thank you for the question. As you saw, over the past six months we have
designed a unique transition (inaudible) through an immersive experience. I've
learned the business and the culture of Starbucks from our founder and from our
green apron partners around the world.
Since January, leadership responsibility has been handed to me and we did the
transition on March 20th to CEO, so I could lead today's meeting. I've learned about
our business and our people and I'm continued -- I'm excited to continue earning

A - Zabrina Jenkinsconnection to union representation. One of the most important decisions any
employee or in our case partner can make is whether or not they're going to
represent it by union or maintain a direct partnership with us.
As such, it's important that our partners have the information that they need to aptly
participate within a democratic process of voting and engaging with both their store
and also partner experience. Furthermore, we believe our partners’ voice should be
heard and be exercised, doing [ph] election process, whether that be for or against
union representation.
Given this background and understanding, we will not be entering into a neutrality
agreement because it would prohibit the ability for us to talk openly and freely with
our partners, provide them with the information that they need about the value and
importance of direct relationship with us and how it could change under union
representation. Moreover, virtually every neutrality agreement that is issued will
contain a provision called card check.
In a card check process, union gains representation and recognition by signing of
cards versus a secret ballot election. This would deny our partners the right to vote
on whether or not they should be represented by union or not. This is a key issue for
-- of the 289 stores that had voted to unionize in our company, 94.2% of them have
done so with an aﬃrmative vote by minority of our partners.
Let me explain, the average store will have between 20 to 25 individuals within that
store partners. Those partners, if -- when they vote, they will have a situation where a
minority of partners, say for instance six, will vote and maybe four will vote for, two
[ph] will vote against and the majority will not vote.
If we were to enter into a neutrality agreement, we will be suppressing the ability for
those who didn't vote or make a determination that may not be in align with their
experience, their expectation or their choices. To be clear, we respect every partner's
right to to organize and lawfully engage in union activities, which is why we believe
that we must aﬃrm our partner's ability to vote in election and have access,
information they need to make an informed decision. Thank you again for the
question.

Thank you for the question. First, we believe that it is Starbucks's responsibility to
work alongside coﬀee farmers to improve their livelihoods, whether they sell to us or
not. Together, we hope to help farmers increase our productivity, quality of life and
the proﬁtability by developing solutions that support both people and our planet.
For example, Starbucks pays premiums that support farmer proﬁtability above
commercial market price. These premiums are driven by the fact that we buy
premium quality coﬀee that is veriﬁed as ethically sourced by C.A.F.E. Practice
standards, which is one of the coﬀee industry's very ﬁrst set of ethical sourcing
standards when we launched it in 2004.
These practices are design to promote transparent, promote transparent, proﬁtable

Thank you, Michelle. And another question for you. Why does Starbucks charged
more for alternative milks?
{BIO 20642917 <GO>}
Great, thank you. And I think as Jennifer mentioned, the price for plant-based milk
customization does vary by market and depends on a mix of considerations. In some
geographies, the market conditions do allow us to price plant-based milk much
more closely to dairy milk than in others.
For instance, there's currently no additional charge for customizing beverages with
plant-based milk and company operated markets in the United Kingdom or Japan,
even in the United States, we're adding a slash [ph] of any plant-based milk to
brewed coﬀee, iced coﬀee, cold, brew and our Americana beverages as oﬀered to
our customers free of charge. Thank you.
Thanks Michelle. Sara, question for you. What is Starbucks doing to ensure that its
employees in the U.S. are receiving fair and equitable compensation for their work?
{BIO 20201199 <GO>}
Kevin, thank you for the question. I'll start by saying that from the very beginning
Starbucks has made it a priority to invest in its people. This past Fiscal Year alone, as
Zabrina had mentioned, Starbucks invested more than $1 billion, really focus on our
partner experience in the form of wage and training investments.
These investments have enabled us to bring our ﬂoor to $15 an hour for our partners
across the country. Our starting wages rang from $15 an hour to $24 an hour and our
average hourly rate across the U.S. is $17.50 an hour. If you include all of the available
beneﬁts which -- and [ph] has rated number one as -- for Starbucks as any retailer in
the country, it provides an additional $10 of value to our partners per hour.
So if you take our national average of $17 an hour and 50 cents plus the average
value of beneﬁts of $10 an hour, it brings a value to our partners to $27 an hour and
50 cents. In addition, I would add that we recently completed our rollout of digital
tipping across all eligible stores. This is giving our customers more ways to show
their appreciation to our partners.

When we look at Starbucks over the years, what we've seen is that our brand is
considered an aﬀordable luxury and that is supported by our customers. And that's
actually created by the incredible experience that our partners create for our

A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerKevin, thank you for the question. We've been in China for more than 20 years. We
remained optimistic about the region. Our belief in China which is Starbucks's
second largest market is based on our belief in our partners, our success in the
country and our commitment to playing the long game.
When COVID disruptions abate, we are conﬁdent that Starbucks will emerge not
only as the undisputed leader in our category but likely the number one western
consumer brand in the country. I just want to make a callout to our team in China.
Our team in China has been through a lot over the course of the last three years.
And what we are seeing now, particularly as COVID abates, is you're seeing a real
turn in our business as the country returns to a post-COVID state. I celebrate their
resilience and how they're rebuilding the business coming from where it was over
the course of COVID.
Thank you, Laxman, and another question for you. How was return to the oﬃce
working?
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
COVID has been tough on all of us and certainly it has been tough on our company.
During this period, our teams did an incredible amount of work from home or where
they were. And I just want to acknowledge our partners eﬀorts during that time. We
are a company rooted in human connection. We must have authentic and deep
human connection everywhere we work in stores, in our support centers, in our
roasting plants, in our coﬀee farms, everywhere.
Our workplace experience reﬂects the input of many of our partners and includes
more choice for common days in the oﬃce as well as additional tools, resources and
support. Let me give you an example of something I've personally seen in terms of
our return to the oﬃce. I walked around this building and when I walk around this
building, I have an opportunity to interact with many teams.
Recently, I interacted with the team in technology. These are the team that does work
in what's called play builder which is our scheduling deployment tool. It was a very
informal interaction over coﬀee and we had a chat about the work they were doing
and I said I'd come back and spend some time with them which is what I did last
week. And we all got together, we went to the work they were doing and it was
amazing to see the kind of things they were working on, the kind of innovations
they're working to bring to bear.
And we got very direct engagement on real work that we were doing and many have
joined [ph] and we had a great conversation. So, the ability for us to have these
informal interactions goes up in our workplace as we return to the oﬃce.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-23
