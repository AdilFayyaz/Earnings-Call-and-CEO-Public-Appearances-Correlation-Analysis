Presentation
Greetings. Welcome to the Microsoft segment conference call.
(Operator Instructions)
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager Investor
Relations. Thank you. Chris, you may begin.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thank you, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on the call
today. With me Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Oﬃcer.
Today's call is being webcast and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included
in our live transmission, in the transcript. And any future use of the recording. You
can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website
until September 29, 2016.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are
predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements
are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Actual results could materially diﬀer because of factors discussed in
today's conference call. And in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-29

not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Yesterday afternoon we announced our new reporting segments. On our call today,
we will review these segments in more detail. And also discuss what you should
expect with our First Quarter earnings release in October. On our website,
Microsoft.com/investor, is our slide deck, which is intended to follow today's
discussion. Additionally, you can also ﬁnd today's 8-K ﬁling and our recast historical
quarterly segment results on our website.
We will not be discussing any topics other than segments on the call today. Our First
Quarter FY16 earnings call is scheduled for October 22. And we'll provide results for
the quarter at that time.
To start us oﬀ, I'm going to turn the call over to Frank.
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As many of you know, accounting and
disclosure rules require that Microsoft report its ﬁnancial results in the same manner
in which our CEO analyzes performance and allocates resources. During this quarter,
we've worked with our CEO to align our internal reports, our scorecards. And our
accountability framework with Microsoft's three interconnected ambitions. As Chris
noted, yesterday we announced our new ﬁnancial reporting segments. We will
report our results in these new segments beginning with our First Quarter of FY16.
For those following along in the slides, I'm going to talk to slide 4. For each of our
new segments, we will report both revenue and operating income performance,
providing insights into our progress in each of the three ambitions. Our new
segment proﬁt performance measure will be operating income to reﬂect resourcing
decisions that consider both the cost of sales and operating expenses. In this way, it
is a full measure of accountability that reﬂects the changes that we are making in
how we manage the Business. To the extent that gross margin is a material driver of
segment operating income results in a period, it will be discussed in earnings
materials and in the MD&A section of our ﬁling.
Our ﬁrst segment is Productivity and Business Processes, which aligns to our
ambition to reinvent productivity and business processes. To do this, our products
and services will span a variety of devices and platforms. And include productivity,
communication and information services such as Oﬃce, Oﬃce 365, Dynamics,
Exchange, SharePoint and Skype. We are looking to drive scale and usage with dual-
use customers. Therefore, this segment includes revenue from both consumers and
commercial customers.
Our second segment is Intelligent Cloud, which reports on our ambitions to build
the intelligent cloud platform. With our core infrastructure, data platform and server
application, both on premise and in the cloud, we will provide our customer with
improved agility and insight. And solutions that they can use to diﬀerentiate theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-29

Page 3 of 10Chris Suhbusiness. As applications are developed on our cloud platform they are able to
attach our diﬀerentiated solutions for identity and data management, as well as
machine learning and advanced analytics.
Our third segment is aligned with our ambition to create more personal computing.
And is aptly named More Personal Computing. Through our Windows device
platform and our own devices we will look to generate more opportunity for the
Windows ecosystem and enable new product categories. Additionally, we look to
improve the distribution of services such as search, while expanding gaming to one
integrated experience across devices.
On slide number 5, for those of you who are following along, the three segments are
presented along with the major product and service categories that comprise each
segment. By moving to these three segments we are providing transparency in our
progress against our ambitions while simplifying our reporting structure. One
example is Oﬃce products and services, which were previously reported in four
segments but now are included in a single segment, Productivity and Business
Processes. And in the More Personal Computing segment, by including both the
initial Windows platform royalty license revenue, as well as post-sale monetization
through services such as search and gaming, we are giving visibility into the
performance of the broader Windows ecosystem as Windows 10 gains traction and
share.
We will continue to have a segment category named Corporate and Other. One-time
revenue deferrals and recognitions such as tech guarantees and pre-sales prior to
the general availability of our new products are recorded here, as well as the net
impact of Windows 10 revenue deferrals. Corporate-level expenses that are not
attributable to a segment will also be reported in Corporate and Other.
I'll now turn the call back over to Chris who will provide further details.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Frank. In order to help you update your model from the old reporting
segments to the new, we'll now walk through the product mapping in detail. For this
discussion, I'll use Fourth Quarter FY15 results for the mapping, unless otherwise
noted. You should be able to leverage this to extrapolate to other periods. And all
percentages given are approximate.
I'll start with slide 6, beginning with Devices and Consumer Licensing. The majority
of this segment will now be reported in More Personal Computing. In Q4, about 75%
of the revenue was from the sale of Windows, primarily through our OEM partners.
And about 10% was from the licensing of Windows phone and related intellectual
property. All of this revenue will now be reported in the More Personal Computing
segment. The exception is revenue from the traditional licensing of Oﬃce Consumer,
which will now be reported in the Productivity and Business Processes segment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10On slide 7, revenue from our two hardware segments, Computing and Gaming
Hardware. And Phone Hardware, will all be reported in More Personal Computing.
Moving to slide 8, the Devices and Consumer Other segment was primarily
comprised of Search and Display Advertising, Xbox LIVE and 1st Party Games. And
Oﬃce 365 Consumer. The vast majority of these results in this segment, about 90%,
will be reported in More Personal Computing. Search Advertising was about 40% of
the segment's revenue; Display Advertising was 10%; and Xbox LIVE, transactional
revenue and 1st Party Games was another 40%. And all will be reported in More
Personal Computing. Oﬃce 365 Consumer, which was about 10% of the segment,
will be in the Productivity and Business Processes segment.
Switching now to Commercial Licensing segment on slide 9, server products
licensed on premise, which was roughly 45% of the segment's revenue, will now be
reported in Intelligent Cloud. And similarly, traditional licensing of Oﬃce commercial
products, which was about 40% of the revenue. And our Dynamics business, about
5%, will be in Productivity and Business Processes. The last major component is the
volume license sales of Windows. And that will be reported in More Personal
Computing.
Finally, in our Commercial Other segment, the revenue mix was approximately 60%
commercial cloud and 40% enterprise services. Within commercial cloud, Oﬃce 365
Commercial and Dynamics CRM Online will both be reported in Productivity and
Business Processes. Azure and Enterprises Services will be reported in Intelligent
Cloud. That completes the detailed mapping of the old segments to the new.
Slide 11 is a clean view that summarizes where our products and services are
reported in both the old and new segments. One aspect of the new mapping that
will undoubtedly stand out is that this brings together the traditionally licensed
products with their cloud counterparts, improving the visibility into the combined
ﬁnancial performance as customers transition and adopt cloud services.
Moving to slide 12, as most of you know, with each quarterly earnings release we
share our results in a variety of ways, including our earnings press release, a slide
deck of our results, our earnings conference call. And in the MD&A section of our
quarterly ﬁlings. Across these various components, we provide actual ﬁnancial
results, as well as the material drivers of business during the quarter. Additionally, on
our IR website we publish a set of quarterly metrics that supplement the information
we provide in the earnings release and MD&A. The goal of these metrics is to
provide additional insight that helps you understand our results. And also to gauge
the progress we're making against our ambition.
On slide 12, you'll ﬁrst notice that we've designated a set of metrics that cover our
commercial business results across Microsoft. This is in addition to speciﬁc metrics
within each reporting segment that are also commercial oriented. I want to
emphasize the insight and transparency into the performance of our commercial
business that we will provide. Though we no longer have speciﬁc commercialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-29
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 10segments, we have updated our metrics to more easily communicate the health of
our entire commercial billing cycle, including commercial bookings, unearned
revenue, contracted not billed. And commercial annuity revenue mix.
Next, we'll continue to publish a set of segment-speciﬁc metrics. Since many of these
are not new, I'll only focus on the ones that have changed. The ﬁrst is Oﬃce 365
Consumer subscribers. In the past, we've provided this metric as a growth
percentage, while occasionally providing the subscriber count in other earnings
materials. Going forward, the metric will reﬂect the subscriber count.
The second metric that is changing is the addition of Xbox LIVE active users that
replaces the Xbox console unit metric. Console sales will continue to be provided in
other earnings materials when they are a driver of changes in revenue and operating
income. The addition of Xbox LIVE active users demonstrates the opportunity that
we see to extend our gaming assets beyond the living room to PCs, tablets, phones
and other form or factors with Windows 10. And is more aligned to our long-term
opportunity.
Third, we've been disclosing our Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate for
a few quarters now. And going forward, it will be a quarterly metric, meaning you can
expect to receive this number with each earnings release.
The ﬁnal change I want to walk you through is the metric deﬁnition for search
advertising. With the transition of search advertising sales to Microsoft and the
amended Yahoo agreement, we've adjusted the quarterly metric to be revenue, less
traﬃc acquisition costs, which is a better indicator of Bing search advertising revenue
growth going forward.
As you look through the complete list of metrics, as mentioned, we will continue to
be very clear about the performance of our commercial results within each reporting
segment, too, with Commercial Cloud, Oﬃce Commercial, server products and
services. And Windows volume licensing and Dynamics metrics all still readily
available. Through our comprehensive reporting framework, the reporting of our
results with our new segments aligned to our three ambitions, the disclosures in our
earnings materials. And the details provided in our SEC ﬁlings. And all of this
supplemented with our quarterly metrics, we will continue to work to provide
investors with best-in-class transparency into our business results. And key drivers of
our progress and performance.
Before taking questions, I'll walk through what you should expect from us in the
coming weeks as we move to the new reporting segments. On October 22, we will
report our First Quarter FY16 results. And these results will be presented in our three
new reporting segments. This includes all ﬁlings, commentary. And any forward-
looking guidance.
To ease the transition and bridge back to any forward-looking statements that we
made last quarter, we will provide a supplemental table of the Q1 results in the oldFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-29

reported amounts into the new segments.
So with that, Frank and I will take some questions. Again, please limit your questions
to items covered only in today's call. Jesse, please go ahead and repeat your
instructions.
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions)
Mark Moerdler, Bernstein Research.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Thank you. You've given a lot of information that will hopefully
help people and be able to understand it. Now that you're making the change and
you've gone from gross margin to operating margin -- gross margin did give you
some sense of clarity as to what's happening with the hosting costs of the cloud --
are we going to get any additional data that will give us a sense of the improving
margins of the cloud from a purely hosting point of view as you gain scale and
eﬃciency?
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
Mark, this is Frank. First of all, we have to report our proﬁt indicator in the way in
which our leadership looks at the results. Our team focuses on accountability on
operating income as the basis for their resource decisions and for their performance
analysis. We see it as a full measure of proﬁtability as we progress towards our
ambitions.
We will continue to disclose gross margin and gross margin changes when it's a
material driver of results. Gross margin is an important component of operating
income so it is something that we'll speak to in explaining where our results came
out in any given period.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
And Mark, if I could just add on, speciﬁc to your cloud question, as you know,
previously we didn't disclose commercial cloud gross margin speciﬁcally but it was
part of commercial other and you were able to see generally how the performance
of our gross margin progress was. We talked a little bit about speciﬁcally commercial
cloud gross margin in periodic points when we reach milestones and that is how I
anticipate we will talk about it going forward. We do anticipate that we continue to
make forward progress in improving that gross margin. And as we hit relative
milestones we'll continue to talk about it to the extent that they are driving our
performance results.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-29

Perfect. Thank you. And thanks again for the additional information and the metrics.
Daniel Ives, FBR.
{BIO 3704239 <GO>}
From the perspective internally, what do you think the new reporting structure adds
from a transparency perspective, especially the Windows 10 as well as the cloud
initiatives? Maybe you could just talk about that from a high level; how it is going to
make it easier even internally to look at your results.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Dan. Thanks for the question. It is a good question because for those who
have been following the Company for a while, Satya has, as he's evolved his role as
CEO, he has clearly been focused on these ambitions as priorities for the Company.
And I think the way that the new reporting aligns to those ambitions provides great
transparency and accountability toward the progress against those ambitions.
You talked about Windows speciﬁcally. With Windows 10, the notion of the ability to
monetize after the initial license sales through the PC is an important concept and
one that we have more clear alignment and transparency toward with these new
reporting segments.
{BIO 3704239 <GO>}
Great. Thanks.
Kirk Materne, Evercore.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
Thanks very much and I'll echo, thanks for the additional details on this new
breakout. Chris or Frank, could you talk a little bit about commercial, in general,
meaning you are now mixing commercial with consumer on the productivity side?
And are we going to get any updates in terms of commercial as a total percentage?
The only thing I would say about the new combination is I would think that you
would still think about the oﬃce commercial business a little bit diﬀerently than the
oﬃce consumer internally. So are going to get any updates on that? Or within the
productivity bucket, any idea of what percentage of that is more annuitized because
actually you've got, we had the annuity breakout of commercial. And now
commercial is spread across a couple buckets? So mainly just trying to get a sense ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-29

Q - Michael Turits
A - Chris Suhhow we should be thinking about commercial in general and then annuity with this
new structure around the productivity segment. Thanks.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Kirk. Commercial is an important construct. I know clearly that investors view
the commercial side of our business as an area of focus, as well. We're taking a
number of steps to make sure that we maintain good transparency and visibility into
the commercial results.
To address a couple of the points you made speciﬁcally, within the Business
Productivity and Processes segment, we will be reporting through our KPI structure
and in the MD&A of our 10-Q the performance of Oﬃce commercial separate from
Oﬃce consumer. So that will be very visible within the segment construct, as well.
Then, secondly, through our KPIs we will have a list of KPIs that are labeled
speciﬁcally commercial that will have the commercial annuity revenue mix, which is
one that you referenced, as well as our commercial bookings, our commercial
unearned revenue and our commercial contracted not billed. I do believe that even
with the new segments, while we simplify it in many ways by putting the product
families together, we maintain the visibility and transparency to all of our results
regardless of whether they are sold to commercial or consumer customers.
{BIO 5771115 <GO>}
Thanks, Chris.
Michael Turits, Raymond James.
{BIO 1720659 <GO>}
Hello, guys, thanks very much. Two questions. One, any change that you can tell us
about in the way that you'll be giving guidance. And inclusive of that whether you
will be giving COGS guidance, as well. Then a second question is, just as commercial
and consumer is blended in these segments, as you pointed out, both cloud and on-
prem are blended. Is there anything you're going to be doing to help us understand
a little bit better the transition to cloud, both from a revenue and margin
perspective?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Michael. A couple of things. On guidance, structurally I don't anticipate that
we'll be changing the way that we give guidance. In other words, we have been
giving guidance with each segment, the revenue guidance for each segment. And
we gave previously COGS number for the entire company all up, as well as
operating expenses all up. I do anticipate that we will follow a similar structure. And
you'll hear more from us on October 22 when we talk about the First Quarter as well
as any forward-looking statements.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-29

OperatorThen to your second question in terms of our cloud performance versus our on-
prem performance, there's two ways that I think you'll be able to get transparency on
that. One is that we will continue to publish and report on our commercial cloud
revenue annualized revenue run rate in total. So you'll be able to see that consistent
with the way that we've reported it in the past. You'll be able to see the aggregate
performance of our commercial cloud, which is Oﬃce 365, Azure, CRM online, as
well as some of our new ﬁnished applications that fall into the Azure family.
Secondly, we historically publish KPIs that report on both the combined performance
of Oﬃce, what we call products and services, which means on-prem plus the cloud,
server products on-prem plus in the cloud, Dynamics on-prem plus the cloud. And
will continue to publish each of those KPIs so you can see the aggregate
performance growth on revenue for both on-prem and sold through a variety of
cloud services. So you will be able to see that there. Then I would look for additional
discussion within our MD&A in the SEC ﬁlings. To the extent that they're material
drivers of our results we will continue to publish that.
Then, ﬁnally, our earnings slide deck is always rich with information that provides
additional breakdown of performance across all of our segments and we'll continue
to keep those on our website, both historically and going forward. And I would
recommend that you read through that to see detailed discussion about
performance within a segment, as well. So I think there's a variety of places you will
be able to get pretty good transparency into that.
{BIO 1720659 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Frank.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Michael. With that, I think we wrap up the call and the Q&A portion of
today's call. I want to thank you all for joining us. If you have any questions as you are
updating your models please reach out to the IR team and we will be happy to help
where we can. Thanks again for joining us today.
