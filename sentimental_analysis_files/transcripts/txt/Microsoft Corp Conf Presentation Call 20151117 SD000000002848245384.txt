Presentation
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
All right. Thank you for joining. We have, I think, a fantastic software lunch. We got a
chance to hear from Christian and now you're going to hear from Amy Hood. Amy
has been the CFO since May of 2013. Microsoft stock is up 60% since she took over.
So I know you're not measuring yourself on that exact metric.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
No.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
But it's nice to note. She joined in 2002 and held various roles across the business,
which has resulted, now, in her taking over as the CFO. So thank you, Amy, for
joining.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thank you, Brent, for having me.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
I think this is one of your ﬁrst sell-side events. We appreciate you --
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Maybe -- actually, not maybe. It's I think my ﬁrst ever in my history at Microsoft, 13
years. My ﬁrst sell-side conference.

The one shift that we've seen -- and I'll go through some questions. And please,
again, I've got the iPad. I don't meant to sound like a broken record. But you can ask
questions and I'll ask questions of this or I go to my questions. Please ask any
questions that you have.
The shift that we've seen -- and I started my career as a developer in Microsoft so, in
the early 1990s, I'm dating myself -- but there's a big shift that's gone on, at least that
we've felt is just independent of the Company, which is you go through Silicon
Valley, everyone believes in what Satya is doing from a product perspective and then
what you're doing on the operational perspective. You have done quite a bit. Can
you just talk a little bit about what's happened since both of you have eﬀectively
taken over, what the change has been?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Well I think, like all things, it's probably both overstated and understated in certain
respects. We've been working on our cloud transition. I think we took our ﬁrst
Exchange customer where we hosted their mail for them in 2007. It may have been
2006. And so, we've been at many things for a very long time, strategically, that I
think maybe are paying oﬀ diﬀerently in the past couple of years. And there's things
that I think feel very new at the Company in the past, probably, two years.
I do think what Satya very deeply brings is a focus on where we have a unique
reason to exist. The word that we call those are our ambitions. There are three of
them. For ease, they're also our reporting segments now so it sort of makes it more
cleanly aligned. That's resulted in great focus on the engineering side in terms of
where are we going to spend our money, where are we going to put our
engineering talent. And where are we going to focus our execution muscle, which
we think is very good.
When you're a CFO in that environment, it's very helpful because you can sort of
continue to have conversations about focus and execution and eﬃciency and
process reinvention. So I do spend a lot of time on that. And together, I think what
his product vision and the holistic nature of it for us; he's very future-minded. It's a
very clear vision of where the Company ought to be in a year, in three years, in ﬁve
years. That's very helpful when you're a resource allocator, which is my fundamental
job in life.
Then, you add to that trying to think about excellence in execution all the way
through the customer-facing salesforce. And we've done a lot of work in our selling
transitions in the past couple of years in terms of what do you want your salespeople
selling and why. There are natural ways to do that. I love salespeople in some
regards. They're very easily motivated and change behaviors quite easy. Whereas, in
the marketing side, it could be a harder transition in terms making the motivations
more clear.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

A - Amy HoodBut it's very clear. We've sold better. We've sold the future. We've deployed the
future. And done it, I think, better than some of peer group. And I feel good about
that. And I think what you can say is that doesn't happen by two people being
focused on it happening. It happens when we have a senior leadership team that
meets for hours every week -- literally, every week -- to talk about if we're driving the
business in the right direction. You can course-correct very quickly when you meet as
often as we do.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
You've done a great job in the transition. What have been the easier things to move
and what are still the challenges as you see in front of you in terms of this transition?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Oh, they're no diﬀerent than we talk about on the earnings call every quarter. I think
we continue to focus on the cloud transition. How quickly can you make it? How
aggressively can you think about customers being ready? How can you make them
more ready? There's a real balance there. We run a hybrid environment. Most of
customers run a hybrid environment. And so, being able to make sure we get
customers through that transition in a healthy way is always a balance. But we try to
make it as easy as possible and aggressively as possible.
And I guess that transition is going as well as one would expect when you have as
large of a customer base as we have. So I feel quite good about that. And we're still -
- you think about that in terms of our ambitions; that's our ﬁrst and second ambition.
Build the intelligent cloud and reinvent productivity in business processes. Those
two fundamentally say what our job is in the transition.
And so, I think we get it. I think customers understand where we're going. They
understand the roadmap. And so, I always feel like we're making good progress on
that. I always, of course, see places you can do better. So that's just the nature of,
probably, how my mind works.
The third ambition, more personal computing, we've been clear we're going through
that transition. We're about four-and-a-half months into the launch of Windows 10.
We feel very good about it, feel good about the progress we've made in our
hardware portfolio for holiday this year both in the margin proﬁle of that hardware
portfolio and in its competitiveness and innovation. So that feels very good.
The early signs out of our search business, in terms of its correlation to Windows 10,
feel very good. But that's the earliest transition, I would say. If you think about a
fundamental business concept of taking every customer interaction you have and
thinking about it in terms of lifetime value, that's the easiest way to think about what
we're doing as a company, period. You say, "What's Microsoft up to?" Taking every
customer relationship we have and turning it into a lifetime value annuity construct.
And so, we've been doing that longer in the intelligent cloud and in business
process. Think about that as Oﬃce and the server business. And we're newer to it,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

Q - Brent Thillfrankly, in Windows. But Windows 10 is absolutely the best insight into what that
looks like when you think about an annuity equation of a consumer on a PC.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
When you look at the new Microsoft, it's a lot more open. You talk to executives,
whether it's Dropbox. And they say, "We love them."
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
They don't always say that, I don't think.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
No. But when you think about what's happened in some of the key partnerships that
may have been a little more friction in the past, the friction is a lot -- it's a lot
smoother now.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I thought you were going to pick Red Hat. That was a better example.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Well in Red Hat, exactly. So if you go to Red Hat. But when you think about where are
you at in this evolution with the partner ecosystem; are you through the big ones you
want to be through? Is it --?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I would think about it a little diﬀerently. Brent. Assume every time I think about
whether or not partnerships make sense or what type of environment to have,
assume we're optimizing for customers and developers every time. Every time. And
think about it last is whether I decide somebody is a friend or not a friend. Everybody
needs to work together to make customers' experience the best it can be.
And so, I think that's what Satya has very cleanly brought as an environment. And you
see Peggy Johnson, who heads BizDev, is executing on that every day. Most of
leadership team has pretty deep relationships across the industry, at this point. And
so, if you think about from the customer out as opposed from Microsoft sort of out,
it's a better understanding of why we're doing what we're doing.
And so, the importance of working with Red Hat, the importance of working with
SAP, the importance of working with Oracle or Google or, the list is long, Salesforce.
It's because it matters in terms of customer experience. And so, when you take that
lens, it's actually quite easy to understand why we would work the way we work.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Just going into some of the segment lines. On personal computing, it's your largest
business as a % of revenue. The margins will ﬂuctuate around and I know you'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 18A - Amy Hood
Q - Brent Thill
A - Amy Hoodmyopically focused on cost. So when you think about the opportunity in eﬃciency,
where you do think the biggest opportunity is for you on the personal computing
line for improving the eﬃciency of --?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's interesting you asked the question that way. I don't think I am as focused on cost
in the way that you think I am. What I think about is what's the most eﬃcient way to
run a business we've chosen to be in and how can we do that better every day. All
businesses that we're in have diﬀerent margin proﬁles. So I think about what's the
right margin proﬁle for that business and how do we best get there. And sort of
that's probably the maniacal way I think about it.
And so, in more personal computing, it's you have to manage at a slightly more
granular level because of the nature of the components. So in the Surface business,
you think about the gross margin inherent in the product and the value prop it has to
be able to generate the right returns. In the OEM business, I would think quite
diﬀerently about eﬃciency. Eﬃciency, there, is taking three or four operating system
teams on the OpEx side, putting them on one team. And having them eﬀectively
work better. That is both more eﬃcient and far less costly. But frankly, the beneﬁts
are far broader than the fact that we can cut costs. We have a logical ecosystem
interface through the store, through universal apps.
And so, I tend to think about why -- there's a peer group that makes sense and then
there's also the why. Then, if you manage those two things, you, frankly, ﬁnd it far
easier to have culture change on cost because people know why they're doing it;
not a CFO showing up saying, "You need to be cheaper." That's the absolute worst
way to have cost-cutting happen. It needs to happen because it makes you a winner,
not because you want to be cheaper. Being a winner is what motivates people these
days.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
When you look at the entry into some of these new hardware solutions, one of the
questions I get is you look at the service book, pretty compelling. I bought the
Microsoft Band 2, some really compelling features for running and golf and so many
features that I think are opening up a broader TAM. But how do you control ensuring
that you're not cannonballing into this; that you're kind of gradually going in so you
can control --?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. It's funny. Most of the feedback I'm getting now is; where is the supply? So it's
funny you asked about cannonballing anywhere. Currently, the feedback is, "I'd love
to see the Surface Book terabyte in stock for holiday" or "I'd love to see the i7."
And so, what I think of is -- you picked two funny examples. The bigger issue is how
do you think about what unique value prop you have in the market and how many
do you think you can sell and how do you get an eﬃcient supply chain down to
where the supply and demand balance can be eﬀectively controlled.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

A - Amy HoodHow do you stage-gate? There's no need to do annual budgeting in a company
when you work like that. It can be stage-gated. Hardware is the perfect example of
where we have that process. You make progress, you get more funding. You don't
make progress, there's no need to have more funding. And so, that's a good
behavior because it rewards positive outcomes. And so, I think, instead of thinking
about that as a control mechanism, think about it as when you meet your
commitment to the Company, you get to bet a little bigger.
And you've seen that. We've been willing with the transition from Surface Pro to
Surface Pro 3 to Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. The margin proﬁle is better the
device. The specs are very compelling. The price to value is a very compelling oﬀer.
Reviews have gotten better. General social sentiment is pretty high. So I feel very
good about how we've sort of stage-gated our entry into some of these markets.
And that's been a learning. I do understand that was not our approach a couple of
years ago. And when you do it that way, your risk-reward balance is in the right place
instead of a bit oﬀ-kilter.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
You did see pretty big margin improvement in the last quarter in this business. Is that
sustainable? How do you think about what we saw last quarter versus how we think
about --?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. Part of that's a portfolio transition. As we've focused our phone portfolio, you'll
see margin improvement. I continue to think we can see margin improvement
because we do improve the whole portfolio of margin across every hardware
product. And so, while you may see step functions based on mix -- so, we've taken
some exposure to phone oﬀ -- you'll see bigger improvements in those quarters. But
I would expect general improvement across successful hardware product launches.
You design premium products, you can earn premium margin.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Shifting to the productivity business, process business. The biggest question I get is;
how far can the Oﬃce franchise go? And I know you keep putting more into Oﬃce to
make it more compelling.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And charging more. You put more in and you charge more.

Q - Brent Thill
A - Amy Hood{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
So yes, if you could just walk through how you think about what's happening here,
the impact of E5 coming, I think, in December.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It goes on the price list in December, yes. Let's talk about Oﬃce in general and
continuing to expand the deﬁnition. It's why we didn't say reinvent Oﬃce. The
ambition is not to reinvent Oﬃce. The ambition is to reinvent productivity and
business processes. That's a very broad and very expansive total addressable market
ambition.
And so, I think of Oﬃce. And whether now I call it Oﬃce 365, just because I think
about Oﬃce in its holistic version, we're adding new things to the umbrella we call
Oﬃce. And that's analytics. It's security. Some of you may have seen we did a
reasonably-sized security announcement this morning out of D.C. in terms of talking
about how we're thinking about that. We're probably one of the biggest investors in
security that nobody understands is in the security business. And the third pillar is
voice.
And so, when you think about that, those are very new TAM markets for us and very
logical extensions of what our salesforce knows and does quite well. And so, when
you can take an eﬀective salesforce with good relationships and add modules, easy
way to think about, to the selling motion, we can do so reasonably eﬃciently. Not a
ton of marginal cost. But a ton of marginal revenue opportunity. And those are good
for us when you think about the logic of extension.
Adjacencies tend to make sense for us when done that way. Some are more
adjacent. Some are slightly less. But that's why the framework works. And it's why
you've seen us make a lot of acquisitions recently in some of the enterprise
businesses where we can take something that's not quite at scale, very quickly turn it
around and relaunch it. And get it into the channel quite quickly.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
The Dynamics product line seems really exciting; back oﬃce, front oﬃce. When you
think about things you can do there, can you just help us understand what you think
are some of the interesting low-hanging fruit in that business?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Well I think, in general, when you think about moving our entire business application
business onto the Azure platform, which is what we are doing. And think about what
that says about your ability to understand workﬂows of any type and what workﬂows
can you apply that logic to, I think the opportunity is pretty expansive. When you
hear Satya or Scott Guthrie talk about it, they'll say; look at anything that has a
workﬂow to it and say is there an opportunity for us to be in that business. Far
beyond, what you think of as like the general ledger; accounts payable, accounts
receivable. That's a pretty narrow vision of what business process can be. And so, forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

A - Amy Hoodus, I do think it is a pretty expansive view of when you understand how to do that in
your platform. The opportunity to add nodes above it at the SaaS layer seems pretty
marginally cheap on the cost side and marginally positive on the revenue side.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
It seems like there's a lot left in this category. And there's maybe a lot of questions I
get about; how much is left? But it seems like from your response there's --
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Well I think in some ways, it's about us expanding our own ambition in this spot.
We've spent so much time talking about the transition of Word, Excel. And Power
Point to Word, Excel. And Power Point in the cloud. I think sometimes you talk
yourself into the narrowness of the vision. And it's why I think it's so important for us
all to understand what we're trying to do in that umbrella.
The umbrella is to add TAM, to take as many users as we can and transition, to add
new users that weren't possible before because of the IT demands. And sell all of
them more stuﬀ. I mean at good margins. And so, in that, frankly, when we narrowed
our own vision, I think it actually was maybe the actual big misstep from a couple
years ago. And instead, talk about the expansive of our vision and what's possible
given the assets we have, the knowledge we have. And the customers we already
know.

{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes.

The server numbers have been, database server operating system numbers, have
been fantastic. You're taking share. You've disrupted some very large vendors in that
space. Can you walk through what you're seeing? Why this is happening? Just give
everyone just a little bit of your perspective on --
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's interesting. This is a business that can grow a lot. I mean I just look and say we
have a good vision. We have a highly-compelling value prop. And I feel like we're
competitively well-positioned amongst many, many vendors that exist in this space.
And it's so early in the game.
And I think we've done a good job of taking our existing customers and existing
product lines -- we'll call that our perpetual business, for lack of a great term for it --
and done a good job of taking share, to your point. If people were going to stay on-

Q - Brent Thillpremium workloads and, on occasion, raising price in those sort of prop to core
transitions people talk about. So those are all very good execution things.
But this is the place, I think, where there's more new, fundamentally new, workloads
being created. And that's probably what's more exciting to me than many other
things. It's things we couldn't even dream were possible are now possible in this
segment. When you think about the investments in machine learning, you think
about the extent analytics can be used, you think about how much more we can
learn from sensors and technology and what the vastness -- like when you say --
Satya, we laugh, because he's like, "Every business is a software business today."
That, to me, is very compelling because it means wherever we thought our
addressable market was up to this point has been too constrained. And so, we're
really constrained by our ability to execute and do so well and do so consistently.
And so, this team has done a great job. I mean this team is not lacking for people
writing nice things about them. So I love that about us.
But given the segments that we can make progress in, there is a lot of room for us to
continue to be ambitious here. And I think that's a statement I would make in
general. I mean I think this is a place where the pace of the transition is quickening,
which I think people have kind of seen in the last couple quarters. It's felt that way, I
think, in the market. It feels that way to us. The pace is sort of picking up. Even in a
macro environment that feels a little unsettling, I think, globally, it still feels like the
pace is picking up of the cloud transition; people's interest, people understanding
how it could impact their business fundamentally.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
You've always felt that that's additive to the cloud, not subtracting.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. I've always felt that.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Can we talk about --
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
You don't do what we've done for 10 years and thought it wasn't additive. Just to
point out the obvious. I mean there are things you do because they're defensive and
there's things you do because you know it's opportunistic. People thought we were
doing, I think, the cloud for defensive reasons. It's not. It's because, ultimately, your
TAM is simply larger. Period. And so, I think that's maybe the distinction in the world
view that I have.

I guess. We were behind some and ahead of some. So I'm never confused on that. I
mean there's people that were ahead and we were catching up. And we're ahead in
places and other people are further behind. And those environments can change.
The important thing is if we don't stay aggressive and focused, I don't want be that

{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Can we talk just a little bit about, in the public cloud you're the clear number-two.
There is one better ahead of you.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes, on the infra.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
With AWS. A common question we get is; how do you think about this --?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. I think this is a good question because we laugh -- listen; real estate in Seattle is
a very vibrant place, currently. We have two fundamental winners that feel like
winners in the commercial cloud business. When you say there's breakaways, I don't
feel left out of the breakaway in the commercial cloud business itself.
I think Amazon -- and Satya did a good job, I think, in his earnings comments this
quarter, talking about what he's seeing technically; that both of us, we have diﬀerent
world views. But we're both share-gainers in this space and the TAM is growing
quickly. And so, we don't see -- I think, in the past 12 months, I feel like our trajectory
has changed a bit. You've seen it in terms of how we've talked, with Azure. I haven't
had to change our trajectory talk on Oﬃce 365. It's always been positive and we've
gotten credit for it, which I appreciate.
But I think the trajectory change has been the number of conversations we have with
customers, now, around Azure that are proactive, where we're not the one bringing it
up. And that is a diﬀerence. And I feel good about it. I think our pace of innovation
has really sped up there. But I'm not confused about where AWS is in terms of share
in the infra, in infra space.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
I have one other question then we'll go to the question line. We have double-digit
questions. So a lot of questions. OpEx has remained ﬂat for quite some time and
projected, I think, to be down slightly. Can you just talk about the balance of what
you're doing on investing for growth and cutting?

A - Amy Hood
Q - Brent ThillYes. First of all, we've been very transparent that we've gotten 3-ish points of help
from FX. So I've been transparent. I will remain transparent. We've gotten help, like
the rest of the world has, from FX for the past 11 months because I think the bottom
dropped out of the euro around December 20. It seems to recall around my birthday
so that's how I think about the euro. And so, we'll continue to have that beneﬁt right
through this quarter. Now, that gets harder next calendar, assuming that there is any
stability at all in exchange rates.
Now, outside of that, you've asked sort of how do I think about investing versus,
quote-unquote, cutting. I think, ﬁrst, we will continue to have that balance. What's
nice about the new reporting segments going all the way through to operating proﬁt
as the proﬁt measure is you can actually see where we're putting money in the OpEx
level versus where we may be getting more eﬃcient. And so, you saw, this quarter, in
the intelligent cloud, listen we're growing revenue at double digits on a constant-
currency basis, we should be investing in sales capacity, in consumption capacity
because, otherwise, frankly, we're not taking advantage of what is a clear opportunity
for us to have revenue growth. So that's an important concept. And I think we'll
continue to do that as long as we see the opportunity to take share and grow our
business.
At the same time, in the other segments, you've seen us be able to move resources
around more or reduce them. You've seen that we've been far more eﬃcient on our
marketing programs and we've made some eﬀorts on the sales execution to get
more eﬃcient and those have been helpful. There's always ways, I think, that we
continue to review what else can we do. Can we run this process more eﬃciently?
Can we run it through one engine? And I think we'll continue to go and focus on
these things.
But I never want to constrain a revenue growth, where there is opportunity to take
share and grow, with some need to meet an OpEx number. It would be very short-
sighted of us, given our opportunity sets.

Yes. Move everyone to it with a higher LTV.

How should we think about your foray into notebook hardware?

Foray? Oh, the Surface Book?

First laptop you've built --
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Okay. Okay, check. Yes, got it.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
So do you expect to do other form factors?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
You should think of it as a concerted eﬀort for us to address a core component.
We've had a lot of, a lot of demand for high-end Windows machines from creatives
and a good product to do it.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
I hope to get it.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. We're working fast.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
What is Microsoft's perspective with regards to the open versus closed ecosystem?
You seem to be embracing more collaboration around open.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
You're talking to the company who's fundamentally a platform company. We're
pretty open. I mean it's weird for me because if I choose closed, I don't know on
what basis I would choose that. So we are a platform company. We've always been a
platform company. The more open we can be, the better oﬀ we generally are.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

Microsoft will go through a transition from a license model to a subscription model.
You will be hybrid for a while. How long does this take to make that shift over?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
A diﬀerent question. There's a technical -- this is a weird one because so much of our
enterprise business has always been subscription, when you think about it, in terms
of how the accounting construct was. So moving from a perpetual subscription to a
cloud-based subscription doesn't look any diﬀerent. So the P&L doesn't have an
impact in that way.
The only place it's the cleanest is our Oﬃce consumer business because we had a
purely perpetual business recognized upfront to a business that's a subscription.
And I think we've talked about that transition and we ﬁnally were at a place this
quarter where we got a tailwind from the subscription as opposed to headwind from
the perpetual change.
The technical question you're asking, on the infrastructure side, in terms of the pace
of that transition from on-prem to hybrid to a pure cloud, I mean that's a transition
that's a long one for a company.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Can you talk about the relationship with Apple?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. Do you want me to, now, talk about it or is this the lightning round?
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
No. You don't have to give one -- yes.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
No. We have worked with Apple for -- we have a long history of working with Apple.
I'm very proud of the new Oﬃce for Mac release. If you guys are running the 2011
version, you should move. 2016 is a monumental improvement. So I should just say,
it's terriﬁc. We were onstage at their last event. It's been a long time since that's
happened. And I feel good about that.
So if we're going to build great productivity software and we want our users to use
our productivity software, it will be important to ship it cross-plat. And that's always
been true for us. Again, if you think about the thing I said at the very beginning, if
you talk about caring about a customer ﬁrst instead of starting with like a Microsoft
lens all the time, your answer will be; of course, we have a good relationship with
Apple. It would be crazy not to.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

Just so you don't think I'm crazy. Mike Tyson and the Jedi master are in the house.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
My God, that's so good. If the Jedi master is here, I'm very excited for Star Wars. So
we are alike.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
So Jedi master's question is; how do you think about moving beyond into things like
the automotive market? You were in the auto segment. But is there something that
you can do there that --?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
There are many verticals, auto is one of them, where I say to myself what is the
opportunity for things like the number of sensors that will be embedded in machines
of all sorts -- autos are a great example -- and our ability to help in that ecosystem.
So I do think you'll see us have a focus on certain verticals, especially. Not in the way
that people are sitting here thinking, "Oh my God, she's lost her mind. She's going
to do a driverless car." That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying there are opportunities
in industry segments where the amount of data and sensor inputs make a perfect
sense for us reinventing business processes and enabling very diﬀerent experiences
inside an automobile or whatever else you'd like to reinvent on that front.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
I think this question just goes back to open. But I'll ask it anyway. Just as it relates to
Linux on Azure, it's growing as a %, it feels like.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It is.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
And before, it was probably not referred to as a friend. Now it is being referred to as
more friendly. Can you talk about what's changed this view? I think I know the
answer.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
No. It's the same thing. Again, if you're trying to build an environment -- and this is
about big developers instead of maybe an end user enterprise customer that we've
talked about so far -- if what you care about is having developers love the platform
you're building and have it be ﬂexible for them for the scenarios they want to use, of
course, of course we will work with many Linux providers to make sure Azure works
for them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

Okay. A lot of talk in the industry about analytics, big data. You guys have made a
number of acquisitions. You've unveiled Power BI. It seems a little bit easier to use.
You don't have to tether it to all kinds of diﬀerent technologies. Is this starting to
have an impact? Does this show up on the CFOs radar at all?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
On my radar? It does. You have to remember we have a very big analytics business
when you think about it holistically. Between the investments of BI and SQL, between
us owning one of the most-used front ends in Excel, we have a very interesting
opportunity to grow our analytics business. I feel like the product suite -- we have a
terriﬁc leader in that business, a guy named James Phillips, who's just doing
awesome work. And I'm very excited about our opportunity to increase the share we
have there in analytics. E5 will be a very good vehicle for us to do that.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Phone question. There's a lot of focus on market share. How do you think about
where you want to be in that market share war?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
The best example is to say; what are we launching? We launched the 950 and
950XL. They're premium products at the premium end of the market, made for
Windows fans. And we'll have a business phone as well. It's a focused approach. I
think we're not confused on what that growth will look like and should look like.
We're focused on doing it in a smart way and we're focused on the people who love
our products and our experience. So this is where -- if the mobility of the experience
is important, then we'll probably be in that segment in the phone is the premium in
the business segment for us.

After Satya was named CEO, he commented that all the businesses needed to be
able to stand on their own.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Does this apply to the phone business as well?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. It's a funny question. Every business we're in has to ultimately stand on its own.
The important question is; how do you deﬁne a business? At what level you deﬁne
it? But the answer is yes. Once we've deﬁned a business, it absolutely needs to standFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

itself.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Just another like four other questions on mobile. How do you think about the
strategy of what you're doing? Obviously the subscription is growing across
platforms. It can have a big attach. I know I'm an Oﬃce 365 subscriber and can
deploy it anywhere.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
You can.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
What else is going to help on the mobile side, from your perspective?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I didn't totally follow the question. I think what you're saying is do I believe the
mobility of an experience is important. You've seen us say it's important. We've now
bought Acompli, Wunderlist, Sunrise, MileIQ. Those are all terriﬁc productivity
experiences, cross-plat, that allow you, which is a common scenario for people to
have an Android or an iPhone, iOS phone. And a Windows PC. If you want -- well, I
don't know whether there's any more common proﬁle -- be having that experience
be consistent, gorgeous. And accrue is incredibly important to us.
You can look at -- I mean it's very funny all the articles that have come out on how we
own more of your iPhone space than we used to on your mobile phone. It's because
of these beautiful experiences that we've put together that are accruing back to
Oﬃce. It's a very good thing to have people want to use your apps. That is what we
mean by mobile ﬁrst. It doesn't have to mean we sell a phone. Let me be super clear
on that.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Another question from the audience. Could you envision the scenario where Azure
really accelerates and maybe can play catch-up to AWS as the lead rider up beyond
the peloton?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. Let me answer that question two ways. Number one, while I know everybody
wants me to focus on just the size of my Azure cloud, you'll never see me do it
because our business is the commercial cloud all up from the SaaS to the IaaS and
the PaaS layer. Literally, we won't talk it about it separately. And so, mentally, I know
people want to do it that way. It's probably not going to happen.
That being said, what's important is we are growing very fast. I don't know how else I
am supposed to grow faster. It's a very big number. And I feel very good about theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

where, over the long haul, with the amount of TAM that exists to be captured in this
business there can be two very big players? I absolutely believe there can be two
very big commercial cloud players, given the size of this market.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
A question around the entertainment business. Is the TV still important in this world?
What's the opportunity for Xbox in terms of ﬁnancial relevance in Microsoft?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Number one, XBOX is ﬁnancially relevant to Microsoft. So people should not be
confused about the journey of improvement we have been on in the past few years
in the Xbox business. So I will just simply say that.
Next, I don't think about it as much about the TV. I think about the importance of
gaming. I would actually, literally, very speciﬁcally talk about the importance of
gaming to us. You've seen the investments we've made. You've seen us talk about
gaming and it's important across all form factors for us, via the PC, via the phone, via
the console itself. And I think we've done a very good job of taking what was
something that was sort of sat outside the Windows ecosystem and made it part of
the Windows ecosystem so that gaming value accrues back to the ecosystem and to
the developers who work there.
And so, for me, entertainment is too broad of a question. I would say gaming is
fundamentally important. The brand, Xbox, is still an incredibly powerful brand.
Gaming PCs are amongst the most lucrative businesses to be in. Gaming, as a
category, is quite proﬁtable. And I feel good about sort of how we've changed the
landscape of what that looks like as a company and was incredibly excited at the
Code.org announcement yesterday where Minecraft will be one of the two
fundamental experiences every young and aspiring coder across the globe will get
to work in. We are super proud of the relevance that has to us. And so, gaming is a
very interesting opportunity in as much as it attracts young people to the ecosystem.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
The last question on iPad was; when you just look external, companies that inspire
you that you feel you would like to bring aspects of that to Microsoft?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
There's so many. Gosh, where would I start? I am deeply inspired by the focus on the
customer that people like Pixar have, how cleanly they know who their audience is.
And how deeply they focus on it. I am always inspired by companies that look -- I'll
give you a funny example, maybe. I think GE has done a really interesting job of
changing how they think about the businesses they're in. I always ﬁnd that to be very
inspiring, when people can take a lens that's sort of been applied to them from the
outside world and really change about what their asset is they have in life and
getting back to what that matters.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-17

A - Amy HoodThere's companies, even locally, that I think we learn a lot from. Starbucks; Starbucks
has a very clear vision of their reason for existing on the planet. When you talk to
them, there are 300,000 people who can tell you why they exist. Literally, 300,000.
Consistently. The culture is so deeply understood in every part of their being. I think
that is such a monumental testament to the consistency of a strategy and culture.
And I think we're working really hard on that. But we've got a ways to go because we
run a pretty diverse business. But I look and there's tons of them.
And in tech, you could pick tons of people. Like, I think Mark's here, right? Garret. I'm
like shameless in saying that I learned a lot from how they talked about their
transition years ago and I think they did a terriﬁc job.
And so, I have to tell you I am not afraid to beg, borrow, steal, learn and that's just
been a cultural norm we have to have. If somebody does something better, then let's
just -- let's learn how they did it and do better. And I think that's a culture thing that
people have to appreciate as diﬀerent. We call it sort of always learning is the
cultural principle we have.
And so, that's why I laughed when you asked me the question. There are so many
things I look and say I've learned in the past two years that we can do better and the
list is sort of very long. And it always should be. Like, as a leader, if you're not
thinking you can do something better, do something diﬀerent, try it again, take a
diﬀerent approach, then you're probably too proud or too clueless, both of which
are bad. That would be unfortunate.
