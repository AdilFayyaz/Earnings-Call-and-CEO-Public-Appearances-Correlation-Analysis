Page 2 of 18Lizabeth Dunnabout Back-to-School and what her thoughts are on the season, who is here to win
the season, how the season will evolve and what we should be looking for as we
analyze the 2016 Back-to-School College season. So, Liz welcome and I guess
(inaudible).
Absolutely. Thank you. So I guess, just to kick it oﬀ, how important do you think the
Back-to-School season is for retailers, how big is that, what kind of things should be
we looking for?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
It's the second most important season, so it is very important, obviously dwarfed by
the holiday season, but it's important because it's an indication of what's to come. So
many people look at the Back-to-School season, Back-to-School, Back-to-College
and take that as an indication of how we're teeing-up for a holiday. You know, it's
obviously been a bit of a choppy year this year, but the expectations for Back-to-
School and Back-to-College look to be pretty strong so far, so I am trying to -- sorry --
I am just want to advance the slide. So, and you know we're looking at the NRF's
survey results, and what they do is conduct a survey to get consumers' expectations
of what they're planning to spend. They're looking for about an 11.5% increase, which
is -- would be phenomenal after a little bit weaker year last year, Back-to-School and
Back-to-College in total they're estimating at about $75 billion, so you know quite a
big season and really important for some of the key retailers
They're also looking at -- they're looking at a couple things. First of all, every
category is expected to be up, to the major categories apparel and footwear, school
supplies, technology all expected to be up. But we're looking for some really or
they're looking for some really strong growth in apparel and footwear. So I think
that's what we're going to focus on today and those categories look to be up high-
single digits according to their survey.
Now, it's important to mention there are some other surveys out there that suggest
that the season won't be quite as strong, but everybody is looking for growth and I
saw one out today or yesterday from the (inaudible) Institute Research Group and
they said that they were looking for 2% to 3% growth, but that was sort of in line with
what we've seen year-to-date in terms of spending.
And so, you know, whether or not it's up low-single digits or high single-digits is
obviously going to be a big deal for many of these retailers, but everyone is kind of
looking for it to be up, and I think what's important in NRF survey is where people's
purchase intent is. Now, in the Back-to-School side of the chart you see that there is
an increased interest in shopping at drugstores, in shopping online, obviously huge
jump there, department stores and oﬃce supply.
In the Back-to-college survey, it's a little bit strange that pretty much every category
is down, so there is -- so they are expecting to spend more, but perhaps it spread out
among, you know, the categories of retailer in a little bit broader sense. So I guess,
we kind of covered, much of that aspect. Yeah, it's a really important season.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

So Liz, ﬁrst of all thank you for coming. Just along those line of the retail landscape
and we talked before how, you know, we see new trends, speciﬁcally to the Back-to-
School season, (inaudible) how do you see it change from what it used to be, how is
it diﬀerent from what it used to be, what's important for people right now?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah. The -- it looks like people are shopping a little bit earlier, and really looking for
bargains. Back-to-School is an interesting period of time, because it really is
appointment shopping, and so when the economy gets a little rocky, years ago
everyone started talking about sort of appointment shopping versus shopping that
we do the rest of the year. So appointment meaning there really is a call to action or
reason to be purchasing and I think Back-to-School is the -- and it's the biggest, you
know, the biggest appointment based shopping time of the year, because you know
with where you need space, you need notebooks, you need pencils, you know if
your kids are growing they need things, if your kids are going to college they need
dorm supplies, so there is all this appointment activity, but I think that, you know, the
biggest change we are seeing this year is that things are happening a lot earlier,
people are completing their shopping a lot earlier.
We also -- you know, obvious big change is that much of the business has shifted to
online, and so online is -- continues to grow the outpaced growth for Back-to-School.
And I think -- I think that is a -- it's a big challenge for many traditional brick and
mortar retailers.
The other thing we saw coming out of the NRF survey was that there is -- the people
are still very, very focused on free shipping as, you know the number one thing they
want to see online, but they are more and more focused on some of those
omnichannel oﬀerings like -- like buy online and pick up in store, you know kind of
click and collect is another way people refer to it, and so they're looking for those
convenience factors and they really are expecting that there'll be just this kind of
seamless integration between on line and in-store, which not every retailer is set up
to handle some of the bigger ones are certainly there, but I think it's a challenge for
some of the smaller retailers.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
So I guess, you know, following up on that there is obviously lots of information out
there for the consumer, that's ﬁckle [ph] and there's a lot of diﬀerent ways retailers
are trying to approach those customers, but what do you think is the best way and
how -- what are these diﬀerent approaches that some retailers are using to capture
this audience?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 4 of 18Yeah. You know, the landscape has changed quite a bit in a lot of ways. I mean, there
is much, much more competition and the consumer is hard to reach there on their
phones. I think, I looked at a presentation recently that said -- said that the average
millennial spends, you know over eight hours a day on their phone, which is just, you
know, an insane amount of time.
And so they're on their phones, they're oﬀ chasing Pokemon or whatever they're
doing, they are really hard to reach and they're getting -- they're considering more
brands than they've ever considered before. They are not just looking to the main
mall-based retailers as a -- you know as a source for fashion, inspiration or where
they're going to purchase product, and they have higher expectations as I
mentioned for service and for omnichannel integration. They want shipping to be
free or if not free, cheap. They want it to be fast, they expect things in a matter of
days, and they just really don't have time for a retailers sort of comes away ﬁguring
out how to address the changes at the marketplace. And you know, they are also a
lot less interested in things and more interested in experiences. And so for retailers,
for traditional retailers to rise above the noise in and really capture their attention,
they really have to try very hard to make their store environments, their online
presence and their social media presence kind of all worked to garner attention,
right.
And then you talk about free shipping, you know the name that comes to mind is
Amazon, they pioneered free shipping and especially in two days or less. So when
we think of Amazon, when we think of Back-to-School and their push into apparel,
especially you've mentioned that apparel is a category that may see an increase.
What should we expect, I mean, is Amazon going to put dent in apparel shopping or
what the retailers have to do to compete with Amazon?
Yeah, from what we've seen so far, I don't think they're really poised to see outsized
increases in the apparel category right now, but I mean, you can't discount Amazon.
Any time Amazon says that they're coming after a category you're in, I think, most
retailers, you know are terriﬁed by that and some estimates suggests that their
market share in the US is already about 7% in the apparel category. So that's already
very, very meaningful share. They've launched some private brands this year, kind of
in stealth mode and they're really trying to ﬁgure out this marketplace.
But you know preparation for this webcast and sort of looking around on Amazon's
website and trying to ﬁgure out whether or not their algorithms could kind of
identiﬁed me as a Back-to-School shopper. So, you know, you and I talked about this
putting some things in our basket that we're kind of Back-to-School categories and
seeing if they begin to oﬀer us anything in the way of apparel. And you know they
just didn't and even you really have to kind of search on Amazon's website for Back-
to-School apparel very speciﬁcally to ﬁnd, you know curated lists of uniforms or
whatever. It's not -- so they haven't cracked the code, I think, is the short answer for
this even.
But you know, I think, it remains to be seen, but I'm certainly hearing from most of
my consulting clients and from a lot of the public companies that, that this is a very --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 5 of 18Chen Grazutis
Lizabeth Dunnvery much something everybody's watching, because they will eventually get it by
throwing a lot of money at it. You have prime numbers already buying a lot of staple
items from Amazon for Back-to-School, and I think it's just kind of a natural evolution
that they'll begin to tap into some of those apparel categories.
When they tap into these apparel categories, one of the biggest challenges in
apparel for any retailer, especially online, is the returns that you get, what can
Amazon do with those returns like, I mean, what does they do with them, they don't
have a store. They don't have a distribution outlet outside of amazon.com.
Yeah, I think Amazon's fulﬁllment model is, you know, best in the business. And so I
think that handling those returns is going to be coming little bit more naturally to
them than the confusion that many brick and mortar retailers faced with it. So most
brick and mortar retailers have, you know separate inventory -- a separate inventory
for online versus stores and as they accept returns from online into stores and from
stores to online, you know it becomes very confusing. I think that -- I think that for
Amazon, it's a little bit more natural because they are -- they are, you know best ad
fulﬁllment.
But I think it's -- I think you're right, the apparel category, you can see returns of, you
know, 30% to 50%, which is unusual. They do have the experience of having depots
[ph] and depots has really adapted managing all those returns and you know,
they've obviously -- they obviously have a dominant position in the footwear market.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
But it just to -- so if I boil it down, so if you look at the non-apparel categories, we
think people going to go more online, if you look at the apparel category we're
seeing Amazon is not there yet. So what would you think, who would be in the
apparel category where people didn't move this line, online as much and Amazon is
not playing such a big, who would you see winning there?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah. In the apparel categories, I think, there are number of -- there are number of
companies that are may be poised to win, most apparel and footwear businesses,
retailers have -- have you know e-commerce operations and so, you know, how well
those operations are integrated with their stores, I think, is important. And I think that
athleisure is going to continue to be a great category for the holiday season, I'm
sorry for the Back-to-School season.
And I think that -- I think that some of the traditional teen apparel companies, sort of
the remaining teen apparel companies are poised to be a little bit better, and
speciﬁcally focused on Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle as sort of having an
opportunity this season. I think they are kind of beneﬁting from some of the shake-
out in states, and the fact that retailers like (inaudible) dollar, and you know,
(inaudible) and (inaudible) quite a few stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

Lizabeth DunnI think the department stores I'm looking at close is being sort of best positioned this
Back-to-School season and you know, we can kind of get into that a little bit, but
there are some slides in the presentation, at least, if people want to refer -- refer to
them. But and you know, I also think that the business is just going to be a lot
broader and you know we saw out of some of this -- out of some of the same-store
sales reports today, it's pretty choppy out there. I mean, like we all had a diﬃcult
month, all brands does a little bit better than expected, but ﬂat in their brick and
mortar stores and that's been a winner over time. I think, our prices is positioned
pretty well and will continue to be -- be a winner in the -- during the season.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
We touch on athleisure for a second and we have the Olympics starting tomorrow.
Well, can you tell me about, you know, who is going to be, might be poised to win
from this Olympics, in terms of the athletic brands or athleisure companies?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, it's a great opportunity for brands to shine and Lululemon is designing
some uniforms, I think that's going to get them a lot of great PR, Nike as always, is
always a winner coming out of an Olympic cycle. I saw at Foot Locker present
recently and they talked about the cycle of innovation that kind of follows after an
Olympic year and the fact that, you know this innovation really does trickle down into
the products that end up on the shelves at Foot Locker and Finish Line and other
places.
And so I think that the whole footwear category will beneﬁt from that innovation.
We've seen some softness in the basketball category in -- you know recent quarters
and so it will be good to have some innovation coming out of this event, as well as
you know, just a huge opportunity for marketing and brand engagement, which you
know goes back to many of the things that some of the traditional retailers are
struggling to do. I think there's a lot more kind of natural, emotional engagement
with brands in the athletic category and the Olympics is a great opportunity to sort
of showcase that into, and to you know amplify messaging.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Just going more on athleisure, we see a lot of specialty apparel stores, department
stores creating their own brands to target this growing segment in popular apparel
market. Who do you think is doing it right, like if you look at the gap, the Macy's, the
H&Ms, J.C.Penney, even everyone is entering athleisure, but who is actually able to
do well and can succeed?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah. I think that the department stores are doing an okay job. I think, you know,
Kohl's just announced that they're going to add Under Armour to their assortment. I
think that's something that they've been wanting to do for a really long time. I
remember like ﬁve years ago sitting down with management and then they sort ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 7 of 18Poonam Goyal
Lizabeth Dunnrubbed their hands and said, we can't get Under Armour and so that's a really big
coup for them. I think that you know just walking the department store sales force,
you really see pretty strong assortments in the athletic and athleisure category.
Macy's just obviously partnered with Finish Line couple of years ago and I think that's
going well and allowing them to get access to product and also kind of a store
environment that feels a little bit more fun in the footwear category and they're also
you know doing a lot of in-store things around the apparel business in athleisure.
I think that in the specialty retail world, it's been hit or miss. American Eagle has
done a pretty good job kind of with their -- with Aerie and kind of using that as a
launchpad into athleisure. I think Victoria's Secret has done a good job as well and
they're really beneﬁting from that soft dressing category with pink and their athletic
line, which I'm seeing -- I mean, it's totally anecdotal, but I think that you can take
something from what women are wearing to all these boutiques ﬁtness classes and
in Manhattan as like a forward indicator of what brands are cool and you do see a lot
of Victoria's Secret in that, you know more than, much more than you used to, it's not
all Lululemon.
Obviously Lululemon is, you know, you have to mention them when you're talking
about the athleisure category and I do think that the company is poised to continue
to see a same-store sales gains. I'm not as excited about the brand as I used to be. I
think it's a, you know, I think the brand has lost some momentum and some
excitement and I don't see the fashion there, but that doesn't mean that the stock
can't work and that the -- and that the sales won't continue to increase, because they
were coming-oﬀ of a few really tough years.
But I think that you know what we've really seen is just a shift in how people are
dressing and it's a soft dressing trend that doesn't seem to be going away. I think
you always have to be aware of these trends when they're rooted a little bit in
function as well as fashion that's a harder trend to break, then just some sort of fad,
right, you know, and so I think it speaks to the way that people are living, more
active, but it also is a trend kind of based in comfort and innovation, you know fabric
innovation.
And we're seeing a lot of brands and retailers kind of use some of the fabric
innovation and you know build product, that's a little bit more every day wear. It's not
necessarily meant to be worn to the gym, but it's, you know, it's got all the function
and the comfort that athletic apparel has.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
If you go back to Back-to-School and you think of apparel athleisure is deﬁnitely an
area where we'll see both school and college shoppers making a purchase. And how
about denim, has denim made a comeback in your view, and is that going to be a
big item this Back-to-School again?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 8 of 18Poonam GoyalYeah. I think denim is going to be important, if I look at what Abercrombie and
American Eagle are emphasizing, you know, they're both really pushing denim right
now, in a little bit diﬀerent ways, but there is like this denim lifestyle. I think both
companies kind of know that that's a category that they can own a bit more than
some of the fashion categories that they're pushing the envelope on but I think
denim is important where we are back in a denim cycle, last year we started to
denim pickup and I think that continues.
So it's not athleisure or denim, I think it's both and at least from what I'm seeing both
with my consulting clients and what I'm seeing in the mall and more broadly it looks
like denim is poised to be strong for this year.
The other thing that we're seeing is a lot more focus on kind of sharp price points
instead of blanket promotions. So Abercrombie, Hollister, they are oﬀering these
sharp price points on denim, instead of saying we're going to oﬀer 40% of the whole
store.
And I think that's a better approach, it certainly and typically a more proﬁtable
approach if it works. And I think it's giving consumers a price point around a holiday
and/or an event like Back-to-School that you know that's really compelling. And
American Eagle on the other hand is doing, it's taking more of a BOGO approach,
which I think is also valid, because if this is a period of time where people are
stocking up with Back-to-School, I think that's a good approach.
However, I highlighted in the presentation, you know, one company that's kind of
shifted from blanket promotions to price point promotions or you know, sharp price
points is just as and I think that's a little risky. You know, doing some store checks
over the last couple of weeks, it's just is a big shift for them and they've talked about,
and they've talked to, you know analysts and investors about their shift in strategy.
They're also introducing a lot broader fashion.
So it's not all glitter, you know they've got kind of a BOHO corner and you know
global inspiration corner and a DenimBar and some athleisure. So they've got a lot
more diversity in their fashion assortment and more price points instead of blanket
promotions. But it's a big shift, you know and obviously they've had some
challenging times. So perhaps, you know, it kind of -- it's a -- likewise they can aﬀord
to stay the course that they really need to shift, but I think it might cause a little bit of
consumer confusion around Back-to-School about whether or not the value is that
compelling as it is used to be.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
That's interesting because if you recall three or four years ago, J. C. Penney with
there, you know, single price point model versus the promotions backﬁred basically
and it's interesting that the team retailers can make it work, but someone like adjust
it for a department store, where the customer is almost trained for aggressive
discounts before they make the purchase, do you think the strategy will resonateFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 9 of 18Lizabeth Dunn
Poonam Goyal
Lizabeth Dunnwith just as, I know, you talked a little about that and do you see department stores
that are moving to this strategy again?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah. It's a really diﬃcult transition to make and then you know ﬁnally got into the
place, right. I don't cringe when somebody mentioned all the bad things that
happened at J. C. Penney years ago, but I think it's a pretty diﬃcult transition and I
think when companies like just as make that transition, there'll be some short-term
pain.
But I do think that the consumer is shifting their mindset, particularly younger
consumers, pricing integrity is really important to them and pricing transparency.
And so, you know, they kind of get turned oﬀ by these, you know blanket sales and I
think for just this (Technical Diﬃculty) to go and for those concepts like Abercrombie
and American Eagle that are -- they are really trying to target (Technical Diﬃculty)
this millennial customer, you know, without it's not the (Technical Diﬃculty) this adult
customer, I think the right approach and you know, apparently a much more
compelling fashion assortment, a stronger brand voice more focused in social media
and you know, these indirect channels.
So it's, you know, for those two brands, it's kind of a total overhaul, more so for
Abercrombie than American Eagle. I mean, American Eagle isn't (Technical Diﬃculty)
anywhere near the (Technical Diﬃculty) and so Abercrombie has done just a massive
overhaul of several (Technical Diﬃculty) at their business and I think the pricing is the
right approach, I hope that they can maintain discipline as we move into the back
half of the year.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
And in Abercrombie, if you look at Hollister and the namesake brand, Hollister has
obviously done a better job or it seems that they have -- do you think Abercrombie,
the namesake brand can turn itself around to have better relevance with their
customers. I mean, it's a diﬀerent story than it was, you know, than two years ago?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah. It's very diﬀerent and I think that they've made some real strides. I think the
fashion is much, much more relevant. I think that, I mean the website is among the
best in the teen and young adult space. It's really fresh, and they're kind of moving
towards this message of inclusiveness, which was never they're saying and I think
that's -- that's the message that resonates. And so, you know, I think they're well on
their way, but it will take time and I think that -- I think that a new generation of young
adults is not so jaded that they wouldn't be -- you know that they be open to
Abercrombie & Fitch being a relevant brand choice for them, it's just -- it's up to the
company to kind of stay consistent with the complete overhaul that they're
attempting to do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

I just wanted to remind people that on the bottom of the page, they can put
questions and I think we have about three already. So we're just going to take a look
and we'll see if you can take some questions from the audience.
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
I'll say just presentation is about whether or not -- questions about whether or not
the presentation will be available, it will.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Which the answer is yes, I believe, correct?
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Yes. We will send out the presentation materials and a transcript after 11 hours
(inaudible).
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
If you do have questions, please ask until that we will continue. The other thing I
wanted to say about the teen companies is that, you know, they're really beneﬁting
from some of the shake-out in this space, you know Airbus store is closing a number
of stores, I mean, Abercrombie has closed quite a few stores, but what the stores that
are left in that center are seeing, assuming it's a solid center is that you know couple
of point lift in comp. So if Airbus store closes, the American Eagle next door sees a
couple of point lift in comp, which is great news.
Now, I don't think that's a one-size-ﬁts-all approach to looking at bankruptcies and
looking at the shake-out in the space. I saw a presentation from Genesco recently.
They own Journeys as well as number of other brands that they said, you now, if the
mall is going south, you know, it's not good for them to see -- to see vacancies
because then the Mall starts to lose relevance. So in those C [ph] centers, you don't
see the same beneﬁt as stores close, but they do think that it's a good -- it's a net
positive if the entire mall closes, because then the center down the street or you
know in the same trade area get quite a big lift from that, you know, shake-out.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
You know, I think, in one of the headlines that you had here, I heard you say before
the young adults are just you know price integrity is very important to them, which I
ﬁnd very interesting, which also bring me to the oﬀ-price retailers and you touched
on them for a second before. The brands that I cover, a couple have done, it's really
worth going [ph], they did discuss reducing the exposure they have to appraise
retailers, reducing the inventory that they give those guys.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

Poonam Goyal{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Did you see that as a real trend to try to get back to that price integrity and what
could be the dynamics there between the brand and the operating channel?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah. I think that's a great question. (Technical Diﬃculty) But I think that brands like
Ralph Lauren has had kind of a you know a dirty little secret that's not so much of a
secret, which is they supply a signiﬁcant amount of product to that channel and I
think as they have looked at where their brand is and whether or not that consumer
is giving them permission to have this to occupy this luxury space. And that's a
problem and I think it's one that is in conﬂict with what they want to do with their
brand overall. And so I think it's -- that particular thing is a little bit of a Ralph Lauren
problem.
But I think the bigger issue for a lot of brands like Ralph Lauren, like you know
Tommy Hilﬁger et cetera is their distribution and their part in -- you know in Macy's.
And I have been pretty critical of Macy's of late, because I am seeing brands, you
know kind of want to maybe pull back on that channel of distribution, because it's so
promotional.
Macy's is not good at selling things full price and then when they discount the
product, they go back to the vendor and ask for money and so it's a model that
doesn't work, it's not particularly customer friendly, because the price is not the price
and you know, you can walk-in with a coupon and a discount. I bought a pair of
shoes at Macy's the other day and you know the lady at the register just said, oh, I
think there's a coupon on that and grabbed some ﬂyer and I suddenly I got an
additional discount and it was a pair of Michael Kors shoes and I think they -- I
walked out of the stores with them for like $40, But that's not good for Michael Kors. I
think those shoes cost you know $180 originally.
And so that's I think a little bit more brand destroying than selling goods in the oﬀ-
price channel for most brands. Ralph Lauren, like I said is a little bit of a special
situation, but I think they have a bit more pricing integrity and that better and
moderate department stores so they have a little bit more pricing integrity in Macy's
than some of the other brands, but that oﬀ-price and the fact that they were making
product, cutting product speciﬁcally for the oﬀ-price channel in large quantities was
starting to be -- starting to be a little bit brand dilutive for them.

So what do you think of backstage in a Macy's store? Is that good or bad?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

You know I think it's -- I don't like it. I just --
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
I don't either.
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
I feel like it's, you know just one more thing that tells the consumers this is the store
where everything's pretty much always on sale and you know if that's not a good
enough sale, we've got it at that area -- yeah, of an even bigger sale and it's kind of
like a drug and for Macy's, it's been a, particularly, you know, they're like on the drug
and they've got a Trust Fund behind it, which (inaudible) vendors, their vendors who
are providing all this markdown money, but it's not a sustainable way to stay in
business, I think, I mean, I'm not suggesting Macy's, you know.
But I just think it's not a sustainable way to manage your business and it's not a long-
term strategy, I think it's chasing this oﬀ-price trend in a very short term way and
putting those backstage areas in their own stores is just, I mean, it to me is madness.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Doesn't it make more sense to have them outside of your stores with separate
standalone, so which they are doing too, but it seems like they are chasing the in-
store model faster.
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
And the model that's outside the store.
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
I would much -- I mean, I don't like the strategy period, but I would much rather see
it outside of the store than in their own stores and I just, I think it's continuing to feed
an environment where the consumer thinks, you know, Macy's is all about sales and
maybe that's good in a short term, because the consumer feels like they can get a
bargain there.
I think, I say in the presentation that, you know at times like Back-to-School, the
department stores are known for being able to really deliver more compelling value
than some another channels, but ultimately Macy's has two, you know, customersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

Chen Grazutisreally, they have their customer, but they also need to keep the brands happy and
they need to keep the brands there. And if the brands are feeling like Macy's is a
brand dilutive experience for them, as of long-term risk.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
We had a question that we actually get this question a lot and I would be interested
to hear what's your opinion on it. In terms of e-commerce sales and promotions, as
more customers move to that channel, do you expect, and to rely on Amazon one
more or to stick with the kind of brick and mortar retailers that they were used to and
expect the personal consulting on the product, what's your opinion on that?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
And you know, I think that sorry -- can you rephrase the question, I am really
(inaudible) --
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
So if people move more to buy online using e-commerce, do you think if you are
going to just stick with the convenience of Amazon or they would just, you know buy
the same things they used to buy from the brick and mortars, stay with the same
name, but just use their e-commerce channels?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I think Amazon is consolidating a lot of the business because of prime.
So once you are prime, you sort of want to check Amazon ﬁrst, before you go
anywhere else, at least that's the way I operate. You know whether I'm looking for an
air conditioner ﬁlter, an aero mattress like whatever it is, groceries, I get my groceries
on Amazon now and it's just -- it's easy because once you're prime, you know it can
be a one-plus experience, you can you know get very quick fulﬁllment, free
fulﬁllment and so I think there is more and more business that's going to shift to
Amazon.
I don't know if apparel is going to be as easy. I'm not to crack for them, because
there is a -- there is a, you know fashion and a taste component. It's very, very
speciﬁc and so I -- I don't, I'm just not looking for a commodity product when
looking for apparel. But I think that you know for anything that's somewhat
commoditized, Amazon is absolutely the way to go and I think consumers are going
to dedicate more and more of their wallet to Amazon.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Yeah. Actually I want to say basically the same thing. I think it's really depends of
what kind of retailer you are looking at, because some of -- for DICK'S Sporting
Goods, which is a very, you know -- that the items we can ﬁnd very easily on Amazon
comparable to what they sell, it can be tougher versus more the apparel speciﬁcFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

Page 14 of 18Lizabeth Dunnretailers, that it's just harder to do it online with Amazon. Everyone say it is best buy
but the Best Buy, I feel like its being -- doing some interesting stuﬀ online.
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah. I also think you know, I think there is something to be said, I mean, Best Buy
and the Best Buy shopper. So I just -- my computer just crashed, so I had to get a
new computer and I, ﬁrst of all, went to Best Buy because I wanted to go to Geek
Squad, see if they could help with the same, I needed it restored. So I, you know,
entered into a contract which cost me $600 to get the computer restored, but I also
bought, you know, a new computer at Best Buy and that whole experience with Best
Buy, there is a service element there that you know that Amazon hasn't replicated
and so I think that's important.
I also think that there is a little bit of discovery in walking into a Best Buy store, which
is interesting. I mean, it can be a fun shopping environment and more and more
retailers really need to look at ways to bring those experiential elements into their
store to make shopping fun, just sort of experience if there is an education
component with product that can go along with the store service environment. I
think that's important and that can be a protective mode that -- you that Amazon
can't maybe oﬀer in a pure online environment. So it's about experience, It's about
education and having you know some aspect of discovery and maybe even fun in
your stores.
Yeah. You know traﬃc is obviously been down for a multi-year period. But it's not
down at the best centers, it's really the business is kind of consolidating around
those top centers and it's up for many of the A malls and B malls as well. And so I
think it's really the C and D malls we're seeing this kind of rapid unraveling of those
properties. And I think that it's a little bit of a self-fulﬁlling prophecy, because the
landlords are unwilling to invest capital in those malls. And, you know, so then
they're going away even more rapidly.
You know, you're seeing in the top centers they're getting an improved food court,
they're getting improved, you know experiential elements into their stores, they're
having -- they're adding new stores, new wings, all of the stuﬀ and new fast casual
concepts and the consumer seems to love dining out these days more than
anything. And so all of those things are making us understand out. But you know, it's
hard to invest in something you've already deemed a losing asset. And so I think
we'll see a bigger shake out in the next couple of years of those kind of lower tier
centers.
Back to that Genesco presentation from a couple of weeks ago, they said that when
they renegotiate leases in those C centers, they're not doing any D centers. But in
even C centers they are not signing anything less than or anything more than like a
two year lease. And they're doing it with so many protections, and about, you know
the vacancy rates in the co-tenancy. And so I think it's -- I think that e-commerce and
everything that's happened digitally and everything that's happened with the
consumer is hastening the demise of those lower tier centers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

Lizabeth DunnI think the question is also sort of about the retailers that are located in those lower
tier centers. I think that's a really ﬂawed strategy and one that is going to lead to a
couple of more failures in the next couple of years of some of the specialty retailers
that are really focused on making, you know think, oh, we can go to C centers,
because the rent is so inexpensive and there's not a lot of competition that's a losing
long-term strategy, and one that could play out in kind of a nasty way for some
retailers in the short-term.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
And then just going back to department stories, you said Kohl's is probably your
pick, what was going to win in the Back-to-School season, what are they doing that's
so diﬀerent from Macy's, Penney's and even Sears that would draw more shoppers to
the history's best Back-to-School season?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah, I think Kohl's has a fresher store environment, is a cleaner store, its -- they've
spent a lot of time focused on and you know attracting new brands and attracting
and upgrading certain areas of the store like beauty, and I think that they have a
better website than the other two, you know that I'm highlighting in the presentation,
Macy's and Penney's. It's just you know easier to navigate.
There is an obvious editorial point of view around areas like dorm or uniforms and
even fashion. And I think that they have done a great job emphasizing the fact that
they've got click and collect oﬀerings and you know, really just emphasizing that
omnichannel experience to their consumer. They -- yeah, so I just think they're doing
a really good job across the board and I think that because their stores are, you
know, a cleaner sort of more exciting shopping environment. I mean, that gives them
-- that gives them a leg up on the other two.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Do you think they are losing customers to Penney or say, just to update their focus
on Back-to-School. I mean, it's a big business for both Kohl's and Penney's. It's a key
period for them and I've seen a push, at least, by J. C. Penney to try to get that
shopper back and to shop with them and whether it's tiny deals or whether it's $10
giveaways in store, just a promotion seem to be alluring customers to their stores.
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah, I do think, I mean, I think Penney's has poised to have a decent Back-to-School
season, but I and I think that they're probably pulling business from other retailers
and you know may be pulling a little bit from mass retailers in the apparel category.
And I think, whole of this is kind of sticking to their netting a little bit and just
continuing to enhance that they've built with better brands and better service, and
you know improved assortments kind of across the board.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

Probably a last question from me. We track a lot of e-commerce data on our
dashboard. And I think this striking, and the most striking data point that I have been
looking at is kind of the growth within e-commerce, I think, was it being done on a
mobile phone versus a desktop or an iPad. I think, it doubled the traﬃc and sales on
the mobile it doubled last year on an industry-wide basis, do you see anyone that is
winning on the mobile side?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah, and I think that the most innovation, and I think is coming from smaller
companies, but you know, but I wouldn't say that you know that the larger
companies are -- so it's smaller like more innovative companies like, I don't know,
Rent the Runway, they have an excellent app and I'm on it all the time. And but you
know, I think that the challenge with a lot of -- and a lot of bigger companies is that
they are not well-positioned for mobile, it's not as easy to navigate, it's not as easy to
check out and I think with the data that you highlight means that they need to be
there yesterday, you know, they can't move quick enough to implement this change.
I was shopping Macy's the other day or channel checking Macy's the other day on
online and then also on my phone and the experience was really kind of horrendous
and I don't mean to pick on Macy's so much, but they should be doing better. They
really, and maybe with the shift in management recently, they will, but that the
experience in -- on mobile is almost more important than the experience online,
because the consumer is, you know typically doing something. I mean, that's a really
pretty strong purchase indicator that somebody is on their phone, looking for
merchandise and if they can't check-out or they can't ﬁnd what they're looking for, I
think that's a real negative.
I think that the teen retailers are doing a better job that the ones that I highlighted in
the presentation. Abercrombie and Eagle and -- but basically everyone needs to get
there, if they're not already, extremely commerce-enabled on their mobile sites.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
I have one last question. We touched on department stores, we touched on specialty
apparels, the teens speciﬁcally, but what about children's apparel? I know you talked
about Justice, but if you think of Children's Place, (inaudible), where do you see
demand for children's clothing and how much of it do you think is promotion-driven
for Back-to-School or need based, meaning mom's really wait till the last minute,
because kids outgrow their sizes to shop. So what is your perspective on children's
clothing?
{BIO 6334380 <GO>}
Yeah. And I think that you know, children's clothing is, to your point, it's a need
based thing, it's -- and you know moms are -- value is important, but I also think thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-08-03

Poonam Goyalit's interesting that you know most of the moms are really in that millennial sweet
spot. So that's where we've seen the biggest shift in consumer demand trends and
how they're shopping. And so it's not entirely just price that's motivating them, they
care a lot more of these millennial shoppers about how the product was made,
where it was made, you know, why it was made, the story behind the product and
they're looking, and you know they're researching far and wide for not only the best
value, but the product that aligns most with, you know their values. And so I think
children's and apparel will do ﬁne in the near-term. And I think it will be
promotionally driven business, you know the brick and mortar retailers that you're
talking about. But I think over the long-term, these businesses really need to shift,
because the consumer there is shifting more rapidly than anywhere.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}

good season, which we haven't seen.

of weeks, and the ﬁrst commentary from many other retailers. I mean, I guess, some
people talked about it today on back to -- and on same-store sales, but we'll
certainly see a lot more broad commentaries. I'm looking forward to it. Thank you so
much for having me.
