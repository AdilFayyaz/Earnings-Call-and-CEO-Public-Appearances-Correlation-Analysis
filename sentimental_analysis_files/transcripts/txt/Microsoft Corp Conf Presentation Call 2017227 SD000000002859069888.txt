So we'll get started with our ﬁrst lunchtime keynote with Amy Hood, CFO of
Microsoft. Before we get started, I have a lot of safe harbor to read, okay, from
Microsoft. Microsoft may make some forward-looking statements during this
presentation and you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for the risk factors related to
their business. This is true whether you're here in person or listening on the web.
From Morgan Stanley, please note, all important disclosures including personal
holding disclosures and Morgan Stanley disclosures appear on the Morgan Stanley
public website at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures or at the registration
desk.
So with that out of the way, Amy, thank you very much for joining us once again.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thank you for having me.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So there has been a lot happening in Microsoft over the past year since we've been
talking on the stage. I guess, the biggest one being the addition of LinkedIn. But also
a lot more subtle changes like improved gross margins. Can you walk us through
your perspective on what have been some of the biggest changes we've seen in
Microsoft over the past year and what are you most excited about going into the
next year?

Amy HoodIt's interesting, I think, maybe what you perceive as a lot of changes, I would
probably describe it's just accelerating a bit on the vision that we've had as a team.
Strategy hasn't changed, our ambitions haven't changed, our goals haven't changed,
I think, in many ways. The only thing that you've seen is probably a bit more
aggression in that transformation to make sure we're accelerating through it which is
an important phase. I think with conﬁdence comes some acceleration. Trying to think
-- Satya, it will be three years for him this month. And it's getting close to four for me.
And with that, I think some stability and excitement about the future and conﬁdence
and what we can achieve and that's probably what I would say.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. When I talk to investors, the area of the story that I spend the most time on is
intelligent cloud. And (inaudible) one fundamental debate has been the most time
talking about is server and tools versus Azure. So maybe you can start with the
conversation, server product revenue had a really nice quarter last quarter, up 7%
constant currency. How do you think about the durability of that on-premise portion
of the business longer-term. Is this something that could sustain over the next year,
over the next three years?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's interesting. I know people tend to focus on the component tree and I tend to
focus on all of server products and services number. So many reasons. Number one
that all up number takes out the temporal impact of the timing of a transition, not
annuity this, annuity that, crowd this, on-prem that, hybrid, diﬀerent mechanisms of
licensing. And so for me the long-term goal is quite clear, right, to build a hybrid
server business, server and services business that's primarily annuity based.
And so with that the number of the -- so the KPI of server products and services
tends to resonate at be the cleaner. There will be many customers and in many geos
who run the server products on time longer than others for various reasons
regulatory, geo-political et cetera. And so worrying about the pace of the transition is
not a thing I spend a lot of time on, frankly. I spend a lot more time making sure we
have the capabilities both for our -- and most of our customers are hybrid customers.
So for hybrid solutions or cloud solutions could be as capable of supporting the
Company's journey that they want to go on, not our journey we want to go on. And I
think that's probably better suited to pleasing customers and we really tend to focus
on it all up.
This quarter it was there, we talked a little bit about the fact that Sequel and
Windows launches, both actually went a little better than we thought when that
happened. You do you see that on-prem KPI be a little better. But over the long term
the most important thing to me is continue to pivot it to an annuity business which is
long-term commitments by customers to our platform and our products and then
continue to break new TAM ground with many of the cloud solutions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Got it. I do think that's a good segue into sort of the second part of the question that
investors have is when you -- some of work went into the on-premise environment
versus selling into the cloud environment, how does the opportunity, the
monetization opportunity change for Microsoft? Are you going to be able to make
up in terms of broader monetization what you're losing in what was a hugely high
gross margin business in on-premise?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's why I think we focus so much on dollar proﬁt growth whether that is a gross or
the operating line because, number one, you're right, if you just said like-for-like, if
you sold the exact same server standard SKU and somebody chose to run it in the
cloud versus on on-prem, there's clearly a distinction and the cost that we would
bear. But that's not actually what's happening. Instead of you selling, you sell 1.3 or
1.6 or 2 point some number, multiple of that in terms of new data needs, new
workloads created, new opportunities for compute or insight. And so while the one-
for-one substitution would clearly not be as interesting it's just not how the world is
evolving. The pace of the opportunity grows, the pace of that expansion it's I think
sort of a once in a every decade construct maybe, maybe longer.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Could you remind me about the framework of what percentage of customers
coming over to Azure, what percentage of that is net new business versus visiting
business transitioning over?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's hard to say one for one that you know that this ﬁle/print server that used to run
on-prem is now being run as the ﬁle/print workload. It's not exactly how the math
would work. So the way I tend to think about it is looking to say, hey, topline revenue
has been growing double digits in that server products and cloud business, margins
are getting better all up, we know the market is growing, we know we're taking share
within that and so overall I tend to feel pretty good as opposed to do a one-for-one
like switch.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Then on the competitive environment, when we're talking about that sort of
global scale, public cloud, utility, if you will, most people talk about you, Amazon
Web Services and Google Cloud Computing, the big vendors in that space. How do
you see that competitive dynamic having shifted over the past year, how do you see
that evolving on a going forward basis?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

I think maybe the distinction in a year later is less in those three players than, I think,
were there before and continue to be there and quite aggressive as you would
expect. And maybe some of the people that have entered a little bit later, I think, the
IBM cloud gets a lot of mention with very large customers, you see that both in the
press and in some of the workload solutions they talked about. Probably Allee is
incredibly successful across China and other very large interesting markets globally.
And so I often say it's not the three, although I think you would put them in the clear
leader camp, it would be actually that from a global perspective there is probably
even more players than the three that you've seen a year later.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. It's interesting that you bring up IBM because I think one of the
diﬀerentiations that I often talk to about Azure versus AWS or a Google is is actually
you guys have an install base, that you have a broad distribution channel like IBM
does, install base. Has that advantage -- that sort of install base advantage, has that
become more so invented over the past year as people move from that net new
environment, new workloads to more thinking about how we're going to do that
hybrid environment longer term?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes, I think, the distinction may in fact be twofold. Number one is, we've always been
hybrid from the start. We ourselves run a hybrid environment inside the company,
most of our large customers are after that from the beginning. And so, I do think that
sort of just how we're built architecturally and from a customer centricity perspective.
The other thing about having an install base, usually the customer connection and
relationship, our enterprise sales force, I think, has been underappreciated in its
transition from really selling what we would think of as desktop-based workload,
selling Windows and some version of Oﬃce through to selling really full
infrastructure stacks. (inaudible) the transition to do that and the capabilities, I'm
really proud of that group and all they've done to transition that without really
adding, we've added some sales capability at the technical high end, most of it has
been re-training. And new job ﬁlls.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. One last quick question and then we'll shift gears to productivity and business
process. Amazon recently lowered prices, you guys recently lowered prices. How
should we be thinking about that on a going forward basis, sort of just the pricing
dynamic going on on a go-forward basis?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Page 5 of 14Keith Weiss
Amy Hood
Keith Weiss
Amy HoodIt's been a pricing dynamic there for many, many years -- to the point. I think you
should think it's a competitive market. All of us tend to want to move up the stack in
terms of adding premium services. Our premium services are growing faster than
the core business for us. Part of that is volume, part of it also obviously would be the
impact of price. You don't see the same impact at the higher end where there's more
diﬀerentiation or maybe more commitment on analytics or insight. And so, I don't
describe the pricing dynamic as something that is new or that I would think to be
temporal. But I do you think what you'll see is an eﬀort to continue to move people
up the stack in terms of capability. You are not just really running -- you don't want to
be in the business of running, I think, just core storage and compute.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So more and more the value, goes up the chain.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So shifting gears to productivity and business process. I think the biggest
change obviously since last time we've spoken is that now LinkedIn is in that set of
overall business. Where and when should investors be looking to see the initial sort
of beneﬁts of bringing LinkedIn on board and having LinkedIn part of the Microsoft
ecosystem?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think you'll start to see -- the earliest beneﬁts probably in the co-selling of some of
their, what I would call, business solutions. And you may have noticed in Satya's
comments this quarter he really grouped LinkedIn along with our dynamics business
in terms of how to talk about the oﬀers. You'll see, I think, the Sales Navigator
product, which is one of LinkedIn's core products have some and ﬁnd some added
beneﬁt in having our dynamic sales force to be able to sell that as well.
I think our ability to leverage each other's sales forces for some of that work will be a
good thing and quite tangible in terms of adding quota is not the most complicated
change to make in terms of integration.
The next places you'll start to see it will be in oﬃce in terms of some of the
integrations and insights that you'll be able to learn through outlook for some of the
experiences if you're running the modern clients. And when I say modern clients, I
mean Oﬃce 365 ProPlus, which is what we call the subscription form as opposed to
the pure client perpetual licenses. You'll see some of the ﬁrst integrations come
there. The pace has been quite encouraging. We need, I think it's once a month to
go through the technical roadmap, integration roadmap together. Their former headFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Keith Weissof engineering, Kevin Scott is now the CTO for our Company, which I think is a great
position in terms of integration and being able to do product roadmap together.
He's already made a big impact and we enjoy having him in our meetings on
Fridays.
So I think I'm pretty excited about what's possible both with the Dynamics business.
But also in the broader oﬃce businesses well growing our core -- I mean the
business is growing quickly. First thing -- ﬁght club, is what they said, ﬁrst real ﬁght
club, it's sort of just don't mess with it. You want to keep the core growing and are
doing a great job of that, the team is good. They are motivated. Jeﬀ is a great leader,
inspiring to be around, yes, good.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Speaking of don't mess with it, the other side of the equation is substantial for cost
savings. And I think the investors have thought about potential cost savings arising
from being able to run their application on your backend about savings to
distribution and now dynamic CRM is much more of a distribution channel for them
on a going forward basis. How should the investors think about the timeframe for
achieving those eﬃciencies or should be a little bit more cautious because --
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
You should assume I'm not focused on it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I'm focused on growing the top line revenue and accelerating that business and its
potential with ours, to add more customers, to increase their impact, to have it grow
faster, to accelerate our business, to have the integration and technical integration to
deliver customer value go well. We will do the smart things in terms of sharing
quota. You'd call that a cost synergy, to me that's a revenue generator.
Can we do and share accounting teams, I'm sure, we can and we will share
accounting team. We will have one internal audit team. The smart things will happen
and we're pretty good at that type of activity and I'm just deeply, deeply focused on
driving revenue growth. This deal was not done for cost savings. The deal was done
to drive the topline.

Keith WeissShifting gears to Oﬃce 365, particularly Oﬃce 365, the commercial side of the
business. I think last quarter you had 49% constant currency growth. By our
calculations, this is becoming one of the biggest drivers of gross proﬁt dollar growth
within the overall business. We're trying understand sort of where this ﬁts into the
broader sort of path of $20 billion in commercial cloud that you guys have been
talking about. So really on two sides of the equation, price and quantity. When it
comes to the price, where are we in kind of SKU uplift? We have that tiering, E1, E3,
E5, how far along the path have we gone?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's interesting. We talked about we're about 60% premium mix in our E-Suite. But
what's interesting about that is it really talks about E3 as being premium, even
though we've now got versions of something E4 like and now E5 like with the
security analytics and voice PSTN conferencing in the higher SKU and so that 60%,
we've talked about is really primarily the mix from E1 to E3. Most of the ARPU lift that
you've seen over the past three years is primarily attributable to that ﬁrst mix shift to
the E3 SKU. And so, there's lots of room for us to continue to move people even
further up the skew sack, to also add standalone components like analytics that have
actually done quite well, standalone as of some book security component. Then
move them to E3 as well. So I think we may -- Chris might have been talking about
this, do I need another metric, because it's sort of premium-premium. We will
continue to add tiers. And so E3 probably won't seem quite as premiums any more
as we continue to add layers in the stack.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Any color you could give us in terms of what is the core functionality that are
(appointive Oﬃce) stack, is it analytics, is it security, what is it something we're
starting to hear a lot of that?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Right now I would say just in terms of those business decision makers and CIOs both
analytics and primarily security tend to be the pool right now into that upper E5 SKU,
it's top of mind for everybody. It tends to actually be quite price competitive to its
peers in terms of value both on a standalone basis and then if you were to buy the
SKU giving you optionality into other workloads as you see ﬁt. It's still pretty
compelling as a bundle/seat. And so I would probably say stack ranking them
security is the biggest pool currently, then probably analytics. Voice is always going
to be a trailer, it's a more complex workload. You're less likely to deploy it sort of all
at once across all your seats. So it tends to be something people opt-in through
branch and other deployments that we've been encouraged. Obviously, we run on it.
But we've been encouraged by large deployment.

Page 8 of 14Amy Hood
Keith Weiss
Amy HoodAnd just double clicking real quickly on that analytics, analytics is something that we
talked about a lot over the past 10 years with Microsoft and it seems like Oﬃce 365
has been a vehicle that's really starting to sort of enable that distribution. Is it just
that, is it just a much better vehicle for enabling distribution or is it really sort of
where the products come where the markets (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think it's a lot of things. Most of the analytic solutions required a near PhD to
operate for a long period of time. And so when we kept seeing the optimism around
analytics, I actually think some of the solutions were still pretty complex in terms of
being able to bring that type of insight down to an ease of use that's more similar to
Excel. Most people still use their number one insight tool and analytic tool that
continues to be our Excel product. And so the more you have our solutions like
Power BI or Analytics inside, sequel databases, looking ﬁelds from a user and
integration perspective, more like Excel than less like Excel, I think the more you'll
ﬁnd that broad-based coverage analytics type solutions will be more interesting to
people.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Then on the key side of the Ps and Qs in terms of quantity, where are we in terms of
the base migration? And still with that, I think if you can give us some samples along
the way. But how far along -- particularly when we get to some of the regulated
industries like as (Azek, Morgan Stanley), are they coming close to sort of coming on
board with Oﬃce 365?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Let me take the ﬁrst question and then the second on regulated industry. The ﬁrst
question, which is where are we in the queue, I guess, about two years ago, it seems
like just yesterday Keith, we had the analyst brieﬁng and in that, I should look an
install base chart, I can see it in my mind. And we talked about the path we're all with
the install base exchange in particular, we talked about Oﬃce as well. I felt really
good about the projections we laid out nearly two years ago and where we're today
in terms of both install base growth and the penetration of the install base in the
transition. So both components of that queue I feel quite good about. And you say
where's the queue coming from, the next queue as opposed to the transition queue.
The next queue tends to be still coming from the small to mid-sized customer
segment, often people who couldn't aﬀord the capital expenditure upfront to deploy
some of these solutions. The other place has actually been adding, the term is odd,
we call it deathless, the worker. But adding some of the employees even in large
enterprises where one to one computing constructs didn't exist in the same way in
terms of a PC and so we actually are seeing decent coverage of those, especially for
the non-oﬃce components of the suite Exchange, SharePoint and some of the
comps components. So that's in the other big queue of overall driver and then the
install base transition I think, it's gone actually pretty, pretty on plan is the term I
would use to maybe even a little better than we had hoped.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Got it. Then to the regulated industry (multiple speakers).
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Oh, sorry. I think this is interesting. It's a little bit like the CIO survey that you guys all
do. You every year or every six months ask people do you have any intent to move to
the cloud and they are sort of the adamant I'll never do it. But the I'll nevers tend to
go down with every CIO survey. I tend to think regulated industries we're seeing that
transition. The level of security insight, the level you're seeing, actually the
geopolitics play an interesting component for regulated industries as well. We run
diﬀerent models. Germany we have a tenant based model, we've got a diﬀerent
model in China, we run through a company called 21Vianet, we've got owned and
operated data centers as well. All of these are meaningful components to moving
right-delated industries, I would say, further. But I tend to view it more as a time
series as opposed to there's one day that everybody will decide today is my day,
tend to move diﬀerent workloads over time and so, I don't know, I remain hopeful
about sensors as a person --
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
We are working on it.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
You guys are working on it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
I got a Surface tab already, diﬀerent division. In terms of the quantity question, is
piracy becoming a part of this at all, is Oﬃce 365 helping to winnow that down at all
or is that still --?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Interesting, I get asked that a lot. I do think in certain geos, it's never -- I wouldn't say
-- I think, it probably resonates funny. I don't think of that as oh, I now have an
antipiracy product. I think about it more as what value can you put in a subscription
such that paying for it feels like good value. And I do think we've made some
progress on that front, speciﬁcally in some of the geos you would expect. We also
frankly had a lot of piracy. It's not just geo-based, many people pirate and don't
know frankly that they are. And so a lot of the small and mid-size businesses in
particular tended to have piracy challenges and I do think you could think about
that. It's not the language I would normally use. But it is certainly a way to think about
it in terms of having paid SMB growth could be a little bit of a proxy for that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Some perhaps under licensing more so --
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Under licensing would be a preferred term I would use.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Last segment, more personal computing, just seen, I think, a lot of investors, I won't
say don't focus on. But don't think of as an area of potential adds anymore. But that
being said the Windows OEM business has been growing single digits over the past
couple of quarters and a lot of that's come from the strength in the commercial side
of the business. Can you give us an update on where are we on that LinkedIn cycle?
What's the ability for that commercial cycle to grow that overall Windows OEM
business?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I'm happy you asked me about Windows. You seem to not get asked about it very
often. And you're right. I do feel like people -- either I'm not telling the story well
enough, which I take as feedback because nobody asks or I think you're right. Over
time, people just began to focus on our big investments and big growth returns and
that has been, frankly. And we set ourselves up for that by talking about the
commercial cloud target and I think all the energy frankly externally. And we have lot
of internal energy on too to get to that goal. Windows is really interesting. Windows
10, when it launched and we did the free upgrade process primarily for consumers,
we were really encouraged by how many and the types of feedback we were
getting. But more importantly was the feedback we were getting from commercial
customers. The security value prop and the management value prop of Windows 10
is clearly resonating on the number of proof of concepts, the number of earlier
deployments, the number of transitions, what I would describe as pull as opposed to
push in terms of customer demand. We clearly feel it inside the enterprise, the
Windows 10.
Our deployment has been encouraging , especially -- and the way you would see
that we tried to change the KPI in the summer to be more similar. So you had like --
we do the oﬃce services and product KPI, which is the combination of on-prem and
cloud, do the same thing in the server one and there's a new one, Windows
commercial products and services, it does the same thing. It basically takes the
volume licensing component of the Windows, which would be on prem and add
some of the cloud components like advanced threat protection and other SKUs
which you would hear us call believe it or not we have a Windows E5 just to make
things confusing. But from customer perspective it's easier to name things the same.
Those things all go into that metric. That metric has been growing, I think, like 6%
this last quarter. It's a combination of excitement around Windows 10, the security
value prop, the commitment, I think, companies are making and I do think you'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 14Keith Weiss
Amy Hoodstarting to see it in terms of OEM commercial demand. We've seen it in, I think, the
industry in terms of shipments -- PC shipments and we shouldn't -- and have in the
commercial business tended to be around that number. We're slightly higher than it
right at this minute. But it should trend pretty close on the commercial side. But yes
we are. I'm very encouraged.
And you have to understand when you sell Windows what you're really selling is a
modern desktop environment. A modern desktop environment also allows us to talk
to customers about why you should be become modern oﬃce, why you should be
upgraded to the most recent solutions. Number one, many of our customers own
them; number two, when you upgrade and deploy on the new Windows version, you
should and are more secure and I think it's allowed us to sort of expand the dialog
beyond, you need a new PC with a TPM chip, it's now easier on a secure
environment. And these are the components of doing that which I think you're
starting to see.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
I want to make sure that we talk about CapEx and some of the balance sheet items
as well. When you think about -- you made some comments last summer about the
growth in CapEx spending having a peak. Can you help us understand sort of where
that comment comes from, is it a utilization comment, is it a build out comment, is it
just in terms of sort of how you see the end demand working out?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's deﬁnitely not demand driven. What I mean by that is, demand seems to be there.
So it's far more driven by infrastructure improvements. I mean, it's actually twofold
when we talk about eﬃciency improvements. One is just the software and continuing
to invest on the software side toward increasing how much stuﬀ you can ﬁt in a unit
of things. And so, we spend a lot of time seeing how much stuﬀ we can jam into a
unit.
The other concept is how cheap is a unit, right, I would say, that's also through the
Moore's Law construct. But it also happens when you standardize all your
component tree across a very broad business. So not only are, in certain instances,
hardware prices coming down, not everywhere, in some places, hardware prices are
coming down when you run workloads that are everything from search with Bing all
the way up to very high level AI Azure SKUs and you are able to run them on a
consistent architecture, your cost has come way down. I'm not dual sourcing any
piece of network equipment, right. And so think of it almost as supply chain
improvement is sort of a simplistic way of thinking about it. All of those things have
actually been encouraging. We're in those geos which I think is another aspect to
your question. That being said, we're not laying down a bunch of concrete in
advance of meeting it. So even though you are in a geo, you still got to lay down
more concrete pads and water cooling systems as you need it. We're not building
that stuﬀ in advance.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Amy HoodSo well, I think people like oh, you must be everywhere in the world, aren't you done
buying land or you done hauling in -- away lots of dirt, no, we're not. It's just you
more can be just in time. So I don't have a long lead in terms of the stand versus
seeing the demand curve, which is a good thing. It just brings the working capital
issues down.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. I am going to sneak in one more before open up to the audience. Probably
the second most asked question I get from investors is the sustainability of very low
OpEx growth. You guys have been talking about that sort of moving from
underperforming investments into better performing investments for quite some
time. Is there still meat on the bone in being able to do that?

There is always -- this is funny. I get asked this question so often, I'm going to cover
oﬀ the all forms I get it asked in. Number one, do you solve for zero. No. I do not
solve for zero, I don't solve for it, I don't think about it, not the frame I use. So that's
the best way I get asked, it's like you just sit there and circular reference your way
into zero, no.
Do I solve for inﬂation, no, I don't solve for inﬂation, don't solve for a number. I will
tell you what I solve for is the ROI of every single one of the $31 billion-ish in
operating expense that we fund. While if you ask anybody of Microsoft could they
spend more money, all of them would say yes, all of them, right. They should say
that, right, they should say, yes, I got so many terriﬁc innovative, interesting,
awesomely impactful ideas that you ought to get me more money. And they all say I
love that, I love that energy, right, that comes with that and I listen to some really
fascinating arguments, some are terriﬁc, some are less terriﬁc. But the energy to
grow is what I hear about. Then, my job is to take those dollars, every one of them.
And ask myself if we're putting it in the right place and on the right time horizon.
From what I would call horizon zero, which is like right this minute, do we have the
right promo in place, do we have the right SKU pricing, do we have the right channel
incentives, all the way to Horizon 3, which is much more like research-based work
done out of our MSR, Microsoft research facility. Some of that looks very academic
pursuits to many, deeply important. It's what, I think, made us the leader in some
technologies like FPGA and putting that into data centers.
So the answer is if I feel like it can drive topline revenue growth, if I feel like the
return on those actual ROI of the dollar or the return on the invested capital, which is
another dollar we spend a lot on is above the hurdle rate we have the competencies
to achieve it. We're going to spend -- and so I never know what that number will be
until I feel like I've looked under every pillow cushion and found that there is nothing
left for me to ﬁnd. Right now when I looked up the pillows on the couch, there's still
some pennies in there and we can move on and the market changes, right. You can
always retrain teams, you can move salespeople, geos sometimes aren't as healthierFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Amy Hoodor are as healthy. You can move salespeople, you can change incentive plans. And
there is tons of mechanisms to use and I think we've grown far more sophisticated.
And I think what you always want to keep in mind is you never want some world due
on OpEx that's very short term to dictate the amount of ambition we have and I
would say the ambition that we have is high.
And our ability to achieve it is really good. And so the conﬁdence with which you
spend money changes when that environment looks that way. That being said,
people would probably say I'm cheap and so it's okay. I mean that's the way your
CFO shouldn't be. They should become tough and diﬃcult and kind-hearted. But
like 65% of the time. But that's my job, to keep you all in mind and have a high bar.
But it doesn't mean I'm solving for zero. Just everybody's is squared away, doesn't
mean it wouldn't be zero, just means I am not solving for zero.

So a couple of minutes to take a few questions from the audience. You have any?
Okay, perfect. So I wanted to ask this question. (inaudible)
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Pretty fast with Keith.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Exactly. When we think about capital return, people ask me about the durability of
capital return given that you have to take on debt in order to do it. And one of my
favorite quotes is from you using as long as people give me dollars at 2%, I will keep
on back my 3% dividend yield stock. Your interest rates are coming up and interest
rates overall are coming up. So is that dynamic going to be durable over time?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Let me say these things. While I am proud of my AAA rating, it's not a thing I solve
for. We just got back in the market rating dead. And so I think I've always viewed the
return of capital as a priority. We've been returning in excess of our free cash ﬂow
and far in excess of our free cash ﬂow, gosh, couple of years at this point. The
commitment that we made at the Board level and from Satya and I wish to bring
down the net cash balance of the Company and return it to shareholders both
through buyback and dividend, we've done that and I'm really proud of it. I think that
was a great decision. And I think going forward, you'll continue to see a balanced
view. We accelerated the pace to get the balance down. I still view that as an
important component along with continuing to invest in ourselves and continue to
invest capital in growing the business. But I don't -- it's not interest rate driven in the
way that you are thinking about it per se. I mean, even if interest rates rise a little bit,
there is still room to borrow and have it make sense for us and you'll continue to not
see that as a constraint, in my mind, it's a math equation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

And just in terms of sort of on the political side of the equation, there's lot of
uncertainty around taxes and repatriation and the like. Does that impact any of your
near-term decision making on capital allocation. Do you wait for staﬀ (multiple
speakers)?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
We have been advocating for structural tax reform for many and varied
administrations, what I would say. This one, we will watch, we will see what various
proposals get discussed. And as it gets closer -- if it gets closer and as it gets closer,
we'll be able to tell you how it would impact what we do all day.
In the interim, we've not been a company to wait on tax reform to return capital, I
mean, you've seen it. I mean we've basically said it made sense to return capital, it
made sense to buy back stock. We borrowed to do it, we haven't waited for
structural tax reform. It's not been a reason to wait for me or for the Board or for
Satya who cares deeply about the topic. I'm sure for others, waiting could make
more sense, it's a more meaningful delta. But for us, our capacity to borrow plus the
ability to invest in ourselves, I don't feel like we have to wait to be able to do any of
the things that I feel super passionate about which is mainly continuing to grow. And
if there is ways to grow, I don't feel like waiting for this administration or any other,
it's a good tactic.
