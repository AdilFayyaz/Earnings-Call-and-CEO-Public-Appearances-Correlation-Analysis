Good morning, everyone. It's great to see everyone live. Welcome to day two of our
2022 Morgan Stanley TMT Conference. We are thrilled today to have Ruth Porat with
us, the CFO of Alphabet and Google. It is great to see you live.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
It's great to be back here.

We have a lot to talk about. There is always a lot of things going on in the world,
things going on with Alphabet and it's always good to connect with you. It's -- you're
approaching your 7-year anniversary at Alphabet in a couple of months from now. I
wanted to sort of -- I was stuck with this question with you and talk about investment
and innovation. When you sort of step back at the key priorities at Alphabet forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Ruth Poratwhere you're most focused on innovating for users, advertisers and the ecosystem,
where are you most excited for what happens next?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So there is a lot to talk about. Look, at the highest level, when we talk about
investments, when we approach our investments, it's unchanged from what you and
I have talked about over the years. We start with investing for long-term growth. And
within that, every product area looks at how they can optimize within their portfolio
and we focus on investing for operational excellence, everything around trust
privacy, cyber security, content moderations. To the heart of your question, I think
there are couple of areas to call out. First and foremost is AI. About 5-years ago,
Sundar said that we are moving from mobile ﬁrst to AI ﬁrst and that AI, we would be
able to apply across our products to really enhance experiences for everyone in the
ecosystem, users, advertisers, merchants, governments, you name it. And you can
see that in everything from Search and ads to YouTube and hardware.
But if you focus for example on Search, as hopefully many of you remember about a
year or two ago, Sundar at IO said that Search remains our biggest moonshot and
what we're really excited about with AI is the ability to make Search more human like,
more conversational. We've talked about MUM and how that enables you to actually
have a more human like interaction. You'll be seeing us for example with Lens, where
you can take a photo of a bike and then just literally query, how do I ﬁx it. And so we
still think there is a lot to one, as a result of the enhancements with AI. The other
obvious area is cloud and everything that's going on there. The number of times I
said, we still think we're in early innings with cloud, super excited about the
opportunity and again the progress, the momentum that we've seen and that's not
just GCP, it's also with Workspace. And when you think about the importance of
productivity tools, in particular, as we're moving to this hybrid work environment,
super excited about what's going on there.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. AI, machine learning and cloud, a lot of focus. Let me go back to Search. You
talked about Search, you've talked a lot over the years about just the runway there
and the innovation there. I think over the last year or so, the Retail category of Search
has been particularly strong. You've called it out in conference calls, our alpha-wise
data show there is a rising number of people starting on Google with an e-
commerce, advertisers and merchants seem more pleased than ever. Maybe just can
you bring it down, double down for me a little bit, can you give us a couple of
examples of speciﬁc improvements you made within the Retail Search category that
have driven this user growth, the merchant spending and the overall more
transactions per customers?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Absolutely. So we did talk about it quite a bit on the Q4 call, it was an important
contributor to results and when we talk about Retail, we obviously talk about ads as
well as the broader set of experiences, all that Bill Ready is doing with commerceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Brian Nowak
Ruth Porat
Brian Nowak
Ruth Poratand really excited about the eﬀort that he has been leading. And I would say that a
couple of the things that are really important from our perspective, is one, really
connecting users to merchants and all that we're doing to create the best place for
users and merchants. It is about building this open ecosystem. So the way we work
as an example with Shopify and Square and again it's the open ecosystem that's
important. And then using technology in ways to enable you to Search. So Lens
again is a great example. It's bringing all of those to bear, whether it's in the
commerce discussion that -- that we just went through, or all that we can do across
the platform.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
The open ecosystem or Lens or the partnerships, are there examples of learnings
you've had within Retail Search that you think could be applicable to other
categories, as you think about healthcare, travel and other categories just because
we're thinking about what happens next in Search, which categories are you most
focused on?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yes, I love that question. When I think about what we're -- the way we describe what
we're doing in Retail and Commerce. It is about creating the best experience for
users and providers, merchants in the instance of all that Bill is doing. And so if you
take that very simple framework and you say, what are we doing for example in
travel, it's the same concept. It's about creating the best experience for users and
everyone in the ecosystem. So for example, with users the question is, where do I go
for inspiration, for best pricing, price comparison, for booking and that's what we're
looking to do, which is, create access to updated relevant timely information so that
you can go on that entire user journey in the most eﬀective way. Similarly for travel
providers, the notion is, how can you have this seamless connection to users. How
can we create this open highly competitive vibrant ecosystem, so that you can
connect to users. So it's a very similar concept, so as we described in Commerce.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. Next you can see that innovation to come then. Lets talk about YouTube a little
bit. Again, strong year for YouTube in 2021, contributions, we think from both
branded advertisers and direct response advertisers, $29 billion of revenue growing
over 40%. Two-part question on YouTube, sort of similar to Search, can you give us
some examples of innovation that sort of spurred that strength in YouTube
throughout 2021? And as now you sit here and look ahead to '22 and 2'3, what are
the areas of potential improvements you see on YouTube to come to sort of keep
that growth going?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So, I think there are sort of two parts to your question as I hear it. One is, given you
cited the year-on-year growth, obviously, as we talked about throughout last year, in
many respects, that growth reﬂects how challenging 2020 was as much as anything.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Page 4 of 13Brian Nowak
Ruth Porat
Brian Nowak
Ruth PoratSo we have the beneﬁt of lapping, we called it out throughout last year and that was
an important driver of what those numbers look like. That being said, the team does
continue to focus on innovation and diﬀerent new opportunities, whether it's Shorts
or Shopping and so we do continue to iterate and look at opportunities within
YouTube, building on the strong base that we have.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. Let's talk about Shorts then, there is a lot of discussion about the creator
economy and all big platform sort of trying to address the creator economy and
short form video. For YouTube Shorts you have Shorts receiving 15 billion daily views,
5 trillion all-time views, probably higher now since that blog came out. Susan has
spoken quite a bit about the importance of the creator economy. Maybe just help us
understand how you look to diﬀerentiate YouTube in the creator economy for both
creators versus other platforms, as well as how do you ensure that you're getting
users engagement and monetizing those Shorts?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So, it's still early in Shorts to state the obvious, but I think when we look at it, we're
starting with a strong base. The YouTube Partner Program was started about 15-years
ago and as a way to provide support to creators, so they can build thriving
businesses basically on YouTube. We have 2 million creators who are building
businesses through the Partner Program. And we're looking, as we look at extending
this to Shorts, we're still experimenting with what's the best approach to
monetization. So as many of you are aware, we did create $100 million fund for
creators. That's one of the early iterations, but it is early and we're continuing to look
at what monetization is. I would say one of the other important elements of YouTube
generally and as it relates to Shorts, is the investments that we continue to make in
the content moderation and really protecting what is a healthy appropriate vibrant
ecosystem.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
YouTube, it's fascinating when we were putting together these questions, I look at all
the questions over the years on YouTube and there's been a lot of diﬀerent
strategies. YouTube when you have billions of users, trillions of hours of content,
there is a lot of opportunities. And we've gone from subscriptions, premium video,
music content, YouTube TV, Shorts, creator economy, shopping, there is a lot. As you
look back at the last 5-years on YouTube, can you give us an example of one or two
of the strategies that maybe didn't quite scale as well as you hoped, why did that
happen and what did that teach you about sort of what works well? What does not
work well on YouTube?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yes. That's important because we talk a lot about the successes as much what you do
is what you don't do and the whole notion of prioritizing within each of our productFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Brian Nowak

Ruth Porat
Brian Nowakareas. I would say one of the areas that iterated -- reiterated quite a bit was what we
were doing with YouTube Original.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
And so originally we thought, let's take YouTube Originals and create this as a really
interesting oﬀering as part of our subscription oﬀering, we then said, you know let's
open it up for the ad supported part of YouTube and sort of iterated there as well.
And I think you went through a great list of diﬀerent areas what the team is working
on and our view is, if we're thinking about highest and best use where to focus, that
wasn't -- that wasn't going to end up being the kind of the long run and so you've
seen us pivot some of our eﬀorts to other areas. And these types of calls are hard, I
think we learn how we build on the strength of what the content community is, the
greater community is and so again trying to be responsive to what we're seeing from
users and creators and where they really want to be and so that would be one
example.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. It's a good example. There's a lot of macro uncertainty through these diﬃcult
times right now. Can you just, to level set the best you can, can you talk to us about
your exposure to Russia and Ukraine and how that's sort of impacting the business?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well most important, it is obviously -- it's just devastating to see and it's such a
human tragedy. So we are focused intensely on everything we can do to be in
support of people in Ukraine and that's everything from how do we get the right
information to them, how do we shut down attempted disinformation campaigns. It's
intense work 24/7 on Cyber Security and attempts to disrupt. It is the humanitarian
relief work through google.org and Googlers broadly, it's looking at how to protects
Googlers and their families, extended families both in Ukraine and in Russia. So that
is a big part of it. We have stopped advertising within -- within Russia and so there is
no doubt an economic cost to this. It's both in revenues and I would say also, if you
see the strengthening dollar foreign exchange headwind that that implies, but for us
the most important focus area is making sure we're doing what we can in support of
people in Ukraine.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. Want to talk about privacy and regulation a little bit, another recurring topic
we cover pretty much every year. Maybe just with all the changes that are going on,
both changes that Alphabet is making, changes that other platforms are making,
regulatory headwind changes, etc. Just maybe talk to us philosophically about what
Alphabet is most focused on in the changes that you've sort of written about in someFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 13Ruth Porat
Brian Nowak
Ruth Poratof the blog post and what steps are you taking to minimize the friction for advertisers
throughout any of these privacy changes you may implement?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yes, that's the key part of the question. So I think I've said in this room that one of the
important approaches we have is to continue to raise the bar on ourselves on
privacy. It is very clear that this is core to all of our users. And we -- it's a responsibility
we have to make sure that we continue to use technology as we can to up the bar on
privacy and at the same time, we want to make sure that we continue to support an
open ad supported ecosystem. And so, getting that right is where our teams have
been intensely focused.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. On the Cloud, so with the Cloud, the other area that you talked about as an
area of investment and innovation. 2021 we had about high 40%s growth in the
Cloud segment, about $19 billion of revenue and we think GCP is growing even
faster than that within the mix. I think you said that a couple of the quarters in the
past, so very impressive growth in a competitive Cloud space. As you sort of look
back at the last 2 or 3-years, the changes you've made in the Cloud segment, what
have sort of been some of the key executional areas that have driven that growth
and how do you think about further low hanging fruit to come?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well, one of the most important is bringing in Thomas Curry in to run it and have him
lay out the vision and bring in the team that he did, and really excited about the
announcement we made this morning, that we signed a deﬁnitive agreement to
acquire Mandiant, an extraordinary player in cyber security, really adding to all that
we do in cyber security and is going to enable us to provide this end-to-end solution
in this very important area. Again, it goes to our commitment around cyber security,
but also all that we're doing in Cloud. So I would say, if you break down his approach
and what the team is doing, the investments and the focus, it starts with, let's make
sure we've got the depth and breadth within industry verticals, so that we can
address the idiosyncratic needs within each industry, whether it's ﬁnance versus
retail versus healthcare and so they built those out.
Very consistent with that, building out the product engineering team. We have said, I
think on the call, the last call that we've introduced more than 2000 new products in
2021 alone, again enriching the overall oﬀering of Cloud. We continue to build out
our go-to-market organization. We've continued to build out partnerships for
distribution. We've continued to build out what we're doing with our Cloud region,
so that we really have this fantastic global infrastructure to support our customers. So
it's really that full breadth and then when we step back and say, okay, how do we
continue to diﬀerentiate. What we do keep hearing is so much public sector private
sector, it's our data analytics and AI. It is all that we are able to oﬀer in cyber security
and look forward to extending that even further. It is the strength of what we do
around cyber security and it's, again, what we're doing with Workspace and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Ruth Poratability to actually help companies and the public sector as they transform network
experience.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
The future looks very good for Cloud too. We look at the backlog, $51 billion backlog
is the latest ﬁgures, there is -- there's a lot of hopeful growth to come. When I look at
the segment, it still looks like there's about $3 billion of losses in 2021. Now, if I
compare the size of Cloud, Google Cloud to some of your peers, at that point, the
losses are larger. The question is, is that a fair comparison? Are there factors that are
diﬀerent from a go-to market, a revenue mix perspective and investment philosophy
as to why we should not make that an analogy or how do you think about the
proﬁtability of Cloud versus your peers at this point?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yes. So I think the way we look at it is, we're obviously not competing against our
peers at the scale they were then, we're competing against them at the scale they
are now in a market that is accelerating. And our view is, we've said repeatedly, is we
continue to think it's early innings and we want to make sure that we continue to
invest aggressively in the business so that we have the capability to deliver on this
accelerating opportunity. So we don't view it as a guide post, we want to make sure
we're investing commensurate with the opportunity, and as I've said repeatedly, we
are going to continue to invest aggressively given the opportunity that we see. We of
course remain focused on what is that longer-term path to proﬁtability, but to be
really clear in the near term, we're continuing to invest across the Board to support
Cloud.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. Let's talk about expenses then. For the total Company in 2020 and 2021 were
years -- if it goes that way. Yes, 2020 and 2021 were years really unlike any other,
when we think about remote work, teams operating really eﬃciently at home from
around the globe. I know as of April, the teams in the Bay Area are going be coming
back a few days a week, so there is a return to work action in motion. But I guess as
you sort of you look at learnings over the last 2 years with all the OpEx reductions
and sort of what happened, are there any areas where you see structural potential
for productivity to be higher, eﬃciency to be higher, OpEx levels to be lower going
forward, just learnings from working -- working remotely?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So there deﬁnitely are advantages to working remotely. And I think we've all
experienced it. Our view is that there are advantages to working remotely, but there
are also tremendous advantages to be together, which is why we were early to say
we think hybrid is the way to go and we continue to believe that. At the highest level
in your question, yes, we are focused on eﬃciencies. We always will be and you see it
in some of the comments we make, technical infrastructure or other areas that
continues to be a key focus. But we're also looking to invest consistent with what weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Brian Nowak
Ruth Poratbelieve is important given the opportunities that we see. And you saw that in the
fourth quarter, in particular head counts that we added 6500 people in the fourth
quarter and I tried to be very clear that we intend to continue to hire aggressively
and it's because we see opportunity across the Board.
I've mentioned Cloud already, the opportunity we see there, but it's true in Google
Services as well. It's everything that we're seeing with the investments to support
better experiences in Search, the application of AI and ads, it's about what we're
doing in YouTube and hardware. So across the Board we're seeing opportunities and
we want to make sure we're setting ourselves up to continue to really extend that
runway by investing where we see it makes sense. So you're going to see it really in
OpEx and in CapEx. In CapEx on the call I indicated, we're continuing to build out
our technical infrastructure globally, that's primarily servers, but also data centers
and then as it relates to oﬃce facilities, we've continued to add.
So even though we're hybrid, when you add for example, 6500 in one quarter,
people have often said to me, so why did you buy new space as well? Our view is
that it's more eﬃcient, it gives us control over the space to do what we want. And so
we added in the ﬁrst quarter in New York, we made an acquisition in London and
hopefully you saw in Poland as well earlier this week. So in Q1 about $4 billion in
CapEx around the oﬃce facilities and we think again that sets us up really well for the
kind of growth that we hope to execute against.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
That's helpful. 6500 employees in the fourth quarter and I think 21,000 for the year
in a highly competitive labor market. I'm sometimes asked by investors, how do they
even hire that many people in a year? So let me pop open the hood a little bit and
help us out, as you're thinking about hiring, as you're thinking about bringing on all
these people on onto the platform, is it project based? Is it segment based? Like,
what -- how does the actual hiring process work? And what safeguards and checks
do you have in place to ensure that as your hiring all these people, you're still
getting a good return from them to deliver returns for shareholders?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So on hiring and overall planning, we start ﬁrst with what we call, OKR, Objectives
and Key Results. We've talked a lot about how committed Google is to really setting
out, what are your OKRs (inaudible) and then, really marking to market your progress
throughout the year. And frankly discussing it with the entire Company. That starts
the capital allocation discussion and then within every product area and function, we
look at, so what are the resources that you need, headcount being an important part
of it, to deliver against those OKRs. And then throughout the year, we have quarterly
ﬁnancial view that check-in out of which ﬂows are you executing against the metrics
that were pre-ordained by the business leaders and the functional leaders as you go
throughout the year.
And so, yes, there is rigor around it. And, yes, it's an important question, because we
want to make sure we're on boarding great talent, giving people an extraordinaryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 13Brian Nowak

Ruth Porat
Brian Nowakexperience and having them deliver eﬀectively and it's really all parts of it. Part of the
hiring and part of your question goes to, we're really pleased, proud to continue to
be an incredible a magnet for talent. We had more than 5 million applications last
year and so a large part of this is the rigor around, okay, 5 million applications, how
do we then leverage the global team and everybody has a role in hiring, because
people and compute are two of the most important ingredients to then deliver these
magical experiences. So that's a big part of it.
I think that a large part is the work people get to do, but I would also say that some
of the return to oﬃce decisions that we made. So for example, we're really proud of
the fact that we've opened up the number of locations, in particular across the US, so
that we can attract more diverse talent. We -- we're really increasing in Atlanta, in
Chicago, in New York and DC and so thinking through what is your footprint and we
have the luxury of that given the scale that we have to hire in so many diﬀerent
places and still have large cohesive teams. But that's important, giving people
agency like 4 weeks work from anywhere, thinking about how do you do hybrid, I
think those are additive to continuing to be a great magnet for talent.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. And I remember in the -- in the early days when you came to Alphabet, you
talked about really making sure the managers are more accountable to the projects
which are and everything else, I'm sure that's part of it as well, where the project
leaders who are being given these heads, there is ﬁrm mandates and ROI and
ensuring that you're clearing ROI goals.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well there with -- everybody is looking at what are the metrics and milestones along
the way. And it really varies from the earlier stage research to sort of early -- earlier
stage to all the way through to more sort of consistent and established that we're
trying to make sure that we're running it in the most responsible way.

Seep cards are in place.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Seep cards.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
And the capital return point, we saw Alphabet buyback $50 billion of stock in 2021,
that's about $110 billion since 2018 total. The share count has declined by about 5%
even through dilution over that period. Yet so clearly, the cash $140 billion of cash
and marketable securities, we think you're going to generate about $85 billion to
$100 billion a year going forward. It's a good preamble to just remind us again howFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 13Ruth Porat
Brian Nowak
Ruth Poratyou think philosophically about capital allocation strategy, dividends versus share
repurchases and how do you arrive at the size of the buybacks?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yes. Carefully I would say. So capital allocation starts with the primary use of capital is
organic growth. Everything we've just talked about investing in the business. The
second part is the M&A and strategic equity investments. And then we turn to the
question of capital allocation. On the strategic equity investments, you've seen the
beneﬁt of those in other income and expense over the last couple of years, OI&E,
and we've called out that most of those are unrealized, that with market volatility
obviously those can go up and those can go down. So that's on OI&E.
More broadly to your question on sizing of program, we do look at this consistently
with our Board and we look at size as well as form of capital return. I'm really pleased
that we're able to have taken it up as much as we have. I think if you had gone back
to that 2018, we were having this conversation and I had said we would be here. You
may have questioned it, but we've gone and made this steady march forward. And at
this point, we think that share repurchase continues to be the right answer for us, but
we do consistently look at it that, as I said, both size and form.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. Let's talk about some of the more -- the emerging pieces. I guess hardware is
not really emerging, but it is sort of a question I get last by investors, what's the
hardware strategy? So maybe let me sort of ask a three-part around hardware.
Biggest learnings from hardware for you, the overall hardware strategy and how
does the ambient compute ﬁt into the hardware strategy for where you would like
the Android ecosystem to go in the next 3 to 5 years?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So overall, what we've seen is that when we bring together the best of AI and
software and hardware, we can create a really important sort of benchmark and work
with the ecosystem more broadly and it's showing kind of what is the art of the
possible, whether it's how it's used or photography or other elements of it. And so
that was the initial goal and remains the goal, is that we continue to support the
broader ecosystem and we have the opportunity to, with our product, demonstrate
some of the capabilities. It was I think really exciting for us to ﬁnally have the system
on a chip. This past we picked the Pixel 6, and the implications of that and sort of the
functionality of the phone, that was an important learning and continuing to invest
there as a result.
And then to your question about ambient computing, the whole notion is to be as
useful and helpful to you wherever you may happen to be and so adding Fitbit as an
example to the family, it's like whether you're with your phone or with a watch or in
the car, it's this notion of constantly being able to be as responsive as needed. And
so that's the way we're continuing and the team is continuing to work against the
program.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Okay. Lets talk about Waymo, autonomous driving, there is that this is sort of been a,
I would say sort of a snails pace relative to what we thought from an autonomous
perspective, it's a very diﬃcult engineering challenge, lot of regulatory challenges,
etc. You've -- you now have Waymo One rider only product out for a little over a year
now. So I guess the question is, as you sort of look at progress you've made with
Waymo and Waymo One, where have you come the farthest and what are sort of the
biggest areas of incremental investment you need to make on Waymo to sort of get
autonomous driving to where you want it to be?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So, it is tough engineering challenge and when you look at the more than 1 million
lives blocked on the road, that's what motivated this. We've talked about that here
before and continues to do so and we're making sure that we're doing this in a really
safe way. So we, at this point, we've had 10s of thousands of rides. We are starting to
charge here in San Francisco, which is a step in the right direction. We're testing in
New York, we're testing in other cities so that we can see what happens in diﬀerent
climates and diﬀerent topography and so continuing to make progress with safety
continuing to be kind of the number 1, 2 and 3 priority. We are also building out
Waymo Via which is with around logistics and we have some partnerships there for
example with UPS. And so it's -- we're continuing to iterate on the front.

Okay. Emerging markets have been a pretty consistent focus over the years, I want to
ask you about India and Africa, you have a lot of initiatives in those markets.
YouTube, Android, hardware, payments, cloud, investments with Reliance, the
entrepreneur fund. I guess as you and the executive team sort of envision where you
would like India and Africa to go, how should we think about investments there and
how do you think about those markets developing maybe diﬀerently than some of
the more developed markets like the US and Europe?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yes. All important, it goes back to the -- my ﬁrst comment which is, we invest for
long-term growth and we short hand call this the NBU markets, the Next Billion
Users. And so have been very focused on ensuring that we're investing for the Next
Billion Users and your point, how is this diﬀerent, yes it's diﬀerent. In many markets,
younger, mobile ﬁrst and so it's poised before tax. So there are a lot of the elements
of it that are diﬀerent. And so what we did in India is, we created a $10 billion India
Digitization Fund and the notion was really to invest in that ecosystem to build it out
and it's about conﬁdence and where India actually can go and as you said, with
Reliance, with Airtel, with Jio Reliance, we've made some investments and are
looking to develop products that is speciﬁc to the market and potentially more
broadly in NBU.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-03-08

Brian NowakIn Africa, we announced, I think it was late last year, a $1 billion commitment to invest
across Africa and very similarly, it's very exciting when you look at a lot of the
innovation that's coming out of there. We have some AI engineers there as well,
payments that some of the innovation that really points to the rest of the world. So
our view is, we need to be where the Next Billion Users are and as part of our
mission, organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful for
everyone. It is a core part of it. And as you're thinking long term, of course it is a key
initiative and I've sized that for you and to give a little dimension.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay. I wanted to close, I look at -- look over the years at the questions, a year ago, I
don't think we externally had any idea that the Retail Search category have this type
of really acceleration even through laws of large numbers. YouTube surprised us for
a good part of the year. As you sit here now, what sort of excites you most about
2022, that one year from now, we're going to be sitting here and saying, wow, this
aspect of Alphabet really surprised everyone and where it's not paying enough
attention to at this point?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well, I think I've hit on sort of the key areas that we're focused on. AI is one of those
opportunities where it just continues to build on itself, and as we have an
extraordinary team you just -- as they continue to explore, it continues to go deeper
and whether we're talking about MOMs and that's what does that mean for Search
or whether you look at some of the things like performance MAX and ads or smart
bidding, across the Board, the opportunity in cloud to work with enterprise. Every
enterprise needs to think about how do they interact with their customers, how do
they think about eﬃciency, how do they think about risk analytics. And so this will
continue to I think surprise or guide the way. So, excited about -- excited about that.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. Cant wait to watch it. Well we're talking about over the course of the year.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Great.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Thank you very much.
