Hey, thanks, everyone. Thanks for joining us for Day-1 of the Wells Fargo TMT Summit
here in Sunny Southern California. Very pleased to be helping host the lunch session
here with Microsoft. So we have Tim Stuart, who's we were just discussing, has a lot
on his plate with everything that's happening in the gaming world, particularly this
time of year. So looking forward to the conversation. I'll let you sit ﬁrst. Then we can

Seattle. I'll take this any day.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
So it's nice to just kind of look outside and see some sun.

time at Microsoft.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
So maybe we can just start with, over the past two decades the evolution that you've
seen. There are a few diﬀerent milestones that I think we think about. We think about
Satya and Amy and the move towards cloud and Azure.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
And now we're seeing the advent of AI, and maybe you can just contextualize that
advent of AI with your time spent at Microsoft and kind of set the stage.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. That's a good place to start. I've been at Microsoft for 22 years, so I started as an
intern. And back then, the big draw was you got to go to Bill Gates' house for a
barbecue.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
No way.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
And that was kind of the big sell back then. But yes, we've seen the kind of Bill Gates
to Steve Ballmer to Satya era.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
And they've all had their moments, and they've all had their unique sort of
ﬁngerprints on the company obviously. And where we're at right now, with AI
especially, is another one of those moments. It's kind of like the internet moment orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28

place that Microsoft really has a great position in to really change the landscape.
So, I know for gaming, and we'll talk about that in a bit, but it's meaningful for us, but
at the highest level for Microsoft, AI is one of the biggest shifts I've ever seen, and a
really exciting moment.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
If you were an intern 20 years ago, does that mean there's a demo video of you with
hair like Satya?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. It's great. There's a great Satya with hair picture, I think, out there.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
I love that.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
I also have those and it's been a few years.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
That's fantastic.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
So good. So, as far as AI, what it means for you as the CFO of the gaming segment.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Maybe we can just talk a little bit about the opportunity set. I know there's a lot to go
into. We'll zoom back out to the Microsoft perspective as well.

Page 4 of 17Q - Michael Turrin
A - Tim Stuart
Q - Michael Turrin
A - Tim StuartYes. For gaming, I'd say I've never been sort of more excited about a technology shift
in the gaming landscape. Maybe the last one we did was when we went from kind of
disks and consoles to, let's call it, online games, games as a service. Think like
Fortnite, Minecraft, things like that, which really changed the landscape of how
people play mobile games being another one. I think AI is one of those inﬂection
points for us.
And there's really two sides of the coin that I think about it from a gaming landscape.
One is for the consumer, and one is for the developer, the people creating the
games. On the developer side, you think about the millions and millions of dollars in
a game spent on localization, scripts, how you think about players moving from point
A to point B. And you have-to-have a non-player character or the game have
dialogue. AI can take care of all that.
You now say, hey, I need a player to get from A to B. And instead of having to write
1,000 lines of scripting or code, you just have the AI get you from A to B. Things like
localization, putting things in new languages. When we think about game testing, a
million AI bots can run through a level of Minecraft and ﬁnd where players get stuck,
where they spend money, how they think about a level. So this is, pun intended,
game changing for the developer.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Well done.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
And then the -- thank you. And then the -- I've used that before, by the way. And then
for the consumer, when you think about how a player or a person playing a game
interacts with AI, we have an example of like, you're in Minecraft and you're playing
in a level and you're talking to Hermione from Harry Potter and the Hermione
character's an AI -- it's an AI agent that's running through the Hermione scripts, that's
from Harry Potter, by the way. And you're having these nice unique moments. So I
think for gaming, there's really those two sides, developer, eﬃciency, speed of
creation, and then consumer, kind of love for the game and how it really adapts you.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
So let's spend more time on the developer side, because you and I were having a
sidebar conversation around this, and the future vision there, to me, is very
compelling. It's compelling on both sides, right? But I think intuitively, I don't know if
I appreciated how quickly this is evolving. So your view on what AI capabilities can
open up from the developer side, in terms of speed, or type of game, or just type of
developer?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. An example I'd like to give is, there's probably, pick your number, 100,000,
maybe game developers in the world, kind of across companies, big and small. And
now with AI, and we'll call it like, think like GitHub, or with Copilot, you can generateFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28

Q - Michael Turrincode, you can generate instances, you can generate games, you can generate art
assets. Hey, I want a tree with snow in the desert, something like that.
What it opens up now is anyone in this room can be a game developer. Whereas
before you had to have a unique sort of, call it unique angle. I know how to code or
I'm a multiplayer level designer. But now it takes the 100,000 game developers in
the world to millions and millions. The barista at your local Starbucks has an
awesome idea for a game. They can now use Copilot or they can use AI to go create
a great mobile experience.
And so you think about mobile being that kind of ﬁrst instance of a lot of, I'll call it, AI
generated mobile games. Some will break through. You'll ﬁnd your Flappy Bird, if
you remember that game, or Angry Birds, kind of these simple games that really take
oﬀ, I think you're going to see a really an explosion of the kind of these, we call them
citizen creators, people that are not historically game creators that can now make
games. And that's going to, I think, create a new wave of multi-platform, unique
experiences. Obviously, they're all built on AI.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
That's super compelling. We're not going to hold you to a timeline or trajectory in
terms of metrics, but thinking how far or close we are to citizen development
happening on the gaming side.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. The ability for someone to go into ChatGPT or Copilot or something, we're still a
little ways away from that. But what we do see is things like art assets. Even I can go
out to being an image creator, and I can generate -- create me a CFO in the spirit of
Halo that looks like they're playing in a desert or something like that.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
You should have brought that.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
That's a game -- I'm trying to build that game, I haven't really quite found the
uniqueness. But those kind of things, I think, will happen sooner than later. So we're
already seeing the ideas being generated. And I think we're actually going to see a
pretty fast acceleration on putting the art plus the code, plus the level design
together. And I think we're going to see some great games coming here in a short
while.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
That's pretty incredible. So it feels like every part of Microsoft is exploding with
newfound opportunities because of AI. So you're the CFO of a signiﬁcant becoming
more signiﬁcant, and we'll get to why in terms of scale in a minute. But the
advocating process with Amy, like how do you ensure that you're getting adequate
resources. And what are the kind of puts and takes of what being assessed at theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28

A - Tim StuartMicrosoft level and making sure that all of these incredible Copilot opportunities can
come to life?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. The Microsoft level, it's full speed ahead. Satya and Amy across our senior
leadership team are putting resources, time, energy, eﬀort into the space and, of
course, we talked about this GPU capacity and there's things you got it -- you have to
weigh out, but we work through those scenarios. And in the end, it's -- good ideas
win, go develop Copilot in Oﬃce, go to a Copilot in Outlook, how you think about
GitHub with Copilot and that's a great place to be.
We even look at things like Copilot in gaming and while this isn't a broad
announcement or anything, you can go into your -- think about your Xbox or your
mobile experience and say, I really love Starﬁeld but I'm in the mood for a spooky
game and Copilot has a recommendation engine that says, we see you like these
kind of games, your friends played these types of games, you should go play Dead
Space or some -- pick a game like that.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
So we see like a Copilot like example in gaming as a huge value driver for customers
as well. Think, recommendation engines, how you play the games, what you want to
play, your friends are playing. I think we'll see some -- from a CFO standpoint, you
actually see some monetization opportunities which we can talk about as well, which
is, hey, you're getting people into more games, playing more often, which is kind of
our secret sauce.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, choose to answer this question how you may, but I'd be remiss if I didn't
at least ask about the thing that everyone was armchair quarterbacking during
Thanksgiving, which was just OpenAI and the partnership and the relationship. So
just from the Microsoft standpoint, if you can level set for the Group here today, the
partnership, the dependence, the cooperation that goes into the Copilot
technologies, and just what you'd like to impart.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. I think the big thing from my seat, and obviously I'm sort of at arm's length from
that speciﬁc relationship, but really it's just the partnership the two companies have.
Satya talks a lot about, hey, look, we're in the same position we were a few weeks
ago, kind of with the ins and outs of what was going on in the news. But in the end,
it's a great partnership with companies working well together to develop just
awesome technology. So from our seat at gaming, we get to leverage a lot of that
tech, and like I said, that's Amy and Satya really pushing a great relationship andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28

{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes. You've also been busy with another AI. It's with a TV in the middle, ATVI [ph] in
Activision, right?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. That's good one. That's good, yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
You can use that one.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
I'll use that. Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Going forward as well. I mean, that deal was announced, it feels like ages ago, early
2022.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Finally became oﬃcial, so maybe given there's been a lot of time that's passed since
the initial inception, just help level set for everyone the opportunity set, the focus,
the strategic rationale for Activision, and then we can get into kind of the
permutations afterwards.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. It does seem like it's been a while on the Activision landscape. And you know
we went through the process, We worked with the right regional regulators and
worked through that thing and thankfully we got to a place that's, I think, a good-
good outcome there.
Activision Blizzard King, ABK as we call it sometimes, is really an accelerant to our
gaming strategy. I talk a lot about, it's not the strategy, it's part of the strategy. Really
for gaming at Microsoft, when we look at what we've done in the last 10 years and
where we're going, we think a lot about the cross-platform play, which is, I want to
play on all the devices that I have and all the screens that I have.
And I think it's -- that's really when I think it's a sort of holistic -- the holistic lens is the,

Q - Michael Turrin
A - Tim StuartSwitches in a mobile landscape, how are we on mobile? We can talk about cloud as
well. But really at the highest level, it's leveraging what Activision is so good at, which
is consoles and PC and mobile.
How do we take that great DNA, make it an accelerant to the IP that we have,
leverage the great assets that they have, the expertise that they have, and thankfully
we both talk a gaming lens or a gaming language, and even the few, what, months
since we've been sort of a united entity, just the speed of which we've integrated
and the speed of which we've worked together has been really impressive.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes. Can we talk more about the mobile opportunity speciﬁcally within Activision,
and maybe that's an area where Microsoft has been less penetrated than other areas
in the gaming side.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
So, is that one speciﬁc aap that you're focused on?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. Mobile is -- the most gamers in the world play on mobile. We think about the
console landscape, and part of the really evolution of the deal was, hey look, we've
got a ﬁxed console audience with Xbox are relatively ﬁxed, but not growing that fast.
You've got a couple hundred million kind of console adjustable market. You've got
300 million or 400 million kind of in that PC gamer market. And then you have
billions in the mobile market.
And mobile games are hard to make. You have-to-have the DNA. You have to have
A-B test. You have to know how to do performance marketing and how you think
about getting installs. And we've tried on our own a few times. We've got a great
Minecraft mobile experience on iOS and Android and other things. So we've got
some foothold. But what Activision Blizzard King does on mobile is impressive.
And what they've done with Candy Crush being one of the biggest ones from King.
But also you think about Call of Duty mobile. That's the most players playing is
frankly to Call of Duty mobile. I think about what they've done with Blizzard and
Diablo and World of Warcraft mobile, they just talked about a BlizzCon a few weeks
ago. And like I said Candy Crush.
So they're taking their IP into the mobile landscape and they know how to do it, how
to build it, how to iterate quickly. And that's just -- the DNA is gold, and we can then
leverage that with our IP and take the learnings in our business and say, okay, how
do we go now address these new, frankly, these new -- frankly, these new billion
gamers that we've never had a chance to go reach before.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28

developer opportunities?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
So now there's a couple of diﬀerent worlds, right? You have a content creation
engine.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
That is well-deﬁned and has built a great library and has strong franchises in many
areas. We're talking about a world where development could come from many
diﬀerent forms.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
So talk about how you kind of keep the competitive gap there.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
And it's changed at all in terms of talent or development cycle or how you think
about some of these things just as the technologies are shifting.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. So I'd start with Microsoft in general is, like, DNA -- we're a platform company in
our DNA whether it's Azure or Windows or what have you. And we treat -- we think
about gaming in very similar ways. So kind of think about two ends of the spectrum,
at the maybe, I don't want to call it lower end, but the more casual end. You've got
citizen creators building games that they can launch in our store, on the Xbox
platform, in our apps, into xCloud, which is our game streaming service over the
cloud, even on mobile.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28

Page 10 of 17Q - Michael Turrin
A - Tim Stuart
Q - Michael Turrin
A - Tim Stuart
Q - Michael TurrinSo you can capture that end of the pipe. And then you've got your high-end, call it
AAA game experiences, Halo, and even Minecraft, Call of Duty, Diablo, which is a
new one from Blizzard. So I think you've got -- I really think about two ends of the
spectrum. And then users can come in or gamers can come into our ecosystem, and
they can play a variety of things.
I like to joke, and it's interesting, like why does Netﬂix not really have a big social
experience? You kind of ask yourself. And maybe it's because you don't want people
knowing what you're watching, maybe. Do I want people to know I'm watching Tiger
King? I don't know if you think Tiger King, but kind of the --
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
That one's okay.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
That one's okay? But Tiger King is this great example where, Netﬂix has this kind of
unique experience or unique thing to watch, has a huge draw, creates that topspin,
and then you sort of create that viral eﬀect with people. Games are much the same
way, and we can talk about Game Pass in a bit.
But when you think about millions and millions of people on a subscription service,
you need the variety of games to get excitement, to have -- launch in new
geographies. And that's really kind of where I think about that casual, sort of maybe
AI created games that you can launch on a platform all the way up to Halo, what is --
House of Cards or Orange is the New Black, those kind of things.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes. That's so good. I'll give you a chance just to plug Call of Duty because timing
there was also great, right, in terms of becoming a part of Microsoft, before the
holidays. Just one of the most well known franchise.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. So if you haven't bought Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III launched on
November 10, you can get -- I'll let you go do it now on your app if you'd like to go
buy it. But, no, a great time to really be with Activision, go through their launch
motion. You sort of take it for granted now, but they launch a AAA, hugely successful,
millions and millions of gamers game every single holiday. And it's sort of easy to
say now that Call of Duty comes every year, but that is a huge feat.
The amount of developers they have, the amount of work they put against it, and so
we got to ride that wave with them. And we've known the Call of Duty team for
decades, they launched on Xbox 360 in 2005 with Call of Duty 2, and so we've been
with them for a while, but those kind of experiences and being with them and
learning from them has been very-very valuable.

Page 11 of 17A - Tim Stuart
Q - Michael Turrin
A - Tim StuartI mean, you wear many hats, so I can ask you a modeling question too. But just in
terms of the model impacts, there are a couple of things that we know in terms of
Activision. One is, maybe you can just help level set ﬁrst party versus third party, and
what that means for Microsoft and for investors who are kind of trying to formulate
through what Activision looks like standalone versus as a part of Microsoft.
And then we could talk about the margin side too because, remarkable, the
company has proven able to protect and sustain margins despite all the innovation
that's happening within the company. We take it for granted sometimes, but I'm sure
you don't and it's really impressive.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
It's -- I'd say that's from a lot of hard work, number one. And Amy and Satya have just
a great-great focus on driving value, acquiring new customers, whether if you're
commercial or consumer, whatever you want to -- whatever we think about what a
customer is, and driving operating leverage throughout that, which means smart
investments, targeted investments.
We talk a lot about it, the gaming leadership team. One of our most important jobs
is resource allocation. Putting the right things on the right bets at the right time. And
Satya and Amy are excellent at that as well. Pick the bets. You make sure you fund
them to where they need to be funded to be successful. Say no to the right things.
Stop doing the right things. And that's just a unique superpower, for sure, of
management.
But for us, when we think about the business, gaming as it relates to Microsoft and
with Activision, operating leverage and margin expansion, deﬁnitely a piece of that
puzzle. We think about acquisition, amortization separately --
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
-- so you can work that in your models. But at the highest level, you go from what
was a lower margin third party entity that we sold on our store to a high margin ﬁrst
party business.
So that's kind of when you think about the Xbox component of Call of Duties -- Call
of Duty, you go from, again, that low margin business to high margin business. Then
what you do is you also expand and say, we're now driving high margin sales on
PlayStation, on Nintendo. World of Warcraft has subscription high margin
businesses.
So you're bringing in high margin business into a traditionally more lower margin
business when you think about the Xbox's console and hardware. And that's really,
maybe lastly, is where we're going in this business is that expansion of operatingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 12 of 17Q - Michael Turrin
A - Tim Stuart
Q - Michael Turrin
A - Tim Stuartleverage, where we think about placing our bets, ﬁrst party, subscriptions,
advertising, those are all high margin businesses that we want to expand into.
And what you'll hear from us more-and-more is a bit of a change of strategy. And
again, not announcing anything broadly here, but our mission is to bring our ﬁrst-
party experiences, our subscription services, to every screen that can take a -- that
can play a game. That means smart TVs, that means mobile devices, that means what
we would have thought as competitors in the past, like PlayStation and Nintendo.
We're going to NVIDIA, GeForce Now, their gaming subscription service. I know you
have Colette, I think, on tomorrow. You can talk to her about that.
But when we think about taking our businesses to these endpoints, again, it's that
high-margin business to new gamers that really Activision allows us to do in a much,
I don't want to say easier way, but a much more I'll say fast way to get there versus
trying to kind of build on your own.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
I think we got the internal pitch on why this one rose to the top.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
So just thinking about how the mix evolves within gaming, more further towards
content and services and away from console. Can you just talk about the mix? And
then does this change the seasonality to a certain extent of what you'd expect from
the gaming business relative to what it has looked like?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. Starting with seasonality, one of the things we focused on a lot is kind of more of
games, think of games as a service, but really we mean that more often ability for you
to talk to your customers.
Think about Fortnite, it was a great example that, really did it well. We did it even
early on with Minecraft. But things like Fortnite are less about a holiday bump and
more about the, hey, we're launching a Thanos skin around Avengers Endgame in
May, , kind of thing. And I know I'll say, as a platform, we love that, also my kids love
that. That was a great place to be.
But that's kind of a -- as you think about services and content, services is our North
Star, I'll talk about that in a second. But it really smooths things out. You're still going
to have a holiday bump, right? You're still going to have consoles that we sell and
you're still going to have customers that spend in those time periods.
But even things like Game Pass. We last announced 25 million Game Pass
subscribers. It's obviously grown since then. But Game Pass is this millions andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 13 of 17Q - Michael Turrin
A - Tim Stuartmillions of subscribers month in and month out, which for me I love because it's
more of a paid annuity as opposed to that, you're betting on those big game
launches every quarter or every year. But Game Pass helps us smooth it out as well.
So two things to maybe wrap that point. About six or seven years ago, we stopped
giving console volume externally. And at ﬁrst it was like, what are you doing? You're
the Xbox business, you're not giving us consoles. That makes no sense. But it was
really the ﬁrst point of us saying, no, no, it's about content and services. Our business
is P x Q, more customers, spending more money. And that's really how I think about
our model.
So when we talk about content and services externally, that's our KPI. And for that
number to go up, you need more gamers, and you need more gamers spending
money. And we've really focused on that with our internal teams as a, here's how we
grow the business. Go bring more users in and ﬁnd ways for them to play.
And it goes a little bit to my last point here is about business model, kind of -- we call
it business model optimization, but really business model diversity. And if a gamer
comes in, they can subscribe to Game Pass, they can buy a game digitally, they can
have advertising to fund their gaming that way. And so however they want to
monetize, we're trying to ﬁnd a way for them to spend money, if you will, with us.
And we've seen that as a very-very good accelerant in this content and services
landscape.
It also helps us, maybe lastly, on geographic expansion. The vision I like to talk about
is, we've got xCloud gaming -- game streaming. And so you can subscribe to Game
Pass Ultimate, and you can stream hundreds of games to really any endpoint that has
a browser experience. And for models like Africa, or India, Southeast Asia, maybe
places that are not console ﬁrst, you can say, hey, do you want to watch 30 seconds
of an ad and then get two hours of game streaming?
Africa, the 50% of the population, I think 25 years and younger, with a growing
disposable income base, all with cell phones or mobile devices, not a lot of high-end
disposable income, just generally speaking. So we can then go in with our own
business models and say, there's millions and millions of gamers that we would
never have been able to address there, now we can go in with our business models.
So that's a long way of saying smooth it out, but really, content and services revenue
is that North Star that we're aimed at.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes. It's a super a super comprehensive answer. On the last point that you raised, in
some of the emerging markets, are we there from a technology perspective? Is it
certain types of games that you have to focus on because of latency or just
underlying bandwidth constraints? Or maybe help us understand what that is?

Okay.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Super fast-twitch, like you're not going to be able to stream a 4K, 120 frames a
second Forza Motorsport experience to a 65-inch OLED. Not yet.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
So for those kind of experiences, they don't quite exist yet. But for the most part,
being a part of Microsoft, and this is kind of an indirect answer, but being a part of
Microsoft with our Azure footprint gives us access to about 80% of the gamers
around the world. When you think about where Azure data centers are located, how
we've built the latency models to work with gaming, how we've worked with our
transmit speeds. I'd say the experience is largely there.
So one of the things that we saw when we announced xCloud, this was a couple
years ago. And you think about the combination of xCloud plus 5G or high speed
mobile internet, was some of our ﬁrst calls back in were from mobile operators and
saying, hey, how do I get xCloud on my network? Because I want to ﬁnd a way to
upgrade people into the high-end data plans as well. And you think about India or
Africa or some of those geographies, they may not have the physical kind of
footprint to have the traditional ﬁber or whatever, but they've got 5G rollouts that are
happening. And I think we're going to be on the forefront of reaching millions and
millions of gamers that otherwise wouldn't have been able to reach in the past.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Another good segue way. So just in terms of streaming. I'm hoping to hit on a
couple of points and your answers have been comprehensive enough, I'm conﬁdent
you can hit on a couple of points at once. But the pricing monetization strategy
within -- we see multiple SKUs now, we see the core announcement. So is there sort
of a cohort thought behind that, or the pricing strategy and then the points of
competitive diﬀerentiation, particularly focused on Azure, but anything else you
would highlight from what Microsoft has surrounding itself?
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. So the SKU point, which is a really good one, so we used to have Xbox Live
Gold, which is traditionally our multiplayer service, and that was kind of the thing
you'd spend money on to play your multiplayer games. And it worked for -- it still
works largely now, but think about it like a model that said, in the old days of having
a console you'd actually have to pay for multiplayer service. Nowadays, when you -- I
talk to my kids or I'll say play younger gamers or even gamers today, the notion of
paying for multiplayer service feels a little bit antiquated.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28

A - Tim StuartThat -- when you play on a mobile device, you generally don't pay for it. When you
play on a PC, you generally don't pay for it. So -- but we had millions and millions of
players on it. So what we did was we said, hey, look, let's have an entry-level Game
Pass SKU called Game Pass Core, basically. And Game Pass Core allows you to
migrate what was Xbox Live Gold into a Game Pass catalog. And it's got a subset of
our Game Pass catalog. And for those who don't know, Game Pass is our game
content subscription service. You know, for $9.99 a month or $14 -- $17.99 a month,
you get access to 100 great games. Play it, play as much as you want.
So we've really found a way to migrate that kind of Xbox Live Gold base into Game
Pass. And then they see the value of, look, if I upgrade up the SKU pipeline, I can
now get access to the full catalog. I can get access to game streaming which is in
Game Pass Ultimate are high end SKU. So I'll say from a business model landscape
or from my CFO seat ability for us to migrate users up that stack. That's a key value
driver for us.
And one of the great things about gaming too is, if you ﬁnd a way to drive value to
gamers and they're paying for that value that they enjoy, it's actually a great
relationship They don't feel like they're being kind of grinded down on the dollars,
like I'm paying $17 a month and I get access to hundreds of games the value is there.
And for us we oﬀer most of our games, if not all that we've had before Activision,
when a game launches it's included in Game Pass as well. So that's kind of one of the
unique value props that we have.
Lastly, I'd say from a Microsoft standpoint, leveraging the platforms that we have to
go reach all endpoints, think about Oﬃce today, it's on all endpoints. Azure reaches
all endpoints. What we do with our service is really reach as many endpoints there.
So whether it's our digital store or our platform technology, leveraging our position
at Microsoft allows us to move quickly, move with security, move with safety, move
with our conﬁdence that we can protect our consumers. We obviously have a trust in
safety and security lens that we put on everything we do.
So being in that Microsoft framework really allows us to move with speed and allows
us to focus our eﬀorts on what's the best for gamers, what's the best for our
business, and leverage Microsoft where we can to do it quickly.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes. That's great. I'm pleased you're here now because there's a rich list of topics to
check through. We just have a couple of minutes left. So one kind of higher level
Microsoft cultural question I have for you is, you're not alone in having been there for
multiple decades. It's very often we interface with someone at Microsoft that is
maybe rotated around diﬀerent divisions but has been there for a long time. And it
seems like that's even more so the case now because of just the Gravity and all of
the amazing bets that the company has placed. But from your perspective internally,
can you speak to what keeps the continuity, the longevity, all those things in markets
that are hyper-competitive that you're hitting on?

A - Tim StuartYes. I'll say for me personally, the gaming landscape changes every year. So every
day you come in, it's a new battle in a good way. It's a new thing to go solve.
Combined with the culture of Microsoft, I was actually on a panel last night, I ﬂew in
late last night, but yesterday I was on a panel at the oﬃce and it was, I don't know,
ﬁve or six or seven of kind of my peer CFOs through the company. And we looked
on stage and we had something like 250 years of Microsoft experience between the
nine or so of us, or something like that.
And you look at that, and I was kind of reﬂecting later, someone taking a picture and
sent it to me. I was reﬂecting on, why are we all there so long? It's a culture. It's just
that what we've seen over the last, for sure, seven or eight years from Satya taking
over, was really -- he talks a lot about growth mindset, so I don't want to overuse it,
but really, learn it all, be a good listener, with respect, with empathy. And that really
feeds through the organizations.
And Satya and Amy, their bar is high, so it's not be weak and do all these things. It's
be strong, keep your foot on the gas, be smart at what we do, pivot quickly. But you
can do all that with respect. And I think when we look across the table at other
people that are at the company, and you look at people that have been around for a
long time, they execute well together.
And I -- not to be all sports about it, I happen to like watching sports, but some of the
best teams that you see out there are ones that have been around for a while and
execute well together, and they do it with respect. They do it with pushback. There's -
- it's not easy. It's not easy. The bar is high, and you want to keep growing the stock
price. You want to keep growing share and EPS, but really that culture is just at the
top level. Really what I've seen is just great, and so we stick around because we love
it.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
Yes. That's a good passion to answer. Just a minute left, so I'll turn it to you for
closing remarks. I think the crux of what I'd hope to get is just the major metrics and
milestones that you're focused on, and we've touched on a lot, but in three or ﬁve
years, what you're gauging success by.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Yes. Success for us is, we can keep growing that content and services revenue. I'll say
multiple -- double-digits, and I don't mean that with Activision, without Activision,
because you'll see some movement in comps and stuﬀ. But it's really, if we can grow
faster than the market is growing, we are taking share in the gaming market, and
that's where we want to be. It's a $250 billion market. We are not $250 billion.
And so, early on and not to make -- I'll kind of leave at this point maybe is, we walked
into Satya's oﬃce, Phil Spencer who runs Xbox and I, we had both taken our jobs
about the same time. We've known each other for a decade before that together.
We're like, let's go do this gaming thing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-28

Q - Michael TurrinWalked into Satya's oﬃce, hey, we're going to spend $2.5 billion on this thing called
Minecraft. He's like -- jokingly, he says a blocky game, you chop down trees like what,
$2.5 billion for this thing. I'll say turns out one of the best acquisitions that have been
made, it'd be in history. But he said, I don't want to talk about Minecraft. Tell me why
we're in gaming?
And we put the deck down that we had for the acquisition and that was a moment
for Satya, Phil, myself, Amy Hood of why is Microsoft in gaming? And that was eight
or nine years ago. And the answer really is kind of why it's Microsoft in any business?
Big and growing market that we have an ability to take and win share. And that's why
we do gaming at Microsoft.
And of course, we can leverage assets. And of course, we need consumer brands at
Microsoft that are meaningful. You can't just -- in my opinion, you can't just be all
commercial led. You've got to have good consumer lens too. But in the end, it's
grow share in a big and growing market. And that's what we're here to do.
{BIO 20079094 <GO>}
That's a good note to close on as any, Tim. Thanks a lot. Really appreciate the time.
{BIO 20382118 <GO>}
Thanks for having me. It's great to be in person. And it's good seeing everyone too.
