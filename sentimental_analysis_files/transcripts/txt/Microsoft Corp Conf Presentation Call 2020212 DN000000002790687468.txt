{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay, thank you everybody. Great to see a full house for Microsoft. We are very
pleased to have Jared Spataro with us. He's the Corporate Vice President of
Microsoft 365, Marketing. So, thank you for making the trip and spending some time.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
My pleasure. Thank you for having me.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So, everybody knows that Oﬃce 365. Right. Sometimes when we talk about M365
people think we're confused. So it's a huge brand, but walk us through help people
understand what is in the product set?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Sure, thanks. Let's just start, let's break down the components ﬁrst and then play a
little bit about the history. So from a component perspective, Microsoft 365 consists
of Oﬃce 365, EMS, which is our Enterprise Management Security Suite and Windows
and that's the windows commercial value. And we started oﬀ, actually kind of there is
a small bundle that we call the enterprise cloud suite. It was based on customers
looking to buy those things together and we bundle them up and gave them a
discount. What we found over time though was the customers, weren't just buying
for the discount, they of course appreciate the discount, but increasingly, they
wanted to make those purchases together, because they were starting to see real
beneﬁts from deploying the technologies together and getting the beneﬁts of lining
up the latest versions of the software to enable essentially new scenarios.
So then we took that ECS, that Enterprise Cloud Suite in 2.5 years ago we launched
Microsoft 365 as a product proper and over the last two and half years, we've been
very busy, not just taking the components and making them better, but also reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Jared Spataroworking hard across the integration of those components, so that we have a new
value prop. And in fact we have a brand new value prop as we think about the
software itself.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Who's the target market for M365?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Of course our strength is Microsoft has always been IT, I would say. And if I then go
into a segment view that puts us into enterprise. But what's really nice about
Microsoft 365 and bringing those components together is, we have expanded our
target market. So let me talk from a couple of perspectives. First, if we just look at
enterprise, the combination of those components allows us, not just to speak to IT,
but really speak to the business about business transformation and that's been -- that
has really changed our sales motion. I think we'll talk a little bit about that later.
And the second thing that Microsoft 365 has allowed to do, it's allowed us to go into
even in enterprise into new areas, so as an example, ﬁrst line workers people who
largely didn't have access to kind of productivity software, previously. And then it's
allowed us to go down market into SMB because we're able to bring these services
together in a very integrated way and take-out a lot of the management that you had
to do through IT departments previously.
So there's Microsoft 365 as a package has allowed us to do a lot of things that we
just weren't able to do an on-premise software was the way that we delivered our
value.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So, and as you see enterprises and you rightly pointed out in certain pockets of, if
you go outside knowledge workers there were people that may be never had access
to oﬃce or may be didn't even have a Windows machine that they were using. How
has this kind of enabled people to kind of get more of their employee base on to
Microsoft's suite of oﬀerings. And can the IT, can the company, kind of pick and
choose, okay, it might be E5, it might be E3 or it might be some of their SKUs. So
how much mixing and matching is going on as a result of this?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
There is quite a bit of mixing and matching maybe the best example would be to
kind of talk to you about what this looks like in a large enterprise. So, if we take a
step back and look at a large enterprise and what they're doing, of course, they have
their information workers that they're trying to help just be more productive and the
things I think all of us would be familiar with. These are people who carry laptops
with them, who have access to all the computing power of a laptop and then can go
to the cloud.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 16Heather Bellini
Jared Spataro
Heather BelliniFor a lot of other workers they're, very high value workers. We call them ﬁrst line
workers. They may not kind of every day carry that type of computing device,
increasingly they do carry a phone, but they have kind of been left behind by the
technology revolution focused on productivity. In the healthcare sector as an
example, we have a great customer in St. Luke's regional health care network that
we've proﬁle recently and doctors for them, are ﬁrst line workers.
So these are highly qualiﬁed highly paid individuals, and we're able to use Microsoft
365 deliver our value on a phone now, and do so in a way that really helps them to
be more productive. What we like to say with Microsoft 365 now as you can license
people depending on what they need, and you can connect everyone from the top
ﬂoor to the shop ﬂoor, in other words, you connect everyone across the organization.
We think Microsoft 365 is the ﬁrst platform that really allows us to do that in a
productivity sense spanning diﬀerent worker types. And then just getting to licensing
question very speciﬁcally, we certainly see people that license really based on the
need of the workers. They'd license E3 or E5 for their information workers. We have
other licenses called ﬁrst line licenses and they'll use that for those ﬁrst line workers.
It just depends on what the needs are at the individual worker level.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And did enterprise customers who are used to getting a new machine getting
Windows 10 maybe on that new machine and then either using Oﬃce 365 or
increasingly using Oﬃce 365 like how much of a cultural change is it for enterprise
customers to move away from kind of how they used to adopt Windows technology
in the past and even Oﬃce technology when -- what is it like when they start
morphing over to this type of strategy?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
It's a big change. You should underestimate it. Again, the thing we're tapping into
with Microsoft 365 is business transformation in general. I think what customer
sometimes aren't ready for is how much we will also change their IT operations,
because what we do is we're able to remove a lot of the running of servers, a lot of
the -- for instance imaging of desktops, a lot of kind of essentially kind of that lower
level repetitive work associated with delivering IT services. Now we're able to help
those IT professionals focused on really delivering value. It comes at just the right
time because IT right now increasingly has that pressure and that desire to be
aligned with the business and business objectives.
So we feel like we're riding a wave of demand that starts with this business
transformation idea, but also includes kind of tech transformation in these large
enterprises.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So on your most recent earnings call, obviously you had very strong growth in your
commercial business. Amy called out some of the drivers of that, but she also
speciﬁcally highlighted Microsoft 365 is one of the reasons that commercialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)

Jared Spatarobookings growth was ahead of the expectations. So how do we think about the
opportunity ahead? And kind of how impactful, this could be?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Sure. Let's start with just the remainder of some of the baseline stats, because I think
that helps to ground everyone. Oﬃce 365, we report now, so it's monthly active
users and in Q1 of this ﬁscal year for us, we reported over 200 million monthly active
users of Oﬃce 365. In Q2, we've reported some numbers on EMS, there we report
seats and that was 127 million seats of EMS, that was growing 35% year-over-year.
And then if we get to the third component of Microsoft 365, we have Windows
Commercial. We reported that grew 25% year-over-year. So each of the components
are growing quite nicely. A new data point that I'll share with you, and with this room
that we haven't shared before is that now when we look at Oﬃce 365 purchases over
a quarter of Oﬃce 365 licenses are being purchased through M365 or through
Microsoft 365. So in other words, what we're trying to communicate to you is
Microsoft 365 as a vehicle now is allowing us to go in and not just sell Oﬃce 365, but
also sell EMS and to sell Windows.
So when you think of kind of the upside available for us just in pure SKU and
revenue terms, that's kind of what it looks like. But there's even more as we think
about the value prop, and kind of it resets the value prop conversation for us.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And it actually makes Windows a subscription business, right. So I know you've got
how you guys do Rev Rec for Windows and how that changed over the years, but it
makes it so that you're not just paying a monthly subscription now for Oﬃce 365, but
Windows which probably most people in the room would normally think of if it's just
a transactional purchase has started to change.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Correct. And that's because it would be one thing if we just switch these things over
to subscription businesses, but then there is no value. But in each of those
categories, we have tried really hard to have cloud value. Oﬃce we'll talk more
about it, but the intelligent services associated with Oﬃce allow us to kind of deliver
ongoing value in EMS, again the management is cloud-based and Intelligent based
on cloud services and then Windows, just as you indicate and we're able to the real
hope for us in Windows with Windows Commercial ends up being security, but there
is other end user value like timeline as an example or a cloud-based copy and paste
that are simple, but mean a lot of people across devices.
And then of course there is some innovation, we've introduced with things like
Windows Virtual Desktop we refer to the WVD that's an area that is cloud-based
allows us to really go after this virtualization market with Windows. So, you're exactly
right.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Some people wonder how much of the strength and the success has been the result
of the Windows 7 end of life. So can you can you talk with us a little bit about that in
terms of the uptake that you've seen the strong growth that you've reported. Is there
any way to discern how much of an impact end of life has been?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Of course, again, just to go back to the data point, Q2, 25% year-over-year growth in
billings for Windows Commercial, so that's kind of where we're starting from.
Deﬁnitely Windows 7 end of life has continue to what they driver for us. I think we'll
continue to be as we have even some of those laggards that are catching up, but as
we look out there is just real value in Windows commercial that goes well beyond
having an end of life moment for us and that's what I'm most excited about with the
Windows.
Security really is the anchor. It is the thing that people are excited about, they're
starting to recognize that with their OS, that a one and done doesn't work that they
have to have security services. They keep them secure and then we have these other
values. So as we think -- as we look for a long-term growth, we would say that we see
sustained double-digit growth in billings in that Windows Commercial Business
which is very exciting for us, not something that people would have thought of a
couple of years ago, we see some real strength there.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And even kind of the EMF strength that you've been seeing, if you go back 10 years
ago or even prior to that people would say why would I pay Microsoft for security.
Right. And so you had these markets or these companies evolve that we're oﬀering
security for Windows devices because corporate would say, I don't want to pay
Microsoft to do that. They should be making it secure and you went through this
whole debate way back then, but now EMS is central to the story. So how do you
seem customer perception evolve now that you've got 127 million users of EMS?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
EMS is just foundational to everything we do. Just to review the components for
years, we think about what's in these assets identity, management, security and
compliance. Those four components are what make up EMS. As we think about our
value prop or M365 all up tapping into kind of digital transformation or business
transformation, I divide it into three buckets, there is a bucket for personal
productivity kind of helping your end users be productive, no matter who they are
and what they do, organizational productivity helping the entire org be more
productive. And then ﬁnally, this kind of under guarding of security and compliance.
EMS is critical to delivering all three values like it's just super super important. So as
you think about identity increasingly doing identity right and identity across all yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Jared Spataroinvestments your IT investments becomes a central investment point for you, it
becomes a control plane, we'd like to think of it is. And then even as you get down
to management which kind of was boring for a while, people are starting to
recognize this cross device, cross platform management super important and your
ability with EMS, as an example to manage Windows devices, go across and manage
iOS and Android all the devices in your state is really important.
So it for me kind of (inaudible) the value that, we are delivering through the entire
suite and that's what makes it so important. And as we go drive kind of Microsoft 365
revenue, that's what you're seeing as people are starting to recognize that they need
to invest in this area.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So if you think about Oﬃce 365 you mentioned over 200 million MAUs on your most
recent call, the 127 million users of EMF. How do we think about those, should that
the GAAP between those numbers converge and should we start to see or should
we think about the potential for EMS as being your Oﬃce 365 base in totality?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Absolutely. Let me answer the speciﬁc question, and broadening out how you
should think about the business. The speciﬁc question would be absolutely as you
think about those 200 million MAU, we would certainly want to attach EMS to all of
them, you can deﬁnitely think about the dip in those two numbers as upside. You
also should think about a dip between our MAU and our seats for Oﬃce 365,
because there is a dip there, we don't disclose seats, but there is a delta that you can
be calculating.
In general, the pattern that we see would be that we go from components to ME3 so
Microsoft 365 E3 and then if we step people up into ME5. And so that's the
monetization train we're raiding right now and that's the pattern that we're
essentially developing in our sales force, it's caused us to develop a new sales
motion entirely to go after it.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
What is the new sales notion?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Well, that this awesome opportunity. We use to sell kind of just coverage. That's how
we did it. Oﬃce was essentially I call it WXP, Word Excel PowerPoint, you could add
Outlook into that perhaps Mail, but that was the core value prop for productivity
from Microsoft. We stepped way beyond WXP, what people think of is Oﬃce and so
that all sales motion of just coverage coming in and saying, hey, you have a person
they need Email, they need Oﬃce has now moved into much more of a solution
sales kind of oriented thing where we actually are able to walk in and talk againFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)

Jared Spataroabout personal productivity, organizational productivity and security and
compliance.
The upside to that is we're tapping into new budgets, awesome. The downside to
that is, there is a little bit longer sales cycle, I'm with you. So there's kind of some
balancing for us to do as we go after this new opportunity.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So when you think about the people who have migrated to Oﬃce 365 early, but
maybe didn't use EMF. Do you -- have you noticed a trend? Are there any situations
you could talk about where people have actually maybe they were using something
else for EMF, but they were using Oﬃce 365 and then they started converting over
and switch right, do you see that happening at all?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Absolutely, one of the ideas that are the examples that comes to mind for me is
National Bank of Canada. Again if I start from kind of what got them motivated, they
started, speciﬁcally with this idea of business transformation. They are very interested
in kind of coming up to the 21st century and everything that they did they were
heavy, heavy Oﬃce users, just generally, but they were Oﬃce users kind of for their
oﬃce staﬀ not necessarily for the retailers. As we were able to lock them up the
stack, they moved into Microsoft 365 as a suite that means going from oﬃce and
adding again EMS and Windows Commercial.
It also in this particular case, introducing teams and new ways of collaborating within
six months that organization went from nothing and kind of no collaboration to 50%
of org using teams within nine months they had 80% on. So it's a really nice way of
kind of seen and move from being an old proﬁle customer up to kind of where we
like to see our customers.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Amy also talks about that success and the impact that EMS adoption has had on
Azure and Azure gross margin. So it's a per seat pricing model. It does seem like
there's a lot of runway there for this to continue to see penetration. Is there also an
idea over time where you could see upward SKU migration, so that even though
someone might be an existing customer paying you $5 per user per month that
there is going to be opportunities similar that you have with Oﬃce 365 where you
can start moving up the SKUs so the existing customers can actually start driving
even more incremental revenue.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Absolutely, with Microsoft 365, the strategy behind it is based on the idea that as we
think about someone who is using Microsoft 365, we ﬁnd that even from out of the
gate, they have a higher ARPU then they have lower churn, which is really good. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Jared Spatarothen ﬁnally, to your point exactly, they have a much higher propensity to over time
consumed or what we call our premium SKUs. So E5 and even the components of
E5, so it gives us this opportunity to walk them up through the stack and it's just for
us it's a golden formula. We love what Microsoft 365 is doing to drive the business.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Is it -- you talked a little bit about the lower churn that you mentioned, how material
is it? And what causes the lower churn?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Let's go enterprise down to SMB. Enterprise churn is not something that's been a
really big problem for us.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
But as we move down to the SMB certainly turn to something that is part of just
managing the business over time. So Microsoft 365 has helped us because we are
delivering new value that goes beyond that kind of Word Excel PowerPoint, we
deﬁnitely have been able to see it change the kind of the shape of what churn looks
like in a positive direction for us.
And then as we just think about overall kind of using Microsoft 365, our eﬀorts in this
new sales motion that we've implemented haven't just been on value selling, but
they've also been in value realization and we've invested for instance in, we got
CSM, he is your Customer Success Managers, lots of tech companies do this, it was
new for Microsoft over the last couple of years, and across the stack in our segments,
we actually go in and help them realize the value.
When they're using, and we've got great numbers that show this when they're using
and getting value of the churn just goes away like they in fact add they go up the
stack in terms of SKUs and they add -- over time.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. And again, if we take a look at the security market, typically, it's been a best of
breed market right, and I guess how do you think about your ability to compete with
all of the point solutions that exist across the various categories?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
So this is a place where it's useful to step back and talk about our strategy with
Microsoft 365 in general, while our (inaudible) security, I think it will come up as weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 16Heather Bellini
Jared Spatarotalk about teams, as an example. We are really going after, what I call it no
compromise this strategy and that is that we think we can be best-in-class and we
think we can be best in integration, that has not been possible before particularly in
security as you look at the players out there, most of them are point players, they
have gone after best in breed in a particular area, but we see this opportunity to
actually do both and to really go after and to make our investments in a way that
matter.
As you look at where we've invested in security we start at identity talking about that
EMS later, we move up to devices, we go from devices to apps, we move from app
to the information in the apps, we got all the way up to the cloud services. And ﬁnally
we cap all of that with Threat Protection that essentially kind of looks across all of
those touch points in your infrastructure. And so in each of the areas, we're trying to
invest very deeply, we are committed to being best in class, but in addition to those
investments, we're also investing across those areas and the way that we think makes
us very diﬀerentiated.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So at Ignite back in September, you had a couple of product announcement, where
you had a lot of product announcements, but a couple of were project Cortex also
the endpoint manager product that you announced. Any feedback on those so far?
And also, is this the evolution, we should be expecting is just more and more of
these add-ons into the SKUs?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes, great feedback. Let me talk about endpoint manager. Again, I'd say that
management was a place that was sleepy for a while. We feel like it is increasingly
becoming strategic as companies recognize, hey the ﬁrst step in digital
transformation business transformation is actually making sure you get your directory
right and making sure you manage your devices, right. So, endpoint manager for us,
Microsoft endpoint manager brings together in tune and conﬁg man, these are two
kind of one cloud one kind of on-prem based service and puts them into a single
integrated service that was a really big deal for us. The reaction that's been super
positive. This project Cortex that you refer to Heather has been a really big one for
us. This opens a new market for us and brand new TAM.
It is essentially the idea of knowledge and capturing knowledge within your
company. So using AI to actually identify and codiﬁed knowledge in a way that's very
valuable. One simple example would be taking a whole heap of contracts pointing
Cortex at it, you can actually pull out Q&A and so that you can understand what's in
those contracts, everything from late fees to deadlines that would be coming up
things that you'd usually have to have a human go in and scan for, we can now do
that with Cortex.
So that's a whole new investment area, we think of it as brand new TAM for us. And
then to answer, your ﬁnal question, ma'am, we're excited because the way we're
pursuing M365, Microsoft 365, is to just look for these TAM expansive opportunities.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Heather BelliniSome are adjacent, some push us a little bit further out, but to really bring those into
our deﬁnition of productivity and we're just saying we're going to expand what
productivity looks like by looking at the problems and challenges that customers
have.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
What about Windows virtual desktop? You mentioned that before and you I think
announced that product back in September of '18, I think if I'm not mistaken. What if
you heard from customers there, we had Citrix was here yesterday, I mean, they've
got a complementary partnership with you all, but it's a question that comes up a lot
in the investment community about kind of how you see that relationship, but also
your ambitions with this product?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Let me do the WVD Windows Virtual Desktop, when we talk about partners, let me
talk about in the go-forward strategy. If I ﬁrst said, WVD it's been an excellent
success for us, the deﬁning feature of Windows Virtual Desktop is our ability to
change the economics of virtualization. We are able to change the economics,
because we can run multiple users on the same virtual machine and do so in a way
that's very seamless to those users when you experience you kind of can't believe it.
So it just -- it allowed us to deliver virtualization at a diﬀerent level in terms of pricing.
So we love that.
Second, as we always do, we're producing great services but we love to have our
partners come in and add on top of those services, that's exactly what we're trying to
do with, Citrix, that's been the case since the beginning of time. That's how we run
our ecosystem. So we see opportunity, Citrix, certainly sees opportunities to build on
top of that WVD service.
And then third the go forward for us as we continue to work with customers who
start -- have started to deploy WVD, we get excited because we see this opportunity
to really rethink what computing looks like over time. What I mean by that is, if you
take a step back and look at for instance being able to buy a fairly low cost hardware
on the endpoint, but deliver what would be the equivalent of a $10,000 or $20,000
machines for a virtualized experience, again you can change up the economics of
what it looks like to deliver computing power to your end users. So we see that as a
long-term opportunity that we're investing in now. So this is a place or space where
we see lots of opportunity for us.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And its interesting because this is a market that I think people were hoping would be
a really fast growing market and be a fast follower to server virtualization, and that
hasn't happened. I mean it starting to your -- deﬁnitely getting better data points
around it over the last few years, but what is it that you need to see happen for what
you just mentioned right the $200 or $300 boxes right that you put under your deskFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Heather Bellinito give you the experience that you might be working on an HPC machine, what
needs to happen in order for that to become a reality?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
I would say three things, number one, the endpoint itself needs to become virtual
like Cloud aware, let's just call it, if I can take a step back has been cloud aware in a
way that we can take virtualized services and pop them into the experience in a way
that feels native. Today, it is a little bit clunky, you're spending something up, you
have some window all of a sudden it looks like a whole new desktop, you might
virtualize an app, it doesn't feel like it belongs there. So the endpoints need to get
much smarter much more intelligent that what they do.
Number two, the service itself needs to get a bit more ﬁnished today, as we look at
WVD, it's a way for you to spin up your own virtualization. We think if we want to go
after these opportunities a ﬁnished service oﬀers kind of a unique spin on this. And
the number three, as we think about it, we think that there are some opportunities to
really rethink where virtualization can deliver in that new value, what I mean by that
is, you have certain sectors like healthcare other places where they have found the
value virtualization, and we think there are other places where security, compliance,
your desire for instance to deliver kind of a footprint list computing environment
wouldn't really matter, but because virtualization has been hard and expenses
people have not found that.
So as you do the ﬁrst two, we actually think there will be new use cases that will
evolve. So this very rich fertile soil for us to grow the business, and I'm sure you'll
hear more from us over time here.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I've got a handful more questions, but I do recognize there is a lot of people in the
audience and I wanted to check to see if there's any questions from the ﬁeld, before
I could move on.

Jared SpataroAll right. An increasing area of focus.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Lot of press, you recently announced I think 20 million DAUs right, back in
November.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
That's correct.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So how has user adoption or engagement track versus your expectations?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
It's been phenomenal. If I'm honest with you. Let me just start with the DAU thing
because there's a lot of needling on this. And let me deﬁne the DAU. Daily Active
User for us is a maximum number of users who taken an intentional action over a 24-
hour period, that's really important for me to hit. What we call passive actions do not
count. So auto boot does not count, minimizing the window does not count, closing
the app does not count, we also do --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
There's a lot of questions about this. I got you, yeah.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Skype does not count. So when we release our numbers, we just don't feel like we
want to get in the weeds of kind of argue with people, but the DAU is very real. We
love what we're seeing with Teams. Teams in many ways has become our campus on
which to project the best of Microsoft 365, and that's the way for you to think of it.
It is a new opportunity for us to think about what does the operating system of the
future really look like, because it puts people at the center, it makes comments or
communications, kind of the backplane for how people work together, and then
we're layering on business process, we're layering on an integration with line of
business systems and sales, I mean it has been truly, truly phenomenal how it's taken
oﬀ for us. So that's why I want somebody ask me we really love what's happening.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Jared SpataroIt has become when someone says business or digital transformation, I say Teams
even when they don't ask me questions, I say Teams because it's so hard for us as a
way to really represent a new way of working.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And so how have the conversations with enterprises gone? What is it, if you go back
a year ago or 18 months ago, this still probably a pretty nascent market for you all
and adoption really seems like it's inﬂected? What's caused that? Has your go-to-
market changed? Or your sales people being incented diﬀerently? So what is it that's
really cause to this inﬂection?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
There are both internal and external factors. On the external side, again what we see
is companies desperately want to ﬁnd in many ways, a very symbolic and clear way
to change how they're working together. Teams allows them to do that, they are able
to say, hey, this is a new way of doing things, there's is a form one value prop, there's
chat me, call, collaborate and they say, we're going to do certain business processes
this way. So it has some kind of symbolic value to companies as they change.
Internally as we started to realize that there was a lot of demand, and that we had a
good product market ﬁt because you're always looking for like what's catching ﬁre
and we realize wow, this thing is on ﬁre. Of course, we mobilized our resources to go
and help customers to adapt. So, we hired a lot more of these customer success
managers, so that was a really important set of investments we made. We certainly
have worked really hard to do integration between Teams and the rest kind of the
productivity elements that people use of the suite. So it's both product investments
as well as the type of interactions we have with customers.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So one of your competitors in this market would highlight limitations of your product
and highlight things such as -- you can't have more than 5,000 people in a channel,
otherwise you have to have multiple channels and that might defeat the purpose of
trying to have seamless communication. How -- what's form? And what isn't? What's
real? And what's not in terms of the back and forth, in terms of functionality?
And I guess, why don't we start with that?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
As I think again, think about the form where we thought the hub for teamwork, so
there are multiple competitors. If you're trying to do a Teams does you're going to
pull together Slack, Zoom, Dropbox and Google, that's kind of the fact of life if you
choose not to use Teams. Against each of those competitors we have strengths and
we have gaps, and I would just say that we have -- we are super clear on what our
gaps are against the leaders in those categories, and we invest every day, every day,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12

Jared Spataroevery day to close those gaps. Please don't think that we don't know what those are.
We also have real competitive strength, and we're also working really hard to
strengthen those things.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So let's focus on those for a second, so you mentioned there is gaps. So if you had to
pick the top two or three, and then kind of what's your development cycle? How fast
are you iterating on the product, whereas maybe a year ago, maybe there were six
really big gaps you had to overcome and now there might only be three, If I -- help
us think through that how the gaps have evolved and how you've been narrowing
the gaps? And also what is the -- what's the top one or two value propositions when
you're going into a customer that you lead with because you know you're just that
far ahead?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Great. If I were to take Chat and Colab, which is a place that we are behind a year
and a half ago, boy my gaps in Chat and Colab and versus the Chat and Colab folks,
they are almost non-existent at this point. We still have a couple of very small ones,
having to do a scale, you mentioned one of those kind of channel scalability would
be an example of one. But I can't think of too many others as I work with customers
that are really big diﬀerences, even our platform investments as an example, the
work we've been doing to make Teams a platform, it's far ahead of those
competitors.
If we then take for instance meetings, where we have a company like Zoom it has
done really well, we have at small gaps that we've seen that over the course of the
last 18 months, we have done a lot for instance in quality and we feel really good
about where our quality stands today. Then as we look across the others, the gaps
are small and getting smaller is the way we feel.
I will go back to our strategy. Our strategy is really to be best-in-class and to be best
of integration to be no compromises that's exactly what we're trying to do. If I go to
the question of like what do we say when we walk into a customer what wins the day
every time, it ends up being the combination that hub for teamwork that wins every
time when we say, hey, watch this, you're going to go from paying someone on chat
to bringing in three other people to co-authoring a document, to see each other's
faces to ﬁnally moving this through an approval workﬂow. So you can submit your
bid, and that's all happens on one platform that is totally diﬀerentiated and that's
where we are winning, right now.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. So I think that's the other helpful thing is to how do people think about just
the paying point of integration, if you didn't go with Teams?

Heather BelliniThere are two really big aspects of integration, if you don't go with Teams. First you
actually have to ﬁnd ways to plug your workﬂow and by that I mean the ﬂow of your
work together that's everything from the details of identity and kind of who has
access to what to just like, where do we put this thing, and how do we referenced it?
That's one very practical bucket of things.
The second very practical bucket of things ends up being security and compliance.
How do you create a security and compliance boundary around those things than
ensures that you are secure always in all scenarios and compliance with the
regulations that matter for you in your industry of your ﬁeld of work. Those two areas
of integration are very expensive. And that's the place that we're investing. That's
what our platform is all about.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Last question I had was just on marketing with Teams. Your marketing strategy at the
enterprise level, but also I think you've recently gotten a little bit or maybe double
down or got more aggressive on the SMB side. Can you talk us -- walk us through
kind of the diﬀerent ways you're attracting customers?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
You bet. (Inaudible), I think I love working with them as he is very focused on, hey
when you ﬁnd an opportunity, let's double down to use your words and let's really
go after and Teams certainly popped up as one of those 12 months to 18 months
ago. So as we think about kind of broad air cover, we are investing in resources to do
advertising something we don't typically do for an app, when we started to do that,
we kick that oﬀ, in the NFL prior to the Super Bowl will continue to do that here in the
US and we'll expand out to other markets.
That's important because what we ﬁnd is this category still is just under-known and
we need to ﬁnd a way to make sure people understand what it is and what we can
do. Then as we think about attracting people, we've worked really hard on what we
call our on-ramps. We have a single place for people to go and sign in, so whether
you have a license already, and you don't know it or you don't have a license and
you just want to get going with the product, we have been working super hard on a
single place to go, if you go to -- Teams at microsoft.com you're sign in and then,
we're smart enough to know what to do with you.
If your company has a license for you, we put you right to your Teams experience
connected with everyone, if you don't, you will start up a new free tenant and that
way of kind of really working the friction out just week after week after week, the
process is really an important part of the new Microsoft, and here we are.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Great. I think we're out of time, Jared. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-12
