Good morning. Welcome. And thanks for joining us at Facebook's 2019 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders. I'm Dave Kling, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate
Secretary of Facebook and Chairman of this annual meeting, which I now call to
order.
First, let's run through today's agenda. We'll start with the business set forth in the
proxy statement. Following adjournment of the formal portion of the meeting, Mark
will come on stage and give a company update. Then we'll conclude with a Q&A
session.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you to please turn oﬀ all mobile devices and of
the rules of conduct for this session. Photos or recording of any kind is prohibited.
Also we intend to run an orderly meeting. Anyone who intends on disrupting theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 2 of 28meeting or repurposing it for their own agenda will be asked to leave. We value
engagement with our stockholders. But it's important that this engagement be
respectful in both directions. Thank you for your cooperation.
Let me start by introducing the members of our Board of Directors who are here
today: Mark Zuckerberg; Sheryl Sandberg; Sue Desmond-Hellmann; and Jeﬀ Zients;
Peggy Alford, who was nominated for election to our Board of Directors, is also in
attendance; and Marc Andreessen is joining via teleconference. In addition, we are
joined by Richard Jackson of Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public
accounting ﬁrm; and Kris Veaco, who will act as Inspector of Election for this meeting
and who will tabulate the results of the voting.
Turning now to the formal business. The proxy statement was properly mailed or
made available to all stockholders of record as of April 5, 2019. I have a list of
stockholders entitled to vote at this meeting, which is available for inspection by any
stockholder present and which list will be ﬁled with the records of the meeting. I'm
advised by the Inspector of Election that the holders of shares representing at least a
majority of the voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock voting
together as a single class are present or represented by proxy here today. And the
requisite quorum for each proposal is therefore present. Accordingly, this meeting is
authorized to transact the business set forth in the proxy statement.
We have 12 proposals to consider at this meeting, each of which is described in the
proxy. We'll discuss these proposals momentarily. First, however, I remind you that
voting today is by proxy and written ballot. If you've already sent in the proxy and do
not intend to change your vote, there is no need for you to cast a ballot today. Your
vote will be counted automatically without any further action on your part. Any
stockholder present who has not returned a proxy or who wishes to change their
vote may cast a ballot at this meeting. Does any stockholder wish to cast a ballot
today? If so please raise your hand and one of our volunteers will bring one to you.
Got a couple. Keep them up high.
All right. It is currently 11:05. And the polls are now open. You may vote at any time
during our discussion of the proposals on the agenda. Once you've ﬁlled out your
ballot, please raise your ballot in the air. And our volunteers will come and collect it.
I will now review the proposals to be voted on at this meeting.
The ﬁrst item of business is to elect our Board of Directors to serve at our next
annual meeting. The director nominees are: Peggy Alford, Marc Andreessen, Ken
Chenault, Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Sheryl Sandberg, Peter Thiel, Jeﬀ Zients and
Mark Zuckerberg. The qualiﬁcations of each nominee are set forth in the proxy
statement. No other director nominees have been properly submitted for election
pursuant to our bylaws or SEC rules, therefore, no other nominations may be
accepted at this time. The Board of Directors recommends a vote for the election of
each of the nominated directors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 3 of 28Abigail ShawThe second item of business is to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our
independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for the ﬁscal year ending December
31, 2019. The Board of Directors recommends a vote for this proposal.
The third item of business is to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on the
compensation program for our named executive oﬃcers. The Board of Directors
recommends a vote for this matter.
The fourth item of business is to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on the frequency
of our say-on-pay vote. The Board of Directors recommends a vote for the option of
a vote every three years with respect to say on pay.
Finally, we received 8 stockholder proposals that complied with the requirements of
our bylaws and SEC rules and are, therefore, eligible to be voted on at this meeting.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote against each of proposals 5 through 12.
The company's position on each proposal is as set forth in the proxy statement.
Accordingly, we will not be providing direct responses at this meeting. And any
questions should be held until the Q&A session at the end of the meeting.
Each stockholder proponent may now make a statement in support of their
proposal. I will call you up one by one to one of the microphones. Please limit your
statement to no more than 3 minutes and feel free to use either aisle.
First, for Proposal 5, a proposal regarding a change in stockholder voting, Abigail
Shaw will be speaking on behalf of NorthStar Asset Management. Ms. Shaw?
Good morning, fellow shareholders. My name is Abigail Shaw from NorthStar Asset
Management in Boston. I am here to represent Resolution #5, a good governance
proposal about equal voting rights.
Each year for the past six years, outside shareholders have supported this proposal
by the millions. We estimate that last year, over 80% of independent shareholders
voted yes on this proposal, therefore, telling Mr. Zuckerberg and the Board that they
are unhappy with the current arrangement. Shareholders continue to have no
recourse against the Board or management when scandals pull down shareholder
value. It is no secret that our company has struggled in the past two years due to a
seemingly endless stream of controversies and data breaches. These include
critiques of the company's likely role in proliferating fake news that aﬀected the 2016
U.S. election, stories that "laid bare Facebook's lax policies around the use and
sharing of user information" and risked losing users' trust in the platform and
multiple allegations that the company's communications app, WhatsApp. And even
the Facebook platform itself facilitated the spread of hate in places, such as
Myanmar and India, which led to violence and aided in genocide.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30

Page 4 of 28David Kling
Jonas KronAs shareholders, we do not like reading news stating that Facebook's stock "plunged
as much as 20% after months of scandal and criticism ﬁnally hit the company where
it hurts: Growth" as reported by Time in July 2018. These examples illustrate the risk
to a company when a Board is formed by the CEO to meet his needs and is primarily
composed of insiders or other aﬃliated people rather than truly independent
directors who would provide proper management and oversight to protect
shareholder investment.
Given the existing share structure, the current status of shareholder outrage against
the company and Board can have no corrective eﬀect. We are at a vital impasse for
our company. We are faced right now with a situation for which Facebook clearly
does not have the expertise to manage. Yet if these crucial governance proposals
fail, the only true recourse is for shareholders to vote with their feet by selling the
stock, damaging the value for remaining shareholders. Shareholders, we urge you to
vote for Proxy Item #5. Thank you.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Great. Thank you, Miss Shaw. Next for Proposal 6, a proposal regarding an
independent Chair. Jonas Kron will be speaking on behalf of Trillium Asset
Management.
{BIO 18790709 <GO>}
Good morning. Mr. Chairman, members of the Board, fellow shareholders, my name
is Jonas Kron. And I am here on behalf of Trillium Asset Management and the Park
Foundation to hereby move Item #6 seeking an independent Board Chair policy for
Facebook. This proposal has been co-ﬁled by the New York City Comptroller, the
treasurers of Illinois, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Oregon and multiples -- a
multitude of smaller and faith-based investors. It is core -- at its core, this shareholder
proposal is about the risk of concentrating too much power in one person, any
person. As proxy advisory ﬁrm Glass Lewis put it in its report supporting the
shareholder proposal, "vesting a single person with both executive and Board
leadership concentrates too much responsibility in a single person and inhibits
independent Board oversight of executives."
Facebook is incredibly powerful with wide-ranging and diﬃcult-to-understand, let
alone controlled social impacts. Over the last two years, we have watched with
growing dismay as that list of controversial and damaging social impacts grew very
long. And as rigorous reporting for the New York Times has shown us, having a
uniﬁed Chair and CEO severely limited the Board's ability to provide the company
the oversight it needed. It is these very facts about power and impact, responsibility
and accountability, which highlight why a uniﬁed Chair and CEO is a misguided idea.
It is unwise to have so much power concentrated in one person, which is why we
should look to the examples of other companies, such as Alphabet, Apple, Autodesk
and Microsoft, to name just a few, which all have independent Board Chairs.
We recognize that Facebook has a lead independent Director. And we acknowledge
that the Board has recently taken steps to articulate more clearly her powers andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30

David Almasiresponsibilities. However, these recent changes are fundamentally insuﬃcient to
meet the task at hand because a lead independent Director does not command the
same authority as an independent Board Chair. This question comes to shareholders
at a critical moment. Facebook is embarking on a privacy pivot, which leadership has
described as requiring a completely new platform.
At a time when there is little public trust in Facebook, it is navigating a regulatory
landscape that is changing quickly. It is at a time like this we need 2 diﬀerent people
in these 2 distinctly diﬀerent leadership positions. Let us not miss this opportunity to
make a simple yet powerful change that will go a long way towards creating a
successful future, not only for Facebook and its employees and its shareholders. But
for individuals, families and communities around the world. Thank you for your time
and attention and for your support for an independent Board Chair.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Next for Proposal 7, a proposal regarding majority voting for
directors. Abigail Shaw will be speaking on behalf of James McRitchie and Myra
Young.
This is Proposal #7, majority voting for directors, presented on behalf of James
McRitchie and Myra K. Young. This proposal, in conjunction with Proposal #5, seeks a
meaningful role for shareholders in director elections by changing from a plurality
voting system to a majority vote standard, where only Board-nominated candidates
are on the ballot.
Under our company's voting -- current voting system, a director can be elected if all
vote -- all shareholders oppose the Director but one shareholder votes for, even if by
mistake. 91% of S&P 500 companies have adopted majority voting for uncontested
elections. So far, during the 2019 season, this topic has been voted and results
reported 10 times, with an average vote of 98.5% voting for a majority vote standard.
BlackRock, the world's largest investor with $6.5 trillion in assets, includes the
following in their proxy voting guidelines, "Majority voting standards assist in
ensuring that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not
elected to serve as their representative." Our current Board is unaccountable to
unaﬃliated shareholders. Please vote for Proposals #5 and #7 to help bring
democracy to Facebook. Thank you.

Thank you. Next for Proposal 8, a proposal regarding a true diversity Board policy,
David Almasi will be speaking on behalf of the National Center for Public Policy
Research.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 6 of 28Hi. I'm David Almasi of the National Center for Public Policy Research. And I move
Proposal 8, which seeks to increase ideological diversity on the company's Board of
Directors.
Last year, a colleague and I met with someone from the law ﬁrm of Covington &
Burling, which was commissioned by Facebook to substantiate and analyze
allegations of bias against conservatives on Facebook. We reported that our own
Facebook page, traﬃc had plummeted dramatically over the last few years. The
investigator asked if our organization discusses climate change. It does? Aha. We
were informed that this aspect of our programming, post seeking to continue the
active debate about the science of climate, probably kept us from reaching more
people about all the issues addressed by the national center.
Also last year, Facebook's Senior Engineer, Brian Amerige, complained on an
internal message board that "We Have a Problem with Political Diversity." He
continued "we are a political monoculture that is intolerant of diﬀerent views. We
claim to welcome all perspectives but are quick to attack, often in mobs, anyone who
presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology." While
Amerige initially sought to work with management to promote political diversity, he
eventually left Facebook over disagreements about a free speech policy that he told
WIRED was "dangerous and impractical." One of Amerige's remaining legacies is an
internal online group called FB'ers for Political Diversity.
This group recently revealed that Facebook had created a list of so-called hate
agents, including black conservative Candace Owens and Lebanese American
activist Brigitte Gabriel. Facebook conﬁrmed the existence of this list to
breitbart.com. And it's believed that this list played an integral role in the purging of
several people from Facebook earlier this month. And I'll just throw in that Palmer
Luckey, the guy behind the Oculus technology that's advertised everywhere these
days as the next big thing, alleges he was ﬁred from Facebook because he made a
$10,000 donation to an anti-Hillary pack in 2016. Whether you're willing to admit
there's a bias at Facebook is beyond the point right now. In business, perception is
often reality.
Our proposal provides a tangible way for the company to (combat) its bias. When
the company takes overtly political positions on legal and policy issues, it would
beneﬁt from having voices on both sides of the aisle in that room. The company
would be less like -- much less likely to engage in bias against conservatives if it had
a few right-leaning folks in positions of power. If their voices were heard, it'd go a
long way towards ﬁxing both the actual bias and the perception of bias. From the
way your one known conservative Board member, Peter Thiel, is frequently viliﬁed
and called upon to be dismissed by the Left, it's clear that you needn't -- you need to
be intentional about seeking out and maintaining diversity on the Facebook Board
room. All this points to the necessity of implementing our proposal.
We believe that boards that incorporate diverse perspectives can think more
critically and oversee corporate managers more eﬀectively. Appointing a few
conservatives may help the company avoid groupthink and address biases. That's aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30

Thank you, Mr. Almasi. Next for Proposal 9, a proposal regarding a content
governance report, Natasha Lamb will be speaking on behalf of Arjuna Capital. Ms.
Lamb?
{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning. My name is Natasha Lamb. And I'm here to move
Proposal #9 on behalf of Arjuna Capital and co-ﬁler, The New York State Common
Retirement Fund. We're asking our company to report on content governance and,
speciﬁcally, how the mismanagement of Facebook's platforms is impacting human
rights and democracy. This is a critical inquiry, as such societal impacts carry
reputational, regulatory and ﬁnancial risks for the company and its investors. From
political subterfuge, fake news, violence, hate speech and sexual harassment, it is
clear that content that violates Facebook's own terms of service poses a risk to the
company's market value and brand. We've been raising these investor concerns at
the annual meeting for the last three years. But last year, the materiality of our
concerns was clear. We saw 2 $100 billion market value drops following the
Cambridge Analytica scandal and a subsequent earnings report reﬂecting
decreasing revenue growth and increasing costs to address content and privacy
concerns.
Since then, our company has been forced to play catch-up with increased
disclosures and internal compliance and enforcement strategies. And while the
reporting we've been seeking has certainly improved, Facebook's ability to assuage
investor concerns has not. Abuse continues. The New Zealand shooting is only the
most recent reminder. The United Nations says Facebook has played a determining
role fueling hate speech in Myanmar, where violence against the Rohingya bears the
hallmarks of genocide.
In Germany, researchers found a correlation between Facebook use and racist
violence. And in Libya, armed groups have used Facebook to hunt down opponents
and traﬃc weapons. But our concerns go beyond content governance to the top-
heavy governance structure underpinning Facebook -- Facebook's woes. Mr.
Zuckerberg's dominance over the company continues unchecked as the platform
and online content is weaponized to propagate election interference, violence, hate
speech, sexual harassment, discriminatory advertising and rampant privacy
violations.
At today's meeting, Facebook investors have an important choice to make, not just
to support Proposal #9 but whether to continue to throw our support behind
Zuckerberg's failing autocracy or support a more democratic, transparent and
accountable governance structure. Absent change, Mr. Zuckerberg will continue to

Great. Thank you. For Proposal 10, a proposal regarding median gender pay, Natasha
Lamb will, again, be speaking on behalf of Arjuna Capital.
{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Again, my name is Natasha Lamb. And I move Proposal #10 on
behalf of Arjuna Capital asking for a report on gender and racial pay equity. Arjuna
Capital ﬁrst engaged Facebook on pay equity in 2016. This is the fourth time this
proposal is going to a vote. Importantly, I would like to acknowledge that last
summer, our company took a critical ﬁrst step by publishing statistically adjusted
equal pay for equal work numbers, assessing the pay of men and women
performing similar jobs. Facebook reports women earn 100% of the compensation
received by men.
As a result, the company improved its grade from an F to a C in our annual investor
gender pay scorecard, yet the statistically adjusted number is only half the story. The
other half is median pay disclosure, which is the speciﬁc objective of this proposal.
Median pay is an unadjusted raw measure used by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, the OECD, to assess not only equal pay but equal
opportunity. Women who work full-time in the United States make $0.80 on the
dollar versus men on this basis. African-American women make $0.60 on the dollar.
And Latina women make $0.55 on the dollar.
Gaps in median pay is literally the deﬁnition of the gender pay gap. So while
adjusted equal pay gaps measure whether women and people of color are being
paid commensurate with their peers for the work they are doing today, median pay
gaps measure whether these groups are holding as many high-paying jobs within
companies, that is whether there is equal opportunity. Given the importance of this
measure, disclosure of median pay is now mandated in the United Kingdom.
For Facebook's U.K. operations, our company reported a 12% hourly median pay gap
and a 42% bonus median pay gap. Yet notably, our company has not published
median information for its global operations nor has our company published any
information on racial pay equity. Transparent disclosures that tell the whole story of
gender and racial pay equity are essential to investors as they create accountability
and drive change toward not only equal pay but equal opportunity. That change is in
service to a more diverse company and leadership and, therefore, better
performance. Thank you. So much for your time and support of Proposal #10.

Flaherty will be speaking on behalf of the National Legal and Policy Center.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 9 of 28Peter Flaherty{BIO 6905128 <GO>}
Good afternoon. I'm from the East Coast. I'm Peter Flaherty of the National Legal and
Policy Center. We sponsor the Corporate Integrity project. In response to this
proposal, promoting ideological diversity, the company claims a "diversity of ideas is
core to our business" but then goes on to cite initiatives that make the company less
diverse, not more, like the fact that the company publishes data on the ethnicity and
gender of its workforce. Is it not racist and sexist to attribute certain thoughts and
ideas to individuals based on their gender and race?
Do all African-Americans think alike? How about all women? Facebook huﬀs, "we do
not collect data on the political ideology of our employees." As if this is somehow
intrusive. I'd suggest that it's a lot less intrusive than quizzing employees about the
genetic makeup of their grandparents or what they do in their bedrooms,
information that Facebook is happy to collect and ballyhoo. Facebook also suggests
-- or also cites so-called biased training programs. As described by Carl Horowitz of
my staﬀ in a monograph titled The Authoritarian Roots of Corporate Diversity
Training Jane Elliott's Captive Eyes And Minds, these programs result in double
standards and make employees less likely to voice individual opinions.
It seems like Facebook makes a lot of mistakes. Whenever conservatives or
libertarians get censored by Facebook, it's a mistake. And the denials ﬂy that the
company is biased. But couldn't a lot of these mistakes be avoided if content
gatekeepers weren't practically all San Francisco liberals? As Marc Andreessen
candidly observed, "I think it is really hard for a lot of people in Silicon Valley to even
articulate the other side." What would be wrong with making a conscious eﬀort to
hire more people who are truly underrepresented at Facebook? Conservatives,
libertarians, practicing Catholics and Christians, observant Jews, pro-lifers,
Midwesterners, veterans, it's a pretty long list. And I'm not suggesting all these
people think alike.
For many Americans, maybe Facebook is so hostile to their values that they would
not want to work here. Well maybe Facebook should start doing something about it.
Surely, the company has interests. And it should speak out in defense of them. But if
Facebook wants to be "a platform for all ideas," why in the world does it insert itself
in the most controversial public policy issues of the day? Shouldn't the company be
carefully neutral on issues that have nothing to do with its core business? Take, for
example, Facebook's promotion of the so-called Equality Act. It would basically
abolish gender before the law. Although in the real world, you can't abolish gender
because it's a function of genetics and biology. There is no corner of our society that
it would not touch. Of course, without gender, there can be no feminism. There is no
Title IX, meaning the end of women's sports. But that's just the start of the
controversy.
What could be more seemingly calculated to alienate a signiﬁcant portion of
Facebook users, employees and shareholders? How will it play in the rest of the
world? Is Mark Zuckerberg's view that supporting the Equality Act must be done
because it is the right thing to do? What makes him the arbiter of what is right? Mr.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30

{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Thank you. Finally, for Proposal 12, a proposal regarding strategic alternatives, Ms.
Aryeh Cohen will be speaking on behalf of the proponents.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Aryeh Cohen, national organizer with Bend the
Arc. And I'm speaking on behalf of members -- of some of us. I'm presenting
Shareholder Proposal 12. Our proposal requests that the Board of Directors begin an
orderly process of retaining advisers for strategic alternatives to the current
corporate structure, including a breakup of Facebook, Inc. and an empowered
committee of independent directors to evaluate those alternatives in exercise of
their ﬁduciary responsibilities to maximize shareholder value.
We believe that Facebook is out of control. It is too large and too complex to be
managed eﬀectively. We are sick and tired of apologies as privacy and safety of our
families and communities is repeatedly violated, as hate is inﬂamed and as
democracy undermined by the myriad interconnected monopolies that comprise
Facebook, Inc. Facebook has enabled the spread of incendiary fake news and violent
extremist content that sways elections, triggers mass shootings and sparks genocide.
Facebook's shareholders have suﬀered the regulatory ﬁnes and actions as only the
beginning. And this continues to pile up. Shareholders need to make Facebook
more manageable and Facebook's management more accountable.
Our proposal is not prescriptive as to which strategic alternative should be pursued.
But Facebook founder Chris Hughes laid out a recommended strategic alternative in
his May 9 New York Times Op-Ed. Facebook would have a brief period to spin-oﬀ
Instagram and WhatsApp businesses. And the 3 would become distinct companies,
most likely publicly traded. Facebook's shareholders would initially hold stock in the
new companies and although Mark and other executives would probably be
required to divest their management shares. I think it's easy to understand that this
(isn't) a business imperative. But I want you to know why it's a moral imperative.
Last October, on a quiet morning, I got a text from a childhood friend that made no
sense at ﬁrst. She asked, "Are you okay?" She then went on to explain that there had
been a mass shooting at the Tree of Life, the synagogue by my home and that house
so much of my beloved Pittsburgh Jewish community. The next 48 hours were a
terrifying blur. And I frantically tried to track down friends and loved ones who may
have been at services that Saturday morning at the synagogue. As the hours wore
on, the horriﬁc details grew clear. A white nationalist had murdered 11 members ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 11 of 28my community as they prayed. He, like so many others, had been radicalized on
social media.
In the days that followed, my deep mourning gave way to a renewed fear. I have
been an outspoken community organizer for years. And as a Jewish woman ﬁghting
for social and economic justice, I knew that white nationalists, grotesquely
emboldened by this massacre, would begin targeting people like me for abuse and
worse.
I found that friends of mine were known to the shooter by name and were callously
mocked in this community and this community online had metastasized into a cell of
white nationalist terror. I was forced to ﬁnd and block hundreds of white nationalist
accounts on Facebook and Twitter to protect my safety. Facebook has played a huge
role in spreading the far-right hatred that devastated communities like mine. But I
refuse to allow this failure of due diligence to force me into hiding. I believe that
leadership means living a power-ﬁlled, principled public life. And it's not just
Pittsburgh.
In Charlottesville, a neo-Nazi who murdered Heather Heyer, injured -- and injured
dozens of protesters shared white supremacist memes on Facebook before the
attack. The Christchurch terrorist, who massacred 50 Muslims as they worshiped,
livestreamed his crimes on Facebook. 300,000 versions of this video made it
through Facebook's ﬁlters. And despite April's ban on white nationalist content, a
recent investigation found that hundreds of far-right pages with millions of followers
continue to operate openly, spreading the hatred that so often spills into fatal
violence.
Facebook itself has committed anti-Semitic and racist and sexist acts. Sheryl
Sandberg hired Republican-backed PR ﬁrm Deﬁners Public Aﬀairs to publicly target
George Soros after Soros rightfully criticized Facebook's business model. These
smears against Soros fed into venomous anti-Semitic conspiracies popular with the
far right and neo-Nazis. Facebook claims this incident is resolved. But it has failed to
demonstrate the cultural change that would stop such a scandal in the future.
Shareholders know that the Board of Directors is accountable for failing to rein in
management and allowing these terrible events to occur. We know that our
company's dual-class structure gives Mark Zuckerberg voting control. But regulators
and elected oﬃcials around the world are calling for Facebook to be regulated and
broken up because the company's shoddy record and its monopoly power. It's up to
the Board to move forward and study alternatives to the current conﬁguration that
will give shareholders the most value and will to manage the company in a way that
minimizes legal, regulatory and political risks and -- that have born in my community.
Lastly, I am a millennial. And while I call Pittsburgh my home and have for the last six
years, Facebook is in many ways my neighborhood. I grew up online. Under the
direction of Zuckerberg and Sandberg, my neighborhood, Facebook, has becomeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30

Great. Thank you for sharing your story. I just want to take a brief moment to

in too many places around the world, this past year, are -- were acts of pure evil. My
heart goes out to you and to everyone in the communities that were impacted by
these events. I'm sorry for these things that have happened. And we're -- in keeping
with that, we're committed to doing all we can to curb extremism and hate speech
online. These things don't have any place on our services. We don't allow people to
attack based on national origin, gender, religious aﬃliation. And we remove this
content as soon as we become aware of it. So we're aligned on these things.

Proposal 1, each of the 8 nominees has been elected to the Board of Directors.
I'd actually like to just pause really brieﬂy. We have a new director who is just
elected. So Peggy Alford has now joined our Board of Directors and so I'd just like to
acknowledge that. Welcome, Peggy.
Based on the preliminary results for Proposal 2, Ernst & Young has been approved as
our independent registered public accounting ﬁrm.
Based on the preliminary results for Proposal 3, the compensation program for our

{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
All right. Well thank you all for coming out, as always, the Annual Shareholder
Meeting. This has been a busier year than most. And I thought it would be useful for
me to give an update on how things are going and the priorities for the next year in
terms of what we want to execute on. I mean overall, our community and our
business continue to grow at a faster rate even though we're currently certainly at the
center of a number of really important social issues that we're working to address as
well. Our community now has more than 2.7 billion people around the world who
use one of our services, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger, at least once
a month; and more than 2.1 billion people who use one of our services daily. So
that's a lot of continued growth in the community.
The business continues to grow. In the last quarter, the business grew to -- I think it
was $15.1 billion of revenue, up about 26% year-over-year. So continuing to grow.
But our priorities for the next year are a little bit diﬀerent from what we've -- how
we've traditionally set up the goals and priorities for the company. Historically, we've
focused on things like just the growth of the community and amount that people are
using the services and the growth of the business. This year, we're focused on 4
primary objectives. The ﬁrst is to make -- continue making substantive progress on
the major social issues that our company is at the center of. That's everything from
some of the speech and content and safety issues that some of the folks just talked
about to, of course, preventing election interference, to making sure that we build a
stronger privacy program and deliver the controls that we need to do there. And
also making sure that people can take their data out of the service well and do
things around where they have the data portability that they should have. So we're
very focused on a lot of the big issues that are in front of us.
The second big priority is to deliver qualitatively new experiences in our products,
right? So a lot of what we do is we come in every day, we ﬁx bugs, we make things aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 14 of 28little bit faster, a little bit more secure, we try to rank News Feed a little bit better to
show you the content from the people and interests that you care about. And that's
all important work. But a lot of what we want to do over the next few years is not just
improve the products that you know from our services already but deliver
qualitatively new ones, new platforms, new types of experiences. And I'll talk about
what that could look like in a few minutes as well. The third priority is to continue the
momentum of how we're serving businesses. And especially small businesses
around the world.
The business momentum from the company is -- has been important. We're very
proud of the impact that we've had, where more than 90 million small businesses
around the world now have the opportunity to use marketing tools that previously
only big companies would have had access to. And the vast majority of them use our
services for free. We have 7 million active advertisers. So of the 90 million small
businesses who use our services, a vast majority of them are getting value from our
services without even having to pay us. And when we survey them, they tell us that
they're hiring people because of using our services. And that's just a very big
positive impact that we're proud of and we want to continue delivering on. And
that's the third priority.
Then the fourth priority is to be more transparent and be out there more, articulating
the case for what we're doing, why it's important in the world, why giving people a
voice is important, why giving small businesses powerful tools is important, why the
solutions and ways that we're addressing issues like giving people a voice but also
trying to keep people safe, why these solutions are the right places for a service like
us to be. And I think we need to do a better job of being out there and articulating
this in a number of more forums.
So those are the 4 big things that we're focused on. And that's not just how we're
operating the company, that's also how we're going to judge the performance and
how we do bonuses and how we basically decide whether the diﬀerent folks who are
leading the company and operating inside the company are doing a good job for
over the next year and beyond. I would imagine that this set of priorities will
continue for some time.
So I want to talk a little bit about a couple of speciﬁc areas in this. One is on the
speciﬁc social issues that we face, they are issues that I think society overall faces and
that address a lot of the Internet companies. But we're certainly at the center of a lot
of them. And while I'm proud of a lot of the progress that we've made to limit the
spread of harmful content on our services, one of the things that -- this is probably
the single set of issues that I've focused the most on over the last few years at our
company. And one of the things that's just become quite clear to me, as we've made
progress, is that while there's a lot that we need to do, if the rules for the Internet
were getting rewritten from scratch today, I don't think that most people would want
private companies to be making so many decisions by themselves about what
constitutes acceptable speech or what people are allowed to say around elections or
especially in diﬀerent countries around the world where we may operate but may
not even have a large physical presence.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 15 of 28So one of the conclusions that we've come to is that there needs to be an updated
regulatory framework around each of these issues. And it's not just one thing. It's on
content regulation online to limit the spread of harmful content, on elections and
basically governing in each country around the world what should be political
speech. I don't think that our company should be deciding that for democracies
around -- in the diﬀerent countries around the world. There should be more robust
democratic processes for determining the guard rails on that that we should follow.
And we have a voice in those debates. And we should basically make sure that
people understand what we've learned in our process to ﬁght these issues.
But at the end of the day, whether a certain type of speech is acceptable or not in
political discourse or a certain advertising should be allowed or not, we think should
be up to diﬀerent countries and a democratic process. And that's why I've been out
there advocating for this. So that will be a continued push. We're going to continue
doing the work that we need to. We certainly feel like we have a big responsibility.
But at the end of the day, just like some of the proposals and questions have alluded
to, we feel like the right solution for this over time is not for us to have the ultimate
authority as a company over all of these decisions either. We think that this would go
better if there were more robust democratic process around more of these things.
In terms of product direction and also discussing one of the most important civic and
social issues we face are on privacy. One of the big themes that we're going to be
pushing on for the next 5 to 10 years is building out this vision of a privacy-focused
social platform. And the way that I think about this is that in our lives, we have public
spaces, like our town squares or cities that we -- where we can interact with a lot of
people at once; and we have private spaces like our living rooms, where we typically
interact in more intimate ways with a few people at once. And just like those are the
types of settings that we have, the town square and the living room, in our physical
lives, I believe that in our digital lives, we need that, too. And for the last 15 years,
we've really focused on building up Facebook and Instagram to be the digital
equivalents of the town square, where now you can interact with a lot of people in all
the diﬀerent ways that you would want, not just staying in touch with friends but
meeting new people and communities that share your interests, starting businesses
organizing fundraisers for causes you care about, a lot of diﬀerent types of things
that you would want to do with a lot of people at once.
But when you think about the private tools that we have for communication, it's still
pretty much just texting today. And I just think that when we look back 5 or 10 years
from now, we're going to have private platforms, which are as rich and as developed
as the more open platforms in the digital town squares that we have today. So I think
that, that is both a very important product opportunity that people around the world
want a company like ours to deliver. And I think that this is really important for one of
the bigger social issues that we see, which is that privacy is increasingly important to
people and delivering the ability for people to have secure private interactions is
increasingly important in people's lives. And we see this that of all the diﬀerent ways
that people are communicating online, the 3 fastest-growing ways are: private
messaging, small groups and stories, where what you share, the data doesn't stick
around forever.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30

Page 16 of 28A - David Kling
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantSo this kind of ﬁts with the themes of what we're seeing. It ﬁts with the big social
issues that we want to address. And this is going to be the major thrust of our
product strategy for the next ﬁve years or maybe even beyond is delivering this
privacy-focused social platform to complement the work that we've already done:
building the digital town squares and the work that we're going to continue doing to
build that. So those are the big themes of what I'm thinking about. Those are the
priorities for the company and what you should expect to see me and the other
leaders focused on. And as always, thanks for coming out to the shareholder
meeting. And this is an important period for the company. We take the
responsibilities seriously. We're ﬁghting to do the right things every day.
And I think now we should take some more of your questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Mark. All Right. I'll now like to invite Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's
Chief Operating Oﬃcer; Dave Wehner, Facebook's CFO; and Nick Clegg,
Facebook's VP of Global Aﬀairs and Communications to join Mark to answer some of
your questions.
We'll now open the ﬂoor for questions. And we anticipate taking questions till
approximately 12:15. If you have a question, please line up behind one of the
microphones. If you can't get to a mic, please raise your hand. And we'll have
someone bring one to you.
So we can answer as many questions as possible from the stockholders. We request
that you ask only one question and limit your question to no more than 1 minute. As
stated in the rules of conduct, please don't address the meeting until you've been
recognized.
Now each year, we have I see a lot of the stockholders lining up already -- each year,
we have stockholders who stand in line and don't get to ask a question. So please
be considerate to the other stockholders. If you have a follow-up question, please
write it down and submit it to one of the volunteers that we have around the room.
And we'll follow up on that separately. But we want to try to hear from as many
people as we can. All right. We'll start.
You already spoke I think. So we'll start over on this side.

freely shared their hate speech. Women of color like myself keep getting banned.
This double standard aﬀects my business. Will you commit to working with civil
rights organizations and experts to ensure the training materials for content
moderators to eﬀectively understand racism, sexism, homophobia and other
discrimination in context and stop banning small business owners like me and focus
on them as you're saying that this is a priority for you?

Absolutely. Our policies are that we don't allow hate in any form and we should
allow small businesses. So we'll take a look at your account to see what's going on

Talking about ads. There's a school called Action Player Academy -- it's a charter
school. They wanted to -- their entrepreneur club wanted to have a showing of a
movie. No Safe Spaces, it's coming out soon from Dennis Prager and Adam Carolla.
And they were told that when they wanted to advertise on Facebook, that the school
would have to admit a political aﬃliation. It's a nonproﬁt school, it's not a political
school. But they have been banned from having ads on Facebook at the current time
because they're not willing to admit a political aﬃliation. I don't know what the policy
is on this. But I wanted to bring it to your attention. It was brought up in The
Hollywood Reporter I think in the last 48 hours.

Yes. Give me the information, we'll take a look.
Mr. Zuckerberg, this question is for you. A lot of the conversation and the comments
and the proposals this morning have been about power, voting power, holding the
Chair and CEO role. Can you respond directly to the question of whether you would
be willing to cede some of that power? And I know what we all know about power is
that once you have it, it's very diﬃcult to let it go. Then I think there's a beneﬁt to
sharing that leadership and I think what has become a leadership burden.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Sure. So I spoke about this in the intro comments. But I certainly believe that if
people were rewriting the rules for how they wanted the Internet to work and how
they wanted companies to address the issues that we face and other companies face
that we're certainly at the center of, I don't think that people overall would want
companies to have so much unilateral authority to make as many decisions over
speech and elections and privacy and a lot of things that are just incredibly
important to us as individuals and to our society overall. So I think the big question
that we need to answer is what is the right framework, whether it's regulation or
industry bodies that will enable us to solve the speciﬁc issues that we're grappling
with. And that's what I'm trying really hard to work through and solve. I think that
there are certain things that we internally have a big responsibility to get right. We're
investing a lot. We have very good teams and a lot of our best people working on
the systems around content and preventing election interference and strengthening
privacy and a lot of these things. But I do acknowledge that there are limits to what I
think a -- an individual company should be deciding on this.
And we're taking a multipronged approach on this. One is we're working with
government around the world, not just in the U.S. I was just in Paris meeting with
President Macron. We've had a deep engagement with their government, where
they have spent weeks at our company and diligently looking through our content
practices and basically how our systems work and coming up with their proposal for
a regulatory framework that they think will be eﬀective around this. And that's the
kind of engagement that we're looking to do in more places around the world
because we think that there should be additional rules around this. Frankly, I would
welcome that because I think us having to be in the position that we're in where we
make so many diﬃcult calls, I don't think is really the place that we or anyone else
wants us to be in. At the same time, we're also not waiting for regulation.
We're taking some steps ourselves like setting up an independent oversight board
for content reviews so that way when someone makes -- say, if we make a decision
that you disagree with. And there have been a few folks here today who have had
situations that they disagree with where we might have made a decision, they'll be
able to -- you can appeal the decision that's already today. But if you disagree with
the decision that we make even on appeal, you'll be able to also appeal it to this
independent body. And if they choose to look at your case, which they will for someFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30

Q - Michael G. Verdoneof the most complex and kind of precedential cases, then their decision is actually
going to be binding, right? So at that point, it doesn't matter what I think or what any
of our product or content teams think. That body is going to have the ultimate
(inaudible).
Now I think that it would be better if more of these decisions -- that independent
oversight body will be helpful because it will be independent. So it will give people
assurance that: a, all the decisions aren't being made in a centralized way by our
team or by me; b, that there's no doubt that the decisions are not being made for
any kind of business reason which, today, we don't make content decisions for
business reason. But I understand why people might be confused about that, right?
Because we're one company. And we're, on the one hand, serving people and
serving businesses and on the other hand, we're -- also need to be making a lot of
these decisions around content.
So having an independent organization will make it so that people can have
conﬁdence that this independent body is not making any of those decisions with any
of our business considerations in mind. So there are going to be more things like
that, that we need to do as well. I certainly agree with the general premise, that we
would like to build out more regulation and independent structures around us
because I understand the importance of the issues. And I just don't think that too
much of that can be on one company speciﬁcally, even though we have a big
responsibility to do a lot here as well. But I'm very focused on making sure we take
the right measures and not defaulting to things that seem like they might be easier
to do. But would not actually address the problems that we see.
But more directly, would you be willing to step down from your role as Chair and
cede your super voting shares? That's really my question.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participanttrain quarter. That's at least a decade out. What is Facebook going to do to bring
more housing for their employees here and take some of the pressure oﬀ the cities?
Yes. Thanks for the question. This is an area that we're really concerned about. We've
been doing a lot of work across a number of diﬀerent dimensions on it. You
mentioned looking at things long term like Dumbarton rail. But we're not waiting for
that. We're taking action today. We've been a cocreator of the Partnership for the
Bay's Future, which is a $500 million fund to help create over -- to help protect and
create over 175,000 units of housing. We've also helped start and create the catalyst
fund which is another $75 million initiative for housing as well. We're continuing to
look at how we think about our footprint and making sure that we diversify where we
are growing, not only jobs here in the Bay Area. But also elsewhere and also focusing
on the impact that speciﬁc decisions within the Bay Area have on things like
commute patterns. So putting more of our jobs in other locations rather than just in
Menlo Park. So we're trying to take this into account. We're trying to be good
partners and looking at places where we can have an impact on this big imbalance
issue that you point out which is real. So these are some of the things that we're
already doing. But we're going to continue to look at places where we can invest
more on this front because we think it's a critical issue for the communities in which
we operate.

Sure. So one of the products that we have right now is we ship this product portal in
the last year. And if you haven't checked it out, I really enjoy it and we've got a lot of
great feedback on it. But one of the important parts of it is being able to speak to it
and activate it through voice. And I imagine that there's going to be more products
that we build that are going to -- where voice is going to be an important part of the
user interface over the coming years. So we're working on a lot of diﬀerent things
around this. I don't know that we have anything speciﬁc to announce today in terms
of the eﬀorts. But I think you can look at where the product road map is likely to go
on this and see why this would be a very useful and an important way where people
are going to want to interact with more technology that way.

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantMy name is (Caroline Wyzinger). I'm a Facebook user who's been disproportionately
abused by Facebook because of your content moderation strategies. I was most
recently called what USA Today calls (Zipped) because of being banned multiple
times most recently because of my conversations about actor Liam Neeson and John
(inaudible) horriﬁc history of the KKK and black man being hunted in America. I was
also banned in a Sheryl Sandberg keynote (inaudible) . Literally, in the middle, as he
talked about Facebook actually ﬁxing these problems. I was able to talk to your
content policy team. And they talked about the same thing you talked about today
about going into communities and being transparent about your story as well as
hearing their stories as being abused by Facebook. So my question to you, Mr.
Zuckerberg, is are you willing to actually go into these communities and instead of
having conversations with academics, who are primarily white men, actually talking
to the people of color and the women who have been aﬀected by Facebook's
content policies?
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Sure. I mean I engage very directly in this. I mean I travel around a lot, talk to a lot of
diﬀerent folks. As Sheryl mentioned, we have not just an ad hoc policy of traveling
and talking to people. But a formal set of audits in work that we do to make sure that
we're getting the right input into the processes that we set up. And you can be
assured that I am directly engaged and I'm -- not only building the content, not only
building the systems for safety and security. But also a lot of the theme that's been
discussed today is setting up the right system of governance around what the
content policy should be as well. That's a very important focus for me.

further facial recognition technology. And along the way, in accomplishing this, we
have had a reduction in privacy. That's not your fault, this has been going on since

I'll take them both really quickly because there's 2. On the ﬁrst, we work with
publishers all around the world on the impact Facebook has on journalism. We
provide subscription services. We're a great distribution channel. Deﬁnitely,
journalism and media have had real challenges with the advent of the Internet that
has changed the business model pretty fundamentally. But our role is to make sure
that these are good partners. People get news from Facebook. And we remain a very
important source of traﬃc for journalists. And we have a lot of expertise for the -- in
the company. And I know the Board takes it seriously, too. On the second, I've
spoken out -- we've spoken out extensively. (inaudible) published an op-ed on our

I'm Janice Mathis with National Council of Negro Women. It's a pleasure to be here
this morning. Good to see you again, Ms. Sandberg. Thank you for coming to meet
with one of those marginalized groups of women of color. We represent 2.5 million
African-American women. 70% of them are homeowners, 73% have at least a college
education, 68% of them earn more than $50,000 a year.
My question is they are deeply concerned about, as you know from having met with
them, about election, security and voter protection and that sort of thing. But they're
willing to take responsibility for helping a new generation of Americans understand
how our government works. Many of them are teachers and social workers. And the
best protection against tyranny and the undermining democracy is for citizens to
understand how their government works. So my question for you today is would you
be willing to partner with us to help teach young folks? We know you're not teachers
but you've got a great platform for information. Help us teach young folks how the
government works so they can discern for themselves the diﬀerence between truth
and ﬁction.

huge role in community. But also in the history of getting to more equality and
particularly equal voice and equal votes. And so as we discussed that day, we're very
interested in combating voter suppressions and in voter education, voter
registration. And I think we're already in conversations about doing more together.
So I really appreciate your time and the question.
And I will just say if you're getting criticism from both sides? You've got Peter
Flaherty. You're probably about in the right place.

Let's go back to this side.
My name is (Eli) (inaudible) . My question is for Lead Independent Director, Dr.
Desmond-Hellmann. Could she be made available for a question, please?
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Let's just -- let's hear your question ﬁrst and make sure we have the appropriate
person to answer it.
Well my question is directly to her because she is the only person on the Board that
is empowered to call an executive session without Mark Zuckerberg, the Chair and
CEO. And so my question is directly to her about her ability and willingness to
exercise that power.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Sure. We can get a question for her, for Sue. We can get a microphone for her.
{BIO 1896963 <GO>}
So the responsibilities that I have as Lead Director...
No. I have a speciﬁc question...
{BIO 1896963 <GO>}
Do include that -- oh, you have a question around my ability to call it. Go ahead.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30

Q - Steven Renderos
A - Sheryl Kara SandbergWell -- so my speciﬁc question for you, you've been Lead Independent Director since
2015. You are now becoming chair of the Compensation and Governance
Committee, proxy advisory ﬁrm Glass Lewis recommended that investors withhold
support from you speciﬁcally around the way that you've been exercising or not
exercising your responsibilities as Lead Independent Director. In 2018, a majority of --
sorry, in 2017, a majority of shares not controlled by Mr. Zuckerberg voted for an
independent Chair a truly independent Chair on the Board of Facebook. And last
year, 35% of independent shareholders voted against Mr. Zuckerberg as Chair. You,
as Lead Independent Director, have the power to call. And it says on Page 13 of the
proxy, to call an executive session without Mr. Zuckerberg to consider the election of
somebody else as Chair. And my question is will you commit to holding such an
executive session?
{BIO 1896963 <GO>}
No. I do have the ability to call an executive committee of the Board of Directors as
outlined. And just one small correction, I've been Lead Director since 2015, on the
Board, since 2013. As is outlined in the proxy, the company and I and the Board of
Directors are comfortable with the current operating arrangement where Mark is
Chairman and CEO. We've outlined that the roles I have as Lead Director, which do
include the question you've asked me. And the answer is no. I don't have the
intention of calling such a meeting. And as outlined in the proxy, that's not the
direction we want to take the company or the Board.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Great. We'll come back to this side.
It's Steven Renderos with MediaJustice out here in Oakland, California. So since
2016, several civil rights organizations, including mine, have called on Facebook to
submit itself to an independent civil rights audit. The demand really came on the
heels of experiences by black users and users of color who had experienced
censorships, discrimination and even surveillance on the platform. Last year, after
several years of demanding, this Facebook ﬁnally agreed to an audit. And as much
as that decision was motivated in response to the concerns that we were bringing
up, it certainly had a lot to do with the new cycle surrounding Cambridge Analytica.
And we've been told that -- to expect some of the releases of that audit in the next
month or so or sometime this summer.
Sadly, I think the experience of the users of color on the platform haven't improved.
And whatever recommendations emerge from the audit will be diﬃcult to
implement without the leadership that centers civil rights. And so my question to you
all is will Facebook commit to hiring a civil rights position that's placed within the C-
Suite with real authority to implement the recommendations that emerge from this
audit? And I know as much as this has been a project for you, Sheryl, I would love to
also hear from Mark.

Q - Johnny Mathias
A - Mark Elliot ZuckerbergYes. So I'm going to answer this because we're running out of time. Mark is fully
supportive of this. And we obviously do -- everything we do together. We do have an
audit going on. They put out their ﬁrst report in December, the second one will come
in June. We have a C-Suite Chief Diversity Oﬃcer who's here. Maxine, you can wave.
And she has been instrumental in this work. And what you'll see in those audits is we
are releasing both their recommendations and the actions we've taken to adhere to
their recommendations. Our ﬁrst audit reports focused really on voter suppression
because that was a priority issue coming up to the elections. And the next one will
focus on content and other issues. And this is something that's incredibly important
to me and Mark and all of us is our platform being used -- not being used for hate
and being used to protect civil rights. We know this work is ongoing. We know the
people who are trying to go against people civil rights. We'll continue to ﬁnd new
ways to do that work. And so our commitment will be a very ongoing one, including
C-level staﬃng which we've done.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Great. All right, we'll take this side.
My name is Johnny Mathias. And I'm with Color Of Change, the largest online racial
justice force in the nation. And how we came to begin engaging with Facebook and
part of the process was that one of our members had their personal information
revealed in a private Facebook group of white supremacists for the actions she was
taking against confederate statues in Georgia. And people were showing up at her
house. And luckily, she was able to get in touch with us and we were able to get in
touch with you all. And the information eventually came down and the harassment
ended. And when I met her the other day for the ﬁrst time, four years later, she said
that our actions saved her life. And what I'm wondering is with the shift that you
indicated, Mr. Zuckerberg, to a more private Facebook when we've been working on
the last several years to deal with the very public Facebook through the audit
process and otherwise, how will the safety of black users and other users still be
maintained in a way and would that content come down in your new private vision of
Facebook?
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Yes. I mean the content policies, I don't think are diﬀerent across the diﬀerent apps
and services that we have. I think one of the areas that I've tried to be up-front that I
think is going to be quite challenging in this digital equivalent of a living room is
we're providing world-class, the strongest security and privacy protections that we
can, which means that we're committed to making our messaging products fully
intent-encrypted, which means that we're not -- even our services are not going to
see the content as it ﬂows through, which on the one hand, is extremely strong for
privacy and preventing hackers or governments or diﬀerent folks from being able to
access your information in ways that you might not want. But it does make it a little
bit harder for us to do the content moderation work that we do in some of the more
public spaces. And it doesn't eliminate all the tools, right?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-30

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - David KlingA lot of what we do is not just based on -- for kind of systemic issues like what you're
talking about are for things around election interference. The most important tools
are not necessarily just looking at the content, it's looking at clusters of activity and
being able to identify, hey, these 100 accounts or 200 accounts, they're not
behaving like real people, they look like bots or some kind of spoofed activity so you
can ﬁnd that even without looking at the content and then wipe that out from the
networks. And by the way, one of the advantages of the current setup that we have
as a company is that we can ﬁnd bad actors who are using Facebook or Instagram in
the more open settings. Then if their accounts are linked to accounts that are doing
diﬀerent things that we might not even be able to see in WhatsApp or our
messaging products, we'll be able to take down their accounts there as well.
So I mean some of the questions here have been talking about what is the
advantage of having these services together from a safety perspective, there
deﬁnitely is one. But this is just something that we're going to continue needing to
work on to make sure that we get the balance right and that we build the safety tools
that are as strong as they need to be in a fully encrypted space. It's not going to be
an easy problem. And some of the tools that we've had historically, we're not going
to have in the future. But we're committed to working on this and working with law
enforcement and governments and folks around the world to do as best as we can at
this.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
All right. We're almost out of time. We're going to take 2 more questions, one from
this side, one from this side.
My name is (Brandy Coentockster). I'm a resident of Baltimore, Maryland. In 2016, a
local resident (inaudible) broadcast on Facebook live her standoﬀ with Baltimore
County Police Department with a long history of police corruption. She ﬁlmed the
encounter because she feared for her life. At the request of police, Facebook cut her
livestream and she was gunned down in front of her 5-year-old Cody. My org in
addition to many people have demanded answers. And we've not gotten any. I'm
glad that we have an appeal process now. But obviously, you can't appeal death. I'm
wondering if in the next phase of the audit, you'd be willing to publicly clarify your
position on collaboration with law enforcement. Are you willing to notify users every
time law enforcement, including ICE and FBI, request data?
I think we can certainly be more open. If that's something we should be helpful in
our cooperation with law enforcement, Colin Stretch, General Counsel is conﬁrming
that. We try and be very open about all the interactions that we have with law
enforcement. As Mark has explained, that's evolving any way now as we move to the
fully encrypted messaging service. But without knowing precisely what date you're
after, I don't think I can give you a more precise answer than that.

A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg
A - David KlingAll right. Great. Last question over here. I know there's 2 more people. We don't
have enough time. I know there's 2 more people in line. If you do not get to ask your
question, please feel free to write it down and provide it to one of our volunteers or
e-mail it to investor@fb.com. And we'll work to get you an answer. And here's the last
question over here.
My name is (Rickson), I'm a Facebook shareholder and also a high-tech executive
here in the Valley. My question is actually about -- you talked about the forthcoming
products for Facebook in the next 5 or 10 years. And there's been reports about
Facebook developing their own cryptocurrency based on blockchain, probably call it
globalchain perhaps. I want to get your perspective on -- your thoughts on how you
see such cryptocurrency would operate in terms of the regulations? Are they going
to be similar to how ﬁnancial institutions are being regulated today, or do you see
that it will be a diﬀerent mechanism or platform that it will be done? And also maybe
you can share about some of the concepts about this platform of cryptocurrency,
whether this can be used not just for exchanging of monetization. But also maybe as
a way to build credit for people in the masses that may not have credit today.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Yes. So we have been public that we are working on an eﬀort here in thinking
through what we should do. We haven't gotten to the point yet where we've
announced what we're doing. We're still working through a bunch of important parts
of this. And hopefully, we'll have more to share on that soon. Overall though, this
connects to the privacy-focused social platform vision that I talked about in the intro
and that has been one of the themes today. Because part of the theory of -- in our
lives, we have in our town squares, in our living rooms and you want to -- we -- just
like we built out around Facebook and Instagram, a platform for a lot of diﬀerent
ways you'd want to interact with a lot of people.
We think that there needs to be a platform where people can interact with -- in all the
ways they'd want to privately as well. And certainly, payments and commerce
speciﬁcally are some of the most important and sensitive private interactions that we
have. And it -- one of the things that we're committed to thinking through how we
can do really well and deliver for the billions of people who use our products around
the world is how we can deliver not just messaging and small group communication
but other types of private interactions as well. And payments and commerce
certainly is going to be an important part of that as well. So that's kind of the frame
on how I think about this. And hopefully, we'll have more to share on that speciﬁc
project at some point in the
near future.
