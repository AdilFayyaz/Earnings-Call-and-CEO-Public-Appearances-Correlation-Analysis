Well. Good morning. Welcome to Starbucks' 27th Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Now you'll notice that we are in a diﬀerent venue today. And for good reason.
McCaw Hall provided a wonderful setting for our annual meetings for many years.
But it became clear that we needed more space. And so here we are today with
nearly 4,000 attendees right here in the WAMU Theater and many more joining us
live on the webcast. This is the largest annual shareholder meeting in the history of
Starbucks. Welcome.
Now today is also a very special day for me. It was 10 years ago at this annual
meeting that I oﬃcially joined the Board of Directors and my Starbucks journey
began. For the past decade, I have had the privilege to work side-by-side by -- with a
very talented and engaged board. And so I begin today by thanking and
recognizing my fellow directors, please stand.
Now we also have several of our international license partners who have traveled
great distances to be here with us today. These partners do so much to bring the
Starbucks brand to life in markets around the world. I want to thank you for being
here with us today.
Today is a celebration. It's a celebration of the 380,000 Starbucks partners around
the world who proudly wear the green apron. You are the ones that create that
special Starbucks Experience for the more than 100 million customers that we serve
each week in our stores. Starbucks partners, please stand up. Thank you for what you
do.
Now I also want to oﬀer a special welcome to our veterans, active-duty military and
military spouses who are here with us today. Please stand. We are so pleased to have
all of you here as we celebrate the past year while looking forward to the future.
Now we have a full program for you today. You'll hear from several of our senior
leaders, who will tell the story of how we have sharpened our focus on the most
important priorities for Starbucks and how we are executing against those priorities
in a disciplined manner. We will share the details of our ﬁnancial performance over
the past year and how we are creating value for all stakeholders, our partners, our
customers, communities and our shareholders. We will reinforce our commitment to
our mission and values, while at the same time boldly reimagining our future. We'll
take you on the journey from bean to cup and share some exciting new
announcements. We will also welcome a very special musical guest. And yes, we will
conduct the oﬃcial business of the annual meeting.
Now this has been a transformative year for Starbucks. It was a year of change that
has positioned the Starbucks coﬀee company for our next chapter of growth. It was
also a year in which we delivered record revenue. And we watched our stock price
climb to an all-time high. It was a year of progress that has ampliﬁed the importance
of playing the long game.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20

Page 3 of 33Think about it. Every morning, 5:00 a.m., the leadership team wakes up and they
study the daily sales report. Every month, we do a deeper dive on our business
performance. Each quarter, we publish our ﬁnancial results and we host an investor
call. Then, in real-time, even at this moment, the Starbucks stock is trading on
NASDAQ. Now all of these activities are important. But let's be real, these are all
short-term milestones that can lead to short-term thinking.
Companies that optimize for the short term often lose their way. These are the
companies that stumble and sometimes never recover. So today, we want to focus
on the long-term and how, together, we are building an enduring company.
A little Aged Sumatra, French press. Now let me start by putting this into context.
Starbucks was founded 48 years ago in 1971. And since then has built one of the
world's most admired and trusted brands. 1984, Starbucks introduced the new third
place experience with handcrafted beverages. 1987, we had 17 stores across Seattle,
Chicago and Vancouver, Canada. So 1992, Starbucks went public. 1996, we opened
our ﬁrst international market outside of North America in Japan. 2004, we opened
the ﬁrst Farmer Support Center in Costa Rica. And 2008, we embraced the mission
to inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup, one neighborhood at a
time.
Today, we are a 48-year-old company with over 30,000 stores, 380,000 Starbucks
partners serving over 100 million customers a week. We celebrate the history of
Starbucks with our eye on the future. Building an enduring company means that we
are focused on how we build the foundation for the next 50 years of Starbucks, how
we stay true to our core, reinvent our future and dream of the centennial anniversary
of Starbucks. Imagine, if you will, celebrating the 100th anniversary of Starbucks.
Now that is an enduring company.
So I want to pose a question. What does it take to build an enduring company?
Here's what I believe. I believe an enduring company unites partners through an
emotional connection to a powerful mission and demonstrates values through
action. I believe an enduring company is constantly evolving, taking on new
challenge, not afraid to take risks and always learning and adapting while staying
true to its mission. And I believe an enduring company handles adversity with grace
and success with humility, never losing its way.
Now it goes without saying that building an enduring company demands a long-
term view and a long-term commitment. Now two years ago, before this meeting,
Howard Schultz presented me this key. It is the key to the Pike Place store that he
carried in his pocket for decades. This key is a symbol. It's a symbol of the
responsibility that the leadership team and I have for the future of Starbucks.
We must always have the wisdom to know what to honor and preserve from the past
and the courage to boldly reimagine the future. Here's what it takes to build an
enduring company: Staying true to our mission and values; embracing new ideas
and innovating ways that are relevant to our customers, inspiring to our partners,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 33meaningful to our business; inspiring the believers, the people that believe
Starbucks has a purpose that goes beyond proﬁt, believers who approach the world
with an attitude of optimism and the constant pursuit of doing good.
We aspire for Starbucks to be one of these enduring companies. Why? Because our
mission is grounded in humanity and we have experienced ﬁrsthand how it touches
people's lives. Now I've seen ﬁrsthand how Starbucks touches the lives of coﬀee
farmers around the world.
I was visiting a ﬁfth generation family farm in Costa Rica. I stood amongst the coﬀee
trees on a beautiful hillside as a 7-year-old boy, his father and his grandfather shared
the story of their family farm. I listened as the grandfather explain how the Starbucks
C.A.F. E. Practices helped their family farm not only improve the yield of their crop.
But the quality of their coﬀee, how C.A.F. E. Practices ensured that they were paid
fairly for their coﬀee so that they could support their family. And as I listened to him
sharing their story, I watched this 7-year-old boy looking up at his father and his
grandfather with pride. An enduring company will be there when that 7-year-old boy
one day takes over that farm and cares for his family.
Now I've seen ﬁrsthand how Starbucks touches the lives of partners around the
world. Last year, I was hosting an open forum in Washington, D.C., 400 Starbucks
partners in a hotel meeting room. Partners can stand up and share a story, ask a
question, get feedback. When a young man in his early 20s stood up with the
microphone. He said, "Kevin, I've only been a Starbucks partner for nine months. A
year ago, I was homeless on the streets of Baltimore. My brother had just been
murdered. I had no family, I had no place to go. And I had no purpose in my life. But
a Starbucks store manager cared out enough to reach out to me, understand my
situation and give me an opportunity. And he said, I just want to say thank you."
Thank you. Starbucks touches people's lives in meaningful ways every day all over
the world.
Last year, I was sitting in a Starbucks, just observing, when a barista calls out, "I have
a beverage for Camden." And this young 3-year-old child jumps out of a chair, runs
as fast as he up to the handoﬀ claim, reaches as high as he possibly could to get his
beverage. And as he turned to me enjoying his beverage, he smiled. And his heart
was full of joy.
But so was mine. My heart was full of joy because that 3-year-old little boy is my
grandson. And he likes to go to Starbucks with his pop. Now building an enduring
company means we will be there for coﬀee farmers. We will be there for Starbucks
partners. We will be there in the future for our customers, the communities we serve.
And we have worked so hard this past year to transform our approach and create an
agenda we call Growth at Scale.
This agenda acknowledges that we are growing oﬀ a very large base with 30,000
stores around the world. The consumer behavior is changing rapidly, that we operate
in a dynamic economy and a dynamic geopolitical world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 33With this agenda, we are focusing on the most important priorities and then
executing with discipline. Growth at Scale has 3 building blocks, streamline, 3
strategic focus priorities and build the brand.
Now we've streamlined the company across 4 dimensions. Retail market alignment,
we've transitioned a number of markets around the world to our licensed partners.
Why? Because they'll grow that market faster than we would as a company-operated
model. We acquired 100% of our East China joint venture, making China 1 of our 2
targeted long-term growth markets.
Business simpliﬁcation. We put ourselves in the shoes of the barista, simplifying and
automating administrative tasks so that they can spend more time focused on the
customer. And the Global Coﬀee Alliance with NestlÃ© has unlocked new growth
opportunity by opening up international markets and bringing Starbucks coﬀee to
the Nespresso and Dolce Gusto platforms.
The ﬁnal dimension of streamline is to increase the velocity of innovation by
changing the way we work. We've done this by going from a long cycle innovation
model, which was too slow, to one that enables us to go from idea to action in 100
days and then rapidly learn and adapt, learn and adapt.
Today, we work in smaller cross-functional teams that collaborate on an idea and
leverage a new tryer lab, that provides rapid ideation, prototyping and action. And
ﬁnally, we are increasing the idea ﬂow from innovative start-ups and early-stage
companies from outside of Starbucks that are focused on retail tech and food tech.
So today, we are announcing the Valor Siren Venture Fund. We have partnered with
Valor Equity Partners, a successful investment ﬁrm that was an early investor in some
start-ups you might have heard of, Tesla, Uber, eatsa, SpaceX. Now this fund focuses
on innovators building businesses in areas that are relevant to Starbucks, retail tech
businesses like eatsa, food tech businesses like (inaudible), companies that
Starbucks may explore commercial relationships with and accelerate our innovation
agenda.
Our anchor investment of $100 million is the ﬁrst of its kind for Starbucks. Valor will
raise an additional $300 million from other investors to round out the fund. This
action reinforces our belief that innovative ideas are fuel for the future.
By streamlining the business, we're now focused on 3 priorities: Accelerating our
growth in China and the U.S., our 2 targeted long-term growth markets. These are
the 2 markets that will shape the future; we're expanding our global reach through
the Global Coﬀee Alliance with NestlÃ©; and we're increasing returns for
stakeholders, partners, customers, communities and our shareholders. These 3
priorities are built on a solid foundation, the Starbucks brand, a brand that has been
listed as one of Fortune's most admired brands for the past 17 years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 33Patrick J. GrismerNow we were recently ranked as the ﬁfth most admired in the world and the only
food and beverage brand in the top 10, a distinction we have held since the year
2012. The Starbucks brand is anchored in our mission and these fundamental
concepts: an elevated customer experience that we create in our stores for more
than 100 million customers a week; the romance of the world's ﬁnest arabica coﬀees,
handcrafted beverages tailored to each customer's personal preference; and the
actions that we take to demonstrate that our purpose goes far beyond the pursuit of
proﬁt. We believe in the pursuit of doing good.
Now throughout the day, you will hear from people who helped make this happen
because, together, we are building an enduring company. How does all this come
together? What is the common thread? Well it's actually a green thread. It's the
green thread that is woven in the fabric of our company by the men and women who
proudly wear the green apron. And it's an honor knowing that I can play a role in
building an enduring Starbucks and dream of the day when Starbucks celebrates our
centennial anniversary in the year 2071.
Together, we're on a mission. And here we go. Thank you.
Now it is my pleasure to introduce you to Pat Grismer, who joined Starbucks as our
Chief Financial Oﬃcer four months ago. Pat brings more than 25 years of experience
at the Disney Company, Yum! Brands and Hyatt. Pat has tremendous experience and
passion. And he has been core to helping us drive the growth agenda for the
business. He understands the consumer, he understands the food and beverage
industry. And he understands enduring companies. Please welcome Pat Grismer.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Behind me, you see a wonderful photo
of our newest beverage at Starbucks, the cloud macchiato. It also happens to be my
new favorite beverage.
For many years, my go-to beverage at Starbucks was a tall, skinny vanilla latte. You
might say it's a bit like me, tall, skinny. And some would say, a little vanilla, maybe.
But last month, I savored for the very ﬁrst time the cloud macchiato. And I was
hooked. How could something so indulgent tasting and with such rich texture be so
light? That's the magic of Starbucks. And what a privilege it is for me to be at
Starbucks to help write the next chapter of growth for one of the world's greatest
and most magical companies.
The past four months have been a time of tremendous learning for me. But I've been
fortunate to build my career with some outstanding global consumer-facing
companies. And this experience, coupled with the support of a world-class ﬁnance
team at Starbucks, has positioned me to help shape the company's growth agenda.
And so I'm thrilled to share with you today our growth outlook for Starbucks as well
as a recap of recent ﬁnancial results.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 33As context for our future growth expectations, ﬁscal 2018 provided emerging
evidence that the strategies we are implementing to sustain growth and build long-
term shareholder value are working. With improving business momentum in the last
quarter of the year, Starbucks grew revenues by 10% to a record $25 billion, fueled
by 7% growth in our global retail store base. However, to help build the enduring
brand that Kevin described, the company smartly invested a large portion of the
upside from U.S. tax reform in the middle of the P&L, in our partners and in
technology, pillars of our business and key points of competitive advantage to lay
the foundation for future growth. As a result, our operating margins contracted
signiﬁcantly, limiting our non-GAAP operating income growth to only 1% in ﬁscal
2018 in pursuit of long-term growth. But with the beneﬁt of a lower income tax rate
as well as substantial share repurchases fueled by a more optimal capital structure,
Starbucks drove non-GAAP EPS growth of 17% for the year.
Now to be fair, Starbucks' operating performance had been uneven for several
quarters. But new strategies to improve performance began to take hold in the back
half of ﬁscal 2018, delivering positive results in the Fourth Quarter, results that
sustained into ﬁscal 2019, giving us conﬁdence that we're taking the right steps to
drive more consistent performance and realize the full value of the Starbucks brand.
Now looking ahead, we envision a new phase of growth for the company, what we
call Growth at Scale, as Kevin mentioned. This acknowledges 3 things. Number one,
we remain a growth company. We are not a mature business whose best days are
behind us. With many geographies and channels still not fully penetrated, we are
continuing to grow rapidly. And we are investing behind that growth, demonstrating
our belief in the power of the brand and its untapped potential globally.
Number two, we've achieved a global scale that requires a diﬀerent approach to
sustaining a high rate of growth, an approach that requires more focus and more
discipline. And number three, while growing at a rapid pace, our rate of growth has
admittedly slowed, if only because of our larger base.
Ongoing non-GAAP EPS growth of at least 10% is the revised long-term guidance
that we unveiled at our biannual investor conference in December. In other words,
we believe that we can sustain double-digit EPS growth for years to come, excluding
non-core or nonrecurring items and events that may impact our reported results in
any particular year.
So how do we deliver ongoing EPS growth of at least 10%? Well it starts with revenue
growth of 7% to 9%, led by our retail business, which includes global comp growth
of 3% to 4% and net store growth of 6% to 7%. And although our channel
development business will be growing at a more modest rate in the near; to
medium-term, we expect that rate of growth will accelerate longer term as our
Global Coﬀee Alliance with NestlÃ© unlocks new territories. With a modest amount
of margin expansion, our total revenue growth of 7% to 9% translates into non-GAAP
operating income growth of 8% to 10%. And with at least a 2% net beneﬁt from
ongoing share repurchases, we have a clear path to non-GAAP EPS growth of at
least 10%. This is a rate of growth that we expect to sustain for the foreseeable future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 33But we're not concerned solely about growth as a means of creating shareholder
value, we're also very much focused on returns guided by a disciplined approach to
capital allocation. With a substantial operating cash ﬂow that we generate annually,
our #1 priority is to fuel the growth of our business investing in high-return
opportunities like new store development in the U.S. and China, with cash paybacks
of less than two years.
Second, we're committed to paying a meaningful dividend. We target an earnings
payout ratio of approximately 50%. And that has generated a dividend yield of
about 2% recently, which is quite competitive for a company with our growth proﬁle.
And ﬁnally, we allocate the balance of our cash ﬂow to ongoing share repurchases.
Now what I mean by ongoing is that this does not include cash from non-core
activities or nonrecurring events. At our targeted leverage ratio of 3x lease adjusted
EBITDA, we believe these ongoing share repurchases, net of incremental interest
expense, will sustain an annual EPS growth beneﬁt of about 2%.
In the last year, we committed to return $25 billion of shareholder capital over a 3-
year period, fueled by actions to streamline the company, monetize assets and
optimize our capital structure. At the beginning of this year, ﬁscal 2019, we initiated a
$5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, utilizing after-tax proceeds from the
Global Coﬀee Alliance. I'm pleased to announce today an additional accelerated
share repurchase plan of $2 billion, which we expect to complete by the end of June
2019. This puts us on a path to deliver over 80% of our $25 billion shareholder
capital return commitment by the end of this ﬁscal year.
So how have we performed thus far in 2019? We are very pleased with our overall
business momentum that we demonstrated in the First Quarter, with solid revenue
growth of 9% driven by net store growth of 7% over the past 12 months and global
comp growth of 4%. Despite continued margin compression largely due to the
investments that we made last year, non-GAAP EPS grew 15% versus prior year,
helped by discrete tax beneﬁts in the quarter. These results position us well to
deliver our ﬁscal year 2019 guidance, which remains unchanged from our last
update, revenue growth of 5% to 7%, admittedly lower than our ongoing model due
to the one-time diluted impact of the Global Coﬀee Alliance, a moderate decline in
operating margin given the investments we're making for long-term growth and
non-GAAP EPS growth of 11% to 13%, helped once again by income tax beneﬁts and
an above normal level of share repurchases for the year.
Integral to our Growth at Scale agenda are focus and discipline, continuing to
streamline our business to bring greater focus to what matters most and applying a
higher level of discipline in how we operate our business, including capital
allocation. You will hear more about this from Roz.
And what you will see is that we remain focused on growing in a sustainable way,
investing for the long term so that we build an enduring brand for our customers, for
our partners, for our communities and for our shareholders, not just this quarter, notFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20

{BIO 20642917 <GO>}
Good morning. Isn't that a beautiful, beautiful example of the loving care that
happens on farming and generations around the world. There's a lot of joy that
happens on farms. My only hope is that I could bring you there with me today. But let
me try.
My name is Michelle Burns. And I'm a 24-year Starbucks partner. And over the past
year, I've had the privilege to lead the Starbucks global coﬀee and tea team.
My Starbucks journey has not only deepened my love of our coﬀee and our brand.
But it has led me to both champion and protect the role of coﬀee at Starbucks.
Today, Starbucks' share of the global demand of coﬀee is 3%. That actually makes us
the fourth-largest roaster in the world. But because we only source the highest
quality specialty arabica coﬀee, our purchase are nearly half of the world's highest-
quality specialty arabica that we're providing to our customers every single day. But
we're doing more than just purchasing our coﬀee, we are leading. Working with
them through the supply chains in a responsible and sustainable way.
Now some of the most important work we do. And frankly, the most rewarding on
the global coﬀee team is that it's our job to make sure that the entire coﬀee
community not only endures. But thrives. And that's why our coﬀee buyers travel
over 30 countries sourcing our highest quality coﬀee beans from countries both
large and small. And the real key is establishing deep and long-term relationships
with coﬀee farmers and their communities.
So to put this in perspective, we source from over 380,000 farms from around the
world. And we impact many more. Now hopefully, many of you got a chance to rake
the parchment out on your way in today. That parchment actually comes from ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 33farm in Hacienda Alsacia. In 2013, an important step we took was to purchase our
own farm. Now you're probably wondering why would we own a farm, just one farm.
Well Hacienda Alsacia is also a Global Research and Development facility and a
working farm for Starbucks. So on that farm in partnership, our Head of Coﬀee
Research and Development, Carlos Mario Rodriguez. And his partner, our Farm
Manager, Victor Trejos, work hand in hand with a team of top agronomists to
advance the sustainability of coﬀee through their research.
To date, they are testing an incredible 400 new coﬀee varietals to resist disease and
improve the quality and yield for farmers in the world. So staying true to our
purpose, we share these learnings in an open source environment through our 8
additional Farmer Support Centers all around the world with farmers both in and
outside of our Starbucks supply chains.
Further, I have the privilege of leading a world-class team that creates the unique
blend and taste of Starbucks. And once our experience and passionate small team of
coﬀee developers create and perfect the perfect blend of -- or proﬁle of coﬀee, they
hand the beans over to an even smaller team of our master roasters. Average tenure
of our master roasters, just for a little perspective, over 20 years. And they roast our
signature ﬂavor proﬁles to perfection. All in all, this is a team of about a dozen
people in this company leading the way.
So as you can see, we are building an enduring company. And it's about knowing
who we are and what we're good at. And for us, coﬀee is at our core.
Now let me share a real quick story with you about a recent visit I took to Antigua. I
was hosted by Estuardo Falla and his 2 sons. Let me just tell you, those 2, they are
the future generations of coﬀee. They are curious, they are eager, they want to use
new data. And they want to bring to life the future and future of coﬀee.
So we've been fortunate to enjoy a deep Starbucks relationship for more than 20
years with Estuardo and his family. Some of our most beautiful, elegant coﬀees come
right from this region. Antigua is breathtaking and it's the perfect conditions. But
what was special on this trip, you see, is that Estuardo not only farms. But he shares
the knowledge of many small holder farmers. So he is a large farmer. But the trust
that he has established in his region, combined with our Starbucks donation of
disease-resistant trees, together, this is investing in the future.
And we're committed to building the future with farmers. We continue to look for the
highest quality coﬀee grown in the most sustainable way because we can't assume
that it's going to be there tomorrow. We're going to dedicate to building that future
for farmers to ensure the future of coﬀee and the economic livelihood of farmers is
protected for many generations to come. We are playing the long game.
Now I get to invite you all to join with me in what I think is one of the most special
and wonderful things that we do here at Starbucks. So coming into the room are
more than 150 of my fellow Starbucks partners who exemplify our deep passion andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20

Page 11 of 33our love for coﬀee. So whether it be in our stores or in our support centers, we
celebrate the journey of coﬀee from seed to cup through a ritual of a coﬀee tasting.
So these moments of human connection, they get our days going. They get the
ideas ﬂowing. And overall, they really create community.
So now, we're going to go through an exercise. We'll hand the coﬀee out to each of
you. While we do that, please pass them to the end of your row. Please don't start
drinking. We're going to wait until everyone has their coﬀee. This is the hardest thing
you all do today, I promise. And while we do that, we'd like to share with you images
of the few people in place where Starbucks is making a diﬀerence. It'll take 3 or 4
minutes. Please share.
(presentation)
All right. Does everyone have their cup? All right, very good. Today, we are tasting
Pike Place Roast. What makes this an incredibly special coﬀee is that this was our ﬁrst
designated as 100% ethically sourced and veriﬁed under C.A.F. E. Practices.
In 2008, Pike Place Roast demonstrated to the world that sustainably sourcing our
coﬀee is just as important as the quality. Now I'm going to invite you to do what we
do every day. Please smell the coﬀee. It's amazing to look at all of you out there
smelling. It's a wonderful, wonderful picture. This is the largest tasting I've ever done.
I love it. I can smell the aroma and the toasted nuts, can you? Slurp, please. A little
nutty, toasted almonds, smooth, balanced, rich ﬂavor to this coﬀee. This is a fantastic,
consistent coﬀee where no single characteristic dominates.
But why this has become the most popular coﬀee in the world is around that
consistency, that experience that you can get this in every store on your visits every
single day. But why else might we be drinking this coﬀee? Well as I mentioned, one
of the very important things that we're committed to as a company is sustainability.
Last year, Kevin announced as part of our mission to make coﬀee the world's ﬁrst
sustainable agriculture product that we would look at leveraging technology to
provide transparency in a meaningful and a relevant way.
We've always had full transparency to where our coﬀees come from at Starbucks. But
over the last year, we've made great progress exploring how we can trace our coﬀee
digitally. And we took the liberty to see what could be possible with this very Pike
Place Roast that you're enjoying. Let's hear more about this and take a look.
(presentation)
Pretty great? Yes. This is a tremendous milestone. Now you've seen a preview of
digital traceability and what's possible. Now we're still testing and learning. But
imagine tracing your favorite coﬀees in the near future. And we're not done. More to
come in how we work hand-in-hand with the farmers to empower them through
digital technology in this ever-changing environment. It's incredibly exciting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 12 of 33Rosalind Gates BrewerSo as we've been making progress on the sustainability of our coﬀee and the role
that digital traceability can play, our other teams have been working hard on the
sustainability of our packaging, like the cup that you all have in your hand today. So
let's learn more brieﬂy.
(presentation)
So there, you see some progress. It's fantastic to see it in real-time. Soon, Starbucks
customers and select global cities will be able to test -- help test diﬀerent cups that
are both recyclable and compostable in both municipalities and facilities. There's
more to come. And we look forward to choosing the cup technologies that the
NextGen Cup Challenge winners will deliver, made possible with the expertise and
support from the NextGen Consortium. Sustainable coﬀee served sustainably. This is
our great aspiration.
Let me close by saying this. We believe it is our responsibility to create a sustainable
future for farmers and the communities we serve around the world. And while we
stay true to our heritage, we'll continue to innovate and create a bright future for
generations and generations of futures to come. Thank you.

{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So that's what's happening every single
day in our stores in the third place all around the world, conversations over coﬀee.
You can walk into any Starbucks anywhere or read your social media feed because
that's what you'll ﬁnd. It validates the very exciting work that's underway to bring our
brand to life each and every day in every store.
So good morning, I'm Roz Brewer, I'm Chief Operating Oﬃcer and Group President
of the Americas. And I'm really happy to be here.
Thank you. So today, you'll see how Starbucks is quickly changing and adapting to
meet the customers' needs. But most importantly, you'll hear how our work is built
ahead on a foundation and on past heritage and our success. And it's helping us to
create an enduring company. And you heard Kevin say it, for decades to come.
So let's start with the progress we're making in some of our very important growth
areas. First, delivery. From Hong Kong, where we started this year, Starbucks now
oﬀers delivery in 12 countries, including China, Japan, the U.K. and Mexico. In the
U.S., Starbucks Delivers is now available in almost 1,600 stores and 7 major markets.
Soon, you'll see us here in Seattle and you'll see an expansion across the San
Francisco Bay Area.
Beverage innovation continues to be our most important focus. And we brought
Nitro to nearly half of our U.S. stores. And that's right on plan for us. And of course,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 13 of 33digital remains a key growth driver for us as well.
So over the last two years, we've grown our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program more
than 25%, a signiﬁcant achievement given that these members drive 40% of our
sales in the U.S. It's also why starting next month, we'll introduce enhancements to
give the program's 16 million members more ﬂexibility and choice when redeeming
stars.
And following Philadelphia, we commissioned a report on our eﬀorts to promote
civil rights, to promote equity and to promote diversity and inclusion. And that report
continues to inform our commitment of creating the culture of belonging for all.
I'm thrilled with the headway we've made and it's been driven by the passion and
the hard work of our partners. And we see it in markets all around the world. So last
month, I had the great fortune to travel to Japan with the team to celebrate our
opening of the Tokyo Roastery. I was really amazed by the pride of the partners
there, the enthusiasm. And that enthusiasm for being Starbucks' ﬁrst international
market that we entered some 23 years ago. And now it's home to our ﬁfth Roastery.
Opening day was the highest sales day ever, ever, in the history of the company. And
the store is continuing to attract thousands of people each week. And this, this is our
brand at its best.
We're also celebrating our 20th anniversary in China this year. We're opening 600
stores this year at a rate of 1 every 15 hours. That's amazing. And the opening of a
new store, the opening of a new store in Shenzhen last week marked our 30,000th,
30,000 Starbucks store around the world.
It truly is remarkable to think how we've grown from a single store in Seattle, where
customers scooped roasted beans for brewing at home to serve a city halfway
around the world with a full menu of craft beverages and delicious food. And now,
they can have their Starbucks delivered to them, too. So our performance in the
China region continues to be in line with expectations.
And beyond the ﬁnancials, Belinda and her team in China continue to elevate the
experience for our customers and for our partners. For the fourth year in a row,
Starbucks was named China's Best Employers. Congratulations to that team.
So growing our store base remains essential to our brand. And uplifting our existing
stores in new and inspiring ways will accelerate our next phase of growth. So it's
really hard to believe that 40 years ago, Howard ﬁrst articulated his vision for the
third place. He dreamed of our cafes as places where people could take respite.
They could take respite from the busy days of their lives, the pace of their lives, share
conversation with a friend and have a great cup of coﬀee. And that vision remains
today. And it remains today with Starbucks and our customers rapidly changing
along the way.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 14 of 33We now oﬀer a robust menu of beverages and food. We've evolved the way we work
through innovations, through new technology and equipment. Our customers' lives,
they are as busy as ever. They're more hectic. But they're also much more digital.
And we've introduced new channels, new channels and new formats to keep pace
with their evolving needs. We bring this together and it aﬃrms that the third place is
more vital than ever. This really inspires us to lead with a growth mindset. It inspires
us to reinvest in our partners and our customers and our company. And at the same
time, the vitality of our mission and our place in the world challenges us to connect
with customers on a much deeper level. We have to do this to ensure we always see
the humanity in every customer who walks through our doors.
So to build an enduring company requires thinking diﬀerently than yesterday. We
have to continue innovating. We have to reimagine. So this means evolving our
business around 3 attributes. First is convenience. Second, we have to think about
comfort. And third, it's about the connection. That's what customers expect when
they visit our stores.
So starting this summer, in New York City, we're embarking upon the next phase of
the third place, inspiring work that leads us into a modern view of our reality while
holding on to our heritage. And we won't let go of our deeply rooted mission.
Now I don't want anyone to walk away from here thinking that this our next new
furniture reset or a new renovation strategy. It's much more important than that.
Reimagining the third place is about listening to our customers, listening to our
customers so we can better position our business for now and for the future.
So we began studying several of our markets, our key markets last summer. Now we
love Austin, a lot of people love Austin, Texas. But this happens to be a really
important growth market for us. So it was our ﬁrst store there that was the evolution
of our customer insights work. So customers love our stores. First thing we learned.
They love what we do for them throughout the day. But you know what, they really
just want our stores to be places that make them feel good again. We got that
message. So we're making them brighter. We're making them fresher. We're making
them cleaner.
Then, in New Jersey, we found customers interact with us diﬀerently by daypart. So
we've evolved our Glen Ridge store to provide convenience in the morning and
comfort in the afternoon. And in big cities, it became even more important to help
customers along their daily routine. A pickup store answers one part of their day
eﬀortlessly, maybe even 2 parts of their day if they're in a hurry.
But even in busy places like New York, customers need comfort, too. That's why
stores like Park Row & Beekman, they're essential to us. And yet, no matter how
much we innovate, perhaps the most important insight is this, we must always,
always, always feel like Starbucks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 15 of 33Our relationship with our customers starts with the very moment that they think of us.
They connect with us through their barista and the quality of what's in the cup and
that cup that they take with them. Their third place is everywhere they're holding our
cup. No matter their journey, after leaving our stores, the feeling of comfort stays
with them.
And in an increasingly busy and on-demand world, that's the feeling that keeps this
third place growing. Now there's a lot of work going on behind-the-scenes to make
this happen and to ensure that our customers experience consistency no matter
what Starbucks they visit. Things like automating inventory practices, labor
scheduling and connecting our coﬀee equipment to the cloud. So maintenance can
be remotely managed. And the one common thread that binds this, that binds it all
together, is our store partners. They should feel empowered to make connections
that are personal, that are inspired and that are positive. And they should feel
supported in having fewer administrative tasks, greater clarity on what's important
and more time to make those meaningful connections.
But over the years, we've really complicated the work in our stores. We've
complicated the business. And we've complicated their jobs. So that's why we're
working very hard to reduce the time they spend on manual tasks and their hours
with how traﬃc ﬂows. So we're managing the traﬃc ﬂow in the store with the hours
that we spend in the store. We found partner engagement was at its highest just
after we closed our stores for antibias training last May.
So from there, we learned a lot. We continued our journey to bring unique
experiences to help our partners become better listeners, to be better learners and
to be better leaders. We started with training on topics like mindful decision-making,
engaging with empathy, courageous leadership and cultural perspectives.
Later this year, we're introducing a new curriculum developed in partnership with
Arizona State University faculty and outside diversity experts that focuses on
empathy, courage and inclusion. And in September, 12,000 store managers will
gather in Chicago for a leadership conference. And this is our ﬁrst in 10 years.
We know this will be a deﬁning moment for galvanizing our partners around our
mission and values. And together, we'll build on conversations about taking
ownership, about making best moments, making those best moments for our
customers. Taking ownership and making the best moments for our customers, it's at
our core. This is the path. This is the path that lies ahead. And we believe, we think,
that reimagining the third place and our companies will help us for decades to
come.
Now circling back to where I began, we're in the people business serving coﬀee. Our
success rises and it falls on human connection. And I want to close today with a story
about a woman who's showing us the way, a story about Annie. Annie is a partner of
one of our New York stores. She says to us her job is to spread joy every day, to try
not to judge and to act with compassion. Her leadership has inspired her partnersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20

{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
All right. Well now that you've heard from Pat, Michelle and Roz, there is one more
element of Starbucks I want to close with. We are believers who understand that the
pursuit of proﬁt is not in conﬂict with the pursuit of doing good. Doing good is what
inspires the believers and it's authentic to who we are. And it begins with our
commitment to creating opportunity, opportunity for all Starbucks partners.
Over the past three years, we have hired more than 22,000 veterans and military
spouses. They're making us a better company. And over the last three years, we have
hired over 75,000 young adults through our Opportunity Youth initiative. Today, we
celebrate the 12,000 Starbucks partners who are pursuing a free college degree
through the Starbucks College Achievement program.
We're not just creating opportunities, we are creating equal opportunities. Last year,
we announced that we had achieved 100% gender and race pay equity in the United
States. And today, I'm proud to share that Starbucks will maintain that standard in the
U.S. for the second straight year. We've also been hard at work, hard at work
expanding our pay equity to other markets. And I'm proud to share that we've
achieved gender pay equity, 100% gender pay equity in both Canada and China.
Sustainability. A year ago, we outlined our commitment to make coﬀee the ﬁrst
sustainable agricultural product and then serve that coﬀee in sustainable packaging.
Our agronomists continue to make progress in partnership with Conservation
International on sustainability of coﬀee. And this year, we donated -- now have
donated over 30 million disease-resistant coﬀee trees to farmers around the world.
We've invested $50 million in the Starbucks global farmer fund to help coﬀee
farmers operate their businesses. And today, you held cups that are both recyclable
and compostable. And we're not stopping there. We created strawless lids. And
we're moving quickly to eliminate plastic straws in our stores by the year 2020. We
cannot do this alone. We will continue to work with the industry and governments
around the world to address climate change. We are committed. And we will do our
part.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 17 of 33Now the pursuit of good means strengthening our communities. Throughout the
year, in 30,000 locations around the world, Starbucks partners are engaged in
meaningful and inspiring community service. Across the U.S., we launched our
FoodShare program in partnership with Feeding America. And over the past two
years, over 15 million Starbucks meals have been donated to neighbors in need. And
right here in Seattle, Starbucks worked with the community to enable 6 shelters
operated by Mary's Place to ensure that no child sleeps outside.
These are just a few of the examples of how we are a diﬀerent kind of company with
a diﬀerent mindset, a company with a purpose that goes far beyond proﬁt and is
grounded in our mission and our values.
There are so many inspiring stories. And while we have seen and heard some of
them today. So many of them go untold. Storytelling is an important part of the
Starbucks culture and it's part of our ritual.
So this year, we assembled a small, very talented, in-house creative team to begin to
capture stories that celebrate the human experience. Some of this work is original
content and some is created in partnership with others. I want to share a brief trailer
with you that gives you a sense of what this team and Starbucks productions is
working on. Let's take a look.
(presentation)
Well I hope throughout today, that you've seen that we are building an enduring
company. And we're doing that by staying true to the mission and values grounded
in the human experience. And as our tradition at the annual meeting, we have an
incredible musical guest. And I'm going to give -- we're going to give the stage crew
2 minutes, 2 or 3 minutes to set up. And I'll be back in just a moment to introduce
them to you. Thank you.
(Break)
All right. Well thanks, guys. I kind of wanted to help them out. But I think they got it
all set up. All right. Now at today's meeting, we have explored stories about the
human experience. And it is my pleasure to introduce a very special musical guest.
She's one of the best lyrical storytellers in music today, a woman who combines her
art with her personal mission. Her Looking Out Foundation ampliﬁes the impact of
music by empowering those without a voice. She is committed to use her music to
generate awareness around issues from community development, to human and civil
rights, to children in war zones and injustices in our world. She's a passionate
advocate for women, children and the incarcerated, among many others. And she's
the winner of 3 Grammy Awards just last month. It's a pleasure to introduce one of
Washington State's greatest treasures. Please welcome Brandi Carlile.

The ﬁrst order of business is the election of directors as nominated by the board. The
board recommends a vote for each of the nominees.
The second item of business is the approval of an advisory resolution on our
executive compensation. The board recommends a vote for this proposal.
The third item of business is the ratiﬁcation of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP
as the company's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for the current
ﬁscal year ending September 29, 2019. The board recommends a vote for this
proposal.
The fourth item of business is the shareholder proposal submitted by the National
Center for Public Policy Research regarding board diversity disclosure.
I would now like to recognize Mr. Justin Danhof, a representative of the National
Center for Public Policy Research. Out of respect for other shareholders in
attendance and to allow ample time for Q&A, we'd ask you, Mr. Danhof, to please
limit your comments to a period of 3 minutes.
Go ahead, sir.
Thank you. My name is Justin Danhof, General Counsel with the National Center for
Public Policy Research. And I rise to move Proposal 4, which seeks to increase the
ideological diversity within the company's Board of Directors.
Across corporate America, company after company is adopting board diversity
policies that are based on race and gender. These procedures have the stated goal
of reducing corporate groupthink. That's a good goal. But it does so by requiring
companies to interview an underrepresented minority and women for each open
board seat. This isn't what diversity is. This is actually racism and sexism. Not all
women think alike based on the fact that they're a woman. Similarly, not all Asian or
Latino or Black Americans think the same based on their respective skin colors.
Rather than promoting racism and sexism today, we urge the company to consider
viewpoint diversity, that is people that actually think diﬀerently when they make
board selections.
Through the years, especially under its former CEO, Mr. Schultz, Starbucks earned a
well-worn reputation for being a left of center company. Under Schultz, the company
staked leftist positions on immigration, religious liberty, climate and had a dicey
relationship with certain racial issues. Interestingly, now that he is considering aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 21 of 33Rachel A. Gonzalezpresidential run, Schultz has been met with scorn by the liberals whom he supported
and promoted for years since he is the B and the C word, that is a billionaire that
believes in capitalism.
Many of today's leftists in Washington, D.C. prefer socialism, in which government
takes control of industry and would regulate capitalism out of existence. Raise your
hand here if you want government-run coﬀee or Starbucks coﬀee. I think most
people would raise their hand for Starbucks coﬀee. And forget about the share
buybacks that the CFO talked about earlier. Those would be gone under the new
leftist wave in D.C., too. Yet, Starbucks' liberal convictions remain intact. And even if
the company disagrees with that assertion, in business, all too often, perception is
reality.
Our proposal oﬀers the company a concrete way to change its left-leaning public
persona. When the company engages and takes overtly political positions on legal
and policy issues, it would be a beneﬁt, not a harm to have voices from both sides of
the aisle in the room. That's what our proposal seeks to ensure.
We ﬁled this proposal with many diﬀerent companies across a broad spectrum of
industries. Most companies either adopted this proposal or at least engaged in
substantive dialogue with us on this issue. Starbucks did neither. This points to the
necessity of implementing our proposal. They don't even want to talk about true
diversity.
We believe that boards that incorporate diverse perspectives can think more
critically and oversee corporate managers more eﬀectively. Appointing a few
conservatives may help this company avoid groupthink. It's a win for investors and a
win for diversity. Please join me in voting yes on Proposal 4. Thank you for your time.
{BIO 17980657 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Danhof. A diverse and an inclusive environment is critical to
Starbucks' business. We seek diversity in its broadest sense. And that includes
diversity at the board level.
This year, our proxy statement set forth a matrix describing the skills and experience
and other diversity characteristics of our board members. We're proud to report that
40% of our board members are women. And half of our board members are
ethnically diverse. Our Board of Directors believes that the company already
addresses the disclosure requested by this proposal and that implementing this
proposal would not help our shareholders' understanding of our board diversity.
Accordingly and respectfully, for the reasons stated in our proxy statement, the
board recommends a vote against this proposal.
The last item of business is the shareholder proposal submitted by As You Sow on
behalf of several co-ﬁlers regarding a report on sustainable packaging. I would now

{BIO 20126898 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning. I am Bruce Herbert of Newground Social Investment here
in Seattle. And I do stand to represent As You Sow and Trillium Asset Management,
the proponents of Item #5, which seeks a report on sustainable packaging.
Concerns over plastic contamination of land and water are rising dramatically with
estimates of 16 billion pounds of plastics ending up in our oceans annually. This has
led some governments to entirely ban both plastic straws and plastic packaging. At
last year's AGM, 30% of shareholders representing about $50 billion in value voted
for this proposal. And it urged Starbucks to accomplish, really, 3 things: to ensure
that all cups get recycled, to ban plastic straws and then to emphasize a reuse --
emphasize a use of reusable cups or glasses. Now Starbucks has made good
progress on 2 of these 3 goals. For instance, in response to this very proposal last
year, it made a $10 million commitment to the NextGen Cup recyclability challenge,
which we saw some of today.
However, Starbucks has lost focus on the third of these 3 goals, the reusables goal. In
'08, Starbucks pledged to serve 25% of North American beverages in reusable cups
and to "reestablish glassware or ceramic mugs as our global standard." However,
Starbucks today serves only 1.4% of its beverages in reusable containers. So fulﬁlling
on these promises and goals is critical to reducing the company's growing use of
plastic cups, which ﬁnd their way directly into our waterways and oceans, where they
then degrade into tiny particles that harm aquatic life.
A second consideration for 2019 is that cup recycling goals apply only to North
America and parts of Western Europe. There are no eﬀorts to recycle cups or reduce
plastic where the company is expanding most, in China. Starbucks opens a brand-
new store, as we saw, every 15 hours in China. But without any recycling or plastic
reduction programs. In contrast, competitor McDonald's pulled ahead of Starbucks
in 2018 by making a bold commitment to recycle packaging in all of its locations
worldwide. This is a major issue in terms of environmental act and represents a major
lapse of leadership.
In closing, Starbucks needs to commit resources and to prioritize the use of reusable
containers, especially in Asian markets. A vote for this proposal will build the brand
and retain the loyalty of a very environmentally aware set of customers. The world's
leading proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, recommends support for
this proposal. Therefore, please obey ISS and vote for Proposal #5. Thank you very
much.

Page 23 of 33Thank you, Mr. Herbert. As we have done throughout our history, we do welcome
engagement with our shareholders and other stakeholders to help ensure our
leadership on sustainability. Conservation International, Ocean Conservancy, World
Wildlife Foundation, our 10,000 Green Apron partners and many others have helped
us to set ambitious goals, exceed them and evolve them over a period of time to
meet the threats to the environment generally and to climate change. Together,
we've done hard work to get to 99% sustainably and ethically sourced coﬀee, to be
the world's largest builder of LEED-certiﬁed stores and to commit to the elimination
of plastic straws, among other milestones. We're collaborating with industry to make
coﬀee the world's ﬁrst sustainable agricultural product.
For 18 consecutive years, we have publicly reported our challenges and our progress
on promoting sustainability. We know that the most pressing issues in sustainability
can't be solved by one company alone. And some of our prior solo eﬀorts were less
impactful than we had hoped. Still, we are committed to being transparent about our
eﬀorts. And we're committed to continued progress. We welcome opportunities to
learn. And we will continue to make big bets in sustainability and collaboration with
others. And that includes our customers, for whom we will continue to provide
sustainable solutions.
A year after declaring a 3-year ambition for a greener cup and traceable coﬀee, we
demonstrated signiﬁcant progress on both to date. We recognize our responsibility
to lead when it comes to sustainable packaging. The creation of a greener cup and
the elimination of plastic straws is only the beginning. We will welcome continued
collaboration with our stakeholders, with governments, with partners, with customers
and our shareholders. As Kevin said today, we cannot do this alone. But we will
continue to do our part.
Accordingly, with regards to the shareholder proposal on sustainable packaging, our
Board of Directors believes that the additional analysis and reporting requested by
this particular proposal would be duplicative and unnecessary. Respectfully, the

Rachel, thank you very much. Thank you. We have microphones here in the aisles. So
if we have questions, please form a queue. And we'll start right here. Yes, sir?
Thank you. My name is (John Nichols). I would like to address an issue concerning
the milk used in the lattes. I appreciate all your eﬀorts for sustainable sourcing of
coﬀee. I would like to ask if you could make a statement about the labor dispute
that's going on here in Washington. It's actually happening in many places around
the world where the farmworkers working with the cattle are being abused, suﬀering
from sexual and other harassment and even, in some cases, losing their lives
because of unsafe conditions. The Presbyterian Church recently, last month, sent you
a letter and stated in part, "We understand our company, Starbucks, has been
sourcing dairy products from farms where workers have faced unsafe working
conditions. These reports are deeply concerning to us as Presbyterians and as
investors. We are very concerned about these workers and also about the reputation
of Starbucks." In the face of these concerns, are you going to require Darigold to
work with the dairy workers and their representatives at the UFW, the United Farm
Workers, to guarantee the protection of the workers in that they should have safe
conditions?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thank you for your question. Roz, I'll let you take that.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
(John), thank you for that question. First of all, let me say to everybody here that we
have a very clear policy against human rights violations. And we take those
allegations very seriously. So we've engaged with both the UFW and Darigold
repeatedly. And we've done that to really understand the concerns that are involvedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantin this situation. And we want to underscore that the expectation that we have of our
suppliers is that they respond the way we would. And we ask that of all of our
business partners. So we'll continue to sit down with them and try and understand
the issues around what's happening in the situation. But we're not party to the
litigation that's happening here with Darigold and the farmworkers. But we'll
continue to strongly encourage that conversations happen. And we'll make sure that
this comes to a great understanding. So I also want to mention, too, we talked earlier
about our coﬀee practices. And we think that there's something to be learned and
transferred in what we have engaged with, with our coﬀee partners. And that could
be transferred in this very same topic. So John , I thank you for that question. And
we'll continue to work with Darigold.

My name is (Doug). At last year's Shareholder Meeting, Starbucks made the
buzzworthy announcement that a vegan food line was on the way for your U.S.
restaurants. And while you keep brewing up dairy-free drinks, which we appreciate,
the more than 30,000 people who have signed Compassion Over Killing's petition
with Jane Velez-Mitchell are still hungry for hearty vegan food. Meanwhile,
competitors are cashing in on the demand for plant-based foods with options like
vegan cream cheese at Einstein Bagels and vegan soup at Panera. So when will
Starbucks cater to all your customers with tasty vegan treats like a blueberry muﬃn,
protein bowl or chocolate chip cookie nationwide?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Thank you for that question. So we were here last year at this time. And we talked
about vegan products and how we would expand. We have expanded in alternative
milks, as you described. Our oatmeal breakfast, both the blueberry oatmeal and our
classic oatmeal are both vegan. And so we continue to explore this through our food
and beverage innovation. And you'll continue to see work come from us in that area.
Thank you for the question.

My name is (George). I'm here today with my mother. She's right over there. She
started working in the ﬁelds when she was nine years old. She worked to provide for
me the opportunities that she had never had. Working with Dairygold, my mother
experienced (weight) theft, sexual harassment and discrimination at work. When she
stood up for herself, she was ﬁred. She ﬁled a claim and she won. Most victims of
labor abuse are not strong enough in the face of power. Now she's working hard to
help other women still employed at Dairygold farms. Can you look me in the eye
and tell me you'll protect women working on dairy farms that supply your milk?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20

So thank you for your question. And I'm personally disturbed by your statements and
what happened with your mother. We've got a lot of conversations going on. And we
expect our partners and our suppliers to step up to the plate and operate like we
would and accept our values and our missions. And we'll continue to work with
Dairygold to help get through to a good solution here. And you'll see more work
from us in this area.

I'll just reinforce, we have a clear policy against human rights violations. And we will
stand up for that. Thank you. Thank you, (George). Over here.
My name is (Jim Hein) . First oﬀ, I'd like to tell you how much I appreciate your
shareholder user-friendly meeting. I attend a number of annual meetings throughout
the year. And clearly, this is one of the more user-friendly meetings. You need to be
complimented for that.

Thank you.
The question I have, you mentioned, Kevin, in your presentation the $100 million that
the ﬁrm has committed to the joint venture. I got this T-bone, would you put a little
bit more steak on that, please?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Yes. (Jim), thank you very much. Yes. The $100 million that we are investing, we are
investing in a venture fund, in partnership with Valor Equity Partners. And this fund
will be managed by Valor. They are investors. They know how to invest money in
early stage, growth-stage companies that are innovating in areas that are relevant to
Starbucks. So what Valor will do will take the $100 million that we invest. They're
going to raise another $300 million. So they should have roughly a $400 million
fund. And what happens then is they look for early stage, growth-stage companies
that are doing interesting things that Starbucks could embrace and take advantage
of. And what they do is they make us aware of those companies. And when they do,
we get an opportunity to look at those companies and decide, do we enter into
commercial relationship with them? For example, there's a company called
Elementum in Silicon Valley that has automated supply chain that was introduced to
us through our relationship with Valor. We now are using Elementum to help make
our supply chain more eﬃcient and through things with Valor Siren Venture Fund,
they will also invest in some of these companies. So it's a way for us to get ideasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20

Yes. My name is Larry Brown. I'm President of the Washington State Labor Council.
I'm here today to ask for your help in resolving a problem with our company's milk
supply here in our state. This problem arises at Dairygold, the farmers cooperative
whose member dairies supplies Starbucks milk. Starbucks associates its brand with
the values of social responsibility and responsible supply chain management.
Starbucks is a signatory to the United Nations Compact supporting workers' rights to
organize. In our opinion, Starbucks' silence in the face of these abuse is inconsistent
with the image it projects. So I'm here today to ask, will you meet with United Farm
Workers to hear their claims? And will you exercise our company's good oﬃces to
bring the parties together to seek resolution to these problems? Can you tell me
who within the company can we speak with to assist us in arranging this dialogue?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well ﬁrst of all, thank you for raising the issue again this morning. We've commented
on the policy. And what we will do we'd be glad to have Rachel Gonzalez, our
General Counsel, sit down and understand. I think, clearly, there's litigation going on
between diﬀerent parties in this matter that we're not a part of. But that said, we're
happy to sit down with the United Farm Workers and listen and understand. Thank
you. Yes, sir?
My name is (Dan Sutherland). I've been a shareholder since 2003. This is my ﬁrst
Annual Meeting. I am a coﬀee drinker. Concerning the constitution of the board, I
think it's very powerful. I think there's a lot of high-IQ talent there. It's most
impressive. I would like you to consider going forward the inclusion of someone
from the agricultural sciences on this board. Why would Starbucks, a company
whose focus is agricultural products, not want to have an agriculturalist on their
board, please?

Ieshia, welcome.
And I am with the Fight for $15 union. I'm here to support the Starbucks workers and
farmworkers. My question is, what are you going to do for the sexual harassment
that's going on in the stores and on safety hazard and the discrimination in the
stores?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Thanks for your question.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
So I'll take that question. So ﬁrst of all, thank you for joining us this morning. We've
learned a lot since our work that we've been doing since our May 29 training. But we
continue to respect the partners that work in our store and make sure that they are in
a safe environment. We're doing training and development to help understand how
the leaders in the store can handle those situations if and ever they're surfaced. And
so we'll continue to do that work in our stores to keep our partners safe as we
employ a large amount of partners across our stores. But the work is underway. It's
part of our training and development that we took on back since May 29 and every
month ever since.
I'm also a fast-food worker at McDonald's. And Starbucks workers are having the
same issues that we're having all over the world. So my question is, for my 2 boys at
home, are you going to get some type of sexual harassment training or any
hazardous training? Because we go to work. And we have to live in unstable
conditions at work. And my thing is if I'm not able to go home to my kids because
something failed or the equipment failed and I pass or something, I can't go home
to my boys. So...
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Yes. So one thing I will tell you is that the training and development that we do in our
stores, it's open source. And so I understand you work for another company. And it's
one of those things where we would love to partner with all other companies. And
everything we do is open and available for other people to use in terms of training
documents and the policies also are very open to anyone that wants to adopt.
But I'm also here to support the Starbucks workers in Chile, too. So I just want to
make sure that everything that you're saying that you're going to do, that you're
going to keep your word.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-20

Thank you for your question.
My name is (John). My wife and I are long-time shareholders. And we retired about a
year ago and have been volunteering at a soup kitchen regularly in San Francisco.
And I know that Starbucks has greatly expanded your menu of perishable food
items. And as your presentation indicated, you donate much of that to homeless
shelters and meal programs around the country. And I just want to indicate, I'm a
little conﬂicted between my commitment to volunteer at the soup kitchen and the
fact that I see a truck every morning when we volunteer there back up with a huge
amount of perishable items ranging from parfaits to pastry items. And is this
something that Starbucks is working to ﬁne-tune in your diﬀerent markets because it
is a little bit stunning to see literally an entire truck back up every single morning,
pulling oﬀ food items. It's great for the people we serve. But as a shareholder, I'm a
little conﬂicted by that.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well ﬁrst of all, thanks for the volunteer work you do and for sharing that topic. We
launched a food-sharing program that has been rolling out in diﬀerent markets
around the world in partnership with Feeding America. So if there's any food that's ﬁt
for consumption before it spoils, we donate that to Feeding America. And they have
the entire food safety program. They get that to the diﬀerent shelters and the
diﬀerent organizations that are in need of food. And so rest assured, we continue to
expand that program. And it's our intent to do that nationally. And so thank you.
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
I was just going to add one point to that, sir. In terms of the work that we're doing
with inventory management and some of the work that we're automating in our
stores, we are actually trying to solve that same equation because I understand that
your issues are also around food waste and how that impacts us ﬁnancially. But we're
doing a lot of work in inventory management to help. Thank you.

A - Kevin R. JohnsonWell I want to -- you to consider this as your partners and investors and workers at
the same time, maybe you can consider community participants in the partnership. I
think the whole community should be able to join in the expansion. You represent
the best bag of ideas in Americans today. We are all indebted to you because
workers should work. You pay them beneﬁts for their work and those picking the
beans, the poorest, blackest workers on earth who are living in the most hellish
conditions. Most browse the morning paper and look at the Internet and not
appreciate just where the coﬀee bean come from. And so we want to make certain
that you are as sensitive as we seek to be for that. Last point is that these teachers --
teachers teach school. And they remain Starbucks' workers to get the beneﬁts. And
that's a good deal. The last point has been raised several times before. Outside of
some workers, farmworkers who's -- they are workers, these workers deserve to be
heard. Now technically, if there is a court case, well, there is a moral case. If you
aﬃrm these workers' right to be treated humanely, it destroys the -- as soon as we
know it because the workers may lose in court, they will not lose morally. Since
you're the beneﬁciaries of their work, it seems to me that you cannot that easily
stand by and watch them lose in court. They could win if they had the money to win.
It suggests something to us that's eating at my soul how some of our youths are
living with 15 to 20 years sentences for sniﬃng drugs or cocaine and Manafort gets
three years. It conﬂicts with who we are. The reason I'm so glad you're getting into a
sustainable environment is because the world has destroyed -- beer people don't
drink coﬀee. The hurricanes keep coming ﬁercely and the tornadoes keep blowing.
People on the -- they'll -- and then they'll drink coﬀee. So you have some opportunity
to make the world better. So each would buy the product and drink it. And let me
express my thanks to you and to the company, really, for trying to make America as it
ought to be, not just as it once was. Thank you. So much.

Thank you very much. My name is Attorney and Former Representative, Jesse
Wineberry for Washington state. I am here representing, believe it or not, 395,938
people in the state, many of them here amongst the shareholders who signed an
initiative to bring back diversity, equity and inclusion to Washington state. Many of
you may know that 20 years ago, diversity and aﬃrmative action were banned in
Washington state by an initiative that was deceptively put on our ballot by a guy
named Tim Eyman. And so as a result of the passage of that law called I-200, our
state, for the last 20 years, has been one of only 8 states in America that has banned
aﬃrmative action for women and people of color. Initiative 1000 is now before the
people. The 395,000-plus people signed that initiative to put it on the ballot. The
Seattle Times just this morning unanimously endorsed Initiative 1000. And so my
question is to the Starbucks board, what is the appropriate channel to seek the
support of Starbucks for Initiative 1000 as other companies have given such as the
Seattle Times Company today?

Well ﬁrst of all, thank you for being here today. And thank you for your question.

Starbucks an approach and a model that continues to make improvements every
single year. And we also acknowledge we're not done. So I think -- and our focus is
on the business of Starbucks and taking care of our partners. So we'd be glad to take
