Presentation
(audio in progress) part 01. Welcome to the second software session. I'm really
happy to have Kirk Koenigsbauer here from Microsoft. Kirk, in a second, I'll let you
introduce yourself a little bit more. But I'm reading the ﬁrst harbor statement, which
I'll have my glasses out now. So before we begin, Microsoft may make some forward-
looking statements during this presentation and you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings
for the risk factors relating to their business and that is true whether you are here in
person or listening on the web. That's a much shorter one than we (inaudible)
actually by the way. I like that.
Kirk, great to have you here. Maybe start a little bit to introduce yourself and then
about your role at Microsoft a little bit.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Okay, yes, great. First, thanks for having me, I appreciate it. It's fun to be here. So I've
been at Microsoft, I guess, since early 1990s. So the reading glasses thing is relevant
to me as well. I had a bit of a sabbatical at Amazon.com for a few years. But I have
been at Microsoft since. And I currently run the Oﬃce product marketing and
product management group. So responsible for essentially our go-to-market
strategy, packaging, pricing, all those elements. I had a bunch of diﬀerent roles in
Oﬃce and have been around for a while. I ran the Oﬃce client engineering team for
about four years. So been in a bunch of diﬀerent parts of our business.
Questions And Answers
Okay. Since you've been at Amazon as well, you mentioned, I spent some time at the
(inaudible) Conference last week and 40,000 people that don't ﬁt into some
(inaudible) hotels. It was pretty amazing to see just from the cloud team (inaudible).
How do you guys at Microsoft think about the whole cloud opportunity? What it
does to kind of IT and whole IT landscape?

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 2 of 9A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerYes. Clearly, probably not surprised. Cloud is a huge (inaudible) for us. We think
about the Microsoft cloud as being really a platform for this cloud technology. It has
common identity and in terms of this Microsoft graph and a bunch of diﬀerent
components. Of course, there is workloads, like Oﬃce 365, like Azure, like Dynamics,
like our project Online service. It is the center of the company at this point in terms
of our push. Speaking speciﬁcally from an Oﬃce lens, we really have a very
optimistic view of what the future looks like in terms of our growth opportunities. I
think, right now, we feel like we've been in this phase essentially of I would call it
maybe phase 1 where we were in this -- we've been in this journey of moving our on-
prem base essentially to the cloud. And essentially, these are customers that we're
fans and using our technology and that's great and certainly not minimizing the
amount of hard work we have to go through. But that I feel like has been really the
phase 1 approach. I think we're entering a phase 2, which is the cloud oﬀers so much
opportunity, both to grow stock and grow ARPU by going after underserved
segments. There are segments that we couldn't go after before or our customers
even couldn't serve their own users, for example, in emerging markets or people
that work at desks all day, they have PCs and laptops, they are mobile-only types of
workers, software workers, retail employees, travel professionals. So there's many
diﬀerent kinds of folks that we think about it (inaudible), even small business. The
capital of that we require to reach those types of users for productivity and
collaboration in the past, it was just too expensive, too complicated. But in this cloud
and mobile world, we're able to reach into those new segments. And so, we think
there's quite a bit of opportunity ahead.
I mean, if you think about the issue for the legacy voice is always (inaudible) to make
that transition into the cloud and ﬁrst to realize there is something important and
then kind of take the right step, the altered stories are real success story in that
respect. Can you talk a little bit about the journey there and then you (inaudible) start
to kind of elaborate a little bit on that one like -- so where do you start thinking about
it like what you have to do to make it kind of happen and then you started to talk
about (inaudible).
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No. The journey has been a really interesting one and I remember our ﬁrst
customer, Energizer. Essentially, the conversation went along the lines of "Hey
Microsoft, we think you'll do a better job of running exchange and share points than
we will". And frankly, we want to put our eﬀort, our resources into diﬀerentiating our
own products and our own services and that sort of started this thing called the
BPOS, the business productivity online suite. And I think last quarter, we announced
what we feel are some -- we're really proud of the results, 85 million active users
commercially of the service, over 50 million people using our mobile apps on iOS
and on Android, license growth, usage growth of 40% year-over-year. So it's been
good. I think that it has seen a lot of work, kind of bunch of diﬀerent dimensions. I
mean, there's no question, it starts with product value. And so we recognized early
on that we had a well-established brand, a trusted brand with a notion around
collaboration productivity and so we thought, okay, great and got that. But we also
recognized, particularly in the social space, that hey, if we're going to really drive
hard, we're going to have to invest in the infrastructure to make it really enterpriseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 9A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Kirk Koenigsbauergrade. And so we focused early on with the customers, with regulators, with
lawmakers to really understand what it takes to build a truly hyper-scale, global,
compliant, secure infrastructure. And I think that's been a very, very important part of
our diﬀerentiation over the last years as companies have moved to the cloud. Every
customer I talk to wants to talk about digital transformation. They want to move with
a trusted partner. I think that's beneﬁted us immensely. And so, with that sort of the
humble beginning with the product, I do think there has been other work too that
has been really, really important. We had to reboot the GTM. It's one thing to go sell
licenses to customers. But then get deployed through IT or through partners, it's
diﬀerent in a service relationship. And so whether it's retooling our sales force,
whether it's building out the partner ecosystem to be able to sell our cloud products
and services our cloud products. Being a subscription company is diﬀerent. When
you just sell licenses and again you're sort of a bit of an arm's reach to the customer,
now we have to think about churn and renewal rates. And we have to think about like
for every single customer in their channel, what's the LTV, what's the CAC associated
with it, what's the most eﬃcient way to go to market. So we had to really think
diﬀerently about that piece. Then, I guess I just the last big chunk of the journey has
really been retooling our own product development process. And so gone are the
days of -- these sort of three-year long drawn out product cycles. We ship much
more rapidly, we've re-architected our products, we've changed our build systems,
our deployment systems. We literally have new roles that we didn't have four, ﬁve
years ago. And the eﬃciency that we have now and the agility, the feedback with the
customers, it's just so much more tight than it's ever been. And so, those are some of
things I guess I think about when I think about this journey.
Okay. The other thing like -- look, I'm a ﬁnancial analyst. So I apologize for the
questions in advance. If you think about it, we want to bring it down to numbers
again. If you think about the opportunity around oﬃce, can you talk a little bit
towards the number of seats that -- you mentioned how many seats you've ﬁlled
already around the subscription like. But what's the total opportunity for you and me
to diﬀerentiate between commercial and consumer a little bit?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Okay. Yes. No. I think we don't actually quote speciﬁcally for Oﬃce 365 numbers. We
do provide guidance typically every other quarter on monthly active users. I
mentioned the 85 million. We did grow licenses year-over-year 40%, as well as the
usage growth. So we feel really good about that. For me, this comes down to p x q
sort of a question in the sense of -- and I talk a little bit about some of the queue. We
do feel this continuing to (inaudible) opportunity. With Oﬃce 365, of course, there's
more on-prem to cloud that we feel like we have to go through. But we also feel like
again, opportunities in emerging market, opportunities in small business,
opportunities serving customers we've not served for the desk-oriented workers. We
think there's a big opportunity for us to expand our stock base. And so, we're bullish
about that. Work to (inaudible), we're bullish about it. Then on the pricing side. And
this is something we've been doing really since the beginning of the business
productivity Online Suite, the ﬁrst versions of Oﬃce 365. There is opportunity to
continue to drive mix shift. And so I think about it from the perspective of originally,
when we ﬁrst started, we feel a lot of (inaudible) essentially with exchange online,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 9A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerthat was the predominant workload that people were moving into. But now, we sell
the suite of Oﬃce 365. We have this plan called E1, which is the certain base level
collaboration capabilities in our web-based versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint.
We introduced this thing called E3, which was a really great mix shift for us. We really
recognize a lot of the ARPU beneﬁts in last 12 to 24 months, I would say. That product
includes some higher in value on the collaboration side, things like discovery
capabilities is just one small example or archiving. But there also we introduced the
Oﬃce Client in that package. And customers love the notion of getting the oﬃce
client in a per user model, one that will work across platforms, one that was always
up-to-date like their traditional cloud services and so turning Oﬃce Client into a
cloud service was a big driver in ARPU growth for us. Then, we have this new tier that
we introduced just about a year ago. We call it E5. And there's a bunch of diﬀerent
workloads there where we feel like with these advanced workloads, we can continue
to drive again a premium mix shift. And you ask for a number, I mean, all of our
premium skews, we're at about 60% mix right now. And so, it's really fantastic to see
that side of business doing well as opposed to just socket expansion.
If you think about diﬀerent skews and where the customers are sitting, is there like --
do you think it's going to be like you try to push everyone to E5 or it's going to be
E3 or is going to be one way you want to see most customers and E5 is going to be
like for some that you can have one more functionality, how do you think about that
(inaudible) SKUs?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. Well of course, when we do our account planning, every customer is a little
diﬀerent. But at a really high level from a general perspective, we start with E1 again
as a sort of real value-oriented highly competitive pricing, making sure that we feel
good about that oﬀer in the marketplace. Then, stepping up to E3, it has its
diﬀerentiation around the Oﬃce Clients and advance workloads and that sort of
super valuable. Right now, I would say E3 is s our hero SKU. It's the one we lead with
the most. And it's the one -- there was always a question, long-term vision around E5
most recently. And there we got these new advance workloads. And E5 really has a
value proposition on three core pieces. Those are the hottest, I would say, the one
that's getting the most amount of attention from customers right now, not
surprisingly, its security. We can't have a conversation and not talk about security and
whether its advance threat protection, the work we're doing with this thing called
customer lockbox against discovery. There's a bunch of really great capability there
that the customers are super interested in. Another work we have in E5 is around the
analytics. And so Power BI is sort of a hero product that we have there. Power BI Pro, I
should say. And then we also have this product called Mind Analytics, which really is
an interesting learning and artiﬁcial intelligence to create these personalized
productivity dashboards for customers. Then, there is a third workload around voice,
voice services. And so, we're literally moving PDX into the cloud, a full multi-tenant
oriented solution, great value proposition to customers from a cost and from a
productivity perspective. Then, there is PSTN services around PSTN conferencing
and PSTN calling services that can be added on to E5 as well. And so we feel really
good about what the value proposition looks like. And we'll keep pushing upwards
with the customer base.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-07

A - Kirk Koenigsbauer
A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerYes. And just switching gears a little bit on the consumer side, like how do you think
about the whole situation there?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. We haven't talked much about consumers. We feel really good about the
consumer business as well in the sense that we similarly how we feel like we've been
able to make this transition to the cloud and commercial, it's happening in consumer
as well. And so, we announced in the last quarter just over 24 million active paying
subscribers, which is great to see. There too, we have this notion of sort of a lower
cost value SKU that we push called Oﬃce 365 Personal. Then we step up customers
to a product we have called Oﬃce 365 Home, which you should think of providing
essentially sort of family right, a terabyte of storage for every single person of the
ﬁve in the family. And so, there is a bunch of step hearing that we do there as well.
And so, again, we feel like we're transitioning that base from buying oﬃce with the
PC device-oriented license to now being in the subscription business.
You mentioned earlier, the emerging markets as a big opportunity. How do you like
to think about it, like on the one hand, I think like repeat connectivity might not be
that good. So with that kind of more an oﬃce on-prem-type license. But you sound
like you're actually more excited about it from a --?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
I'm deﬁnitely excited about it in the sense that I think similarly to what has happened
in sort of develop markets, there is no question that the cost of connectivity is still
expensive in emerging markets. But increasingly, big cities, big companies, you can
expect it. And so more of a commercial statement I think I'm making here in terms of
where we see the opportunity. But there's a lot of big companies in these emerging
markets. There's huge populations (inaudible) two weeks ago. And you go to place
like the Philippines and you're just blown away by the opportunity that's there, large
population, GDP growing quite rapidly, 7% I think. And we see a bunch of
opportunities. Those customers are now thinking, okay, it isn't the question of I'm
going to move to cloud, it's when I am going to move to cloud. Well it may be
behind developed markets or what we see here in North America, generally
speaking, there is a lot of opportunity there. And so, we're quite bullish.
The other thing, I guess, I would mention is related to that is this notion of mobile-
only customers, particularly in emerging markets, we think it's interesting. And there,
I think, we have holistically due to a hole in our value proposition. But there's no
question that we're going to be there and we see it as opportunity.
Yes. Okay. Shifting here again a little bit. You mentioned earlier artiﬁcial intelligence.
It seems to me like the new password for every vendor. Last year, you had talkedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 9A - Kirk Koenigsbauer
A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerabout reimagining productivity, like how do you think about artiﬁcial intelligence?
How does that ﬁt into that overall scheme of reimagining how we work?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
You bet. Yes. It's a big focus for us and has been for several years. I think I actually
credit Dr. Chivu, who came to Microsoft, the ﬁrst (inaudible). And also was
responsible for the Oﬃce business (inaudible). He really pushed the Company
around many, many years ago. And we've beneﬁted from it, I think, on the Oﬃce
side in terms of not only insight. But for us, we think about artiﬁcial intelligence,
machine learning around much of intelligence features and their capability. And I
think there's a bunch of opportunity, whether it's helping you streamline your email
box, which is cluttered and overcrowded. And you can use machine learning for that,
whether it's helping you literally automate task and create content, like I talked about
some of the work that we're doing there, whether it's around discovery of people
and content and information, it can be a great (inaudible) sort of a vehicle. And so,
it's a very important part of our value proposition. I'll give you a few examples. We
just launched, a few months back, a feature in PowerPoint, (inaudible) PowerPoint
called PowerPoint Designer. And literally, it'll take your presentation and it will make
it beautiful, like having a designer and lighting the box. And it looks at your content
and just templates. It does things like cropping pictures for you. It's a (inaudible) sort
of blow you away sort of things, when you see it in action. I wish I could come on to
your guys there. But it's a really great one. On Word, we've literally revised the
grammar and spelling checking capability. But now, we're using machine learning
around natural language. So literally, how people like better changing from, say,
passive voice to active voice, being more inclusive. We will give these suggestions,
not only to be a better writer so that when people go read your stuﬀ, they can read it
more comprehensively. Excel, we're using artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning in
Excel. We're using, for example, sentiment analysis tools actually as a service that we
wired into Excel. There's some many examples. And by the way, it's not just end-user
pieces, too. Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence, we use it for our security
workloads as well. We believe it's a reason over threats and patterns and have a
much more rapid response to be able to update our capability to protect our
customers better. So there are many, many, -- it's a part of the life blood of what
Oﬃce 365 is.
Yes. The artiﬁcial writing will probably need extra (inaudible). Just talk a little bit
towards how Oﬃce and Oﬃce 365 kind of ﬁts in with kind of the other big areas,
Windows and Azure, like, how do you kind of interact with those two big parts of
(inaudible)?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No. Increasingly, it's just so important those customers are -- of course, there's
going to be heterogeneous environments. The customers (inaudible) and largely
angling towards back-oriented solutions. And there is a bunch of diﬀerent ways. For
example, we (inaudible) about, again, as I started the discussion (inaudible) about
the Microsoft cloud and so with Oﬃce 365, as an example, when a company goes
and deploys our collaboration productivity workloads, they're going to want toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 9A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Kirk Koenigsbauer
A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerprotect those workloads. And so (inaudible) services become a natural attachment to
that or maybe they want CRM capability and so great, they can attach to dynamics or
maybe they want project management, great, they can attach to project online. And
so, there's really a lot of opportunity to take a socket like Oﬃce 365 and then up-sell
other diﬀerent SaaS-type workloads and other workloads that we have. From an
infrastructure perspective, we're building on the Microsoft cloud. We use Azure
services in our products. The PowerPoint designer service I referenced, that's actually
a service that runs on Azure. I mentioned that Excel example. That's a service that
runs on Azure. And so, increasingly, we're able to leverage members of the platform
by infrastructure, the data centers and all that. Again, even with Windows, I
mentioned we're doing quite a bit of work with Oﬃce and Windows, whether it's ink,
whether it's better streamlining of notiﬁcations in the user experience. But even
security. So Windows has a capability called Windows Events Threat Protection. We
have one in exchange online also that's one of the parts of Azure. We take all that
signal together and by being able to reason across that, we can better protect
customers because we have so much input coming in from all these diﬀerent
services. So there's a lot of opportunity.
And you were sitting on Azure obviously like -- where is Azure on that global wallet?
Are you kind of global enough (inaudible)? Oﬃce is already a global product. Is
Azure (inaudible) to help you across the globe?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No. We think it's deﬁnitely -- we think -- we work very closely with the Azure
team to think about our overall data center footprint. And our CFO is, of course,
quite involved in those discussions as well, as you might expect. But we deﬁnitely
think of it as a signiﬁcant competitive advantage for us. I mean, just take Oﬃce 365
right now, we're in 150 markets worldwide. In the next few years, we'll do another 97
markets. We're localized in 44 diﬀerent languages. When we introduced Microsoft
team in early November, which is a new collaboration, sort of chat-based workspace,
Oﬃce 365. That was immediately available to preview right now. But it was
immediately available for millions and millions of customers for evaluation and trial
and to be able to experience it. So we deﬁnitely think of this as a great share and
opportunity with the Microsoft Cloud.
Okay, perfect. I know I only have three minutes. But I can't let you go without talking
about proﬁtability and margins. Gross margins, if you look at the scale that you have
in Oﬃce, you were like a very, very big SaaS company already. But the gross margin
seemed to yield a little bit lower than other guys in that space. Can you talk a little bit
about factors that we need to consider when we think about proﬁtability or gross
margins?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, no, sure. For productivity and collaboration space, (inaudible) all SaaS workloads
aren't the same. And so, there are some that are going to have this point solutions inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-12-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 9A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerthe marketplace, there are some solutions that maybe have a heavy storage
component, which are going to have obviously lower margins. There are suites like
ours. We're oﬀering a breadth of services. And so, I think it's a little bit tricky to
compare them. But I would say in the productivity and collaboration space, we
expect to be best-in-class. And we think we're actually doing relatively well. We
announced a good quarter of growth in our margins improvement overall at
Microsoft. And we expect that to continue. With Oﬃce, we talked a little bit about the
ARPU opportunity to continue to improve our margin. We think there's an
opportunity for sure. We also think there's an opportunity just with how we run the
business, the notion of being more eﬃcient as we do things like combine the same
back-ends for our consumer email service, which, of course, was based on Hotmail
originally, we have our exchange online service. Now, it's just (inaudible), it's just one
service. And so that's one of the ways re-architecting by bringing these back-ends
together, being much more eﬃcient than we can improve our margins. The data
center capability as we do go more globally -- grow more global, the capital
eﬃciency we get out of driving 85 million users to Oﬃce, that helps our margins
overall. So we expect to continue to see some growth. We think it'll be a little bit
lumpy quarter-to-quarter. But generally speaking, we expect to be best-in-class. And
we expect to improve over time.
And go one level down on OpEx, like if you -- I remember, when Amy started, she
kind of, at least to me, introduced a notion like you don't have your $100 budget for
the year and you spend it the next, you get a $105. It seems a lot more dynamic now.
Can you talk a little bit about how that's impacting, how you're working in the oﬃce
space?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, sure. There's no question that Amy and Satya, I think, has really taken so much of
the company in terms of changing the culture. This is one area of the culture they
have absolutely changed, I think, in a really positive way. We're much more agile
about how we think about budgeting and managing OpEx. Amy does, I think, a
great job of pushing all of us. We have -- when I say agile, I mean, we have a lot more
ﬂexibility and a real big push from them to reallocate as opposed to always asking
for more. And so, I'll give you an example of that, where we do a lot more example
that where we do digital market that we've ever done before, it's highly eﬃcient for
us, particularly in the small business and consumer space and also in enterprise to
some degree. But literally, we're probably running 10 to 13 campaigns a month. We
look at those, we look at the LTV, we look at the CAC, we see what the saturation
looks like and every month, we're sort of shifting dollars around to go invest in what
we think is going to deliver the highest value. And we don't have to be -- we're not
stock on these long-term budget cycles. And I think, she's done an incredible job
setting a great culture around reallocation, eﬃciency, discipline, that we hadn't
always had.
