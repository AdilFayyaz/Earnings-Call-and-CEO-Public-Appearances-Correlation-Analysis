Presentation
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay. I think we're good to go. Thank you all for coming. Big crowd. Nothing less
expected from Nvidia. I'm Toshiya Hari. I cover the semiconductor and semi-cap
equipment sector at Goldman Sachs. Very pleased, very honored to have Colette
Kress, SVP and CFO from NVIDIA with us today. I will kick oﬀ with some questions,
but certainly happy to take questions from you also. To the extent you have
questions please, please raise your hand.
Colette, ﬁrst of all, thank you for taking the time.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you for having us. Appreciate it.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
I deﬁnitely want to spend more time on longer term strategic questions, but quite a
few topical things going on in the world today. So I was hoping to get an update
from you on the near term. Obviously, you're going through an inventory correction
in the gaming business. You've got a weaker macro backdrop which is for
everybody. And then more recently announcements around export restrictions on
high-end data center GPUs. So you can spend 40 minutes on that. Hopefully you
don't, but if you can kick us oﬀ with some opening remarks that will be helpful.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure, let me just start oﬀ with, we had ﬁnished our Q2 results. We did pre-announce
them and then provided an outlook for our Q3. Our Q3 outlook of $5.9 billion,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Q - Toshiya Haricorrect, has in there. Can you -- can you hear? Can you hear me? All right, I'll try and
speak louder. Is this better? Okay. Will try.
We provided guidance for our Q3 quarter that we provided $5.9 billion. Within that
would be a situation that we will do an inventory correction in our gaming, but also
our Pro Visualization business, both our desktops and notebooks. That means that
we will be under selling into the market as we work through that inventory that is in
the channel. That will be a sequential decrease from Q2 to Q3 for those businesses,
But we had expected a growth in our automotive business, similar to what we had in
Q2, moving to Q3, as we're continuing to ramp our architecture on many of our
passenger cars and then future robotaxi as well as AI cars as well.
Our data centers business, solid. We expect also to have solid results. However, we
have a new risk that we articulated just shortly after we gave the guidance.
Regarding the US government had put an additional restriction in terms of what we
can sell of our A100 into China. That risk is about $400 million. We are working right
now with our China customers to provide alternative products versus the A100, and
we expect that to be our best path to assist them, if they also want the license, we
can do that, but right now, we're working with them on alternative products.
So at this time, though, we still have that risk. We're going to see how the quarter
develops. We have still been processing, working with the US government on that
restriction, and we think we now have a path for them. So those are the things in the
most nearest term that we're working on in Q3.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
So, Colette, is it fair to say that what's incremental since you gave guidance, the
export restriction, everything else in the business is more or less tracking. I don't
want to put words in your mouth, but.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That is correct. I don't have any additional update at this time to the rest of the
business. The two days after giving guidance for the exports issue, but we hopefully
will be able to work that through in the next couple of quarters as well.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
I deﬁnitely want to come back to that, but had a couple of questions on the gaming
side, if that's okay. Given what you guided for the October quarter, assuming you
come in, in-line with your guidance for gaming, implicit guidance, anyways. You will
have declined around 60% in revenue and gaming peak to trough, which is a
sharper decline that we saw back in 2019.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Q - Toshiya Hari
A - Colette Kress
Q - Toshiya HariSo, the hope is, you've sort of de-risked your gaming business. But on your call, you
talked about sell-through for the July and October quarters collectively being about
$5 billion. I'm curious, how did you solve for that $5 billion estimate? Has your ability
in tracking sell through a real demand improved over the past couple of years? And
most importantly, based on what you know today, at what point do you expect to be
selling in line with sell-through in gaming?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So let me for the full audience, give them an understanding of what we provided
when we talked about a normalized amount on our call. We talked about a
normalized amount looking at our sell-through or estimated sell-through that we see
for a couple of quarters. We used our Q2 estimate that we had at the end of that
quarter of an actual and we made a thought in terms of what we're seeing for Q3
and put those together to come up with $5 billion of end demand. End demand
meaning, what is our end customers buying from the channel. Those numbers are
little bit in Q2 with a small rise as we move sequentially into Q3, muted overall
growth, muted as we get ready for that, back to school, but also for the holiday.
That I felt was an important understanding that, yes, demand for GPUs is still strong.
There was just too much inventory in the channel. We're going to be watching that
carefully this quarter and further, but that was our overall goal providing that
demand and helping us understand that the GPUs from a pricing side have reached
about the normal levels that we had hoped.
We took action immediately to also reprice price programs to move this inventory
through. We believe this is probably going to take us a couple of quarters to get
through. Maybe at the end of Q4, we'll be back at that normalization, will start that
positioning going forward where selling would be stronger than the sell-through.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
So October and January is still muted sell and perhaps below sell-through, and then
April, maybe you're kind of back at that sell-through.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeas. We hope so. We'll take a look at it. We don't have any guidance at this time for
Q4 and further, but we're watching it carefully.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay. And then on the pricing dynamics within gaming, we got a bunch of questions
from investors about your ability to grow ASPs and price and Gen to Gen which has
been the normal course of business for you over the past, I don't know how many
years.
As we think about this rumored intro of your new product line over the next, call it 12
months, how should we think about, again, your ability to grow pricing? I guess the
bear thesis that we hear is, your ASPs were or mix rather, was inﬂated due to cryptoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Q - Toshiya Hariover the past two years. That was one time and perhaps next cycle you're in a
disadvantageous position, if you will, but how should we think about that dynamic?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So it's got some background of history and what we've seen. You're correct that over
history, we have had the tendency, not only for new gamers coming in or those
repurchasing to upgrade, both an increase in our units that we sell, but also in terms
of our average ASPs. New gamers come in, don't always buy the entry level. They
may by in the middle of the stock. Those returning will also purchase higher end
performance for the types of games that they're doing.
We have seen over a period of maybe ﬁve years when we've been growing revenue
more than 20%, you can almost see an equal split between the units and the ASPs.
Now, over those last part through the pandemic, since the onset of the pandemic,
we have grown revenue about 70% in our gaming business. In this case, ASPs were a
little bit more inﬂuencing versus being in us put absolutely also seen unit growth
over that time.
Now we haven't announced any details of a new architecture. We have announced
that we are getting ready for architecture announcements. So stay tuned for more of
that, but we'll probably see things start to return to normal or have maybe a little bit
less of ASPs in the short term as we transition just based on that peak that we had
seen during the pandemic.
Over the long term, we still feel that there is -- that opportunity for ASPs to be a
meaningful amount of our growth in gaming as well.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
And Colette, on your last point, as you think about your through cycle long-term
growth rate in gaming, I think you provided a very helpful metrics at Analyst Days in
the past, but how are you thinking about that volume versus pricing kind of dynamic,
again, for the gaming business, speciﬁcally?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We always say the gaming industry looking for both new opportunities for the use of
graphics, but also in terms of reaching more and more gamers. So units are still
going to be an important part. As we think about ASPs, we will continue to come out
with a mix of our stock and we'll probably see some early on also purchasing stock
for the great performance that we gave. We just don't have any details right now in
terms of how that will be in that cross-border.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Got it. The other question I guess the last question on gaming that I often get is on
crypto and the exposure there, not just for you, but as a broader industry and I
realize you don't have much visibility in determining or engaging how big or how
small that part of the business is. But if you had to provide your sort of best guess orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 14A - Colette Kress
Q - Toshiya Hari
A - Colette Kressbest estimate on how signiﬁcant that market was in 2021, and and what that's doing
to the channel today, what would be your response there?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's still very, very diﬃcult. Coming up with an estimate is just not feasible to do in any
manner. What we are seeing right now is a change in terms of the proﬁtability of
mining, that has gone down over the last several months. And then for quite some
time, there has been discussion of the proof of stake coming and proof of stake is
expected to be here, maybe this month, maybe later this month. But now that as
well, no, that a proof of stake is in market.
Those two things together, less proﬁtability in mining, as well as future proof of stake
decreases the demand or use of GPUs. So, I believe that the market is likely already
taken that into account in terms of the purchasing that we see. It has certainly
probably impacted the pricing that you see out in retail and e-tail of the cars as well
that have come back down to manufactured suggested prices.
So that's what we see today. We get asked often possibly of resale, will people resell
their cars? We watch it carefully. But our gamers tend to buy new cars. We'll see a
little bit from time to time on resell, that's normal, but it's not like a car that you can
determine how many miles that GPU has been through until people tend to focus on
brand new types of GPUs.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Got it. Shifting over to data center. Just want to hit the export restriction point at the
very top. So the $400 million is the part of your business that is impacted by the
recently announced restrictions. And to your point, you're working with customers in
search for potential oﬀsets. I guess how seamless or not seamless is that process
when customers can say, hey, we can no longer buy the A100, let's buy this entry
level data center GPU? How common should we expect that to be or is that going to
be fairly limited in scope?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So happening in the middle of our quarter was probably the hardest piece to
absorb. And then now we spend the time in terms of communication and helping
understand what does this mean? What can they do in case? Once we work through
there and we talk about alternative products, it can be either something with slightly
diﬀerent performance level, but also you could think about a group of products
together to leave the customer with stellar performance that they desired with the
A100. That work is in progress.
Our full team is ahead in terms of helping them, now, but I think we understand
exactly what the US government has asked us to do. We will follow all of those
pieces and we do hope within this quarter, we can mitigate some of that risk. But at
this time. It's just very unfair how much within the quarter we're going to be able to
do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Okay, got it. And I guess as a quick follow-up. The other question that I get on this
speciﬁc topic is, what's the risk of this broadening out just data center or GPUs
period as opposed to just the A100 and H100, and I guess this is sort of a speculative
perhaps unfair question, but how should we think about that risk coming through?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, I think the world of export controls has been quite active probably now for a
decade. Not only speciﬁc types of chips or any type of machinery, there is often
licenses required. There is restrictions in terms of certain company that they can't
ship to. There are certain countries that people cannot ship to. So I think that is a
continuing pace. It's just now surfaced something very speciﬁc for us here at NVIDIA.
There is more discussion probably out there in the news today that more may be
coming into the semiconductor market. We are aligned and working with the US
government. It was our job to help them understand how our processes work is in --
in the Asia-Paciﬁc area, so that we continue not only following what they had
planned for China and what they wanted to see, but also making sure that we could
continue our work for all of the other regions around the world and our customers
around the world. And that has been a very helpful process for us with the US
government.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Got it. And then on the broader environment in data center, on an earnings call, you
talked about robust demand trends and visibility in terms of US hyperscaler demand.
I think on the China side, even prior to the export restrictions, you talked about some
softness. In enterprise, I think you talked about some deals taking longer than
expected or a little bit more of a mixed environment. I guess, what are your updated
thoughts there? Any deviation in how we're thinking about those respective
buckets?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, so we've talked about at our call, correct, that we felt that the US market for
hyperscale was -- did that get better. Okay, that the demand for our US hyperscales
was quite strong and a little muted in terms of our China hyperscales. Our China
hyperscales even before the restrictions, signiﬁcant economic issues in the country.
Possibly some of it related to the COVID lockdowns and what they needed to do. But
other challenges, just with the economy, and that was known.
But even additionally, our work right now with our customers' enterprises and
particularly in terms of our hyperscales, there are still some challenges in the supply
chain with commodity types of chips. We refer to this as our work that we're doing to
help keep them and along with selling GPUs, they may be looking for very important
pieces of our networking products or very important parts in terms of cabling, things
that seem so simple for their data centers, but are holding up the ability for them to
establish and roll out new data centers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Page 7 of 14Q - Toshiya Hari

Q - Toshiya Hari
A - Colette KressYou'll see those because it's actually very diﬃcult to get a GPU in the cloud. They're
sold out in many diﬀerent places as these logistics, distribution and just the overall
volume of what they need is still lacking for them to do. We've been working
carefully with them and I guess our work right now on selling networking and GPUs
is working quite well. We called out our kitting process to really help those
hyperscales build out these data centers as quickly as possible. But that is something
that we are seeing worldwide.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay. And I guess in US hyperscale, speciﬁcally, the big concern that many of our --
many of your investors have is the macro is going to ultimately impact their cadence
from a spending perspective and things of that nature. As you go back and forth with
your customers, are you sensing pushes and pulls given the environment or you
guys provide something that so strategic and so critical to their process. I would
expect your business to be a lot more resilient than sort of down the middle
company, but, what are you hearing from your customers? What's kind of the
outlook there?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. You hit on some really good points there that says, when you focus on the
enterprise in the hyperscales, the hyperscales, essentially their end customers are
those enterprises. We're seeing solid demand continuing from the enterprises, even
in this macro conditions. We have a portfolio, a platform that is key to many of the
lighthouse accounts and further down the stocks in many industries, that diﬀerentiate
themselves and is a competitive advantage. If they can think about how leveraging
their data, building solutions to help monetize better their platforms, these are going
to be the things that you do in these very diﬃcult times.
You have to focus on your future and what's going to be necessary, and we're right
in that right position to do so. We have an upcoming architecture as well. Folks are
extremely interested and what that also brings to them in helping them build out.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
And Colette, I guess on that last point, be H100, which you'll be ramping over the
next several quarters, as you sort of compare and contrast this upcoming ramp with
what you saw during the A100 and the B100 ramps, anything apart from it being a
much better chance, any diﬀerence in how we should think about the cadence of
customer purchases and things of that sort?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, that lot has changed since the early years of V100 and even A100. V100 was a
surprise, bringing to market. Customers took that opportunity to take it, qualify and
try and bring it up into market and then it was a race to see who could qualify faster
and bring it to market.
Things have changed. Things have moved to our bring up and are bringing a
product is not just about our engineers, it's about our customers engineers. Do theyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

Q - Toshiya Harithink the products ready? That's how much work we are doing in terms of scaling for
the next architecture. They are integral in terms of us bringing this product to market.
It's important to see also the changes that we initiated even with A100. A100, if you
can assist them, it wasn't just a GPU. We assisted in terms of bringing a full scale
board to put the GPUs on, a full system pre-qualiﬁed allows them (inaudible) videos.
This is important for them to both understand what is the performance level that they
can expect, what are the projects that they have coming to work. H100 will certainly
meet those needs.
As you know we've talked about it being very key for transformers, very key in terms
of the large language models that we see in the future will be the extension of
natural language processing. So, I think we feel great about the architecture coming
to market, worked with all the diﬀerent customers, but a lot has changed from the
early days, something like the B100.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Got it. And the Grace CPU. It's a product that a lot of folks are excited about. Is it a
new part of the TAM that you will be addressing going forward? I guess, how should
we think about the percentage of the TAM that you will be addressing? I think you
characterized that it has been a relatively niche part of the market initially at least.
How should we see that progressing going forward and any sort of traction,
customer pool that you're seeing today with the certain over CPU?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, our Grace CPU is special. Our Grace CPU especially in terms of the workloads
and what it is geared for. It was really geared towards high performance computing
types of applications, supercomputing and of course the ﬁeld of overall AI.
Now that's an important piece to understand. Yes, it has a TAM. Yes. It's a sizable
TAM and it moves from going from zero to us from a revenue. So that's a very strong
growth rate going from zero.
But what it is not, it's not a general-purpose CPU. We targeted to really think about
that ﬁeld of high performance computing in AI, the full data center, look of what we
could do with the CPU and the time of the data that was inside the data center and
how long it took through and what we could do for the CPU. So we're excited to
bring to market, it's going to be here next year, probably in the ﬁrst half of next year
and bring to market.
So, a diﬀerent TAM. Yes, but also a great opportunity for us entering into new
markets.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Got it. And then I wanted to touch on the software franchise that you're building
from a pretty low base, but you've been pretty loud about that opportunity, both inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 14A - Colette Kress
Q - Toshiya Hari
Q - Yulia Hofstedeterms of data center as well as the automotive side. But focusing on data center,
what kind of progress have you made over the past several quarters? And where do
you see that opportunity going forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We'll probably talk a little bit more about this at our GTC, that Jensen has coming up
in the (inaudible). But let me kind of talk about how we see software. Software is inter
call, in terms of our progress already in data center and our products that we sell.
Essentially a chip without software is just a chip and we have established a full
platform stack in the work that we are doing.
We bring software every single time that we move to a new architecture. The
software still works and it's there to work with the developers that are out there. Now
software is diﬀerent depending on the type of customer. When you think about the
hyperscales, the hyperscales usually design their own software. We assist though so
many of the enterprises of just they're getting started.
The enterprises are not equipped with software developers. That would develop that
whole stack before it gets to the application. They're going to work on the
application. Our job is to stitch together all of those software component up to that
application and working with our full platform. Now we have a couple opportunities
to monetize software on its own. It is incorporated today and what you see in terms
of our pricing, but now the monetization could be diﬀerent.
NVIDIA AI enterprise, very geared towards the enterprises. Think about it as the AI
operating system that sits on top of the platform. They're beginning starts that both
that you can maneuver your entire platform, your data center using NVIDIA AI, but
also comes with the support that you have for any of the ST case that we've
established for all of the industry workloads that we see out there as well. So that's
one piece of monetization. We can monetize by cords by GPUs with NVIDIA AI
enterprise.
Secondly, more application or platform application level is omnivores. Omnivores is
our ability to help provide the stitching together of a platform to build for the
metaverse. The metaverse focused on anything from digital twins to a overall
simulation of a factory ﬂoor or manufacturing ﬂoor, and how to redesign it for both
eﬃciencies as well as AI. So these are very important two key platforms in the data
center, aside from our software, that correct, we can also put in the car in terms of
automotive.

{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The Chinese hyperscales was the question regarding how do we size that both now
in terms of the future. They are diﬀerent, for example, the US hyperscales. The US
hyperscales are much larger and take up a larger percentage for sure in terms of just
with the type of AI that they accomplish.
If you think about those hyperscales in China, they are multifaceted. Not all of them
have those same types of things and are not sisters to exactly what is here in the US.
They have always been a smaller of that component. We've sold to them for years,
indicating what percent of a much smaller than what we have here in the US and that
will probably continue.

{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, I'm not -- I'm not sure I could articulate from the US government side. But from
our communication, our work with them is nothing diﬀerent from any chip company.
There has been export controls that we need to follow and it's a serious thing. US
export controls is broad and wide and in fact, more than just the US or a single
country. It is worldwide and we're very careful with it, careful to both understand
what the plan for the intentions are but also very rigorous in terms of following
through on it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

second 8-K after clariﬁcation with the US government, helping them understand how
our just internal operations work. Asia, for many of the semiconductor companies is
a very important part, meaning, we are a global semiconductor company.
We use folks companies in the Asia area. We also have a very big part of it here in
the US. So, helping them understand how that works, just to make sure that we could
both follow what they wanted but also we could continue the operations. And I think
we helped explain to them and we feel very good about that relationship. So that's
what I can say about the US. Thank you.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Colette, I guess on that last point, just on your foundry strategy broadly in the past
and to this day, you work closely with suppliers like TSMC and Samsung. There is a
very large domestic supplier who is on its way to run capacity. When you discuss
your foundry strategy with Jansen and the broader team in the Board, how topical is
localization and how often does it come up? Is it a big problem that most of your
productions in Asia? How do you think about it? What's the debate internally?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
I think we started this process years ago, when we went to a dual fab strategy. I think
we're probably one of the largest semiconductor companies with a dual fab strategy.
That helps us both with ﬁnding the best provider for the solutions that we may be
building. That doesn't mean that it's always the same node to node. Each of them
have diﬀerent processes, diﬀerent skills and we've been working with them. Couldn't
be more happy about that strategy of having two of them and we'll continue with
them.
The planned have more here domestically, absolutely is a great strategy as well,
having something closer to home for us, I think could be beneﬁcial. But we do know
that that's a long-term standing goal to get there. It's going to take some years to get
there, but we wouldn't be more excited to be working, even with those same fabs or
a new fab here closer to the US.
So it's front and center for us to always think about about fabs, it's where some of
our initial processes stand, but it's not the only thing. As you know, we have a lot of
system builders. We have a lot of contract manufacturers. We have a ton of suppliers.
We -- and many of us just think it's us and the manufacturer, but it's a host of a very
complex supply chain that we have.

A - Colette Kressmanaging OpEx a little bit more, a little bit more scrutiny there. So if you can kind of
walk us through those dynamics, that would be helpful.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Let me ﬁrst start with the question regarding gross margin. And from a put and takes
standpoint, our biggest driver of our gross margins is always going to be mix. Our
data center including so many of the systems continue to be drivers of gross margin
upward. And after we ﬁnished Q2, stabilizing the channel, we'll probably see a little
bit of muted results in terms of gross margin. Nut long term, the driver of data center
mix and software should continue to fuel our gross margins going forward.
Now on operating expenses. We took this opportunity just as many large companies
did, to slow down hiring that we could concentrate on the employees that we have.
The employees also faced inﬂationary issues just like many other companies around
the world. We focused on get setting them right and increasing their salaries, so that
they could work through this. But now we are also working on how we can be
eﬃcient our costs.
Our cost going into Q4 will probably -- should to be approximately ﬂat and continue
until we start to see the macro environment improve. That just takes work on making
sure that our products coming to market are front and center. And that's where we're
focusing our energy and then ﬁnding eﬃciencies behind the scenes as best as we
can.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay. Got it. I'm hopping around here a little bit. I wanted to hit on automotive. It's a
very robust design win funnel. I think the July quarter was the ﬁrst quarter where
we're really solving inﬂection to the upside, which was great. Can you talk about the
visibility you have in that funnel, sitting your P&L and I think historically, your
proﬁtability in automotive from a gross margin standpoint, was a little bit below the
corporate average. How should we see that evolving over the next couple of years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. Let me give you some background of our automotive business. We have
started to grow in Q1, then moving to Q2 and we do expect going into Q3. What's
behind that? Earlier this year, or Orin architecture launched. We have nearly 40
design wins on Orin, ranging from passenger cars, robotaxis and future AI vehicles.
This is a case of anything from a Level two-Level two plus to a Level ﬁve with Orin
and you'll see that continue to scale over time. I think we're in and what we refer to
as an inﬂection point for our automotive business. Now some of the early parts of
the Orin platform before we get to the AI and software, will still be below our
company average. But once we have the software, these will be quite solid gross
margins as we move forward.
Our work there is broad. We have a pipeline that helps us with that visibility. What
that means is, your automotive are working in terms of their manufacturing lines.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-09-12

view that helps us with visibility, also tracking in terms of that revenue.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Got it. Any questions from the audience? Colette, I guess in the last couple of
minutes, I want to give you the opportunity to kind of speak to any aspects of your
business, any macro dynamics that we should be aware of. Obviously, NVIDIA is a
very well covered stock, but any other topics that we should be hitting here.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. Sure. Let's see. NVIDIA, our position right now in the market, demonstrating
the availability of AI for all, couldn't be stronger and we're approaching now a really
great product cycle, a product cycle that takes our graphics architecture, takes our
work in the data center, not only bringing compute to market with new products, but
also in our networking business.
So these product cycles are important to us. Important for us to continue to fuel the
AI market, the expansion of graphics as well, and that's going to be front and center.
During these macro economic times, inventory corrections, not the most fun thing to
do, but we also know that will pass in time and hopefully by the end of Q4, we will
be in a great position as well for mobiles sell-in and sell-through perspective going
forward.
But we have great new products coming. We couldn't be in a stronger leadership
position and that will take us far, I think going forward.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Maybe lastly on capital allocation, any thoughts there?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So capital allocation, we would always love to look at more and more M&A
opportunities, but we are quite selective in ﬁnding the right ones. We felt the
Mellanox was a great addition, both culturally and what it brought to us as products,
will continue to look. But it's not easy to ﬁnd those.
In the meantime, we are going to focus in terms of stock repurchases and rebuying.
We've done more than $5 billion in the ﬁrst half and we've got $12 billion of
opportunity that would take us all the way to the end of next year's calendar year
over repurchasing as we speak.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Awesome. On that note, I'd like to close the session. Thank you so much for coming.
