Presentation
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
All right. I think we're live now. So good afternoon, everyone. I'm Chris Caso,
Raymond James Semiconductor analyst. So everyone, welcome. This is our ﬁrst
semiconductor ﬁreside chat at this year's IIC. I suppose probably everybody is saying
how we would prefer to be in Orlando rather than in front of our computers. But next
year, for sure. So we're very happy to have NVIDIA with us. With us from NVIDIA is
their CFO, Colette Kress; as well as from Investor Relations, Simona Jankowski and
Stewart Stecker. Welcome, everyone. Thanks for coming. You are muted, Colette. So
just make sure. Sorry. You're still muted, Colette. Sorry. All right. Just give us a
minute.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
There we go.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
No. Muted again. You were on then oﬀ.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Let me try this. Can you hear me now?
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
We got you now. That is the quintessential 2020-2021 start to a meeting.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So sorry about that. We're not sure why we moved over that we did. But thank you so
much for having NVIDIA here at your conference. I agree, next year will be another
great year. But hopefully will be in person.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01

So I guess would you like to start us oﬀ and start with anything you want to say. Then
we'll work into Q&A. But Colette, I'll leave it over to you for however you want to get
us started.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. That sounds great. I just need to give a quick little reminder to everybody that
this presentation and discussion may contain forward-looking
statements, and investors are advised to read our reports ﬁled with the SEC for
information related to risks, uncertainties facing our business. Now once I get that
out of the way let me just kind of talk about, we've just ﬁnished our earnings just last
week, and we completed both our Q4 and full year ﬁscal year '21 and released those
results. Truly a breakout year for us, both in accelerated computing and gaming.
Adoption of our accelerated computing across the industries is now in high gear,
and you can see that gaming has moved beyond just games, incorporating eSports,
now creatives and is really a social medium for us. We had incredible demand for
our GeForce RTX 30 series, our best launch ever. It kicked oﬀ a powerful upgrade
cycle for us. Adoption of NVIDIA's accelerated computing continues to gather
momentum. Greater urgency across many companies as they digest, automate and
accelerate innovation as we move forward. So we can talk further about our results.
But a great ﬁnish to ﬁscal year '21 and a huge guide for what we guided in Q1 of
ﬁscal year '22 as well. I'll turn it back over to you, Chris.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Well that's a good way to start us oﬀ. It was a very strong guidance. It's maybe the
ﬁrst question, and this is going to be common to a lot of semiconductor companies
this week is the aspect of shortages. It's on the mind of every semiconductor investor
right now. Perhaps you could tell us how NVIDIA has been aﬀected by the shortages.
Would demand have been better if you had more supply? And how are you dealing
with it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So when we really think about our business, I think you really have to start the
statement, not on the word supply, but really about the word, demand. Our demand
is strong. Our demand has been strong across our businesses as we have been
launching both the Ampere architecture to gaming and data center. We are now
building, for example, for our overall gaming business, we are building GPUs for
gaming both at Samsung and TSMC. So what we have is we have an ability to source
for our overall gaming business from both of those 2 high-level fabs. We couldn't be
more pleased to have both of them as great partners as they've been with us for
many years. So this will allow us not only to produce everything that we need for the
high end but also below a $300 price point, we will still be able to produce overallFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01

A - Colette M. Kresssupply on our other providers such as TSMC. With our overall Turing architecture
through the end of the year. So in summary, that although, overall, short to demand,
we still believe that we have supply to deliver continued growth for this year in
gaming and data center.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Now one of the things you mentioned on the call also is that you're going -- you're in
the process of launching the mainstream series, the next version of Ampere in the
3060. Can you talk about supply of that product as well as how that impacts as you
go forward into the April quarter?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So let's step back and talk about our 30 series. That's correct. We launched our
overall gaming GPU 30 series earlier last year. It has been a huge success, probably
the most successful gaming launch that we have had. With a second-generation of
RTX, which stands for our ray tracing and now we also have a list of more than 3
dozen games for overall ray tracing and just strong performance improvement with
our 30 series, the demand has been amazing. We started oﬀ the launch of that
product, starting at several of our high-end cards, our 3070 or 3080 and our 3090
has been in market now for several overall months. So over this period of time, it is
showing that a capability of the 30 series, not only to just be for our true gamers out
there, but also supporting the availability for creators and broadcasters that use this.
So we expect to see the 30 series continue to launch new products as we move
forward.
Our latest product that we launched was the 3060. The 60s class is a sweet spot. It's
a sweet spot for gamers, a great performance at a great price. The 60 class is
essentially preferred by our iCafes that you'll ﬁnd in the Asia Pac area as well as many
of our system builders as they build custom overall systems. The 3060's on its launch
last week. It sold out in hours. It has been carefully engineered for gamers and
primarily gamers, and they were excited about it. We now have that Ampere
architecture from $329 and up. So we have great diﬀerentiation in price points to
support any type of gamer depending on what they want to come into the market
and pay for. All of these are well below the cost of a new console.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Now you mentioned the pricing, and that is one of the diﬀerences in the 30 series as
compared to the 20 series as well, where you did launch the 3090 at a higher price
point. And maybe talk about that, and you don't disclose ASPs within that. But maybe
you can speak qualitatively about what the impact of the higher-priced cards are and
what that's done to overall mix within gaming.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So we did start this launch of this architecture with our higher-end cards, very
similar to last time, but I think they were very well received across the market, not
only for the ability to do the ray tracing, but if you think about this being a very
important upgrade cycle for us, you can see the astounding amount of performanceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11A - Christopher Caso
A - Colette M. Kress
A - Christopher Caso
A - Colette M. Kressimprovement, not only from our last architecture. But if you go back to the
architecture of Pascal and the importance that Pascal had in terms of the installed
base. An upgrader from Pascal and/or Turing to see a tremendous performance
improvement and expansion of overall ray trace gains and really a holiday season
that truly beneﬁted from those upgrading as well as new gamers coming into the
market. So we have volume SKUS, such as 3060, but given our interest in many of
the gamers to be even above our volume SKUs and moving into that 3070, 3080,
both helped us in terms of our average ASPs, our total revenue as a whole. We will
likely continue to see those be a driver for us.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Okay. That's good. With the demand being as strong as it is, if I can move back to
the supply side for a moment. Can you talk about the availability of supply,
particularly as you go through the year. And historically, I should say the July quarter
has been a little seasonally weaker on the desktop side. Then as you go into the back
half of the year, that it gets stronger. I would imagine now that things -- supply is --
demand is ahead of supply, that there's some constraints. So perhaps how that
seasonality plays out depends upon the availability of wafers as you go along. Do
you expect to get those additional wafers as the year progresses?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So let's step back and I think we have to talk about where we are in terms of the
end of Q4. So the end of Q4, a great holiday season. Super strength in terms of
demand overall. But correctly, our channel -- our channel inventory is at lean levels at
this time. So when you look at our overall guide of moving from Q4 to Q1,
seasonality was essentially thrown out the window because we have super strong
sequential increase expected between Q4 and Q1 for gaming.
We are working always on our supply. We'll continue to get more supply throughout
Q1 as well as the rest of the year to meet what we have here as that demand has
been quite strong. Now that seasonality, therefore, changed in Q1. It will probably,
therefore, change as we think about the whole rest of the year. We'll just have to see
how the rest of the year goes as we guide 1 quarter at a time. But the seasonality of
what we've seen in the past is probably not going to be able to repeat itself until
we're able to move the overall levels into the channel to an appropriate level.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Right. So it sounds like you don't feel that the constraints in supply -- I mean you still
may be constrained, but it doesn't necessarily constrain your ability to grow from
these levels. There's additional supply coming on. Demand, is there. We can still get
some growth.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, absolutely, Chris. So this is, of course a situation that we would love to have
more optionality. We would love to have more overall supply. But remember, our
issue is, is demand is strong. Demand is strong, and we do believe we will grow
quite well as this demand will continue through this year in front of us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01

A - Colette M. Kress{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Yes. We've observed just looking for the cards at retail. They're very hard to get. So
certainly, the data is out there. You can go to any website and corroborate what
you're saying. The other factor, it's obviously been a concern to investors is the
impact of cryptocurrency on the business right now, that a fear that -- the
cryptocurrency business, and I think you just said in the call, you're expecting that to
be sort of a permanent element of demand going forward. But it's more volatile than
the gaming demand. And maybe you could talk to what your view of that is and what
steps you're taking to control that risk.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. If we step back and understand crypto and understand crypto currency this time
around, the environment is very diﬀerent, very diﬀerent from last cycle. First, the
gaming architecture with the 30 series is early in its ramp versus the early stage of
the transition that took placed back in 2018. And as we've just discussed, the channel
is very lean of our 30 series right now.
Secondly, keep in mind that we are de-hashing, reducing the overall mining
performance on our latest 60 series GPU and announced a CMP board, speciﬁcally
for miners.
We announced that CMP board as we felt if we saw demand from our professional
miners, it would be a good opportunity for us to restart that CMP program for them.
Now thirdly, Etherium mining increases that have occurred is shared with a lot of
diﬀerent overall drivers. Remember, we have an established installed base Ethereum
this time around versus what we had in 2018. You're also seeing new ASICs that are
part of a lot of the hashing that is occurring, and there are multiple GPU providers at
this time. Our quarter for gaming, for example, probably would have been the same
with or without crypto because we're supply constrained. So we'll continue to watch
this. We believe that our CMP product will allow us better visibility for understanding
the size of crypto within our quarter.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
And if I could go back to that because within -- in 2018 with the 20 cycle, you did
release mining speciﬁc boards at that time also. But it wasn't as, I'd say as aggressive
an approach as it is now when you're actually de-hashing the 3060. I suppose you're
not -- you did not take that step with some of the higher end 30 series cards. Is it
safe to say going forward, this is one of the strategy that you will now employ to
segment the crypto part, the gaming part of the market, make sure the gaming cards
get to gamers and crypto, you can address them like that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So correct. We've announced that CMP program, and it will start shipping in the
March time frame. And additionally, with our 3060 that came out, that was an
opportunity for us to allow that to be available for our gamers. We build GeForce for
gamers. So we took that additional step to reduce that hash rate eﬃciency with theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 11A - Christopher Caso
A - Colette M. Kress
A - Christopher Caso
A - Colette M. Kressnew launch of the 3060, but we didn't see this as a need to take that step with other
30 series cards because we launched them last fall and crypto mining wasn't really
happening that far back. So we are here to support our gamers, support our gamers
with our GeForce and really create a CMP card for those professional miners. That's
what we'll see in this next quarter, and we'll update everybody after the quarter in
terms of what we saw in terms of cryptocurrency with the CMP.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
I'll ask one more in gaming. (Operator Instructions) But as far as gaming in general, I
suppose that's one of the market segments, we could say as one of the work-from-
home, learned-from-home, be-at-home beneﬁciaries as my 9-year-old in the next
room is deﬁnitely evidence of that. Is that -- in terms of the exceptional demand
we're seeing from gaming now, how do you deal with the potential risk that as we
can go outside and do other things that demand can tail oﬀ.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So look at it in the perspective of what gaming has moved to. Gaming has
continued to grow as an entertainment and social medium. It has also served as an
important connection for many of us during this last year as a perfect virtual and safe
option for entertainment. If anything, we believe this past year accelerated that
discovery of gaming and growth as a preferred entertainment and social medium at
this time. We expect that continued growth to occur even as things possibly get
better and people are able to do more things in a social medium. But being hooked
on that gaming, being hooked on the friends, the overall social aspects of gaming,
it's going to be really diﬃcult to turn that back. So we still think this has been a great
opportunity to expose people to overall gaming. You can see that in our overall
demand, but we do expect this to continue to work from the home.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Great. Well I'll attest to that, too, winning a Fortnite match with my son was probably
the best bonding opportunity of COVID. So -- and I don't think I can go back on that.
So I'll pivot to data center. The data center has been growing. It's been more modest
growth than what we've seen in gaming, at least over the short term, not over the
long term. Maybe talk about where that business is going, the extent to which the
data center business is also being constrained by some of the shortages.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So let's look at our data center business as we ﬁnish ﬁscal year '21. Fiscal year '21
was a record level for the total company. As we've discussed, it was a record number
for gaming. But it was also a record ﬁnish for our data center business. It was the
year of not only launching Ampere for gaming, but we launched the Ampere
architecture for data center, starting in terms of that launch even during the
lockdowns associated with the pandemic. So a true successful year for us.
Q4 was also a record. In Q4, our data center business grew while the industry as a
whole did not grow. Additionally, we are guiding growth in Q1, where our industry is
also planning to be down sequentially 20%. So we feel really great aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01

business here. We are still ramping overall A100 and we have expanded and have a
great set of diverse customers with the over launch -- with the overall launch of A100.
Hyperscales and clouds are still ramping. But we have also added customers
through our vertical industries. This is a case where we have broad-based strength
across our CSPs, our vertical industries as they continue to support in our
enterprises, the use of accelerated computing and AI. We've gotten great
momentum from our DGXs, both at CSPs as well as our vertical industries. So we'll
continue to see growth as we are in Q1 today. I think our data center business will still
be a growth driver for the years to come.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
Colette, how -- what's the split between the on-premise versus hyperscale part of the
data center business? And obviously on-premise is one of the areas that has been
COVID impacted. Enterprise spending in general has been ?weaker. Is that true for
your business as well? And by extension, if we do expect enterprise to get better as
people go back to oﬃces, should that materialize in your data center business also?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So our hyperscales are an important part of our business and have been with us
for many years. So some of the initial starts with AI and accelerated computing really
was birthed with our overall hyperscale partners, and they are ramping A100. But our
hyperscale business as a whole is less than 50% of our data center business. So our
enterprise and verticals represent more than 50%. But the important piece here is
there are multiple ways to attract our vertical industries and our enterprises.
We have cloud instances, which have been a new form to adopt computing
platforms in this new wave of accelerated computing. Most of our hyperscale cloud
providers have quickly deployed overall A100 into their cloud instances. This is a way
for our enterprises to both test to get comfortable with the new architectures to
continue to buy that on-premise basis or continue to keep it in the overall cloud.
So we have seen the strength from many years of working in terms of building out
software SDKs to meet the needs of accelerated computing applications that are out
there. So as we have moved into this era of Ampere architecture, the growth of those
customer sets is now, not only just the hyperscales, but a very, very strong enterprise
presence. We expect that we grew faster than the industry as well here on the
enterprise as acceleration AI is still important, even though the economy may have
some challenges with it at this time.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
As a follow-on on the data center, and I'll read one of the questions that came in is
about the DPU part of the data center market. The question is, is that an entirely
incremental opportunity? Or is there some cannibalization of the GPU in the data
center if you're going to do more compute and sort of -- at the DPU.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 11A - Christopher Caso
A - Colette M. Kress
A - Christopher Caso
A - Colette M. KressYes. So let me start with discussing what is our DPU. We work together Mellanox plus
NVIDIA, working together to create the opportunities for acceleration in the data
center beyond GPU acceleration. What we were looking to was include both
networking and software-deﬁned networking. But there's a new piece as well, which
is referred to as the DPU. Now the DPU provides data processing unit for that
modern data center. If you step back and look at how modern data centers are
being built right now. Modern data centers are disaggregating all of those diﬀerent
components that will exist in the data center to have racks of CPUS, racks of GPUs,
racks of storage, memory. But important piece is also the DPU. The DPU is a data
processing unit. It aids in the overall security of the data. The possible encryption
necessary in the data, particularly on those cloud instances. So the data center as a
whole is becoming the compute, not just the server. So this DPU is a great
opportunity for us to expand the market beyond our networking, beyond our overall
GPU to serve the market with our overall DPU. Our BlueField-2 end market today
continues to build awareness through the hyperscales, through cloud Internet
companies as well. This will likely be a part of our business and grow in the second
half of this year as well as next year. We've added a new opportunity nearing about
$10 billion in TAM by just working together, leadership team to leadership team,
Mellanox and NVIDIA together. So we're really great to see how this will evolve as we
go forward.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
And how do you view the size of that DPU TAM as compared to the existing data
center TAM, which is AI training, AI inference. I think Jen-Hsun, your CEO, on the call
made a comment that his view was over time, and it didn't sound like over a long
period of time, that every workload -- server workload would be accelerated
because of security. So I'd imagine that, that's quite a large TAM.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Correct. We incorporated this as we spoke about our new size of the data center
TAM as we moved forward with the inclusion of Mellanox. So much of our work in
terms of both edge computing, high-performance computing, inference training, all
of these things together have allowed us to reach about a $100 billion TAM as we
move forward. So just having more ability to inﬂuence the whole view of the
infrastructure of the data center has been able to increase our TAM.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
What about -- just moving on with that into the hyperscale part. You mentioned
about half your business. And as we go forward there, how do you expect your
growth rate in hyperscale to compare to hyperscale growth rates overall? And we're
seeing somewhere in the range, 20%, 25% hyperscale CapEx growth this year, a bit
of an improvement from last year. Do you expect your business both in AI and DPU
and everything else to grow at some multiple of that for some time?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11A - Christopher Caso
A - Colette M. KressOur hyperscales are an important part of our data center business for sure. Our level
of engagement with them, their support of our overall A100 architecture design has
really allowed them to use A100 quite eﬃciently from the onset of our overall launch.
We created the A100 as a system, a full system that allowed them an easy
deployment, an easy ability to overall qualify for not only cloud instances, but also
for their internal use. An important piece of why A100 is such a great opportunity for
these hyperscales is really about that strong performance and its universal use.
Universal use of not only just doing training, but inferencing at the same time, virtual
instances of both of those occurring in one overall system is a great form factor for
them. Now, why are they so interested? Well the overall growth of what we've seen in
terms of training models as we've been talking for more than 1.5 years about
conversational AI. The complexity of those models, what that has driven in terms of
their need for performance, their need for compute to do those AI models.
Additionally, around this work-from-home, everything on the web right now is about
recommendations. That says how can you recommend the news? What I should have
for lunch? Where I should go next in a safe environment? All of those are driving the
interest in A100. The ramp for A100 with our hyperscale still has a ways to go. A great
end to the overall year of them both growing sequentially and year-over-year. But we
will use this opportunity to continue to provide A100 to all of our hyperscales around
the world.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
All right. I think we've got about 8 minutes left, so this will be the last call for
questions. But if I can move on to the acquisition of ARM, and you gave some
updates on that on the earnings call. But I guess my question is -- on that is what
does ARM bring to NVIDIA that one you don't have already? Then secondly, why the
need to buy ARM as opposed to just the licensee of ARM, which you already are.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks for that question. ARM is a great overall asset. And NVIDIA plus ARM
together can really make the AI computing company the future together. ARM has
been a 30-year tremendous success, the most energy-eﬃcient CPU out there, a
developer base that is quite enormous and serves a wide range of customers from
mobile to PC to data center to IOT. The interesting thing is NVIDIA also can bring to
them the overall capabilities of acceleration and AI, which that paired with an overall
energy eﬃcient CPU is a great opportunity for the overall market.
So we look at this in terms of help infusing investment and understanding of the
ecosystem around several very important markets, important markets of data center
and PCs we can assist on in that path of creating an opportunity for a new type of
CPU in the data center and CPUs -- data centers and PCs using the ARM CPU. We
love their licensing model. They're licensing -- their open licensing model is
absolutely one of the greatest licensing models out there. Our ability to take some of
our technology and license through their open model is absolutely one of the great
things that we can do with the overall ARM acquisition. But let me step back and say
ﬁrst, ARM, we are conﬁdent it will close, and we do promise to keep it open, keep its
licensing open and make sure that our customers have the assurance of that existingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01

A - Colette M. Kressbusiness model that we will keep. We are excited about injecting ARM with a boost
of AI and ecosystem through there. I think that will provide more opportunities in the
market, but most importantly, more opportunities for customers.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
And in the event that the acquisition were unable to go through, I know that's not
your intention. But as an investor looking at the risk, how would it change NVIDIA's
road map? And again you would -- if the acquisition were not to go through, you
would still be a licensee. Would you still be able to pursue some of those things you
talked about? And particularly in the CPU space and server, would that be
something that you would be able to do if it didn't happen?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So let's ﬁrst start with, yes, we remain conﬁdent on the acquisition closing at this
time. But the realistic look at this is NVIDIA will be a great large company, whether
with it or without. But I think it's important to note that there is great optionality that
we have as a licensee of overall ARM as well as continuing to assist them as we have
been assisting them with CUDA, integrating CUDA into their overall work that they
do today and we will continue that great partnership that we have had. But I will
ﬁnish with we remain conﬁdent that the acquisition will close.
{BIO 4815032 <GO>}
We will make a note of that, I'll ﬁnish -- we've got just a couple of minutes here, but
I'll ﬁnish up with automotive. It's something that we've all talked about for quite a
long time. I know it's a focus area for you. Maybe there's been disappointment in the
market that Level 5 self-driving hasn't moved as fast as maybe the industry thought
3, four years ago. It still sees something that you're very committed to. What drives
the auto space over the next couple of years? Is this still something that investors
should pay close attention to?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The automotive industry is working feverishly right now. It certainly has had probably
one of its unique years of manufacturing lines coming to a halt due to the pandemic
and then the quick surge back to those manufacturing lines and building those. But
aside from that, let's step back and look at what we're seeing in terms of
autonomous.
We have continued to win overall agreements for long-term Level 2+ or Level 4
robotaxis to fully deals. Probably the one -- the most transformational deals that
we've put out there is our Mercedes-Daimler deal, a very important and all eyes on it
just because of its unique overall structure. They have decided to use our end-to-end
platform through its entire ﬂeet that it will produce in 2024 and beyond.
The important part of that is not only incorporating hardware systems within the ﬂeet
of cars and continuing to upgrade the software through over-the-air updates and
keeping that current. But sharing the overall revenue that they achieve from selling
that autonomous system within the car with us here at NVIDIA. So now we have anFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-01

A - Colette M. Kressability to have a software stream from the overall Daimler agreement. Very important
deal for us, the trust we have of Mercedes-Daimler. As you know, we are also in their
AI cockpit and their hyper screen that they just recently announced. The second year
of the MBOS [ph] product line that they have for their overall AI infotainment system.
We couldn't be more pleased about that deal, but we have many others. We also
discussed deals in terms of -- with Li Auto. We have discussed with Xpeng. We have
discussed with SAIC. All of them continuing to use the autonomous platform that we
have for their cars and their electric vehicles that they will put on the road. We
continue to work with many other start-ups, Tier 1s and other OEMs on Autonomous.
It will take probably a couple of years for production level of these, whether it be
robotaxis or passenger cars, overall hit the road. But we have clearly demonstrated
that our both performance, our engineering of software, connected with our
performance of our hardware is a true end-to-end performance for them for
autonomous vehicles. So we couldn't be more pleased with the progress that we've
seen.

Well we'll look forward to sending an autonomous taxi to take you from the airport
into one of the IIC conferences in Orlando, maybe -- I don't know, maybe 2024. It
sounds like it might be the reasonable -- if not more, not earlier. I think that is all the
time we have.
