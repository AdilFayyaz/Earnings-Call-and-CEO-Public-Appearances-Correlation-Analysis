{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet
Conference, the Nvidia presentation. With us from the company today, we are very
happy to have the Director of Investor Relations, Chris Evenden. Welcome Chris.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Thank you. Good to be here.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
So Chris, you just reported a pretty fun quarter last night above the high end of your
guidance. And you guided a little bit better than -- or maybe in line with seasonal but
oﬀ of a higher base --
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Much higher base, yes.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
And I guess people are saying hey, our PC is back. And I think clearly the desktop
business was probably up more strongly than the notebook business is fair to say.
Can you help us understand where the underlying dynamic -- is it really just gaming
applications being very, very, very strong above and beyond what the PC market is
doing. And maybe talk about kind of the underlying trends in the OEM PC business
as well?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. So we have a GeForce product line that is graphics for consumers. And the most
informative way to think about that, if you like, is dividing it into a gaming market andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

Page 2 of 15James Schneider
Chris Evendenan OEM market. And those two markets have very diﬀerent dynamics, as Jim was
alluding. So although having said that, both of them were actually strong in Q4, the
OEM one probably more unexpectedly.
But the long-term underlying trend is that gaming is strong and the OEM business is
weak. The OEM business is princely mainstream notebook. And that's under a lot of
pressure. The mainstream notebook market as a whole is under a lot of pressure,
right? We all know that. And I think there's additional pressures within graphics
within mainstream notebook as well. So I think there's a lot of pressure in that
business.
Gaming, however, is actually a very strong, proﬁtable actually slowly growing
business within the PC market. So you take -- you can't take a homogenous view of
the PC market. It has very distinct segments. Gaming we estimate is growing at
about 10% a year. And obviously Q4 is a strong quarter for gaming. But also because
a lot of games come out in Q4 and people don't buy GPUs -- gamers don't buy
GPUs because they want a better GPU. They buy GPUs because they want to play
Battleﬁeld 4 with all the features turned on, or they want to pay Blade and Soul. And I
think the reason I mentioned Blade and Soul is that's a game that launched in China
last quarter from Tencent. And that's a new departure because it's much higher
production values than is typical for China. And although I am only talking about one
game here, I think it's a very signiﬁcant diﬀerence because it's raised the level of
expectations of what a game in China can look like. And so we are pretty excited
about that.
And China has been historically about 40% of GeForce revenues, just as a rule of
thumb. And so if we can get them moving up in terms of ASPs, that's a very exciting
opportunity for us. So dynamics, both markets were strong. But I would say the
longer-term underlying trend is that PC gaming will continue to be strong. OEM I
think is somewhat of a headwind in the next 12 months.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
And are you seeing any kind of tailwind from market share versus AMD, or is it more
just kind of strong share, still ﬂat but the markets are doing what they're doing?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
The market share numbers will come out today or tomorrow, I think. So we will see. A
word of caution with market share numbers, they're unit share and there's a lot of
diﬀerence between the OEM business and the gaming business in terms of both
ASP and in terms of gross margins as well. So you can actually move -- excuse me,
you can move market share very signiﬁcantly and actually probably move proﬁt
dollars (inaudible) one quarter like Q3 of last year. We actually lost market share. But
we increased our dollar share of the market. So it's good to have data and market
share as one data point. But you've got to be cautious about interpreting it too
literally because most of the money is made in the higher-end business. And by
high-end, I'm talking about a graphics card that retails at like $150, or to $1000. ButFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

Chris Evendenreally starting at that sort of level. So it's not stupendously expensive. That's where
the money is going.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Got it. And relative to the Q1 guidance, I think you guided revenues down about I
think about 8% sequentially at the midpoint. Can you maybe talk about the moving
pieces within that, because clearly there's a lot of them. One is Tegra seasonality is
particularly weaker in Q1. Nobody really knows what seasonality in Tesla in the
professional business is. So help us kind of break apart the seasonality in the core PC
and gaming franchise versus the rest.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes, I think seasonality is a really dangerous concept when it comes to Nvidia,
because I think it implies that you know something when you don't. If you look at
historically what other businesses have done, there probably is an underlying
seasonality. But my God there's a lot of noise on top of that seasonality as well. And
so it's diﬃcult to use that as a basis.
Now, in terms of guiding into Q1, I think we guided pretty much in line with
everybody else. We had a stronger Q4 than everybody else. So and even when you
go down 8%, which is the midpoint into Q1, that still gives us a stronger -- if you look
at it like Q3 to Q1, we are still stronger than pretty much all our peers I think Q3 to
Q1. So I think it's good guidance. We will be up 10% year-on-year. The moving parts
within that, certainly the GeForce business will be down signiﬁcantly, both Desktop --
both gaming and OEM will be down signiﬁcantly in that period of time. The
professional business will be strong I think. And oﬀset some of that. And Tegra will
be wherever Tegra ends up.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
That's helpful. I want to kind of switch from the near term to kind of the product side
of things for a minute. You announced the latest in your Tegra series, the Tegra K1,
back at the Consumer Electronics Show. I think the metrics you put around that were,
say, 65% less power at any given performance and 40% more performance in any
given power. I think that's what you said. But basically, can you help us understand
ﬁrst of all what are the advantages of K1 relative to Tegra 4 in the past and then what
are the advantages relative to other competitors like a QUALCOMM-based solution
or even other competitive solutions like X and Os or the Apple iPad?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. So both questions have the same answer. And that is it's the ﬁrst time you've got
a PC plus GPU inside a mobile power. So it ﬁts -- don't get me wrong, it ﬁts within a
mobile power and we can run it at 5 watts in a tablet, we can run it at 2 watts on a
phone and still be in terms of per watt and raw performance. But it is PC class. So
what does that mean? It means it has all the features of open GL for its DirectTouch
11. We worked with Epic support Unreal Engine 4 to it. And Unreal Engine is one ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 15James Schneider
Chris Evendenthe most popular game engines in the world today. So that means it makes it very
easy for a game developer to take a game that already exists on another platform
and makes it pretty trivial actually to port it to Tegra K1.
In fact, one of the demos we showed at our analyst day was a PC demo running on
Tegra K1. And another one (inaudible) at CES. One was a PC demo running on Tegra
K1 on the Unreal Engine. And another one was actually a PS4 demo I think on the
Unreal Engine on Tegra K1. So that shows you just how easy it is to transfer that
contract across. Of course, that's a big deal for a software developer because now
it's a very little incremental asset that can make a game available on Android.
Then the other thing is it brings CUDA, the GPU general-purpose GPU program
(inaudible) CUDA with its 192 processor cores to mobile. And so that gives you a lot
of more options in terms of other features that you can add, because just as a GPU is
good at taking data and turning it into an image, it's actually really good at taking an
image and turning it into data. So image processing. And a bunch of other highly
powered computing tasks as well. So we demonstrated it and the automotive
context in terms of identifying the white lines on the road, reading road signs at the
side, measuring the distance to the car in front, all these things. You have
fundamental building blocks of advanced driver assistance systems. But in phones
and tablets as well you have gesture control, facial recognition and all these other
apps, high-deﬁnition -- high dynamic range photography, all these other apps can
run in CUDA as well. So there's a lot of features and performance that brings that you
didn't have before. And that's why we didn't call it Tegra 5 because we felt it was
suﬃciently big (inaudible) emphasize the fact that it's got the Kepler core in it and
Tegra K1 as well in terms of that. That's a diﬀerentiation. And it's part of our
fundamental strategy in terms of gaming on Android. So Android, again, is all about
being ubiquitous; it's all about being everywhere. And we believe that as Android
matures as a platform, there will be distinct segments that will crystallize out, if you
will, out of the Android market. And one of those will be gaming. And we will be at
the Vanguard of that and we intend to be the incumbent as that market solidiﬁes.
And part of that -- it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem in the sense that game
developers don't want to develop games until they've got an installed base.
Hardware manufacturers don't want to build an installed base until they've got
games. And so we have to invest to build the gaming ecosystem on Android and
Tegra K1 is part of that investment. Shield is part of that investment. Our game works
team under Tony Tamasi is part of that investment as well. So this is a team of several
hundred engineers that work with game developers to bring content to those
platforms. So all of those things I think will build gaming on Android. And that's
where we can build a strong, defensible, proﬁtable segment for ourselves.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
You mentioned (inaudible) side and get back to that. But if I look at kind of the rest
of where Tegra is focused, how much do you see this as a tablet platform versus a
smart phone platform. And then how do we think about the kind of dual core and
quad core versions of the product out there?

Chris EvendenSo deﬁnitely more tablet than phone. We said that last year as well. And then Jammy
came along and we had a big phone. But I would say that, strategically, it's much
more focused on tablets. There's more room to diﬀerentiate the visual experience on
a bigger screen fundamentally. But yes, I'd put it that way.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
And dual core versus quad?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
It depends on the application. So it's hard to be speciﬁc about that. There's a certain
amount of what some generously call market texture. You come up with an eight-
core processor because eight cores are obviously better than four. And even though
you can't actually demonstrate that in any real-world sense, it works with the
consumers. Eight is a bigger number than four. And that deﬁnitely helps out. So
there are places for both types of architecture.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
And what is the importance of 64-bit for Nvidia? Is that another market texture kind
of thing, or is there actually real application (multiple speakers) really wanting to use
(multiple speakers) software?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So silicon is a chicken and egg situation here as well, that you need 64 apps to take
advantage of the architecture and they'll come on. But clearly the market is going in
that direction. At ﬁve years' time, we won't be having a debate about 32 bit versus
64 bit. Everyone will be on 64 bit for the whole range.
So the question is what beneﬁts accrue to being ﬁrst? I think we are ﬁrst. So I think
that will beneﬁt us in some sense. There will be apps that support 64-bit. And then
there's the fact that you can pitch to a consumer that you've got a 64-bit tablet and
the other guys only have got a 32-bit tablet. And so there's absolutely an element to
that. But absolutely as well there will be features and applications that will take
advantage of that 64-bit architecture when it's available.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Got it. Then I want to understand the modem strategy, because here there is an area
where you made an investment or an acquisition of Icera. You've deﬁnitely done
some proof points and last year you got CAGR certiﬁed. I think you -- that's been a
pretty big success.

Chris Evenden{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Can you talk about how critical the integrated modem versus the discrete modem is
to the overall mobile strategy for you?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
That's really diﬃcult. I thought you were going to ask me a much easier question. But
I think modems -- let me answer the easy question and then I'll change the subject
and we can move on.
The modems themselves I think are incredibly important. I think connectivity and
cellular connectivity is going to be crucial whether you're in cars, whether you are in
tablets, whether you're in a shield-like gaming device. Whether that needs to be
discrete or integrated is actually a much more diﬃcult philosophical question.
Integrated, the principal advantage of integrated is that it's cheaper. You can argue
also that there is a power segment. But the power segment is really trivial in any
meaningful sense. There's also a ﬂoor plan saving for integrated. But in the space we
play in, the ﬂoor plan is pretty darn big, from a 4.3-inch phone and up. So you really
are not too constrained about ﬂoor plans. So it stands for cost-saving. And again we
compete at the high end. So the relatively small cost saving again from that is not a
make or break feature.
Now, the advantage of going discrete is you can interact more quickly and you
reduce risk because you can iterate separately on two very complex processes at the
same time without impelling the schedule of the other. So where we play, discrete is
actually a good solution. Having said that, absolutely there are market segments in
which at some point you get down to where price becomes an imperative. And at
that point, then integrated becomes much more important.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Then I just want to kind of touch on the obvious question which is about design wins,
because I think we've had a couple of diﬀerent junctures in the past where you've
had performance leadership, you've blown away the competition in positive
performance, in diﬀerent kinds of performance metrics. But it really hasn't translated
into market share. So what gives you conﬁdence that this year is going to be the year
that's diﬀerent in terms of either tablet or smartphone design wins. And is it
something we should simply be looking at Mobile World Congress and Computex
beyond that and we should say ah, now I understand? Or how should we think about
the design win traction and more importantly the outward visibility of that?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. So we have pretty good visibility certainly into the phone side, less so into
tablets because they have a shorter product cycle. But it's diﬃcult for me to discussFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

Chris Evendenwithout verging on guiding the year. And I absolutely do not want to guide the year,
because that has proven to be more diﬃcult than we thought I think.
So we should have Tegra K1 32-bit devices shipping in the ﬁrst half. We should have
64-bit devices shipping in the second half. We should have Tegra 4i smartphones
shipping in the ﬁrst half as well. But in terms of numbers and stuﬀ, I don't want to
dive down that rat hole.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Understand. I think that K1 is the ﬁrst one where you've kind of introduced this
Denver core you talked about --
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
You've talked about this Denver core for a long time now. What does that really
bring to the table for developers, for consumers. And --
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
It's the ﬁrst 64-bit platform that is available. So it gives you the performance and
features of a 64-bit platform. It gives you the adjustable memory space of a 64-bit
platform. And I think we're ﬁrst to market with it. Certainly we're the ﬁrst to
demonstrate Android running on 64-bit. We'll see how that goes.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Does it kind of -- is there a threshold of performance for example in the automotive
market for the machine vision and that kind of stuﬀ where you couldn't have got
there if you didn't have 64-bit? Or what are the capital applications you can say now I
really crossed the threshold and that enables me to (multiple speakers) application?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
That's a really good question. I'm not sure I've got a very good answer for it. The
image processing is run on the CUDA course, because a fully programmable GPU is
a much more power-eﬃcient place to do image analysis than a CPU. And you've got
192 cores. So you're running a massively parallel problem like image processing, it
makes much more sense to do it on a GPU than on a CPU. I don't have any good
examples of how 64-bit enables diﬀerent platforms. I'm sure somewhere we do. And
I'll do some work on that and ﬁgure out -- get you some examples on that. But I don't
have it with me right now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

Kind of the next natural question related to this is, hey, you've got these other data
center players in Grid and Tesla. And etc. Now you have a 64-bit ARM processor
which is out in the market with a lot of performance. Why not go out there to be on
several markets with this?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So well, there's diﬀerent (inaudible). So our diﬀerentiation in service today is power
processing, through whether it's Tesla or grid, it is about the power processing.
That's the diﬀerent and that's where we can -- that's where we are succeeding. I
mean, look at where Tesla is. Tesla is growing very strongly. It grew 37% last year
year-on-year and I would expect it to carry on growing this year as well. And it's a
very, very proﬁtable business, as you know.
Grid, I don't have revenues to point you at right now. But it is -- the number of trials is
increasing. They increased over 40% quarter on quarter the number of trials. And so
the purchase cycle in enterprise IT is 18 to 24 months. So it's a while before that turns
into revenue. And I don't have a revenue number to point you at. But right now it
looks pretty interesting.
Going into like general ARM servers (inaudible) something like that, that you need a
diﬀerentiator in that. So Cavium and MCC would talk about their networking
infrastructures and AMD would at well to some extent and AMD would probably also
talk about their very real experience they have through years of their Opteron
business. So Intel is in there. Rumors are that QUALCOMM, Samsung. And a bunch
of other people are in that space as well. I think that's going to be a very hard-fought
space over a small number of customers as well.
So you look at the market and you think that sounds like a big market but actually
there's probably, after you've gone out of the ﬁrst three customers, it is suddenly a
much smaller market than you think. So that's a diﬃcult place to be. Never say never.
But right now that looks like a diﬃcult place to be.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
So no thanks for now.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
No thanks for now, yes.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Okay, got it. Automotive, that is one where you've clearly demonstrated some level
of traction with the Audi kind of self-driving car, the machine vision kind of capability.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

Chris EvendenAnd there you actually have given numbers. You've said I believe $450 million in
calendar 2015 I think from around $100 million that you did last year.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. It should go -- it's increasing at a very rapid rate. So I think what we said was --
what we did say is $100 million, $200 million, $400 million.
The other number we gave. And I mentioned this on the earnings call yesterday, is
we have about a $2 billion pipeline. And I think that's the number I am most
conﬁdent about because I don't know exactly when that $2 billion is going to arrive.
Its model is moving to diﬀerent quarters and so on. But the basic point being there's
billions of dollars of order commitments. orders (technical diﬃculty) technical term.
But commitments, design wins that we have in the pipeline. So that's obviously a
very good business but the product cycles are very long. We have a real
diﬀerentiation in that business as well, both with regards to processing for advanced
driver systems, which everyone is looking at. And also in terms of actually even the
raw graphics performance is starting to really matter in cars, whether it's how quickly
your nav system updates. If it announces many updates once a second, it's really
annoying. Or now we go moving to full digital dashes. So instead of having physical
dials and needles, you will -- actually it will all be pixels. And that's what Audi was
announcing at CES was -- part of what Audi was announcing the Tegra 3 was going
to be powering the next generation of digital cockpit. And there graphics actually
matters because the quality of their expense, the quality of your experience with the
car is now so heavily inﬂuenced by the quality of the (inaudible) that's around you
because that's your interface with the car to a large extent. And just as it used to be,
inlaid walnut and handstitched leather on a dash that said something about the
quality of the car, now it really is the quality of the pixels. Have I got an especially
good quality display. And I've experiences that myself when I look at cars and being
put oﬀ just because their electronics was wrong. So I think that's going to be a very
important diﬀerentiator for us.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Interesting. And related to that point, what are the sign posts we should look at to
say oh wow, I see where the design are coming from. Is it going to be just more auto
shows and more CESs to come?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. We've got design wins that people might not even announce this year because
it's (inaudible) design for so long. Our two largest customers right now are
Volkswagen Audi Group and BMW. So we are in the whole range of Audi cars I think
now from A3 on up. We in the Golf, Volkswagen Golf. We always have an interesting
debate with our marketing department because whenever they produce slides, they
like to put Tesla and Lamborghini on our automotive slides. But I would like to put
Golf on our automotive slides.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

James SchneiderWe are in BMW i3. We are going to be in the i8 when that is launched. We are in the
3, 5 and 7. We are in the Tesla obviously. We're in a whole bunch of other -- we are in
Skoda actually. So if there are Europeans in the room, they'll actually recognize the
brand. Well Skoda has come a long way. But my point being is we are not just in
Bentley and Lamborghini. It goes the full gamut. Then we have another couple of
major automotive manufactures that we haven't announced at all yet. So they are
part of that $2 billion pipeline as well.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Great. I want to shift to the core GPU business for a second. Maxwell is out there as
the product you said you were going to launch this year. And there's a lot of
speculation in the trade press about that being kind of relatively imminent. That's the
20 nanometer product.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
There's no personal growth reading those forms, you know that, right?
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
I know ﬁrsthand. But can you help us understand? I understand you don't want to
preannounce any products today. But understand (spagie) with macro, when it
comes and whether we should expect this to be kind of a traditional Nvidia launch
where it kind of starts at the high end and it waterfalls down to the (inaudible)?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
There's so much I want to say and absolutely nothing I can say. We'll talk about -- we
never talk about products before they are announced. You have -- and the GPU
market is a very, very competitive market. And the products are quite perishable.
Typically you have a six-month like cycle and then you're done and then you move
onto the next one. So you want to maximize every hour of revenue generating ability
that product has. So we literally, when we launch them, they're almost always actually
available in sale that day. And you don't tip your hand at all for the competitor
before you do it. So you'll ﬁnd out about Maxwell when it matters, when people can
buy it. It doesn't matter what I say about Maxwell right now because no one can buy
it anyway. So what matters is how competitive will Maxwell be when it launches. And
obviously I can make some empty statements about how great I feel it's going to be.
But you'll see when the reviews go live.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
I do want to ask about the notebook business, because that's still a material chunk of
business for you. You talked about the dynamic. But I want to ask you about the
market share because I think now is the time when you certainly have visibility as to
what happened for back-to-school, etc. So can you talk about directionally how you
feel about your notebook OEM share position as we head into the end of this year?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

So I do have visibility on that. I'm not sure I want to share too much about it. The
OEM -- because the other thing that introduces uncertainty in that is exactly when
OEMs refresh their lines. And so if they are all in the same cadence -- if they change
their cadence, then all my numbers will be oﬀ. So I probably shouldn't talk about that
with you because I don't actually know for certain right now. I know which design
slots I'm in and I know when they're scheduled to start shipping. And I know which
designs I didn't win. And I know when they're scheduled to start shipping. But I don't
know how that will translate into market share.
Then like I said, market share is data, that's great. But on the other hand, you've got
to be careful because it's very swayed by the large numbers of low-value units with
low proﬁts as well. So you can ﬁnd yourself -- in fact, we were in Q3 of last year, we
actually, according to the Mercury numbers, our market share went down. But our
dollar share clearly went up. So you have to be careful about -- the data is good. And
I don't want to steer anyone away from using data ever. But on the other hand I want
to caution people about reading too much into it because it can be misleading in
terms of market share for those units. And those units are -- you can have a GPU
that's $12 and is making 25% gross margins at the low end and you can ship 1 million
of those and hardly shift proﬁt dollars from one company to the other.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Yes. Switching to professional for a second then --
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Now we are talking proﬁt dollars.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Yes, exactly. Let's go from one extreme to the other. Quadro was actually pretty good
for you last year, I think. And I guess part of that --
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Best year ever actually for Quadro last year. Actually, it's a record. Yes.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
So I think part of that was the tablet refresh. Part of that arguably was just kind of the

-- (multiple speakers) use this, because that is the cyclical balance. So big growth
there for Quadro. So as we head into 2014, how should we think about does that
normalize, or do you see continued headwinds in kind of the overall market? And
what's the impact that we should think about in terms of the product launch not
anniversarying or whatever it is?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
RBC tells us we have 81% market share, unit share in Workstation. And we believe we
have over 90% dollar share. What that means is the market movements are more
signiﬁcant than share gains or losses in that. Now, we have a bunch of initiatives in
place to grow the market, intended to grow the market. But nevertheless the
dominant term in that equation, if you like, is where the market actually goes. And so
how can I use market data to predict where Quadro goes. Quadro, 80% of Quadro
revenues are CAD-based. So manufacturing GDP is generally a good -- as good as it
gets in terms of indicators of the way the business going to go. So I would look to
that. If you look at where manufacturing is going in the next 12 months, where do we
think that is going to be strong, that would tell you something about our Quadro
market. So I think it had been weak for some time and I think it sort of recovered to a
more rational level last year. So I don't see it normalizing back down again
particularly. But at the same time, I wouldn't want to guide you towards like 20%
growth or something. It's (multiple speakers)
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
It probably doesn't grow like it did last year. But it's growth.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you. You should be a press room communicator.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
I guess I want to ask about Tesla, because that's an area where I think it's hard for
investors to kind of see like what's really going on under the hood kind of buried in
the P&L that you report. We also know that it's lumpy, some of it's tied to kind of
supercomputing or very speciﬁc big customer builds. And some of it is more OEM
based. So how should we think about the Tesla business, how big was it last year and
kind of directionally what's going to drive the growth in 2014?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So we don't break it out separately. It grew a lot last year. It grew nearly 40% year-on-
year into last year. The thing that really excites me about the Tesla business, actually I
love the Tesla business. It's really broken out I think in a sense that for a couple of
years, it was puttering along at sort of level of $25 million a quarter or thereabouts.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

Chris EvendenAnd it's sort of puzzling to me because it was clearly -- you go to an HPC show and
there would be so much enthusiasm and so much passion and you'd see Tesla at
every booth, whether was IBM's booth or Supermicro's booth or Cray's booth, it was
there. And people were using it and the engineer -- the scientists and engineers in
their poster session would have all these incredible applications for Tesla. And it was
clearly (inaudible) and yet $25 million, $25 million, $25 million every quarter. And
now we've really broken out of that. And I think the reason we've broken out of that
is because two things, actually. One, we support the critical number of codes
because there is work that has to be done in taking a code from a regular
architecture PC to a parallel architecture like Tesla. And two, our channel now in
terms of Supermicro, Dell, HP, IBM, Cray, all those guys. So whereas in the past, a
year ago or 18 months ago, our Tesla team would have had to have gone in person
to the engineering ﬁrm and evangelize the product. And evangelize ﬁrst and then
sold and then shipped, right?
Now we are at a point where there could be a guy, a researcher at Johnson &
Johnson looking into protein interaction. And he knows he needs the molecular
dynamics, he knows that Tesla accelerated molecular dynamics code. He knows he
can get a Tesla server from IBM. So he just dials up the IBM salesman and it gets
delivered on Tuesday. It's a completely diﬀerent sale. And that's made a big
diﬀerence.
I think, in retrospect, that $25 million represented what our team was capable of
personally supporting directly. And now we've got all these other people supporting
us. And the announcement we made last quarter with IBM -- and the GM of our
business thinks it's the most signiﬁcant announcement we've made all year in the
sense that now you've got all of IBM's salespeople enthusiastically selling Tesla into
all their accounts, which is a pretty big deal. IBM is responsible for nearly a third of
the supercomputing installations worldwide. So that's pretty important. But also,
more interestingly, they are looking at applying GPU acceleration to all of their
enterprise apps as well. So this is a whole new market for us. So there's no -- this is all
a very long way of saying there's no reason not to believe that a strong growth at
Tesla would not continue. I would expect that strong growth to continue.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Got it. I'd be remiss not to ask any ﬁnancial questions. So I'll ask about gross margins
ﬁrst and maybe talk about capital return quickly. Gross margins, you've done a great
job of expanding gross margins, part of that -- over the past several years. Part of that
has been the Intel licensing agreement, which is all gross margin of course. But then
part of it has also been your foundry agreements allowed you to really kind of
basically take ownership of the yields on it.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
I think it's mostly mix actually, because if you think about how much we expanded
gross margins, before the previous ramp, our record gross margin was 46.3%. And
that was at a time that, frankly, that ATI hadn't produced a decent graphics card for
three years. So we had the market to ourselves. Now we are at mid-50s% basically.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

Chris EvendenWe were a bit lower last quarter but we've guided to recover slightly this quarter. So
now we are in the mid-50s%. And that 10 points of margin didn't come from just Intel
and better negotiation with our sole supplier for semiconductors. It's not an easy
negotiation, as you might imagine. It came from mix. We developed the Quadro
business. We developed the Tesla business. The gaming business is becoming more
and more proﬁtable as well. That GPU business is becoming more and more
aﬀordable. So there's a whole bunch of things that have pushed the margins up
1000 basis points in a couple of years.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
So from here, it sounds like you wouldn't expect any big structural kind of underlying
changes to drive it. It would be mix, as you said --
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
It's mix, right.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
(multiple speakers) gets more proﬁtable and professional mix grows and --
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes, exactly. The OEM business declining this year is a tailwind for gross margins.
Tesla growing at the tail end of margins. We will see what good it does. I don't know
what good it does. And we'll see how Tegra does as well.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Yes, capital returns. You've done a great job there. You've taken on $1.5 billion of
(inaudible) in the form of convert. Presumably that's going to be mostly if not all
share buyback.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
So how should we think about your appetite for doing even more beyond this?
Because clearly there is some ﬁrepower in the balance sheet.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes. So that $1.5 billion gives us ﬂexibility (inaudible) as well. So we said we would
return $1 billion this year. Dividends account for just, rough numbers, $160 million ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-02-13

James Schneiderthat, maybe $180 million of that, something in that range. And the rest will be share
repurchases at some point during this year, yes.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
And your appetite for doing more even than that?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
It's still there. It's still there. Like we said, there will be some left over at the end of the
year. And so let's reconsider, let's see where we are then.
{BIO 15753052 <GO>}
Great. With that, I think we are out of time. Thanks, Chris, for being with us.
