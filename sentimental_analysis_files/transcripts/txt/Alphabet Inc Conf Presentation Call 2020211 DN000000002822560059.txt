All right. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us this week. We are
very honored to have Thomas Kurian with us from Google. He joined Alphabet in
November of 2018. He assumed the role of CEO of Google Cloud and prior to
joining Alphabet, he was at Oracle, many of you probably have known him from his
years at Oracle, he was there for more than 20 years. So I'm going to read the Safe
Harbor statement ﬁrst, then Thomas is going to come up, he has got some slides to
go through and then we'll go into the ﬁreside chat and open it up for questions to
the audience.
So with that said, okay, so this is from Google. Good morning -- Alphabet sorry.
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to a conversation with Thomas Kurian, CEO
of Google Cloud. Some of the statements that Mr. Kurian may make today could be
considered forward-looking. These statements involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially. Any forward-looking
statements that Mr. Kurian makes are based on assumptions as of today and
Alphabet undertakes no obligations to update them. Please refer to Alphabet's Form
10-K for a discussion of the risk factors that may aﬀect its results. And Thomas, I
welcome you on stage, for what you take it from here.
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you, Heather. Thank you all for giving me the time to speak with
you. Our strategy at Google for cloud computing is to help organizations advance
and transform. I think there's clickers.

Here we go.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11

There you go. Is to help organizations in diﬀerent industries accelerate how they use
digital technology.
We do that with four important capabilities. Infrastructure, Platform, Solutions for
speciﬁc industries to help transform digitally, and our Expertise as Alphabet in
building and running some of the world's largest consumer services.
Let's look at what we're doing with each of these pieces. I'll start with infrastructure
as a service, then talk about our digital platform, talk about our industry-speciﬁc
solutions and our development organization or engineering function is organized
around these three principles. Okay.
So infrastructure. Our vision for infrastructure this last year, we have signiﬁcantly
expanded our infrastructure to a number of regions globally. We also have
introduced a number of new capabilities in infrastructure. I think we should switch
this -- it's -- okay. The -- so if you look at our infrastructure oﬀering, we brought in the
number of regions in which we can deliver infrastructure.
Second, we see infrastructure executing in four contexts; our data centers, what we
call public cloud; in a customer's data center, hybrid cloud, we introduced the
technology last year and we have a lot of customers now using it, Ruth mentioned on
the earnings call a technology called Anthos, which is seeing strong adoption, this is
to allow people to run our cloud inside their data center. We also oﬀer the ability to
run our cloud and orchestrate workloads and manage them in a consistent way
across their premise, Google's Cloud and other public clouds.
The beneﬁt to customers is twofold. Number one, you get to train your organization
on one technology. Second, you get to manage in a consistent way across multiple
cloud environments. And operationally, from a security and monitoring point of view,
that's signiﬁcant beneﬁts. Lastly, in a number of regulated industries, like ﬁnancial
services in Europe, where the regulators are concerned about concentration risk.
This technology gives people choice in how they can move workloads across
multiple platforms. And so we introduced this notion of multi-cloud and now when
you talk to large customers, they -- you will hear a lot about it.
Finally, we're bringing the same technology to a 5G network. To transfer a 5G
network from just being about bandwidth and connectivity to being an application
delivery environment. And so you'll see us providing a single platform across these
modes of execution.
From a why we win, the diﬀerentiation that we see a lot of the reasons why we win
are based on technology diﬀerentiators. First, we have deep support for core
enterprise workloads. Metro Group, the largest retailer in Germany runs their SAP
system on Google Cloud. And the reason is, they never have to take down the
system ever, either for patching, maintenance or upgrades, super important for aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 12retailer, that's running supply chain order management. We're the only cloud
provider, that provides that.
From a security point of view, Fortinet, Palo Alto, McAfee, Splunk a number of the
leading security companies use our cloud to run their own cyber oﬀerings. The
reason is our cloud is diﬀerentiated from the point of view how we handle cyber
security.
And lastly, customers in a number of industries are choosing us for the freedom and
portability that our multi-cloud technology based on a standard called Kubernetes,
which is getting a lot of attention in the developer community provides. An example
is ANZ Bank that uses it to run between their data centers and Google Cloud, a
hybrid environment, or BBVA, a large ﬁnancial institution in Europe which runs their
consumer banking system again between their premise and Google Cloud. There is
a number of these customers are very interested in having that deployment
ﬂexibility.
The second piece of our portfolio is our platform, we see three, four important
capabilities in our platform. The ability to build applications, to manage data at scale,
to do analytics, to use Google's AI and machine learning, and to collaborate with
people.
In each of these segments, we have diﬀerentiators not only technologically, but
capability wise.
Let's look at them just brieﬂy. For developing applications, we are the only cloud
provider that partners with open source companies. So if you are a company that
wants to build with the most popular open source tools, whether that's MongoDB,
Elastic, Conﬂuent, Redis, we announced the partnership last year, and we have a
number of companies using these technologies along with our platform.
If you want to do analytics, UPS came to us with a problem a year ago. And the
problem, they were trying to solve was when trucks breakdown, it is taking a long
time to schedule the ﬂeet, multiple hours, they wanted a solution to reschedule the
delivery vehicles. They're able to reduce that time from seven hours to a few
minutes, saving many, many dollars in terms of cost eﬃciency and obviously
improving customer satisfaction, because packages get delivered on time.
For those of you, who use the Gillette razor, the analytics on customer, supply,
demand forecasting that Procter & Gamble runs, runs on Google Cloud, the reason
they chose us and migrated from another cloud provider to us was because of
scalability and capability for analytics portfolio.
And lastly, if you listen to Hulu and you call their contact center. A software agent
answers the phone, improving the quality of customer service and lowering the cost
of customer service. That software agent is a Google software agent, that speaks aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 12natural language and can translate your questions in nine languages and eliminates
the need for a human being to have to wait for a contact center agent.
These are all examples of capability that we oﬀer around data processing that are
very diﬀerentiated in the market.
Lastly, as we observed how organizations were struggling to use Artiﬁcial
Intelligence and Machine Learning to both automate their business process and to
improve decision-making. We have now built a set of industry-speciﬁc solutions.
These are sold ﬁrst of all to a line of business executive, not to an IT audience, they
are priced based on value, not on the cost of the infrastructure, and they're very
highly diﬀerentiated because of the advanced capabilities that Google has in AI and
Machine Learning.
Let me give you just two or three quick examples. Uniqlo, a leading retailer wanted
to optimize its inventory, and the reason it needed to optimize inventories in the
past, people went to the store to buy a product. Now they order at home and want
to pick up in the store, the order at the store want to deliver home, and so inventory
has become much more ﬂuid. The cost of inventory is very high and they wanted an
algorithm to optimize, demand forecasting and what we called buy optimization.
They work with us to optimize that. Frankly speaking for most retailers, inventory
optimization is a huge issue and with the emergence of e-commerce is becoming
more complicated and helping them with their problem allows us to enter many
retailers with highly diﬀerentiated value proposition.
Recently, we announced a partnership with Lufthansa. Lufthansa wants to keep its
planes ﬂying on time and the biggest issue aﬀecting the ability to keep the planes in
the air and on-time is, how they schedule logistics for maintenance and crews when
the planes come into the airport. They use our technology for optimization to solve
this problem.
Lastly, if you are a media company, and you record sports, for example, one of the
things you need to do a strip out the advertising in the sports and optimize the
delivery of fragments of that information so that it can be rebroadcast. Our computer
vision is used by many media companies to optimize that. Because we are selling to
the line of business, we've also introduced a set of solutions that business users can
use to collaborate with one and other -- could you go back one slide please, to
collaborate with one and other, to build APIs, for example, to do analytics and to
build low code applications.
This allows us not just to sell outside of IT to business audiences, but it also gives
people the ability to build a vast -- large number of applications on our platform,
thereby, making our platform more sticky.
Our diﬀerentiators in this segment largely come to the unique capability that Google
has in understanding consumers and understanding buying behavior and also
optimizing AI.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 12Next slide, please. So if you look at industry-speciﬁc solutions. In retail, we obviously
understand a lot based on our search expertise, how to allow people to discover
products. Many retailers are working with us to improve product discovery, because
of our expertise in search. They would love to have the ability to take the inventory
that happens to be in the store and make it available to everybody so that they can
see what's available in the corner store rather than having to go online. That's an
example obviously, we have unique expertise in that area.
In media, if you look at lots of media companies that are moving to streaming, the
fact that we've built an infrastructure for YouTube allows us to diﬀerentiate the kind
of capability we oﬀer media companies. An example of a customer that looked at
our technology and other players and chose us with Activision Blizzard, because they
wanted advanced capability in the network.
And so in these areas, we have lots of diﬀerentiators. The result of all of this has led
to growth. I think you've seen that we've announced that we're at over a $10 billion
run rate, we're at 53% year-on-year growth, but Google Cloud platform is growing
signiﬁcantly faster than that 53% number. We are winning not just small deals, but
large deals and the representation of our success is also can be seen in the backlog.
Ruth discuss a lot of this on the earnings call, so I just want to reiterate it, and we are
very conﬁdent in the progress we're making.
Where are we focused going forward? Five important things: expanding our
addressable market; accelerating our direct sales force; growing the presence in
indirect channels; maintaining customers through a Customer For Life program to
lower customer churn. Let's look at each of these quickly.
Total addressable market. We've introduced a lot of products last year. As we've
introduced these products, they've expanded our reach. Hybrid cloud, we
introduced a product in April last year, we've got lots of customers now using it.
Multi-cloud, a value proposition that we oﬀer uniquely among all the hyperscalers,
lots of customers now are interested in it. This expands the market. When you look at
regulatory compliance, we now meet the regulatory compliance requirements in
many markets that lets us sell in those markets. We've introduced new enterprise
solution support for SAP, VMware, Oracle et cetera, making it easy for people to
move these workloads to us. And when you look at the maturity of our products, if
you look at the leading analysts, Gartner Group and Forrester Research combined,
we're in 20 Leaders quadrant. One of the other hyperscalers is in '20 and another
one is in fewer. So our product are now mature in a variety of these opening up our
ability to reach people.
Last year, we trained 750,000 developers, increased the number of certiﬁed experts
by 3.5 times. And today, if you're in the IT community, the highest-paid certiﬁcation
as measured by global knowledge is Google's Cloud certiﬁed professional. And that
reﬂects the demand people are seeing for our technology.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Here, our customers that have chosen to use us, we would not have been able to
serve, for example, the Department of Transportation or the Arizona government,
because we didn't have compliance certiﬁcations, now we do. We would not have
been able to serve for example Home Depot, because we needed to provide some
more capabilities from a product maturity point of view, they run their entire analytics
estate [ph] on our Cloud. And because we didn't have SAP before last year, we
didn't run somebody like Cardinal Health. So every time, we build a new capability
and we mature our products, it opens up new markets.
From a sales point of view, we've scaled our direct sales organization. We've said
publicly that we're going to triple the size of our sales force and we are well on that
way. While we have scaled our sales organization, we've also improved productivity.
So not only we added more people, each of them is also more productive. And we
have done that by bringing in a new leadership team, specializing our salespeople
by industry, so if you're a bank, you talk to somebody who understands banking and
building a set of solutions that are repeatable. I talked about our products so that
they sell based on business value, not just on IT feeds and speeds.
We have scaled our solution delivery capability, unlike some of the other players,
we're partnering with system integrators to deliver solutions, because they represent
capability that we don't want to build and it broadens our reach through them.
We've introduced enterprise support. Today, if you're a big customer and you're
worried about like Sabre, a super mission-critical system, we're very competitive in
enterprise support, you get 15-minute response time from us.
And lastly, we've done all the things that people are wanted on contracting, pricing
everything that enterprises want.
Finally, recognizing that we need to scale more quickly. We've expanded our work
with partners. So we look at our partners in four dimensions. Can they broaden our
reach?. These are resellers, value-added distributors, who can take us into more
countries and more market segments we can touch directly. Can they accelerate how
quickly a customer can consume cloud by delivering solutions, can they speedup
migrations, for example, we have a lot of work with managed service providers,
because many companies that outsourced IT, when they want to move to the cloud,
they say, I don't have the expertise to run and manage the infrastructure. So we have
lots of work going on with managed service providers, and then we have specialized
work with ISVs and partners.
To give you a sense, our year-on-year growth with partners in terms of revenue that
they inﬂuence grew 190%. They brought us 13 times as many new customers in 2019
than 2018, and we have seen strong growth in both certiﬁcations at partner-sourced
deals.
Here are examples of partners. Just to give you a sense of reach, last week, we
announced with Airtel, one of the largest telecommunications companies in India. A
plan to distribute our technology to hundreds of thousands of small and mediumFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Q - Heather Bellinibusinesses. Somebody that we would not be able to reach directly, but through
them, we are able to reach.
We also introduced for ﬁnancial services, a partnership with Temenos, a large
ﬁnancial institution ISV that many ﬁnancial institutions now ﬁnd that because they run
on our cloud, they can run it reliably, securely and with great uptime.
So going forward, you will see us focused on executing the plan that we've laid out,
which consists of focusing on large customers, we now on a global basis touch many
of the leading companies in the world in every industry, not only in every industry,
but in every geography.
Next slide, please. And if you look at many of the leading verticals, in retail, in
ﬁnancial services, and in communications. Many of the leading companies in those
industries use our cloud to transform their business.
So to summarize, our strategy is fairly simple. We see cloud as a vehicle to deliver
capability, new capability to organizations to help them transform digitally. We
focused on three important things infrastructure, our platform and industry-speciﬁc
solutions. In each of these segments. We have highly diﬀerentiated products,
allowing us to penetrate both the IT organization in companies, as well as the line of
business. And in many industries, the IT budget is controlled by business executives.
So it allows us to enter many companies more quickly with these oﬀerings.
Our products continue to mature, as I said, we are in as many leader squadrons as
everybody else. And that allows us to open more markets for our sales and our
partners, and we're very focused on going direct to a set of customers and then
through partners broadening our reach and we're very conﬁdent in the execution
plan we have through our direct and indirect channels.
I hope this gives you a view of what we're doing and we continue to be very focused
on growing this business as an important part of Alphabet's overall revenue growth
plan. Thank you.
With that, we'll take questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yeah. So why don't you have a seat, Thomas will go through a couple of these and
then we'll open it up to the mic runners in about 10 minutes and so. But ﬁrst of all,
thank you, it's a great presentation. I wanted to ask ﬁrst about you joined the ﬁrm as
CEO of Google Cloud a little over a year ago. What's been the most surprising to
you?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11

Page 8 of 12A - Thomas Kurian

The most surprising I think is the interest from customers in being able to work with
Google. The -- every customer we talk to says, we love the technology, amazing
engineering. We didn't have salespeople and customer service people that we
could work with, and the fact, that you built that capability now with a great sales
team, great customer service professionals. And these are people who come from
industry -- enterprise backgrounds, SAP, Salesforce, a variety of companies we've
been able to attract talent, that's been enormously helpful in reassuring customers
and that's reﬂected in the work we're doing with many of the large customers.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And if you look at the recent disclosure changes which I think we are all very thankful
for. Any views as to why you decided to kind of give those out when you did would
be interesting, but also you can see in the numbers that you reported that actually
Google Cloud is accelerated growth, is a lot of that due to the increasing -- increase
in sales headcount that you mentioned?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Yes. As we've added salespeople, large companies, if you're a Procter & Gamble, if
you're a Colgate, if you're a Whirlpool, if you're an Airbus, you want somebody to
talk to both on the sales side as well as on the customer service side. We've
introduced world-class people and it's partly because of our product strength,
Google's brand as an engineering leader, we're able to track some of the best sales
talent in the industry. And that gives customers conﬁdence that we're becoming
much more capable as an enterprise Company, that's why we're seeing the growth
in customer wins.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And if you look out kind of setting your business plan for the next couple of years,
right, next two or three years, what would you say are your top priorities? What are
the kind of top three things that Sundar is counting on you for in this business?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
I think on the product side, if you look at -- I'll just use ﬁnancial service as an
example. The CIO has a certain budget, but many of the programs are -- the
program budgets are controlled in retail banking by the Head of Consumer, Head of
Institutional, Head of Risk, et cetera. And so when we build these industry-speciﬁc
solutions, they're highly diﬀerentiated. No one has that capability, and that allows us
to sell, not just in IT, but to the business owners.
If you look at retail, it's a similar thing. We go to retailers and they ask us, hey, this
whole e-commerce thing is helping me grow, but the cost of shipping one T-shirt
from my store to the home, that's becoming a big cost driver for me. And if the
fashion cycles are fast, maintaining an inventory assortment of size, color, all that is
really going to be a huge cost driver. Can you guys help me optimize?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Q - Heather Bellini
A - Thomas KurianSo ﬁrst thing that we're very focused on is building that suite of industry-speciﬁc
solutions, because while there's AI and machine learning technology, most
organizations don't have the skillset with data scientists to build that. So the faster we
can do that, the more we can help customers.
Second, I think is we are building out in the platform area, things like data
warehousing as a service. We have really amazing technology that Google has built
for many, many years, which are being used at enormous scale. We're focused on
maturing and ﬁnishing out that product segment. And then lastly, we are super
committed to delivering that vision of multi-cloud. And the reason we believe that --
in that is that, most large institutions, most government agencies cannot go and sign
a contract where they're locked into a cloud provider before the technology that we
invented and gave into open source existed, you really had no choice. And so now
we are committed to making that vision possible.
I would say those are the three primary things on the product side. On the go-to-
market side, we are very committed to growing our direct sales and our partners.
And we've been very clear with the partners, we're a software and solutions
Company, we're not a services Company. So it attracts the big partners to work with
us, people like Accenture, Deloitte, a number of them, because they know there's
very clear lines of separation in what we do and how we partner with them.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So some people would say -- and again, now that you've given out the disclosure, it
helps contextualize this for people. But if you look at the size of AWS today, if you
look at the size of Azure, and now that we've got the numbers for Google Cloud, we
can look at that. Some people would argue it's too late, right? So the market has
already been decided. What's your take on that? How early are we really, and how
do you see your opportunity to kind of close the gap over the next ﬁve or ten years?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
So great questions. Three important things I would say. If you look at Intel server
shipments, which is a proxy for compute in 2018 and 2019, 80% of the shipments still
went to on premise data centers. That is not counting the percentage of servers
already sitting there that are amortizing. So if you assume that, that is a proxy for
where the estate of IT sits, it's super early stages, number one.
Number two, if you look at the market of where cloud is, I tell people, if you went
back to 2000 and ask somebody what's cloud? They say, it doesn't exist, a thing in
the sky, but they were using cloud, it was called Software-as-a -Service, Salesforce
NetSuite, Intuit. Most of those were about convenience. The same thing, you could
get on premise but delivered in a more convenient way, because you didn't have to
do the upgrades and all of that yourself.
Then if you went forward to 2006 and looked at cloud, that was the emergence of
infrastructure-as-a-service. And infrastructure-as-a-service was not -- was shut down
your data center and use mine and most of it was an economic argument, cost-
eﬃciency. It will be cheaper and more eﬃcient if you run it in mine. Where peopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Q - Heather Bellini
A - Thomas Kurian
Q - Heather Belliniwant cloud to be is not about those two things. It's really about, can you give me new
capability that I could not get before? And so when we look at the market, number
one, we are very focused on executing our plan. Lateness, earliness, I don't worry
about that, as I tell people, for those of you, who watch the game between Kansas
City and the Houston Texans, nothing against Houston, a great team. If you looked at
the end of the ﬁrst half, I think somebody would have chosen a particular outcome, I
don't think it turned out that way.
So we're very conﬁdent, we are not distracted by anybody telling us about where we
are in the market, we are focused on executing. When we win customers and when
customers say, what you're oﬀering is truly unique, we're very conﬁdent in executing
that plan. And we don't think the way the cloud and the market looks like three years
out, is going to be the way it does today.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And open source, you have a unique way, you're going about partnering with
people with companies in the open source community that is very diﬀerent than
what AWS is doing, diﬀerent than what Microsoft is doing. What are you -- I mean,
maybe it would be helpful, maybe not everyone in the audience knows to say how --
to talk a little bit about how you're partnering with them and how that might be an
attractive opportunity for maybe to people to start building companies on top of
your platform ﬁrst versus others.
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Open source technologies at the heart of them, it's where the developer ecosystem
lives. Each of the successful open source projects are driven by a community of
developers that love that open source project and want to use it in enterprise
context. So what we have done is we said, if an open source company builds, invest
and puts a lot of resources in both building a product and a community, they should
have a distribution model that protects their future revenue stream. So what we've
done with the leading open source companies Elastic, Conﬂuent, Redis, MongoDB, a
number of them, is take that open source technology, we help them build a cloud
service, because people who want to use the open source technology don't want to
have -- to have the operational burden of running the service. Customers gets, you
can use your existing Google credits to consume the service. We handle through our
experts called site reliability engineers, the ﬁrst line support and we share the
revenues with the partners.
Obviously, that is a very diﬀerent strategy in some of the other cloud providers are
doing, where they're building their own solutions and becoming a threat to the open
source community. So our goal is to foster that innovation, to attract developers and
our long-term view is that platforms that win are diﬀerentiated, not by the solutions
that the platform provider provides. But by the ecosystem of solutions that run on
that platform. And so it's not just a near-term thing, it's a long-term strategic bet that
the platforms that win are not those that are diﬀerentiated just by the cloud provider
solutions, but by the ecosystem of best-of-breed solutions available on it.

We've got about ﬁve minutes left. Does anyone have any questions for Thomas?
There's one right back, sorry, go ahead, Melissa.
Hi, Thomas. Thanks for your remarks. You talked about software-as-a-service. What
are the sort of ambitions for Google in software-as-a-service?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
So when we -- when you look at our industry-speciﬁc solutions, what we're trying to
do, a lot of investment has gone in business process automation, right, ERP, supply
chain, logistics, whatever it is. We are not trying to replace those solutions, because
the business process implementations take years, they're very long cycles, there is a
lot of cost associated with it going to a customer and telling them please rip out your
supply chain. However, what we are doing is helping them using our data analytics
and machine learning extract data from these solutions and be much more
intelligent in how these applications function.
Let me give you a concrete example. Macy's as a customer of ours. They wanted to
optimize how they do their supply chain. They were told by ERP vendors that it's a
long project, because they would have to re-implement their ERP system. The reason
that their supply chains were not eﬃcient is because a lot of the supply calculations
were being done based on rules rather than based on AI models.
We have helped them keep their existing supply chain application extract the data
from it, use our machine learning and AI platform and analytics platforms, and
optimize their distribution center in terms of eﬃciency. We were able to do it with
them for the ﬁrst distribution center between June and August last year. Much
shorter time window, but delivering extremely high value from them -- for them,
because we it helps them optimize a big cost item in their overall revenue line.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right here.
Since you referenced the NFL playoﬀ, there were an awful lot of AWS commercials I
mean, really a lot. I mean, what do you think about that strategy of mass advertising
in order to keep the market share gain I guess?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
We've got a very focused demand generation program, digital demand generation,
where we're expanding top-of-funnel online and then bottom-of-funnel conversion.
We've hugely optimized our spend as well as our eﬃciency in that area and we're
driving that digital demand to our own organization, meaning sales teams as well as
to partners. I think, given -- I think you would expect Google, given our experience in
advertising that we would know how to do digital reach pretty well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-11

I'm going to wrap up with one last question. Just you made an acquisition of Looker,
I guess maybe over the summer, if I recall correctly. How do you think about M&A
supplementing the technology capabilities that you already have? How do you think
about putting the pieces together, that you think you're going to need to continue to
innovate and diﬀerentiate over the next 10 years?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
We've been -- we've done not just Looker, which -- but a bunch of smaller
acquisitions. We look at the -- at our ability to expand our reach through
complementary products in the market segments we're in. And one of the beneﬁts
of scaling our direct and indirect distribution is, when we acquire something, we now
have a much more scale distribution channel through which to inject the technology
into market, thereby allowing us to accelerate things. So we are very focused on
executing our plan, we are not dependent on acquisitions to grow you've obviously
shown that. And we'll make acquisitions appropriately when the time is right.
