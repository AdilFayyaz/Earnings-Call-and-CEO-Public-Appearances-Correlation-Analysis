Welcome to the Bloomberg Intelligence and Fishbowl Analytics Restaurant Webinar;
Turbulence Ahead for Restaurants-Strategies for Navigating the Storm and Beyond. I
have the pleasure of being -- my name is Michael Halen, I'm a Restaurant Analyst
here at Bloomberg Intelligence, and I have the pleasure of being joined by Mike
Lukianoﬀ, who is the Chief Analytics Oﬃcer at Fishbowl; Pete Bell, Senior VP of CRM
at Fishbowl; and Gary Levy, CPA. He is the Head of the Hospitality Industry Practice at
CohnReznick.
So, quickly a few housekeeping notes. Today's presentation will be recorded and will
be available for playback. At the bottom of the slide window, you'll notice that you
can adjust the volume and maximize your screen. We recommend you do so for best
quality. Feel free to ask questions using the Q&A panel to the right of the slides. We

will be distributed via email following the presentation. Additional questions can be
sent to bievents@bloomberg.net.
So, for those of you that aren't familiar, Bloomberg Intelligence provides analysis and
context on diﬀerent industries, companies, government, litigation, economic and
credit factors. It's Bloomberg's in-house research product. We provide broad
coverage and tons of data for our clients. BI EATS GO is where you can ﬁnd our
restaurant analysis.
So, I'll give a quick industry backdrop before looping in our esteemed panel. So,
according to MillerPulse data, restaurant industry sales have been in a slide since
posting a strong weather-aided result back in January. Two-year stacked same-store
sales have fallen sequentially in ﬁve out of the last six months as consumer budgets
are crimped by higher rent, healthcare, student loan and mobile and Wi-Fi costs. On
top of that, the gap between eating at home versus away from home hit a record
high.INITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

Page 2 of 25Mike Lukianoﬀ
Gary LevyThis is motivating cost-conscious consumers to cook for themselves and bag their
lunches instead of visiting restaurants. The gap is being fueled by higher wage rates
across the country. Restaurants are labor-intensive as we all know, so this puts them
at a disadvantage to packaged food manufacturers that can aggressively pass
cheaper commodity costs onto their consumers.
Many restaurants faced with a higher waste cost, opted to raise menu prices, and we
think that's a large reason why we are seeing this drop in restaurant traﬃc.
Discounting is persistent and shows no signs of slowing. Some fast food chains that
have been trying to move away from low price value deals like Wendy's and
McDonald's are seeing an immediate slip in traﬃc. And ﬁnally, baby boomers,
they're retiring, and they're starting to live on ﬁxed budget, so this is creating
another headwind. It should curb discretionary spending from this mash -- from
discretionary spending from this generational cohort, putting greater pressure on
restaurants and, in particular, casual dining.
So, Mike, it doesn't look great out there. How did restaurant chains survive
downturns in the past and what's diﬀerent this time?
I think that if we look at the industry and we sort of separate out, say, the large
national chains from, say, regional and local independents, if we think of how the
large national brands have reacted to downturns in the past, really the playbook was,
go on national media with big discounts, backﬁll some of your weaker markets to
prop up traﬃc, and do some cost-cutting, right. And really that national media would
really help them to be able to keep their head above water. Meanwhile, the local and
regionals who's more of a defensive play, so, yeah, they didn't have those kinds of
budgets to be able to compete, so they've really batten the hatches, play cost
control.
What was diﬀerent was -- what's interesting is that the other -- in the past, it's been
really -- it was really the age of the big national brands, and what we've been seeing
is that a lot of the small chains and regionals have gotten lot more prominence,
largely because of so much more localized media. So, through whether it's social or
local, digital and so on and so forth, they're able to compete more at a local level,
which I think is going to be interesting to see how chains are going to be able to use
this -- if they use the same playbook, or are they still going to be able to prop
themselves up, or are they going to continue to lose more share to these, say, super-
regionals and locals.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
And then if I could just add to that, I mean, consumer tastes are changing and I think
it's all about staying relevant, right. When was the last time you haven't been in an
independent restaurant where they didn't have (inaudible) on the menu, right. And
that's what consumers are wanting. The demographics are all changing as you wereINITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

Mike Lukianoﬀsaying. So, you have to stay relevant or you are going to lose market share to people
who are on top of it.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
And which is also the question of the discounting, right. So we still see, for about
10% of the population, they're very active in responding to discounts, but call it 90%,
maybe 80% of the population may -- everybody likes some price oﬀ, but it's not
necessarily the primary motivating factor.
When the chains, especially locally that are looking more at what the experience is
and changing the experience and adapting to tastes, aren't as subject to having to
do with the price discounting, which really commoditizes these brands. So, when you
see the big discounting across the board, single message nationally, they're really
commoditizing themselves and leaving themselves open to those change that you're
talk about, Gary, that are much more relevant within their local trade areas.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
I agree. And discounting takes all forms. There are discounting available for the
independents, so that large chains can do it for the 2 for 10s, but you see companies
like Groupon as a way to get discounts in independents. Sorry for going oﬀ topic.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
No, no, it's great. So, to continue on that topic, Mike, it seems that, like I had
mentioned, most fast food chains are having trouble moving away from these low
price points, but we all know this isn't sustainable. So how do restaurants manage
their pricing and promotions to kind of gain some share in this type of an
environment?
Well, I think it starts with recognizing who your customers are, who will respond to
the discount. Brands that get in trouble are the ones that try to rip oﬀ the band aid all
at once and say, oh, we're too dependent on the discount, so let's go cold-turkey,
right. That's a sure formula for disaster, because the truth is, years of doing the
discount, you've trained your customers into a certain behavior, and in fact you've
increased the customer mix that responds to the discount.
If you can get more attuned with, say, contextual advertising on these kinds of things,
understanding what people want to buy, what their tastes are, and go more to the
total experience, and bifurcate who is responding to what kinds of discounts versus
who is responding to experiential oﬀers and that kind of thing, new -- be the ﬁrst to
taste our new limited time oﬀer product, these kinds of things. New technologies
and new media channels are enabling this. So, you don't have to do the blanket
across the board 2 for 20 or what have you, where everybody gets a discount just for
continuing their normal habits.INITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

Pete Bell{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
So, Gary, in your experience, what are the best practices for restaurants when the
market turns?
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
When I think about that, to me best practice is the best practices. You should be
doing that consistently throughout your business, right. And, since we come from the
math side, staying on top of the numbers on a regular basis, having your team all
growing in the same direction, being very conscious and aware of what your core
values are in the marketplace.
The diﬀerentiators may be, if the market turns, I'm not going to be as experimental,
maybe looking at what's really performing well on the menu, not add things that are
diﬀerent or new, maybe looking closer at cutting back a position where I can just to
pay more attention to strategy of where I can maximize dollar. If I have the menu
item that the chef loves or -- but no one is buying it or it's labor-intensive, maybe I
eliminate that to focus more on the dollars. Where -- when things are really well, all
right, we'll leave that on. So, you got to stay true to best practices, good governance,
good communication. No matter what's going on in the macro environment, you just
may have to sharpen the pencil a little bit more as you go.
Yeah. And, I think, Gary, the thing that you also need to focus on, as you said, you got
to stay to your best practices. The worst mistake, though, you can make is when the
quality of the product you're delivering, because of the size of the menu, is not what
the guest expects, as well as the service, because in these downtimes, when people
have limited dollars to spend each month to dine out, they want to make sure that
that experience is a great experience. They don't want to have buyer's remorse,
because the service was oﬀ or the quality of the food was not what they expected.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Pete, during sales slumps, marketing spending tends to get cut, especially in
franchise system, so how can restaurant companies most eﬀectively target their
customers and optimize their ad budgets?
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
Yeah, I think the ﬁrst thing that restaurants need to do today is really understand who
their guests are. And when I look back in my career, even going back ﬁve years ago,
we didn't have the data resources we have today or the analytics companies that
could help us to pull that data together and to understand it to truly understand who
our guests are. So, I hope -- I feel that that's a starting point. Before you just go in
and start slashing budgets or optimizing budgets, just make sure who the guest is.INITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 25Michael Halen
Pete Bell
Mike LukianoﬀIt's not just that media buying demo like adults 25-54, today we can understand not
only demographics, psychographic, life stage, media, channel preferences, et cetera.
So, by understanding this, instead of slashing budgets, we can go in and really
optimize the budgets, right. We can still use television and radio, but the right
channels are right day parts that our guests are interacting with, and also with all
these new channels that are available to us making sure we're on those channels that
our key guest segments are engaged with.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
And with the declining sales, do you think some of these chains should look at
cutting their marketing budgets or should they focus more attentively on getting that
media mix optimized?
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
No, I deﬁnitely think it's getting that media mix optimized. I mean, what we've seen
in the past is that the brands that continue to spend can improve market share
versus those that cut the budgets. And, I mean, cutting the ad spend, basically you're
taking yourself out of the guest consideration set, right, you've gone dark on it.
I think really what it comes down to is, reevaluating your media mix, so you can get
more eﬀective and eﬃcient in reaching them. So, again, as I said, it's, are you buying
the right stations on television or radio or the right day parts. Move dollars out of
some of those traditional mediums and move them into the non-traditional new
channels that are out there on the digital online world. Even when you think about
what you do as a company with SEO and keeping yourself out there, I mean, all
generations, young and old, they're all using the Internet to research purchases. So,
you need to constantly be out there in front of your guests or someone else is going
to grab them.
The old adage in media is, I know that half of my marketing budget is working, I just
don't know what half, right. That's in an age of lack of data and information, right.
The whole world has changed, right, that's not an excuse anymore, right. I mean,
people have started building media mix models 20 years ago, right, and the data
has just improved over time. As we get new channels with more robust datasets, it
becomes predictive. There is no longer the excuse to say, I don't know what my
media budget is doing, right.
So, I think that -- and there are chains that do it very well, but there's a huge swap of
the industry that really isn't even collecting the data, having the discipline to analyze
it, to really understand what the return on one of their largest expenditures is. So, I
think that that's a huge opportunity. Downturn or upturn, it's a big opportunity to
optimize.INITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

Right. And I mean, I think, Mike, most brands today don't have the kind of budgets
that -- if you look back 10 or 15 years ago that they had to even going with that
mentality of half of my advertising is working, I just don't know which half, right. So,
the more kind of laser focus you can get in reaching your guest is the approach
that's going to get you the best results.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
And, Pete, you said earlier, know your guests, right, to stay on top of what your
guests is? There were some great data analytic tools or something with the POS
systems or some other companies that do this that can provide you great data on
your guests, who that guest is, his frequency, when his birthday is, what bottle of
wine he likes, so you can do strategic marketing to them. And without the media
vibe of more strategic like in social media, and even email, if you're collecting that
data, all right. I guess email is outdated now, so Instagram or whatever (multiple
speakers) Snapchat.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
It's still in use, but I mean that's a perfect example. Today versus ﬁve, six years ago,
think about all the diﬀerent sources of data we can pull via online reservations. We
have our POS, our payment data, we have loyalty program data, we have email data,
right. So, we're pulling all of this data together, which some of it existed years ago,
but we mostly looked at POS, we looked at things like menu mix where we're
looking at high level traﬃc by day part, by day of week et cetera, we weren't really
taking that data, pulling it together, and drilling down to understand who the guest
is.
Knowing that guest, and when I talk to CMOs, most CMOs say their biggest pain
point is they don't know who their guests are. Knowing that guest then oﬀers up
what you said, should I -- are we doing stuﬀ on Snapchat, what media, what online
channel should I be on, because if I know where my guests are, those are the
channels on --
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
And what strategies can I implement to draw them back in.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Absolutely.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
It's more expensive to capture a new guest and to keep one that consistently comes
back. And I think that puts candidly the independents at an advantage, because theyINITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

Pete Bellknow the community better than no one in the community. They know they're -- they
are there saying hello to people who is working. If the chains can get the training to
the staﬀ about treating the guest that way, I think that evens the playing ﬁeld,
because they do have more dollars to spend on the strategic marketing.
I think the advantage of what you see with how people are messaging and the
mediums they are using, think about it, the locals or these small regionals because of
size of budget, they're forcing these new local channels, right. They have to do more
non-traditional because they can't aﬀord to do broadcast buys.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
I mean, let's face it, people aren't looking at their mobile device, standing in front of
a Chili's to see what the rating of that Chili's is, right. They're looking at it to see if
there's something better down the street, right. And now you can know that and you
can trust it by these other -- whether it's Yelp or whatever the channel is, or Facebook
or what have you, and what are my friends saying about something that's half a
block away. And that's a challenge that used to be, I've got enough media to blanket
the whole nation and say, I am this brand, and this is what I stand for. But now that's
being accomplished at a very local level, right, a resurgence of the local
independents.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
You are right. (multiple speakers) tremendously inﬂuential when someone is trying to
make a decision, especially if they -- from out of town and they don't know that
restaurant brand or name, right.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
Right. So, when you can actually get to people when they're going to make a
decision, right, which is more and more becoming mobile, then you can inﬂuence
that. Instead of just going to the TV and radio and saying, here's my blanket message
across everywhere and I can get it for cheap, well, one thing I can predict, right,
there's a few things that are predictable on restaurants, right, I can predict when
you're going to get hungry almost every day, right, pretty well.

(multiple speakers) much as 12 to 2, right.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
And I also can predict that if you're not within a certain proximity of a restaurant, it's
not your consideration set, right. And those are the two most simple things that a lotINITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

the TV and radio, right, but you can accomplish this through phone.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
That's right, but that I think we are very in the infancy of where that's going to go and
how that's going to happen, right.
But I think that again is getting to a point where restaurant companies are using data
to understand who the guests are, because that's how you're going to reach them in
that mobile device. You're going to reach them on the channels that they engage
with every day on that mobile device.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
I agree with that.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Gary, with so much of the industry being run by sophisticated investors, how do you
think that's going to change the equation this time? From what you're hearing from
your contacts, do you think chains are going to cut that cost and other expenses to
hit quarterly targets, or are they going to continue to invest in the long-term health
of the brand?
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
I think that's a double-sided answer. I mean, if you're focusing on maximizing the
return, because you are a public company and you've got to meet quarterly earnings
for what you told the Street, you may make decisions to focus on meeting that short-
term goal. The more sophisticated investors, the private equity funds, even the large
independents that are multi-unit independent companies, they're focusing on the
long-term, right, and we are not going to sacriﬁce to hurt our brand. We will invest
back into our company if it's investing in human capital or reinvesting back in the
site.
And we'll absorb a lower EBITDA return, almost like a hockey stick approach,
because we know the long-term play is to keep the brand strong, take advantage of
what's going on in the marketplace, and when things turn, we're going to be even
better oﬀ, right. And I think that's the right strategy. Absolutely, the way -- if you want
to be standing whenever the same-store sales come back, you have to do that, right.

The ones, I would say like this, there are a bunch of private equity funds that really,
really understand this business and they're investing in right now. They love the fast
casual arena that are growth concepts. And when they make these investments in
these growth concepts, they realize there's going to be a dollar investment in
technology, human capital systems, because they are investing in the foundation of
the business, no diﬀerently when you build a house.
You want a great foundation so that the thing can grow on its own. The great
example I will think about is, you may have enough people to run a 20-unit
restaurant company, do you have enough people to run a 200-unit restaurant
company? And are those the right people and the right seats on the bus, right? And
if you do that right in the beginning, think how easy it will be to open up more
stores. Some restaurant chains, they open up 100 stores a day. I have clients that take
some three years to open one restaurant. So that's a human capital, right, intellectual
capital equation?
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
So I would imagine this would create some opportunities for long-term investors in
this space. So I guess what kind of opportunities can people with a long-term view
look for in a downmarket?
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Okay. So, I don't know if there is a some way to answering that, there is a lot of talk
about same-store sales being down absolutely. But I don't know if we're necessarily
in a down market when you look at the valuations of privately-held companies that
are doing transactions in the arena, because there's still a -- valuations are high,
driven by the fact that there's still a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines.
So, from that side, I don't know how long that's going to take for that to change. I
think that is going to change, because if the economics aren't working, people are
going to pull back on the valuations, right. I've never seen a spreadsheet that
doesn't go straight up. Projections, I'm still waiting for the one that shows the
(inaudible) going back, right. You all think they don't. [ph] But the --
I am guilty of it too.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
I am aware of this -- everything is beautiful, which is a nice way to look at the world.
But the -- what opportunities are there? And there are a lot of them. I mean, there is
deﬁnitely an opportunity on human capital, ﬁnding great people, right, because
they're out there, compensation is going to change, there's going to be an inﬂux inINITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 25Michael Halen
Mike Lukianoﬀthat. So, there will be an opportunity, and you will see, I think, people who want to
have great careers that are passionate about the brand that want to be part of a
winning strategy and an exit -- leave to go to those brands that get it right, what's
really relevant, what's hot.
Millennials, they wouldn't -- I don't want to -- they don't go to casual dining
restaurants, because they don't want anyone know they are in there, right. But they'll
go to the cool hip (inaudible) or a Tender Greens or any of those things that are
really -- can seem to be really relevant and cool. They want everybody to know they
are there. I see that with my kids all the time and they will never -- so, I think that's it.
The other thing is real estate. You'll see deﬁnitely some opportunities in real estate.
Right now rents are astronomical. It's almost like, what, how much should I have to
pay per square foot. That math doesn't work. But you will see those opportunities
absolutely come out there in the marketplace, and you will see, I mean, there's still a
lot of lenders in the space, there are lot of them.
And so I think you'll still see some opportunities to that. But you'll be able to
renegotiate deals even with your vendors and go on and on about like these are the
10 things you should be really thinking about, but you can go back to your vendors,
you can go back to your landlords, you can go back to your investor group and say,
we have to make a strategy that aligns with (inaudible) core values and the economic
platform, because we're building good to great, a quote of Jim, I'll just keep quoting
him as a model [ph].
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Actually the clients will appreciate that. Mike, so oﬀ of that point, is 5% to 10% unit
growth smart in light of today's real estate market? It would have been -- would
some of these chains be better served maybe to pull back a little bit in light of sales
sliding [ph]?
Yeah, I think, and especially as Gary was mentioning about leases, build-out cost and
all that, there's such pressure for new unit growth, right, because everybody's
projection these days, and to support the valuation, you got to have a lot of new
units out there. We've done a lot of site modeling and what I'll say is that, it's looking
a lot more like, I hate to say, but 2007 out there in terms of seeing the same chains,
all the chains looking at the same sites and lot of competition to get into A, B and
even C locations.
So I would say, be realistic about, ﬁrst of all, what your projection would be for a new
unit, and don't be afraid -- don't be afraid to pass on a unit where if you sit down and
do the math on it, pass on it. I would venture to guess that in -- if you think of the
people who signed leases in 2007 versus the people who signed leases in 2010, it
was a lot more -- a lot easy to sustain something that was signed in 2010, right, and I
think that things are looking a little top-heavy in terms of leases right now.INITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

Gary LevySo, I think the smarter brands are going to ﬁgure out how to slow some of the unit
growth right now, pass on the deals and wait for some of these that are going to -- I
think it may come back to them when you start seeing some units that never made
box economics sense start to close.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
I agree with that. I think you should be strategic in your site selection. You do have,
and you also have the ability to go back to these landlords and say, especially in the
larger shopping areas (inaudible). You want me in this place, right, you're going to
give me TI money to build it out, sort of $20 a square foot, I want $100 a square foot.
So, it's going to lower my CapEx to get back into the store and help improve that
return on invested capital, and I'm going to go back to the smart portfolio backed
restaurants. The management teams are going to be very selective about what site
to check. The thing is, they do have -- they want to grow, they have to grow, right. So,
bunch of guys, similar brands competing for the same spot. And the smart landlords
are like, yeah, we'll have this brand, if you don't want it, I'll give it to him, done.
(inaudible)
Yeah, what I ﬁnd interesting (inaudible) food chains publicly traded anyway are
talking about cutting back on developmental or even, for example, Buﬀalo Wild
Wings. Marcato, I thought did a nice job with their presentation, their Activist
presentation for Buﬀalo Wild Wings, but that wasn't even brought up, which I found
curious.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
Yeah, but if you read the M&M, which I'm sure you do, there's a lot of companies that
are shuttering stores, a lot of them, which is normal course of business. I think that'll
be a good thing in the long-run. I mean, I never like to see a business close, but I
think that's the right thing and market share will be won by the more -- I think,
relevant brands is what the consumers want.
And that's an important thing to think about too, right, is the relevance, right. When
we start talking about -- so talking -- speaking of like box economics, right, so when
we talk about wage rate increases and minimum wage and healthcare and all that
kind of stuﬀ, it makes full service dining, especially the -- as if casual dining and
casual dining bar and grill didn't have enough to worry about, that makes the
economics of that business even tougher.

that, we're going to go from $9 an hour now in three and a half years or about three

now that same person is going to be making over $900 an hour. That I've -- never in
the history of the minimum wage have we seen such dramatic increases.
I don't know, Halen, we could spend some time talking about this too. How does a
restaurateur or any business for that matter absorb such a high increase? You were
going to have to pass on price. I don't know how you can pass it. We talk about
technology, right, which gives a whole bunch of (inaudible). So, we're going to have
that and I said this on our phone call, we're going to have the age of the Jetsons
where you walk in, someone comes on the screen to take your order and it comes
out by conveyor belt, which is not any place I want to go either, at least not now, but -
-
I think along the lines of passing on price, right, I mean, 10 years ago, any time there
was a minimum wage, we kind of knew and have done a lot of price work over time,
kind of knew when minimum wage increases were happening. It was a great time to
actually pass on price. And more often than not, you could pass on 80%, 90%, even
close to 100% of the wage increases through to price, because what was happening
was that that lowest economic consumer was actually a big consumer particular to
QSR and so forth. So, they had money -- more money in their pocket while prices
were going up, so the economics kind of worked out kind of well, right, depending
on where you were in the spectrum of food service.
What we're seeing now is a much diﬀerent environment and we've seen -- we work
with a lot of diﬀerent chains, and even within the same chain, somebody who tries to
pass on minimum wage one of these days and does it traditionally across the board
pricing, all units going up at the same amount, they're getting pounded with traﬃc
erosion, right. It's a more -- we've also seen, though, that if they can really strategic,
not try and pass on all of the minimum wage, ﬁgure how to stage then over time,
they can mitigate a lot of the potential traﬃc erosion and keep some of that. But the
problem is, they still can't get a 100% of that through. So there's got to be other
strategies that need to be employed.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Especially your point that you made earlier that consumers are going to say, all right,
I'm not going to go out, I'll make it at home, because there's such a big diﬀerentiator
or I'll trade down from table service to fast-casual.INITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

Yeah, that's what we saw in 2009, right, fast-casual bled casual dining, because
people traded down. And I think part of that, Mike, is not just what we took in price,
right, that eroded traﬃc, but the other areas where you could start to cut cost in the
quality of the food, right, the food cost, lower those and the labor. So, the service --
so it's sort of a double-edged sword, right. If you don't want to take it all and pass it
through on price, and you cut other areas where the quality and the service now
begin to deteriorate, it's going to erode the traﬃc as well.
Well, and you start to homogenize the line between fast-casual and casual dining,
right, because the more -- if I walk into a fast-casual, I sit down at the table and I can
order there and the food comes out to me, what a great experience, I'm real happy,
right, you are just elevated and I might even be willing to pay a little bit more for
that, right. But if I walk into a full service, place where I expect the waiter to come in, I
sit down and I place my order on a tablet, right, and then I pay on the tablet, if I want
my server, I've got to press the button that lights up and says, somebody wants you
over here, right, that just -- that was just a major step down (inaudible) with it. Yeah.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
Right. That's like, right, the exponential diﬀerential.

So what do you think we'll see, between proposals for $15 federal minimum wage
and one of the candidates wants to see the tip wage rate eliminated completely, how
well these -- if these policy changes are made, what do you think the impact is going
to be? Are we going to see more technology in the restaurants or are there going to
be capital investments in kiosks and server handhelds and the like?
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
The answer to that is, you're going to see a lot. Yes, absolutely technology will be in
the marketplace. Somebody sent me a link to a video of a robot ﬂipping burgers,
and I was thinking, wow, right. That burger can -- it shows up, never calls in sick, don't
have to give him beneﬁts, right. I don't know how expensive it is to buy the robot,
but I think that's something you'll see.
And I don't know what's going to happen with the tipping. It's still like there are
some restaurateurs that are trying very hard to change that mix, and I think they're
getting very mixed results from the consumers that just are not ready for it. But the
diﬀerence between what a server makes and what a cook in the back of the house
makes, there is a big diﬀerential there. And I don't know how much longer that's
going to -- I think at some point that's going to change, because the millennials who
order on their phone, they're not used to tipping, the people who are used to
tipping are the baby boomer generation, right.
The smart brands, right, are the ones who use technology to enhance their surface,

I give the credit card to my son; please, pay. So I think who knows what's going to
happen. I think the minimum wage is going to be a very big issue that's going to
cause inﬂation for the industry, but that's not just for the restaurant industry, that's
every industry, right. So commodity, of course, I assume are going to have to go up
too, because the guy is providing me my meat, or my linens.
But it aﬀects us more, right, because when -- to Michael Halen's point about the
lowering food at home, right, grocery prices are going down, because they don't
have as much (multiple speakers)
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
We want [ph] that go up, because -- we want that go up too, because they're buying
from suppliers, they'd also have to pass on increases?
Not by as much because it's being held down by the commodity deﬂation. Right
now we see wheat prices are at record -- excuse me, wheat supplies are forecasted
to be at record levels, right. So this unusual food deﬂation, the more it increases the
gap between eating at home and restaurants. When there's a narrow gap, there's not
really a choice, but especially when you get into that lowest economic segment,
right, the QSR discount responders, they're going to eat more at home, right. But
even if you get into some of the --
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
-- casual or ﬁne dining, I was with one of my clients, went to a couple of restaurants
and we were talking about this. I guess, look, eating out is expensive. It's like -- it's

department (inaudible) people are cutting back on lunch, right, some of (inaudible)
deciding that it is pricing, they're doing more bag lunches, these kinds of things. It's
going to be -- it's not necessarily going to be across the board, but you need to be
able to recognize it as an operator as to what's price related, what's service related
and what do we do to combat it.
Because if we just (inaudible) on what the competitor across the street is doing, and
doing what's right for you and your customer, it comes right back to what (technical
diﬃculty) know who they are, know what motivates them to come in and tap into
those things, because this (inaudible) message doesn't work anymore.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
Well, I think the other thing too, Mike, is, with brown-bagging it or not coming in and
I also think especially the larger chains (technical diﬃculty) to step back. And you
touched on this earlier, you talked about the culinary capabilities in the restaurants,
it's, are you oﬀering today relevant food items, right. And then there's diﬀerent ﬂavor
proﬁles, healthy items, right. Items that are good for you. We hear this all the time,
farm to fork.
Is that another reason why people are trading oﬀ with a brown-bag because they
want something that's (technical diﬃculty) these younger millennials are more food
(technical diﬃculty). They are looking for something that's more ﬂavorful and more
relevant to what they're searching for versus going into a casual dining chain is not
really going to have those oﬀerings.
I mean, it seems like, just a couple of years ago, it was like groundbreaking that
casual dining chains put sriracha on the menu. I mean that's a sauce, come on, we
are behind the time. That's where fast-casual, I think to your point, Gary, the
independent chains are doing so well, right, because they're developing and
creating those relevant good-for-you, healthy items.
But there's also -- when you look at the big chains, right, it's also got to be about
execution. Can they execute it in scale, right, and can they execute it well in their
individual locations? I wish that half of these brands would stop -- go back to serving
just iceberg lettuce as a salad, right, because they don't know what to do with mixed
baby greens. You can taste the biggest -- popped open a bag of (inaudible) and
dumped it in a bowl or you can taste the detergent on it, because they don't know
how to execute it well, right. Whereas these local concepts that specialize in it, they
can give you something that's actually appealing, not just looks like it's what you've
heard about.INITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

Let us focus on just -- sometimes the economics won't come into play. The foodies,
the chefs that create these things, they are about, I want the best salad possible.
They are going to eat that salad and go, wow. Then I'm thinking about what to
charge you, what it cost to make. As I'm lucky to be at some of the best kitchens or
put some of the best chefs in it, I watch them sometimes throw out, they go right into
the salad bowl and they would throw out lettuce that they don't think is fresh enough
or good enough, right. They're not thinking. I am like you just threw out a lot of
money. I'm like, get out of my kitchen. They just want -- it's got to be the best.
Well, again, I think one of the things you will ﬁnd with the larger chains is that the
days of having chefs in the kitchens, scratch kitchens, for the most part are gone. In
2009, and the recession did, and we started cutting costs. I mean labor, who's in the
kitchen, we leaned on vendors for value-added items. So, as product comes in, we
warm it, slice the bag, plate it and send it out into the dining room. You wouldn't see
that in an independent.
You don't see that when you're standing in line at a fast-causal and you're actually
customizing the meal with fresh ingredients that are laid out in front of you. So,
there's a big diﬀerence when you think about what the independents are doing. I
mean, it's tough for them too in these times, but the product and the quality they're
delivering and the experience as well as what fast-casual is doing, right, that same
experience and the quality of the items and the broad ﬂavor proﬁles they're
delivering are deﬁnitely eroding like casual dining segment.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
You know it's funny you talk about it, because you think about how much the media
has played into creating chefs that are celebrities now and how much they're driving
taste. They are really taste change agents, is that the right word? Tastemakers to the
consumer's (inaudible)
I forget who said this, but I remember (inaudible) someone has said to me people
think about eating more than anything else in the day, right. They think about --
eating is like the number one thing, which most men will like, sure. But -- and so
that's very relevant. They think about what they're going to eat, they're going to care
about it, it's no longer (inaudible). And then the other thing you said, you're thinking
about how the kitchen has changed and you don't have chefs and they truly -- if you
think about a technology shift, the chains traded cooks or chefs for microwave, right.
So now that's at play and you see how that worked out.
And a lot of hotel don't have the kitchen. (multiple speakers). They don't have the
kitchen or the expertise or anything else to actually be able to execute somethingINITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
But (inaudible) this webinar is about what can you do when sales are dropping,
declining. What can you do? And I think the message we're talking about is, you got
to be relevant, what's the relevant food, and how do you communicate that to your
guest. And I'm using the word guest, not customer. How do you communicate that to
them, to have them come, to continue to come in, right, that's really the strategy.
Absolutely. But know what you can do, right, not -- know what your brand is capable
of executing, right, because at the end of the day, that's where you're going to win is
at the location level, the days of top-down management of a large chain. It's not
working that way anymore, you've got to really know what you're doing down at the
location level and execute.

We spoke about it a little bit before oﬄine, but even bad chains can generate some

kind of free up cash ﬂow, and outside of the tech investments that we spoke of, what
should they be doing with their excess cash?

cut labor cost. People can mail the suggestions like, ﬁre people, right. That's quick.
That is not the right answer clearly. There are things you can do strategically. I talked
about it earlier, knowing what's labor-intensive, what doesn't make money and
produce, trim your menu. I remember Julia Stewart talking about when Applebee's
had so many menu items, you really got to keep it simple, so you can execute really
what's good and cravable.
Some of the things to think about in reality is, some restaurants carry decent size
inventories, trim your inventories, see what's out there. Look at your budgeting andINITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

communicate with your vendors, your investor group, your partners, your landlord
and be very clear, hey, this is where we're going, you need to support me through
this, right.
If you have a policy of making X dollar distributions to your partners every month or
every quarter, maybe go back to them and say, we're not going to do that now. You
go back to your landlord and say, you know what, I'm really tight this month, I got to
choose between making payroll and making rent. Can I take that rent and make it up
to you over in the next couple of months as a tail of the lease. Cutback on maybe
some CapEx.
Those are the general things you can think about, but you need to have really good
core communication. I'm always going to go back to -- you got to have the
teamwork, but if you're running the business using the numbers as a beacon, right,
you're going to have -- I always am a big fan of ﬂash reports, every week they get a
ﬂash report and they talk to management about 15 minutes about what's happening,
and people are very aware. If we're trying to hit a targeted throughput, this is how
much you get to spend this week. If you need to go over, we need to approve it,
don't just haphazardly do it. Trim the things that you can, trim the (inaudible)
But I think you also need to keep in mind when you're doing that trimming is, what is
the impact of those cuts going to have on the guests coming through your door.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
Absolutely.
Right, because I have been with brands where we cut and we cut deep, and traﬃc
declines have just escalated. And so it's one of those things that I think you'd always
have to keep in mind that guest, because there's so many choices today.
{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
All right. I absolutely agree. You need to be -- you are going to have to have a -- you
got to be strategic in all the decision you're making here. This is -- we talk about it
like it's so easy. Honestly, this is time-consuming. No one -- everyone, at least my
clients, they don't want to talk about money. It creates anxiety for them, right. Even I
get anxious talking about their money. So, it's something you have to pay attention
to because this is a business.

some will work, some won't. But make sure -- it's always important, and I think that

No, I'm a data guy, so I'm going to have a bias, but I really do believe that the

whole -- your whole data program with certain goals in mind that you're trying to --
that you can actually know you can get a return on investment on, right.
So, whether it's optimizing your media, whether it's price optimization, right, these
are things that are very tangible and measurable, right. And once you've got the
datasets that can actually help to fuel that, then you can apply that sort of a data-
driven culture across the entire company.
{BIO 17914334 <GO>}
I agree with that. That's a -- I mean, I think that just goes to best practices, pick the
right data, use it eﬃciently, pay attention to both macro and micro. Some people
have always said to me, I can't really worry about the macro issues. I'm like, that's like
taking a sailboat out when there's hurricane coming in and saying, I can't worry
about that hurricane, right. You've got to pay attention to both and then implement

{BIO 18904324 <GO>}
And I think, Mike, to your point with the data, it's really understanding your guest
behavior when they're in your restaurant, what they order, when they come, how
they use your brand. Gary, you talked about these restaurants getting huge menus.
Look at casual dining, it's become the sea of sameness. It was probably a dozen at
least menu items on casual dining restaurants, so they're not selling menu but a
competitor has in one of their menus that they have. Those are the areas you can cut,
but you need to understand your key guests, who they are, what those segments are
in your restaurant, and what they're ordering. You don't want to cut those items.
But if you have items that have low sales, those are the items that you want to start to
eliminate. And the problem is, everybody in casual dining has become just like
everybody else. Mike and I've talked about it. If you took the trade dress oﬀ the
menus and you look at the menus you probably wouldn't know what brand you're in.INITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

see that, because that's what the consumer of today and tomorrow is going to really
want.
And we see the Boomers not eating out as much and you talked about, you know,
these chef-driven culture. Well, millennials view themselves as foodies, right. We call
them foodies, right. They are the ones that are searching out things that you're not
going to necessarily ﬁnd in casual dining, but you're going to ﬁnd in these emerging
brands.
You haven't noticed and you go to like some of these cooler, hipper places, while
the kids are on their phone taking pictures of food and next minute it's like all over

Yes. Does -- does a place like Blue Apron, is that a real threat?
Maybe to some of the brands out there.
(inaudible) replacement has been -- Mike talked about forever. So this is just maybe
a smarter way to getting it out there. So Blue Apron is the smart there. There is
another company called Home Chef, that's also getting that traction. So, it's been -- I
think those things are out there.
You know, I mean, I often sit with my (inaudible) my oldest uses Blue Apron, and
really it comes down to -- she is in law school, it's -- she is a foodie, she likes to eat
out, she's a kid that's snapping, you know, she wants to have her own food Instagram

produce, leftovers that she's not going to use again.
So for her, it's aﬀordable, but it's really that one-time meal all the ingredients aren't
there. So, her cupboards aren't stocked with spices and she doesn't have all the
produce that maybe a big household would carry. So for her, it's a really aﬀordable

structure of fast-casual versus full-service dining? So is the impact -- you know, is the
rising minimum wage is going to -- is that going to be much more onerous on casual
dining versus fast-casual.
I know the gentlemen who entered the question is that -- usually that's really bright
and typically hard ones, but I think my opinion, I think that's going to be a more
costly exercise for the quick-service fast-casual, because those are the people that
are really making at the minimum wage more so than I think in the ﬁne dining arena.
But if I'm raising -- if I'm raising, Michael and you are above Michael in seniority and

And then the waiters make so much more than that, the ones in casual dining. I
mean, they're making 20,000 30,000, 40,000 an hour. Remember, years back when
no one was reporting tips or (inaudible), I was thinking, well, why am I going to

landlord about rents, and one of our listeners said that, they've tried going to their
landlord and -- who told them to pound sand. Do you have any recommendations or
any magic words he could use next time he goes back to that landlord?
Landlord sounds like a wonderful guy, right, because internally [ph] you think about
what he did, he probably levered up his building and needs your rent to pay his -- to
pay down the mortgage. But I don't know enough about that situation, but you know
this is almost like a game of who is going to chicken, who is going to bluﬀ ﬁrst,
(inaudible) ﬁrst.
If you have the -- I would check my lease and then be very clear with him about your
ﬁnancial situation is going to be like and if it's really, really tight, right, be slow on
paying the rent, don't pay all of it. I mean, it depends what strategy you really want to
take. I don't know if there is a magic word, if somebody just told you to go pound
sand or jump in a lake.
And how can restaurant management and restaurant leadership help increase the
emotional intelligence of their employees?
First thing, it would come down to -- to training, right, and making sure -- I think,
make sure your employees understand what the brand stands for. You know like
create that passion amongst the employees for the brand. I think, you know, we've all
experienced going into a restaurant where you know that, that server is not just
passing through, but it's a career and they're passionate, they're knowledgeable,
they understand the brand and how many times have we walked out of one of those
experiences, and we just keep talking about what a great experience we had. So, I
think, you know, investing into the employees in the restaurant and really
understanding the front-line is critical.
And hiring in the ﬁrst place, right, getting the right people, the right people on the
door and whole other [ph] --
Which means that you need to be the employer of choice, right, in your area. The
ones who are going to get hit the most with say the minimum wage increases, right.
So, paying all your employees a minimum wage, you're probably not the employer
of choice to begin with, right. You know, the industry needs to do some hardINITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13

Page 24 of 25Michael Halenthinking about, how do we ﬁgure out how to actually make restaurants a career
again like it was (inaudible)
(inaudible) we're trying to do by eliminating tipping and sharing rents with the
house, that it's now a career. And you think about that, I mean the labor question, the
General Managers are the ones who really drive the successful restaurant.
You take a good General Manager and put him in a bad store, he'll make that store
good. You take a great location and you put a bad manager who will own it [ph]. So,
incredibly important. And there's such a bifurcation of what you're supposed to pay
and be relevant in that arena and that's attractive. We're actually working on with a
really large hotel chain right now to do a global compensation study to understand
what's relevant in the local marketplace.
We've just started it. I can't wait to see what the data shows like, what is the
diﬀerentiators of being able to attract people to come work with them, because I
think at the end of the day, the food is got to be great, right. The service is got to be
spot on. And if you have the right team that buys into your core value with great
training, that's a huge win, right. You're going to go back there where that server
knows you, that bartender knows you, rather than, you know, you notice, and I always
notice this in the mornings. When I get up and I go to the men's room, and if there's
a server like crossing my path, and I'm the guest, does he let me walk through ﬁrst,
does he walk in front of me.
Not that -- I'm just noticing and I see I know which restaurants where the server will
say, please, they will always say, please go. (inaudible) no, no you go especially if you
have a lot of food with you, but, to think you notice that stuﬀ and most guests do, not
just me, sorry.
All right. That was great. I want --
No question?
I think so. I think so. So, want one more?
There were some good questions, I'll take three, you're going to comment on three,
maybe, Peter? Michael, we are out of time?
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yes, I think we're -- I think our -- I think we hit our limit. So I want to thank you guys.
This was absolutely phenomenal. Just to put a bow on everything. Number one,
know your customer, serve relevant food that you can execute in your restaurants,
and if we do see a downturn, you know, use it as an opportunity and get the best
employees that you can possibly ﬁnd. So once again thanks, Mike, Pete. Gary, this
was great. Look forward to doing it again.INITIAL DRAFT TRANSCRIPT 2016-09-13
