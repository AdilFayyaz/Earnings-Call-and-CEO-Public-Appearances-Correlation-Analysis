It's great to see how people use the Mac to do such amazing things. The Mac has
always been about innovation and bold change. In June, we announced that the Mac
is taking another huge leap forward by transitioning to Apple Silicon and we
promise that the ﬁrst Mac with Apple Silicon would arrive by the end of this year.
Well that day is here.
To tell you more, here's John.
{BIO 22135753 <GO>}
We love the Mac and our teams have been working tirelessly to deliver the best
lineup of notebooks and desktops that we've ever have. Well, now it's time for the
Mac to take a gigantic leap forward. To do this, we needed to develop a new set of
advanced technologies. So for the past several years, we've had our teams working
with a singular purpose of deﬁning and building the next generation of Mac. And at
the core of this eﬀort is the Silicon. We've been making Apple Silicon for more than a
decade. It's at the heart of iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. And now, we want to bring
it to the Mac, so the Mac can take a huge leap forward with the incredible
performance, custom technologies, and industry-leading power eﬃciency of Apple
Silicon.
And as we've said, we're developing a family of chips, and we're going to transition
the Mac line to these new chips over the next couple of years. Well, today we are
incredibly excited to announce our ﬁrst step in this transition with our ﬁrst chip
designed speciﬁcally for the Mac. And we call it M1. M1 has been optimized for our
most popular low power systems where small size and power eﬃciency are critically
important. It is a stunningly capable chip and it assures in a whole new era for the
Mac.
Now, let's get started by spending a few minutes on a deep dive into this new chip
with Johny.
{BIO 19052877 <GO>}
M1 is a break-through chip for the Mac. Our approach with M1 was to deliver
industry-leading performance and features, while relentlessly focusing on power
eﬃciency. As a result, M1 delivers a joint leaping performance per watt, and every
Mac with M1 will be transformed into a completely diﬀerent class of product.
M1 is the ﬁrst system-on-chip or SOC for the Mac. Let me show you what that means.
Until now, a Mac needed multiple chips to deliver all of its features. It's hard chips for
their processor, IO, security, and memory. Now, with M1, these technologies are
combined into a single SOC, delivering a whole new level of integration for more
simplicity, eﬃciency, and amazing performance. M1 also features our uniﬁed memory
architecture or UMA. M1 uniﬁes its high-bandwidth, low latency memory into a single
pool within a custom package. As a result, all of the technologies in the SOC canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-10
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 13access the same data without copying it between multiple pools of memory. This
dramatically improves performance on power eﬃciency.
M1 is the ﬁrst personal computer chip built using the industry-leading 5-nanometer
process technology, with incredibly small transistors measured at an atomic scale, M1
is remarkably complex. It packs the largest number of transistors we've ever put into
a single chip. M1 has a massive 16 billion transistors and we use all of these
transistors to give M1 amazing performance and leading-edge technologies. And our
goal is to make each of these technologies best in class.
The incredible performance of M1 starts with the CPU which features two types of
cores; high performance and high eﬃciency. Each performance core is designed on
a single task of thread as eﬃciently as possible while maximizing performance.
We've been advancing it year after year. And now with the huge improvements in
M1, when it comes to low power silicon, our high performance core is the world's
fastest CPU core, and M1 has four of these incredibly fast high-performance cores, so
multifaceted workloads take a huge leap in performance as well.
To handle life of workloads more eﬃciently, M1 brings high eﬃciency cores to the
Mac. They use a tenth of the power while still delivering outstanding performance.
This equals the most eﬃcient place to unlike the tasks and allow the performance
cores to be used for the most demanding workloads. And M1 has four of these
eﬃciency cores, which on their own deliver similar performance as the current
generation dual-core MacBook Air at a much lower power.
And ﬁnally, M1 has our latest performance controller that the (inaudible) for
maximum performance and eﬃciency. Altogether, the 8-core CPU in M1 is by far the
highest performance CPU with ever created. And more importantly, it delivers this
performance at the lowest possible power. In fact, the M1 CPU leads the industry by
delivering the world's best CPU performance per watt.
Let's take a look. Here is the CPU performance on power usage of the very latest PC
laptop chip and here's M1. M1 delivers signiﬁcantly higher performance at every
power level and adjust in watts, the thermal envelope of MacBook Air, you can see
that M1 delivers up to two times the CPU performance of the PC chip, and M1 can
deliver the peak performance of the PC chip while using just a quarter of the power.
This is a big deal. What you are seeing here with M1 is extreme level[ph].
When you look back at the single-threaded performance of low power silicon in the
Mac, gains in performance per watt have been very small from one chip to the next.
But when we look at M1, we see a massive 3 times improvement in performance per
watt. This is unheard of. Now, what about graphics? We design GPUs that deliver the
maximum graphics performance and the thermal envelope of each of our products.
This results in a balanced system with a GPU that complements the incredible
performance of our CPU complex. Typically, PCs got to achieve this balance with
integrated graphics. To get great graphics performance, they have to use a discreteFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-10

Page 4 of 13John Ternus
Craig Federighichip, which consumes a lot of power. M1 is diﬀerent. With its integrated graphics, we
get the best of both worlds, incredible performance and low power.
The GPU in M1 beneﬁts from years of thorough analysis of Mac applications. It's the
most advanced graphics processor we've ever created, and with up to eight of these
GPU cores, M1 is capable of executing nearly 25,000 threads at a time. From
teraﬂops to texture bandwidth to ﬁll rate along with its incredible eﬃciency, M1's
GPU is in a class of its own. Here is the graphics performance on power usage of that
same PC laptop chip and here's M1.
M1 delivers signiﬁcantly higher performance every power level, with M1 delivering up
to 2 times more graphics performance than the PC chip. And again, M1 can deliver
the peak performance of the PC chip while using just one-third of the power. When it
comes to personal computers, M1 has the world's fastest integrated graphics. Now,
Apple Silicon is more than just a fast CPU and GPU. We pack our chips with powerful
custom technologies.
M1 features our most advanced Neural Engine. With a 16-core design, it's capable of
executing a massive 11 trillion operations per second. The entire M1 chip is designed
to excel at machine learning, and tasks like video analysis, voice recognition, and
image processing will have a level of performance never seen before in the Mac.
Finally, M1 integrates our latest generation Secure Enclave. It's faster than ever and
brings best-in-class security to the Mac. So that's M1, our ﬁrst SOC design for the
Mac. With its 8-core CPU featuring the world's fastest CPU core along with an 8-core
GPU that delivers the world's fastest integrated graphics, M1 leads the industry-
leading performance per watt, and it has leading-edge technologies like the Neural
Engine, Thunderbolt and USB 4, a faster Secure Enclave, our latest ISP and more.
With its unique combination of remarkable performance, powerful features, and
incredible eﬃciency, M1 is by far the best chip we've ever created. And we're
absolutely thrilled to bring to the Mac.
Now, back to John.
{BIO 22135753 <GO>}
It is so incredibly exciting to think about the Macs we can build, with the
performance and capability of M1. The Mac has never had a chip upgrade this
profound. But the Silicon is only part of the story. For all Apple products, it's a tight
integration of our hardware and software that makes the user experience so
amazing. To deepen this integration on the Mac, we use Mac speciﬁc software
workloads to optimize the architecture of M1. And in the same way, iOS and iPadOS
are built to maximize our A-series chips, macOS Big Sur has been built to maximize
M1. To hear how it unlocks entirely new experiences and capabilities, let's turn it over
to Craig.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-10
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 5 of 13For the ﬁrst time ever, we've been able to design macOS for our own silicon. I'm so
excited about what this means for the platform. Our latest release, macOS Big Sur, is
absolutely incredible on M1. Big Sur introduces a bold new design, powerful updates
for apps like Safari in Messages and the latest improvements to our industry-leading
privacy features. And by designing the whole system together, hardware and
software, we're able to make the things you love about your Mac even better.
Your Mac now instantly wakes from sleep, just like the iPhone and iPad. Let me show
you, but ﬁrst, let's set the mood.
(Video Presentation)
How cool is that? And with M1, things you do every day, like launching apps are
nearly instantaneous, and Safari, which is already the world's fastest browser, really
shines on Apple Silicon. It's now 1.5 times speedier at running Java script and almost
2 times more responsive. The whole system is distinctively snappy and system
animations are buttery smooth. The sheer speed of M1 together with macOS
technologies like Metal deliver a huge boost to the most demanding apps, so you
can render 3D animations in a raw video footage with ease.
Now, part of the secret behind this breakthrough performance is M1's uniﬁed
memory architecture. We built macOS on Apple Silicon to use the same data formats
for things like video decode, GPU, and display, so there is no need for expensive
copying or translation. And macOS gives apps access to more graphics memory
than ever, unlocking breakthrough performance for task ranging from color grading
6K video to playing graphically intensive games for performing real-time machine
learning inﬂuence.
Big Sur also features advanced power management, which intelligently allocates task
between M1's performance and eﬃciency cores, automatically optimizing for
lightweight tasks like reading a node or performance intensive tasks like playing a
game. So your Mac gives you quiet performance and even better battery life.
When it comes to security, M1 represents a major leap forward. For years on iOS,
we've worked to continuously advance the state of the art for computer security. And
with M1, we're bringing this architecture to the Mac. This includes not only hardware
veriﬁed secure boot automatic high performance encryption for all your ﬁles, but
also new security protections built deep into the code execution architecture of M1,
giving you the most advanced security of any personal computer. macOS Big Sur is
engineered down to it's core to fully take advantage of all the capability and power
of M1, and it does this all while maintaining everything you love about macOS.
Of course, we've optimized all of our apps for M1, from every app that comes with
macOS to every other app made by Apple. Apps like Pages, Numbers, and Keynote,
and GarageBand and iMovie are showing us how great performance can be with M1.
For example, with Logic Pro, you can run up to 3 times more Instruments and eﬀectFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-10

Page 6 of 13John Ternusplug-ins. And Final Cut Pro can ﬂy through tasks like rendering a complex timeline
up to 6 times faster. We can't wait for you to unleash your creativity.
Now, macOS Big Sur has incredible technologies that enable you to run a greater
range of apps than ever before. First, our universal apps. Simply put, universal apps
are the fastest, most powerful apps you can get. Universal apps include a native
binary version built for Apple Silicon as well as a native version for Intel processors.
The two come together into a single app that you can download from the App Store
or from the web, meaning that one app can run on all of your Macs.
We're hearing a lot of excitement from developers as they get ready to launch their
universal apps. For example, Omni Group is bringing universal versions of all of their
great Mac apps and Adobe is bringing universal versions of their apps, starting with
Lightroom next month, and other ﬂagship apps including Photoshop early next year.
For existing apps that haven't yet upgraded to universal, Big Sur includes an
amazing new technology, Rosetta 2. On M1 systems, Rosetta seamlessly runs apps
built for Intel based Macs. So even without an app update, you can keep working on
that Fusion 360 project and get to the next level in your favorite game.
Thanks to Metal and M1, some of the most graphically demanding apps actually
perform better under Rosetta than they did running natively on previous Macs with
integrated graphics, it's really incredible. The transition to M1 is also great for
developers. M1 scales up the architecture that they're already accustomed to on
iPhone and iPad, so they can optimize their code across the whole family. And these
new Macs can do something that no Mac has ever done before. For the ﬁrst time
ever, you can run your favorite iPhone and iPad apps directly on your Mac. You have
more games to play, more content to watch, and more apps for everything you want
to do, altogether you get access to the biggest collection of apps ever for the Mac
and it's only going to get better as developers continue to build new apps for M1.
Here are some of them in action.
(Video Presentation)
It's amazing to see developers take advantage of the incredible performance and
features of M1 and Big Sur. We can't wait to see them re-imagine what apps can do.
Over to you, John.
{BIO 22135753 <GO>}
The combination of M1 and macOS Big Sur is super exciting. It truly takes the Mac to
a whole new level. So now, we have all the technologies we need for the next
generation of Mac and it's time to introduce the ﬁrst Mac with M1, a product where
the power eﬃciency of M1 changes everything. Here it is.

Page 7 of 13Laura MetzThis is the new MacBook Air with M1. In the ﬁrst, MacBook Air was pulled out of that
envelope, it deﬁned the category of thin and light notebooks. And our users have
been loving it ever since. Now with the groundbreaking eﬃciency of M1, the new
MacBook Air will completely redeﬁne what a thin and light notebook can do. To tell
you all about it, here's Laura.
{BIO 18783784 <GO>}
MacBook Air is the most popular Mac. In fact, it's the world's best selling 13-inch
notebook. Users love its stunning retina display, great everyday performance, and
incredible portability, all in a sleek wedge-shaped design. These days, users are
working more from home, learning remotely, and using the air to stay connected,
making performance and battery life extremely important. And we're thrilled that M1,
our ﬁrst chip for the Mac, enables MacBook Air to do things that were previously
impossible on such a thin and light notebook. With eight incredibly powerful cores,
the CPU source to a whole new level of performance that's up to 3.5 times faster
than the previous generation. So if you're editing family photos or exporting a video
for the web with iMovie, the new Air believes this right through it. Or if you're
working in light room, you can manage huge raw libraries that unheard of speeds,
turning your Air into a mobile photo studio, and with the world's fastest integrated
graphics that feature up to 8 cores, Air delivers up to 5 times faster graphics
performance. That's the biggest leap ever for MacBook Air.
So when it comes to gaming, you can play immersive graphically-intensive titled at
signiﬁcantly higher frame rates. And for the ﬁrst time, you can add multiple streams
of full quality 4K Pro res video without dropping a frame, that's mind-blowing for
such a thin and light notebook. And when you compare MacBook Air to the best
selling Windows laptop in its class, the new Air is up to 3 times faster. And what's
even more amazing is that with M1, MacBook Air is faster than 98% of PC laptops
sold in the last year.
Now, let's talk about that Neural Engine. With 16 cores, machine-learning workloads
are up to an astonishing 9 times faster than the previous Air, so apps like Final Cut
Pro, they use ML-based features such as Smart Conform to intelligently frame a clip,
can do so in a fraction of the time. And even storage gets a performance boost with
SSDs that are up to 2 times faster. Thanks to the M1 storage controller and latest ﬂash
technology. The tasks like previewing massive high-res images or importing large
ﬁles are super quick. What's also remarkable is that with the industry-leading
eﬃciency of the M1 chip combined with the power management and macOS Big Sur,
the new Air delivers all this performance without a fan. So, no matter how intense the
task, MacBook Air is completely silent, and that same incredible eﬃciency also
delivers extraordinary battery life with up to 15 hours of wireless web browsing and
up to an amazing 18 hours of video playback, that's six hours longer than before.
And when you're video conferencing, which can rapidly drain the battery, you can go
up to twice as long on a single charge. This is the longest battery life ever in a
MacBook Air. And if users connect with friends, family, and coworkers remotely, we
know camera image quality matters even more. So we're excited that with M1,
Apple's latest image signal processor comes to the Mac. This ISP delivers betterFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-10

shadows and highlights, as well as improved auto white balance combined with ML-
enhanced face detection, so you look more natural on your FaceTime calls. In fact,
everything looks stunning on the 13-inch retina display, which now supports P3 wide
color for even more vibrant true to life images. And with the Secure Enclave in M1
combined with Big Sur, Air delivers best-in-class security with features like Touch ID,
which make it easy to unlock your Mac and make secure online purchases using
Apple Pay, with just the touch of your ﬁnger.
And ﬁnally, all these powerful features with a completely new level of performance
are delivered in a sleek, wedge-shaped design. With M1 and Big Sur, we've taken the
MacBook Air and transformed it into something far beyond any other thin and light
notebook. And even with this gigantic increase in performance, along with its new
features, the Air still starts at just $999. And for education, it starts at just $899,
delivering way more value than ever before. So that's the new MacBook Air. With M1,
it has jaw-dropping performance, 3.5 times faster CPU, 5 times faster GPU, all in a
silent fanless design. It also has a more vibrant retina display, improved camera
quality, and incredible battery life up to 18 hours, the longest-ever in a MacBook Air.
So once again, MacBook Air completely redeﬁnes what a thin and light notebook
can do.
Back to you, John.
{BIO 22135753 <GO>}
This new MacBook Air is amazing. So think about what we've done here. We've taken
our most popular notebook, and with M1, giving it more performance, the 98% of PC
laptops sold in the last year. A huge increase in battery life, and at the same time, we
pulled out the fan, not just noise. With that unbelievable combination of
performance and portability, it is by far the best MacBook Air we've ever made. But
that's not all, because today we're bringing M1 to another beloved[ph] Mac and here
it is.

This is the new Mac mini. The tremendous level of integration oﬀered by the system
on a chip design of M1 allows us to pack a remarkable amount of performance and
capability into its compact design. To tell you more about it, here's Julie.
Mac mini delivers the Mac desktop experience in an incredibly small form factor. Our
users love its outstanding performance, array of connectivity and signature design.
And most of all, they love its versatility. It's why you'll ﬁnd Mac minis everywhere
from home oﬃces to home theaters, studios to render farms.
Today, M1 comes to Mac mini, bringing a seismic shift and what an ultra-compact
desktop can do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-10
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 13John TernusWith the 8-core CPU in M1, Mac mini delivers up to 3 times faster CPU performance
than the previous quadcore version. This is a monumental leap in CPU performance
for Mac mini. So if you're a developer compiling a million lines in Xcode or musician
using Logic Pro to take music production to a whole new level, performance never
skips a beat. And the 8-core GPU gives the mini a gigantic six-fold increase in
graphics performance. This enables you to do things you wouldn't have dreamed of
before on the Mac mini, like designing a graphics intensive game in unity, or when
the work is done, cranking up the graphic settings while playing a great game like
Baldur's Gate III.
The mini has an outrageous amount of performance in such a compact design. In
fact, if you compare Mac mini to the top selling PC desktop and its price range, the
mini is just one-tenth the size, and yet, it's up to 5 times faster. Mac mini just blows
the competition away and there is more with M1 bringing the Neural Engine to Mac
mini, machine learning workloads take a quantum leap forward with up to 15 times
faster ML performance than the previous generation. This means the new Mac mini
will supercharge innovative features that are powered by ML, like magically
increasing the resolution of a photo in Pixelmator Pro, giving it more sharpness and
detail.
It also makes Mac mini a great machine for developers, scientists, and engineers,
utilizing deep learning technologies like TensorFlow or CreateML, which are now
accelerated by M1. And with the Mac mini's advanced thermal design, M1 is
unleashed, easily sustaining its breakthrough performance while the mini stays cool
and quiet.
When it comes to connectivity, there is an array of IO, including two USB-C ports that
now support both Thunderbolt and USB 4, to connect a wide range of peripherals,
including the Pro Display XDR at a full 6K resolution.
With the M1 chip and Big Sur, our most versatile Mac packs a staggering amount of
performance and incredible new features, and even with all of its power and
capability, Mac mini now starts at just $699. That's a $100 lower than the previous
generation. No other desktop combines such breathtaking performance with such
an aﬀordable price.
So, that's the mighty new Mac mini, powered by the M1 chip, it takes an enormous
jump in performance with a 3 times faster CPU, 6 times faster GPU, and the Neural
Engine that boosts M1 performance up to 15 time. The new Mac mini is a
phenomenal desktop that's far more versatile and far more capable than ever.

progress we've made. It is so exciting to be able to reinvent three of our most
popular and aﬀordable Macs.
And to make things even more exciting, you can order the new MacBook Air, Mac
mini, and MacBook Pro starting today, and they will all be available next week. And

introduced over the last year. This is by far the strongest Mac lineup that we've ever
had.
The transition to Apple Silicon is going to have a profound impact on the Mac. It will
bring performance and capabilities that have never been possible before. This
journey will take a couple of years to complete and we have a long way to go. We're
oﬀ to one heck of a start. We are so proud of this new family of products and we
can't wait to see what our users are going to do with them.
Now, I'd like to turn it back to Tim. But before I do, here is a short ﬁlm we made to

This truly is a huge day for the Mac and a huge day for Apple. Advancements of this
magnitude only come from making bold changes. The M1 chip is by far the most
powerful chip that we have ever created. It makes these Macs dramatically faster,
provides all new capabilities with extraordinary battery life, and enables the Mac to
run more software than ever. This is exactly why we are transitioning the Mac to
Apple Silicon.
At Apple, our mission is to create products that play a meaningful role in people's
lives. 2020 has been a year, unlike any other, in so many ways. We are inspired by
the strength, resilience, and creativity we've seen displayed by people all around the
world. We are also extremely proud of our teams and the work they've done to
deliver such incredible products during these challenging times. We're looking
forward to seeing what you will do with these products. We're also looking forward
to 2021 and bringing even more amazing experiences to you.
Thank you for joining us. Stay safe, stay well, and have a great day.
