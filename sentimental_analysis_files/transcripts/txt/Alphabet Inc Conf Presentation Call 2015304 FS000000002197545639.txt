All right. We're ready to get started. Keep going. Good afternoon, everybody. My
name is Ben Swinburne. Let me get through the disclosure statements. Please note
that important disclosures including my personal holdings disclosures and Morgan
Stanley disclosures all appear as a handout available in the registration area and on
the Morgan Stanley public website. And I'm going to attempt again to read a Safe
Harbor.
Some of the statements that Neal to my left will make maybe forward-looking –
considered forward-looking. These statements involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially. Please refer the
Google's SEC ﬁlings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may
aﬀect our results. How is that?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
All right. Well done.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}

Glad to be here. Thanks for having me.
Q&A
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
So let's start big picture. One of the big debates on Google stock revolves around
the ability to grow what is signiﬁcant revenue base at the kind of levels you've grown
in the past and particularly going after brand advertising dollars. The conversation
we've been having throughout the conference both with competitors and agencies
and others folks in the ecosystem, but walk us through how you see Google strategy
and product oﬀerings at a high level for those big brand advertisers and their
agency partners?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Sure. So if you think about not just Google, but the evolution of digital marketing,
digital media over the course of the last sort of 10 years, 15 years, 20 years,
predominantly it's been monetized through performance advertising or direct
response advertising and that's been a great run for the entire ecosystem. But one of
the big opportunities and many folks have heard me talk about this a lot in the past
and it's a big area of focus within the company is around sort of cracking the brand
advertising nut, not just on behalf of Google, but for the entire ecosystem if you will.
And for us that starts ﬁrst and foremost of course with YouTube, which is our ﬂagship
video property, attracts over one billion users every single month. The amount of
watch-time on YouTube is growing 50% year-on-year. And, of course, that translates
into an incredibly attractive place for brand advertisers because brand advertisers
like to tell stories, sight, sound and motion and video happens to be frankly the best
medium for that.
And so YouTube is really sort of front and center in terms of our areas of investment
in terms of cracking the brand advertising nut. One of the ﬂagship formats that we
have there which is our native advertising format is called TrueView. Many of you
have seen it, it's the skippable ad format on YouTube. The number of TrueView
impressions on YouTube has actually grown nearly 75% year-on-year. So phenomenal
uptick by advertisers and agencies and brands over the course of the last year and
it's really the early stages there. The YouTube is a big part of that growth cracking
that brand nut.
The other area that I would call out which applies to Google and really to the entire
ecosystem is delivering the means by which brand advertisers and their agency
counterparts can measure the eﬃcacy of digital campaigns. And what's really been
beautiful about direct response and performance advertising in digital is that you
can measure it, click, impressions, clicks and conversions. And so the challenge
before all of us is, can we do the same thing around brands, around brand
advertising. And so that's been a big area of focus for us, around things like
viewability and reach measurement. Is my ad showing up to the right set of usersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04

Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal Mohanand are they able to actually see it across the digital ecosystem including YouTube?
We are also investing in tools like Brand Lift, which give brand advertisers the ability
to actually measure the impact of their brand campaigns, not just who saw the ads,
but as a result of seeing them, did it change their perception around my brand, did it
change how they think about my new product or what-have-you.
And we've run 6,000 of these studies. They've produced, they've shown great
results in terms of advertisers running campaigns on YouTube. But more importantly
we are actually able to give those insights back to brands in near real-time. And if
you contrast that with how it works for brands on television where they oftentimes
get these insights weeks or months or quarters after the campaigns are done, we
can actually deliver those insights while their campaigns are running and allow them
to deliver optimized results as a result of it. And so those are a couple of the big
areas we're focused on in terms of really cracking the brand nut on behalf of Google
and on behalf of the ecosystem.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
If we think about your conversation with agencies today, what's diﬀerent with what
you're oﬀering from a products perspective versus say a year or two ago? Certainly
when I talked to ad buyers, there seems to be a real big evolution in how they think
about YouTube and using YouTube for their clients.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean YouTube obviously as I described is really front and center in that
conversation. It's where their brands want to be, it's where consumers are, in fact –
there was over seven million hours worth of ad content. So these are online videos
on YouTube that are actually made by brands watched since the beginning of this
year on YouTube.
Last year, four of the top 10 videos across all of YouTube were actually built by
brands, they were ads. And so it turns out to be a great place for brands to engage
with their consumers and tell stories. Oftentimes these ads are quite long. There was
a Nike ad that was over ﬁve minutes long, so you can break out of the sort of
standard 15-second or 30-second mold that you're stuck to on television. So that
works incredibly well for agencies and brands. I also touched on what we're doing in
terms of proving the eﬃcacy of brand advertising on YouTube and digital in general
and that's an important conversation for agencies.
The other piece that I'll add to that, kind of two other pieces that I'll call out are, ﬁrst
and foremost, in all of my agency conversations it's pretty clear that agencies want to
be able to enable this programmatically.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal Mohan
Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal MohanAnd programmatic buying is one of the fastest-growing parts of not just our
business, but the entire ecosystem, if you will. For example, in Q4 last year we saw
growth in revenue in our DoubleClick Bid Manager platform grow 100% year-on-
year, which is just phenomenal growth and DoubleClick Bid Manager happens to be
the platform that's used by many large agency on behalf of their brand clients to buy
programmatically across the entire digital ecosystem. So programmatic is a big part
of the conversation. It's an area where we continue to invest in heavily. We've been
pioneers in this space as you know and our investment there continues unabated.
And then the other big area, of course, outside of programmatic and agency
conversations, of course, is how do we make sure that all of our tools and
capabilities apply to the multi-screen world that our consumers are already living in.
Consumers live a 24x7 connected life, we all do. There was a stat recently said 90%
of consumers begin a task on one device and completed on another. From an
advertiser and agency perspective, we need to be able to address that market reality
and that's a big area focus for us. And it's turning out to pay oﬀ in the numbers. In
fact, there has been a 68% increase in the amount of mobile impressions across our
entire stack year-on-year, which is, I already mentioned the nearly 75% growth rate in
TrueView impressions, but mobile is also is a big driver. So emerging formats are a
big driver of our entire programmatic stack which tends to be again where a lot of
the conversation with our agency partners is focused.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
Is that 68% increase a YouTube statistic on mobile or across the...
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Across the entire stack.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
Got it. Okay. You mentioned measurement and attribution. So we had a session
yesterday on programmatic with one – and an agency person had talked about some
of the issues there around understanding measurement on the video side, generally
TV, but also online.
What are you seeing in the industry, your – on the board of IAB and I know they are
focused on it. What are the things we're going to see in 2015 on the measurement
front either from Google or from the industry that sort of really make a diﬀerence
with agency trust and transparency.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, I think the way that I think about it is – this is a problem that needs to
get solved at an industry-wide level. I think Google is in a position because of our
DoubleClick stack and its adoption on both the publisher side and the advertiser
side, where our publisher partners and our advertiser and agency partners are often
looking to us to help develop those solutions because we happen to operate the
technology stacks that they used to manage their media buying or selling, whether
they are advertisers or publishers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 11And so the way I think about it is really as a pyramid, if you will. And from a brands
perspective, the very ﬁrst question that every brand should be asking is, did a human
being actually see my ad. And that sounds kind of like an obvious question and one
that the answer should be, of course, yes. But from a digital standpoint, one of the
biggest challenges we have that I believe is an addressable challenge is to answer
the question of viewability for brands. And we have a product there called Active
View, which we make available freely in our DoubleClick stack for advertisers and
publishers to use, to seamlessly measure viewability across their entire campaign.
In January, I announced that we brought it not just to display and banners and rich
media ads, but also the video and so it's available for video advertising as well as
display. But really that's the bottom of the pyramid. And after answering the question
of whether a human being actually saw my ad, the next obvious question that a
brand should ask is, was it the right set of human being? Did I reach my target
audience? And that's where Google partnered with companies like comScore and
Nielsen around their vCE and OCR metrics to be able to measure audience reach
and frequency across YouTube, but across our Google display network as well across
the entire DoubleClick stack to kind of to broaden it out.
And if you think about sort of what brands had available in television land, it really
was sort of up to that question of, did the right set of users see my ad, was it the right
audience, using GRPs as proxy for that. But the beauty of digital is, we can go one
step further. And so I think the next step in the pyramid above and beyond did a
human being see my ad and was it the right human being, is a question that really
matters to brands which is, what impact did it have, what did it change about that
side of consumers that I reached as a result of me spending money in digital. And I
think that's kind of the Holy Grail or the very key metric that needs to get solved just
like if you think about sort of clicks in AdWords, what that did for direct response and
search campaign and the fact that clicks were associated with some sort of
conversion or sale event down the road.
And so that next pyramid is sort of what we call our Brand Lift products. We have a
portfolio product that allow brands to be able to measure the impact of their
campaign. As I mentioned, things like change in consideration, change in ad recall,
change in brand awareness, all those upper funnel metrics that brands know and
love, but really had no way of actually measuring in meaningful scale before the
advent of these products in this Brand Lift portfolio.
And again, these are products that we make available to our brands for free. We ran
6,000 of these studies as I mentioned last year. The good news is that places like
YouTube actually do generate meaningful Brand Lift. But as I said, the really sort of
healthy metric for us in the long term is the fact that not only do these campaigns
generate lift, but we can give that lift insight to brands back in as near real-time as
possible.
And I think that's the distinguishing thing about what happens in the digital world
versus what brands have been used to in television, where they could never getFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 11Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal Mohan
Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburnethose insights in real-time and therefore could not optimize their campaigns while
they were still running.
And so if you think about that from a brands perspective that's the diﬀerence
between getting the exact results you are looking for during your holiday, most
important campaign time of the year, versus getting some results after the fact that
you can only apply 12 months down the road when you're running your next holiday
campaign.
And so it's kind of a long answer to your question, but I wanted to unpack that a little
bit and give some visibility into how we think about sort of our brand measurement
strategy and how we think it's going to be game-changing in terms of really cracking
that nut for brand advertisers, not just on YouTube, but across the entire digital
ecosystem as we bake those metrics into our DoubleClick platforms as well.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
You've been at this for a while, so you know that the debate around measurement
and data is a ﬁerce one. And certainly, one thing that I think had helped television
maintain inertia is, you have Nielsen ratings, people understand it, it's easy currency
to trade even if it's not perfect, where do you come down and sort of the ﬁrst-party,
third-party data point on your business because you mentioned Nielsen OCR and
vCE that's helped. Are you all the way there now in terms of using a third-party
currency to help brand advertisers and maybe more important their agency partners
believe in what they're buying and sort of comfortable putting more money to work,
or is was there more room to go?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
So we – as I said at the beginning, our goal is to partner with the entire industry like
you said, I'm on the board of the IAB, these are all big issues there. And I think they
need to get addressed from an industry standpoint.
Having said that, I believe that the industry does look to companies like Google to
actually help address a lot of the technological challenges on behalf of the industry.
And so I mentioned, our viewability product's called Active View, so that's
technology that we've developed. It has, without getting into a lot of the gory
technical details, has the capability to provide broad coverage in terms of viewability
for publishers and advertisers. But we believe that, that's something that shouldn't
just remain the purview of Google, and that's why we've made it available for free
across our entire stack, it's MRC accredited and we're happy for it to be something
that's used by the entire industry. And so we view our role as really contributors of
insights in technology that can be adopted by a broader industry. But absolutely, it
needs to be an industry-wide eﬀort as opposed to silo metrics developed by
individual players.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
Let's turn to the content side of the equation, but stick on this theme of sort of
agency and brand advertiser adoption of YouTube. Is your perspective on what kindFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 11A - Neal Mohan
Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal Mohanof content you want to put on YouTube and what do you want to pay for evolving?
You've launched YouTube Kids recently, which at least as a parent seems to be an
evolution in a little bit of a diﬀerent direction, but maybe you can put that into
context in for us and how you are thinking about evolving the content piece of the
puzzle at YouTube?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, for us, it's always been about really from the early days of YouTube, it's
really been about the organic evolution of a lot of that content. I mean, if you think
about some of the largest creators on YouTube today, PewDiePie, (16:44), et cetera.
Those are incredibly ﬁerce loyal fan bases that they've built up and they are very
large. And so in YouTube, we view our job as really sort of supporting our creators
through that entire sort of lifecycle and that includes everything from studio support.
So we have studios in LA and New York, where we help creators marketing support.
You've seen kind of our kind of YouTube Original's marketing eﬀorts.
And then back in September, we announced also monetary support around some
types of programming. And really it's oriented around, really oriented around our
creators. And the breadth of our creators is pretty astonishing. YouTube today has
more 18-year-olds to 34-year-olds than any cable channel out there. I already
mentioned the watch-time growth 50% year-over-year. And so really the goal there is
to support creators in any way possible. Few weeks ago, we mentioned that the
amount of money that we paid out to creators grew by about 50% between 2013
and 2014. And so it's an incredibly vibrant platform. We view it as, we've always
viewed it as three pillars, our users, our viewers, our creators, the people that are
publishing the content, and then of course, our advertisers were looking to reach
consumers but then they're also helping support that content.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
The advent of the YouTube stars have been to impressive to watch. You mentioned
some of the big stars. Are you seeing real competition for talent now in a business
that you essentially created in many ways because it seems some new company's
launch recently and even some other online incumbents look at trying to build a
business like YouTube which is easier said than done. But it could in theory pressure
your margins.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
I mean, we're head-down focused on supporting our consumers, I mean, supporting
our creators and what they care about and what they tell us anytime I met with them,
what they share back with me is YouTube is a place where their audience is. That's
where they're able to connect with their audience. In fact, the conversation very
quickly moves to the types of features and capabilities we can provide to creators to
help them better connect with their audience. And so our creators, at least in my
conversations remain incredibly committed to the platform. They know that's where
their users are. I mentioned some of the results we've been able to provide from a
monetization standpoint.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 11Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal MohanSo we're incredibly happy with that. We're always looking for ways to deepen that
partnership with creators. That's an incredibly vibrant, creative community. And so
making sure that it remains that way is kind of one of the fundamental tenets of
YouTube.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
Let's pivot then to the programmatic automation side of the equation, your
background in DoubleClick, of course, makes sense to talk about this topic, it's a big
one, I think probably one maybe people don't understand as much as we would like
to. What's your perspective on the change that's happening? It seems like it's
accelerating in terms of pace on how media is bought and what that means to your
broader display business in particular?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, so one of the things that that I would say is I think everybody –
probably a few people in this room as well have this impression of programmatic is
being the place where remnant inventory is transacted primarily for a direct
response objective. And if you go back to kind of several years ago, that is where a
lot of the kind of early momentum for programmatic really came from. But what's
most exciting to me about this space is how much it is now applied to kind of the
entire spectrum of inventory and advertiser use cases.
In fact, last year, we launched a program called Google Partner Select, and it was a
program meant to be complementary to our YouTube oﬀering, speciﬁcally the
YouTube sort of Google Preferred oﬀering, which is kind of the premium sort of 5%
of YouTube. And Partner Select has turned out to be a collection of the Internet sort
of most premium video partners on one-end and the most premium sort of global
brands on the other end.
Recently a few weeks ago, we announced sort of 50-plus partners on the sell side
and the buy side and it's fundamentally a programmatic video marketplace that
transacts premium programmatic – premium video inventory sort of the cream of the
crop in terms of what brands are looking for but does so programmatically which is
the other thing that brands are looking for. And it's growing on an impression basis
35% month-on-month, so phenomenal growth. And it really just proves out the point
in terms of the future of programmatic. And where I see that being – see it ﬁrmly sort
of in the brand, sort of programmatic premium spectrum of the market, which is
incredibly exciting because that's a hugely sort of untapped opportunity for the
growth of programmatic.
If you think about sort of the amount of transactions that occur across the digital
world, across the web, across mobile, et cetera, about 70% of that media still
transacted in a kind of upfront RFP manner the way television buying and selling
happened. And that's all right for movement to programmatic with the advent of
things like private exchanges, programmatic deals, et cetera. And these are all areas
where we've seen a phenomenal growth. I gave you some stats around Partner
Select. But we've seen tremendous amount of growth in programmatic primarily in
this programmatic premium section where CPMs tend to be higher, where the typesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal Mohan
Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal Mohan
Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburneof brands tend to be – the typical sort of global premium brands that you would
associate. And so that's where we see the future of programmatic heading. It's
reason why such a capability that's so front and center for all of our agency and
agency holding company conversations as well.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
I can see why that trend would be a positive for DoubleClick and its business. Does
this trend help YouTube and broader Google in terms of its ﬁnancial results?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Absolutely. I mean, one of the means by which agencies and advertisers would like
to buy in YouTube is programmatically as well. And I don't have anything to
announce there speciﬁcally today, but we recognize that that's something that our
advertisers and agencies have moved their business onto and obviously been
leaders in that respect. The YouTube turn outs to be – happens to be the largest
DoubleClick publisher out there. And so it's already integrated in the DoubleClick
publisher stack, if you will, it's a DFP publisher, if you will.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
Yeah. It does seem like the momentum has been on the buyer side, but now
publishers seem to be getting on board. What has happened in the last, maybe in
the six months to 12 months that's convinced publishers, you mentioned premium
video to say, this is not a race to the bottom on pricing, this is actually core to my
growing my business, what's happened?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
I think it's two things. And I think for me, at least it's been two pieces that have been
fundamental to the programmatic equation since the early days. The ﬁrst is – ﬁrst and
foremost from a publisher standpoint is that it's about yield, programmatic buying
because it allows the application of all this very rich buy-side data and insights to
publishers' inventory, that publishers may otherwise not have had access to,
generates higher yields for publishers, in a way that's more eﬃcient because they
can handle it through an automated pipeline as opposed to the traditional way of
buying and selling. And so more money, of course, kind of – it helps the story for
sure.
The second is control, so publishers have control over the type of inventory that they
make available, how they make that available, how they manage channel conﬂict. For
example, they might want to oﬀer a slice of inventory to one particular agency in a
way that might be diﬀerent than the way that they do business with another agency
or a brand. And through the evolution of programmatic technology they now have
all those controls and all those bells and whistles. And so I think those will be the two
things that have led to very rapid adoption of kind of the programmatic capability on
the sell-side, not just on the buy-side.

Page 10 of 11A - Neal Mohan

A - Neal Mohan
Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal MohanYeah. Does any of your comments on what we're seeing in programmatic that
beneﬁts to Google change in a mobile world versus desktop, or is it essentially the
same story?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
There is, of course, changes in the underlying, some of the underlying technology.
Obviously, users tend to be in a diﬀerent context on mobile devices than they may
be on their desktop or tablets, if you will.
But I think, fundamentally nothing has changed. It's still about reaching consumers in
the moments that truly matter. And if you think about it that's what Google has been
about since the earliest days of its advertising business and that remains true to
programmatic. It remains true as the world shifts to mobile. I mentioned one of the
fastest growing parts of our entire stack, the programmatic stack, YouTube, our ad
network, et cetera, happens to be mobile where impressions are growing 68% year-
on-year. And so that has to do with the change of course in consumer behavior, but
the fact that the capabilities that we have to our advertisers and publishers keep up
with that as well.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
Yeah. We're almost out of time, but I want to come back and maybe end with
another big debate on your stock and on the company, which is how well-positioned
Google is in the mobile world. Talk about AdMob and particularly In-app advertising
and then maybe you can comment on this sort of debate around the cookie list,
mobile environment that everyone is navigating on the advertisers and whether
that's an issue for Google?
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}
Sure. Our AdMob business is one that we're incredibly happy with. We've got over
650,000 app developers and growing. So it's quite a large network, reaches about 1
billion users globally. So from an advertiser and agency and brand perspective, it
tends to be a place where they gravitate towards in terms of reaching consumers
and whether that use case is a brand use case, whether it's a performance use case
around app installer, app re-engagement AdMob happens to be a place that works
incredibly well for brands. And we continue to invest and innovate there. Couple
days ago, at the Game Developer Conference right here, we announced a couple of
things, for example, app install ads in our Play Store, but also the advent of native ad
formats support across our entire network. And so that's something that our advisers
have been extremely excited about. And it's been something that I think is going to
work incredibly well for our developers as well. And it's a big tactical feet to be able
to bring a truly native format to a heterogeneous of a network as we have.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17200493 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-04
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 11Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
A - Neal MohanBut our fundamental goal on mobile is the same as it's always been, which is again
reaching consumers and moments that really matter to them. The beauty of our ad
network and our properties like YouTube and others is that we are able to ﬁnd users
in a whole number of context, whether they are entertaining themselves through
video, socializing with friends, reading news sites, et cetera, searching for
information. And so being able to ﬁnd users in all kinds of context throughout their
day is an incredibly powerful oﬀering for advertisers and brands. And so we're
extremely excited by our prospects.
To the second part of your question around sort of cookie list. I think that's around
sort of things like cost device measurement, et cetera. Those are capabilities that we
continue to invest in. Few months ago, we announced an estimated total conversions
in AdWords as a means of being able to give a picture of total conversion activity
driven by our Google campaigns across all devices. That's the capability that you
could imagine extends to our entire stack even beyond AdWords. And for us, our
advertising has always been about, like I said, reaching consumers at the time that
that impact can be most powerful whether it's through the programmatic channel,
whether it's through our AdWords oﬀerings or what-have-you and that applies just as
much in the mobile context as it did in desktop.
{BIO 5489854 <GO>}
Sure.
Well, thank you for sharing with us. It's a great conversation. We look forward to
keeping up and chatting next year. Thank you very much.
