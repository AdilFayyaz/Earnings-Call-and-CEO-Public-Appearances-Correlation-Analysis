Good morning and welcome to the Bloomberg Intelligence Webinar on dissecting
Apple in the post-COVID era. Today is Wednesday, May 26, 2020. And my name is
Anand Srinivasan, I am the primary Apple Analyst, and the Semiconductor and
Hardware Analyst here at Bloomberg Intelligence. I have with me four colleagues
who will be bringing their expertise to bear on the subject. Geetha Ranganathan is
our Media Analyst; Julie Chariell is our FinTech analyst; Amine Bensaid also covers
media, speciﬁcally opining on music and Woo Jin Ho [ph] is our expert in
semiconductors and networking, and will be talking about 3D frequency front-ends.
We have a packed call. So why don't we get started. Administrative items to begin
with. Today's presentation will be recorded, and will be available for playback. You
can access the replay via the link sent to you in the email from Bloomberg webinars
that email will come from Bloomberg webinars. At the bottom of the slide window,
you can adjust the volume and maximize your screen and you can also ask a
question. I would strongly urge participants to use this method. You can ask a
question by submitting one to the right of the slide, there is an area where it's called
questions and answers.
We will address questions at the conclusion of the presentation and then the copy of
the slides being used today will be distributed in a post event email. As I mentioned,
we have a packed agenda and we've stored -- divided the discussion points on the
call into these areas. One is we want to talk through the short versus the longer term.
We want to talk about two subject areas in depth. The two vectors which we think are
drive the investment thesis on Apple. One is the iPhone install base. And within that
we will talk about the iPhone-12 launch, about the eﬀect of 5G. We think pricing is
going to change in 2021. We'll talk about that.
And the second golden egg in this case would be the services business. And within
the scope of the services business, we will talk about not only the subdivisions of
services that we have laid out that we have spread out. We have estimated each ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 2 of 17those businesses, but we will talk about the outsides opportunities. In media, both
on the streaming side as well as on the music side, we will talk about FinTech which
we think principally [ph]. We will also discuss extensive the Apple's chip ambitions.
And last but certainly not least will address valuations and leave some time in the
conference for Q&A.
With that, let's get started. Talking about the near-term versus long term, obviously
the near term calendar year 2020 -- ﬁscal 2021 in the case of Apple is impacted, is
COVID impacted. Surprisingly the near term is less or more shallow in its weakness
than it's -- than we had ﬁrst foreseen. In the long term, we think that there is
substantial opportunity to expand the install base, but also drive a mix shift that from
an ASP perspective raises number one and number two, also drive services. So one
of the things that I want to convey and we have assumed Apple coverage recently
and is the fact that Apple has both the beneﬁt and the burden of scale in terms of
market share, you can see that it's a substantial owner of market share from with 191
or so million units, certainly not the biggest but from an ASP perspective, it's skewed
pretty far to the right, but it certainly has scale from a smartphone volume
perspective.
The second part of it is if you look at consumption of semiconductors. For example,
Apple is a substantial consumer of both DRAM, NAND as well as logic chips. Some
of which are merchant silicon from third parties such as Qualcomms, some of which
is internally designed and made by TSMC. So we'll talk through the eﬀect of scale.
We think that a singular vector of growth in the longer term is the China and India
expansion, obviously from an ASP perspective and the Android penetration versus
the iOS penetration, particularly in PRC and in China, it's multiples in terms of ASP,
it's multiples in terms of each Android phones sold versus each iOS phone.
And, but we believe that these two countries will represent the long-term growth
opportunity for the iPhone relative to Android. And we wanted to spend a little bit of
time on this virtuous cycle where the install base, where you have a new iPhone sold,
you have new adding to the install base, slowly expanding it, you have dramatically
new content via the App Store, which in turn drives more content-enabled devices in
the adjacent products and then which again proliferates wider content through the
new platforms that Apple has and this cycle continues.
If you look at the iPhone, we are paranoid and obsessive about the install base, and
the install base doesn't change drastically in the near term, we think that there is
about a 1.3 billion [ph] units if you consider the iPhone, the iPad the Max, et cetera,
across all of these platforms. We think there is about a 1.3 billion installed base. And
if you look at 1Q '18 through 4Q '19 the installed base has rapidly grown. There are
substantial vectors of growth in terms of the installed base potential. One is not to
be discounted is the ﬁnancing angle. And also the trade-in program. We help
potentially drive a higher ASP product dramatically (Technical Diﬃculty) to grow than
they would have had they not been ﬁnancing didn't have a trade-in program.
So we have estimated sort of a small bleed in iPhone installed base but shockingly
after the last quarter's trend, we are surprised that the impact of COVID is muchFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 17shallower than we had anticipated. As a result, we have dramatically changed our
March and June numbers prior to the print. So they printed roughly about 37 million
units. This is an estimate from IDC. We think that it goes down to sort of the 28
million units in the June quarter, but the rebound through the calendar third and the
fourth quarter to 43 and 72 million units for the iPhone is pretty substantial.
So the -- obviously the product re-freshes, everybody obsesses on it. If you look at
the 8 plus, the SE, the 11 Pro Max, across the board and you compare that relative to
the previous renditions of the iPhone, as well as to comparable products from
Samsung, and Huawei, you will -- I mean on a technological basis, these aren't
necessarily -- every feature set isn't the leader, they not the leader in camera
resolution or from a processor density, et cetera, but a closed ecosystem, coupled
with the strong tie-in of the device with the services dramatically expands the
ecosystem as the revenue potential relative to Android.
So as a result, we are continuingly focused on installed base expansion rather than
any given quarter's shipment. And we'll talk about ASPs at nauseam towards the -- as
we go through the presentation. 5G is a particular enhancer, obviously the value of
5G from a customer perspective is that it brings higher speeds and lower latency of
app experience, but it also drives newer apps and richer videos, 4k content,
enhanced music, et cetera. And this in turn leads to a wider app development, but
the beneﬁts from a carrier perspective is that you can also customize this delivery of
applications and the -- you can tailor the content and the tailor the delivery
mechanism based on user history, location, interest, et cetera. So eﬀectively giving
carriers a sharper monetization mechanism for devices that are on the 5G network.
So and this in turn brings in wider interest for the apps and services, wider from a
customer perspective because it's higher speeds and lower latencies, richer videos,
et cetera, from a customer perspective. And wider from a carrier perspective
because you can slice and dice the user pool better, and so you can tailor the
content and monetize it in a much more sharp fashion than you would have been
able to do in 4G or 3G.
And this in turn drives the cycle wide the 5G adoption could be wider. Again taking
out the eﬀect of COVID here and we're talking a little bit over the long term. In the
near term, I want to step back for one second and look at the near term. If you look
at it. We've done 2020 model where we actually done month by month analysis, and
eﬀectively track the disease and potentially overlaid spending inclinations as a result,
across region by region by region.
And that's how we came up with those unit numbers that I highlighted earlier. The
second part of it is 5G phones are going to be expensive in 2021. We think that
Samsung had a little bit of a failed experiment in trying to raise prices and they
didn't go over so well, so which they had to discontinue later. I think Apple may have
learned from that and I don't think that the ﬂagship prices are going to increase in
2020. The introduction of the iPhone SE or the rebranding or the re-launch of the
iPhone SE, actually brings in a new lower ASP product into the mix and the -- if you
look at the bar bell curve of price distribution of the iOS from 2007 to current, yes, it
has two peaks. One is in the 750 to 800 range and the other one is in the thousandFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 4 of 17plus range. We think that the -- regardless of how the iPhone SE increases the ﬁrst
bump, we think that it has the potential or the -- raise prices in 2021 have the ability
to push the second peak of the barbell at pretty aggressively. The interesting thing
about the chart that you're looking in front of you is that if you look at the white and
the blue columns of Apple, Samsung and Huawei, both from a units and a value
perspective, you can see that the white and the blue is substantially a bigger piece
for Apple even versus Samsung and Huawei and this goes to show that Apple has a
substantially richer Q mix relative to Samsung and Huawei. Apple is not trying to be
the market share leader in from a unit perspective but by selling more expensive
phones, it has the ability to drag in a much wider services business.
So, the installed base is going to be steady, and growing much more slowly
potentially, than a lower end the product could have from an ASP perspective, but
the services mix that it drags in is going to be richer and remember that the services
margin is almost to X [ph] that of the product margin. So this is a barbell curve that I
was talking about earlier, which is this double bump that you see, one is in the 750 to
800 range, and the other one is in the thousand plus range. This goes to show that
regardless of the iPhone ASP starting price, a bulk of the units that are sold actually
carry a value that is substantially higher, right.
And we think that even though the iPhone SE is going to drag this to the left from an
ASP perspective, we think that 2021 is actually going to enhance the SKU mix on the
right hand side of the graph. We think there is an opportunity for Apple to raise
prices eﬀectively potentially not optically, they might introduce one or two SKUs at
the -- at the higher end of the spectrum and thereby the weighted average price of
the platform goes up. I want to spend a little bit of time on services, obviously, again,
I want to refocus on two vectors of growth. One is the iPhone installed base, we have
laid out the case where 2021 could see improved units as well as wider ASPs couple
that with 5G, and which should all drive services.
Services is the other golden egg. This is diverse, fast growing, and margin
enhancing, obviously you wouldn't know any of that. I have a quick question here,
which is on the optics of it which is that the slides apparently are blurry Angela, can
anything be done to improve the eligibility, very diﬃcult to follow the data. Can we
do anything? Or is that a ISP sort of thing from the client's side. Okay. I have a
question. So we'll have to -- for the client that asked the question will be happy to
send the graphs in an email, following the conversation. So services. So we have
specked out in detail. We think there are at least 11 sub-segments of the services, and
you can see that this is roughly a $48 billion business from a trailing 12-month
revenue perspective. We think that this is very diverse as I mentioned, but there are
certain elements that might be more popularly known versus certain others, we will
run through it in quick detail, but we'll also talk about potential areas of growth
across each of those.
The ﬁrst is AppleCare. AppleCare is we think were modelled around roughly at
about 26% of the of the services business. It's a substantial piece of the pie. Number
one. Number 2, it's a sticky piece of the pie and it's substantially diﬀerent than any
maintenance program that we have seen. This is -- a strong attach, and it's gotFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 5 of 17Geetha Ranganathanmonthly fee of somewhere in the $6 to $15 would conservatively assume the $12 to
$13 price point but the fact that it brings out roughly about a ﬁfth of the attach rate of
new phones, that's pretty staggering and so we think that this is a business that is a
steady-eddie business and we think as phones get more and more expensive the
attach rate potential is higher. The second is the App Store business and this is a
popularly known piece of the business. But the interesting piece is the division
between free apps and the paid apps and then potentially in app monetization. So
obviously there is a game downloads where you pay for -- for the app. Apple takes a
30% cut of that and for continuing revenue Apple takes 15% of that. So there is a
substantial monetization potential, a bulk of the apps here are third-party apps.
These are not Apple native apps. So, and we'll talk about why that's important, even
if you buy a Netﬂix subscription or a third party subscription through Apple, you pay
Apple 30% in the ﬁrst year, and 15% in the second year but a bulk of the Apple are --
a bulk of the apps are third-party apps. So there is remarkable potential for
potentially native apps, native content and obviously which are -- with a wider
revenue structure as much as a richer margin mix. This is an interesting business. The
fact that it's getting paid by Google to be the default search engine on all iOS
products is incredibly high margin piece of the business. We've modeled this out at
roughly about $8.8 billion in 2019. We have had some inclining of this from litigation
between the two when they ﬁnally settled to be the default search engine, but it's a
staggering number, number one. Number two, it's near 100% margins. And number
three, it's sticky. And we think that this is a piece of the pie. We actually modeled it
by modeling every other business very conservatively. And the leftover revenues
relative to the reported revenues is the licensing fees.
We've been rather conservative than I think relative to other broker estimates we've
seen there are - that have been mentioned in the popular press. We think that our
numbers are more conservative relative to that. I want to switch gears here and talk
about Apple's media aspirations. We will talk about the diﬀerent pieces of the pie in
the services business as they exist now, but I want to switch gears with Geetha
Ranganathan, who is our Media Analyst on the call and see what they could do with
the media franchise if they wanted to.
Geetha, you want to give us a quick screening [ph] of the media business, and what,
Apple could be interested in doing here?
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. Thanks Anand, and hello everyone. So streaming has become an
extremely crowded space with all the major media companies launching what is
called their direct to consumer platforms over the past few months. In fact you have
HBO Max, which went live today. Apple TV plus actually launched back in November
of 2019 with a fairly ambitious goal. They wanted to create Apple's own HBO. But
what's happened is a little over six months later, Apple TV plus is really not part of
the streaming conversation. So I kind of want to give you a sense of where we are in
terms of subscribers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 17So most signs indicate that the Apple service is oﬀ to somewhat of a slow start, a few
reports suggest about 10 million subscribers, which actually seems like a decent
number. The caveat there is that nobody is really paying for the service. Even though
it is a compelling 499 price point, which is one of the cheapest services out there,
but you have to remember, almost 100% of those subscribers are free and so six
months from now, Apple probably will have a tough time as those free trial start to
run out.
So if they want to catch up to a service like a Netﬂix or a Disney from a subscriber
standpoint, it's going to be a real tough slog. So why is this? So, of course, they are a
bit late to the game and it is a crowded market. So, you do need a diﬀerentiated
product. But if you kind of look at Apple and Disney, they launched their services at
the same time in November last year. So it kind of really then comes down to
content. So, Apple TV when they launched, they had nine original shows, so far this
service has about anywhere from 23 to 25 originals, and that's really a very slim
oﬀering compared to some of the heavy weights that are out there, especially if you
look at Netﬂix, which is kind of become this force in the original space with close to
almost 1200 titles.
So if you kind of look at the Apple TV plus service there just isn't enough to keep
people coming back day after day and oﬀ the oﬀerings that are available. I mean,
you have a few of their shows that did win some acclaim, but very few are really kind
of provoking the water cooler type of conversation. So what's really been the
stumbling block here? So you look at HBO. You look at Netﬂix, they didn't start out
being originals powerhouses. So HBO made its entrance playing old movies and
classic sitcoms that they syndicated. Netﬂix built its initial subscriber base by oﬀering
an exhaustive amount of licensed TV shows and movies that people wanted to
watch.
Disney Plus, for instance, owes most of its success to its kid focused back catalog. So
the bottom line is that Apple needs more content, and it needs a library. So the
question is what do they do next? So obviously money is no object for a company
like Apple. They can obviously aﬀord to put a lot of money for -- of course, paying for
some of these shows, and so I kind of put this slide up here to just show you the per
episode costs for some of the shows that are out there and just kind of take a look at
how Apple TV has really not held back when it come to spending on some of its
bigger shows, the Morning Show for instance $15 million per episode.
See, which is another science ﬁction show a similar amount. So you look -- just look
at per season costs. Those are pretty, pretty high from an industry perspective,
almost 150 million or so. But I think Apple was probably hoping for a much better
reception, after kind of heavily investing in such star powered shows, they really
haven't made that much of headway. So the question is what do they do, what do
they do next? And again, here I just kind of wanted to give you a sense of what the
big media operators are spending annually on content.
So if Apple really wants to be taken seriously in the media space, it's -- we're looking
at anywhere from about $20 billion to $25 billion for some of these biggerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 17Anand Srinivasan
Geetha Ranganathancompanies by 2023. So rather than spending on shows that don't necessarily have a
proven track record and with uncertain ROIs, I guess the big question is why not
invest in a library and this has kind of been the eternal question with investors, where
you can invest in a library, you can buy a catalog, you know what you're getting, but
they've always hesitated. When it has come to build versus buy, they've always kind
of gone with build as far as media is concerned. And then ﬁnally, here I just kind of
wanted to show some of the studios that are out there in the marketplace, which
could be potential acquisition targets.
So we just kind of looked at Sony, Lionsgate, MGM. These have all been rumored in
the past to be potential acquisition targets for Apple, you either take them
individually or you can kind of cobble them together and it's still a pretty
manageable price tag, maybe $35 billion, $40 billion. So the question is should
Apple be going after a studio?
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Geetha, we get investor questions on two subjects. One is what about Disney, right?
In this -- it's been talked about, it's not out of the realm of possibility, we've have
actually addressed that in our in our Apple Prime. So one is that I want you to talk
through that perhaps maybe there is hair on that given the acquisition of theme
parks, et cetera. And the second part is Apple still clipping a coupon for content that
you potentially buy through third parties, via the iOS platform.You know is what is the
risk of being just a distribution mechanism rather than a content owning -- owners
less distributor.
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So ﬁrst, going back to the Disney question. So the upside from acquiring
Disney would obviously be securing their content streaming strategy, and obviously
the potential synergies from adding all of that Disney IP to the iOS platform. The
problem right now and especially with COVID-19. I mean, even pre-COVID-19, a lot of
Disney's businesses especially their TV networks business is really kind of in secular
decline and I'm especially referencing ESPN and the whole cord cutting
phenomenon.
And now with the COVID-19 pandemic, we're ﬁnding that almost all of Disney's
legacy businesses and so that we go to theme parks, we go to TV networks, even
there is studio, it's kind of really getting battered up by the pandemic. And so I'm not
really sure whether Apple would kind of want to deal with so many of their
businesses that are in secular decline.
So that's as far as the Disney part is concerned, I mean other than streaming, really
nothing is working right now. In terms of owning content, I think, they ultimately have
to be able to own that library, because what's happening for them is if they really
want to be a media player as such, they really need to be able to have their own
shows, they need to be able to have a huge licensed library and because that hasn't
happened so the TV plus service itself, hasn't really taken oﬀ. So in terms of being aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Amine Bensaidmedia powerhouse themselves. I don't think that's really going to happen, unless
they are able to get access to a whole lot more of licensed content.
And so it ultimately kind of, yes, they are a very eﬀective distributor. And so, it kind of
depends on what they really wanted to, if that's the game that they want to keep
playing. I think, they obviously have been very successful so far. And they will
continue to be successful there.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. So if I want to expand the services business at a clip faster than the teams that
we are seeing right now, it requires a major stake on the battleﬁeld, which one way
of doing that is by acquiring content.
{BIO 15007716 <GO>}
Exactly.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you, Geetha. Switching gears now into a little bit more successful piece
of the business, which is Apple Music. The interesting part of it is Apple's musics
library is larger but the users are best advised Spotify. So this is a hardware they have
been such as a splash, they have such a big content here and I really want to
understand the dynamics of this business and see where this could go and for that I
have, Amine Bensaid. Amine, what's your take on the music streaming business, and
potentially where Apple is potentially strong and potentially weak relative to Spotify?
{BIO 18756763 <GO>}
Thanks, Anand and welcome, everyone. So I think the trends we see today for audio
like you mentioned, and also as Geetha mentioned, I think they are similar to what
streaming video experienced, two, three years ago. So what I mean by that is on one
hand we have music streaming. I think, growing around 30% in the past two years,
but margins have remained relatively low at around 20% to 25%. So I think now we
have entered the phase of where the narrative has started to shift from traditional to
digital, which is like the slide you see here are worth pointing to the right side.
So (inaudible) everything that is traditional meaning like broadcast or satellite radio
which is more exactly like HAM [ph]. But now as viewers and audience is starting to
shift to over the top or streaming audio. The demand has surged, especially with
COVID-19 and that is expected to accelerate due to this pandemic we are
experiencing. So but what I mean by that is the narrative is going to change, not only
it's going to be focused on music, but it's going to be focused on audio, in general.
That means -- meaning only content is probably going to get focused in the next few
years. So -- and the reason for that if we can shift to the next slide. When we look at a
traditional audio versus digital, we see that the declines on traditional audio wereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 17Anand Srinivasan
Amine Bensaidalready expected to happen this year. And the chart on the left, this is basically radio
versus digital audio and what's interesting here is this was done pre-COVID-19.
So we expect this actually works and what's key here and speaking to maybe at the
iPhone demographic. The younger audiences are leaving the traditional ecosystem
much faster than slightly older audiences. So for that the rest of [ph] content and I
think it's going to be a focus in next few years, as I mentioned. So that's what we saw
Spotify has been upwards of 100 of millions of dollars on content such as Podcast.
And just last week, we saw a couple of reports discussing how Apple and Amazon
are also thinking about investing in Podcast. So going back to your question. Who
wins in this new era. And what -- who are the key leaders.
I think you mentioned Spotify is the largest or the platform today. I think, they have
the upper hand because they did invest in Podcast way earlier and just recently a
week ago, we did have the (inaudible) got the rights for Joe Hogan, which is
arguably one of the top podcasts out there, but I think I am seeing, Apple, Amazon
investing in content helps audio overall, and more speciﬁcally digital audio. So then
traditional players are the ones who are at risk today meaning like the two sections
of the world, which I think they probably going to keep losing more share in the next
few years.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. So again, it comes back to a content story, similar to the video franchise,
where they have to continue to invest in content and potentially acquire big content
in the podcast space, is that the subscriber growth and all here as well, Amine?
{BIO 18756763 <GO>}
I think, it's stage one. The way I see it is podcast is the ﬁrst step to reach both
attractive margins of content, owning the content because when we think about
music, music is -- it's kind of dominated by four major players. One of them -- they
said today, they announced improvements for the IPO. So you have one, you know,
Universal, you have Sony and Merlin. So those are the four -- basically the labels have
almost complete dominance on the music aspects, so that's why margins have
diﬃculty [ph]. So to answer your question, yes, I think, Podcast is the ﬁrst stage, but
when a Spotify on Apple did become big enough. I suspect that they are going to
focus on everything that is audio related. I don't know if Music starting to make their
own music or starting to get deals with artist is going to happen in the next two to
three years. I think, it's unlikely. But I think the end goal is you are -- you've become
big enough that you have the artist coming to you. Also you divest into other parts of
the audio meaning like the other shows like for example, SiriusXM has great shows
with Spark and Howard Stern.
So if you think of those shows starting to shift to digital, that's when we see the
content margins really improving at the bottom line for Spotify and also for the major
players like Apple and Amazon.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Julie Chariell{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you, Amine. Now within the services piece of the pie, FinTech where
Apple Pay, Apple Cards or associated businesses that could be and currently exist
are not a big piece of the pie. But we wanted to highlight this sliver of a business
because we think that it has incredible growth opportunity, number one. And
number two, we think that COVID ampliﬁes that growth opportunity, and with me on
the call is Julie Chariell, who is our FinTech Analyst and to potentially run through
some of the opportunity sets and what Apple is doing and could be doing and sort
of inspirationally talk about the -- the expansive nature of this business. Julie, what's
your take here?
{BIO 17144999 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks, Anand. So the market opportunity that we're looking at now. We really
have because of COVID sort of these three oﬀsetting trends. On the negative side,
we have this overall slowdown in consumer spending. All right. We know things are
bad, especially in April getting a little bit better in May, but that's sort of the negative
right going to recessionary environment. Consumer spending is slowing, which
could hurt any kind of spending via Apple Pay or Apple Card. On the other side,
there has been very strong uptake in electronic payments. People perceive them as
safer than using cash everything is about contactless, no touch and electronic
payments, whether it's with a contactless credit card or with a mobile phone through
a wallet, accessing Apple Pay or others.
That's really begun to take oﬀ. The other positive has been its uptake in e-commerce,
which also just necessitates the use of electronic payments. So the update in e-
commerce has been very strong really actually growing even better -- at a better rate
than before COVID. So far as physical stores are just closed. So those are the
oﬀsetting trends that we're looking at. Let me give you some quick numbers around
this. On the consumer spending side, I am going to use MasterCard here as a proxy,
they've been giving some good spending data. In mid-April, which is basically the
bottom in spending on cards, spending was down 26% in the US and down 33%
internationally. Now fast forward to mid-May. Things have gotten much better. Still
down. So spending in the US was down 6% by mid-May and down 19%
internationally.
You have to kind of ask here, then we think about how sustainable is this? Right. Why
the diﬀerence? Why is international still down so much compared to the US when
many countries around the world have begun opening up ahead of even the US. So
in this case, we have to look to stimulus. By mid-May about 75% of the stimulus
checks were already distributed and so we think that has given a bit of a bump to US
spending, which was a bigger bump, but a temporary one right. To keep that going,
we need to re-openings to kick in -- to come online without a second wave of the
virus really shutting things down again and perhaps even some more stimulus which
the Republican and the Senate are now talking about and getting behind to keep
that going.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Julie ChariellInternationally, we see, not so much stimulus yet some on the way apparently with
EU making some moves today, but the improvement in the international markets
have been a bit slower, because it's just been about very slow and gradual re-
openings. So keeping that in perspective, better than it was in April, but still
something to be watched. When you look at the uptake. The positive side, electronic
payments growing. We have some really interesting data points that we have just
some -- just come out in the past week. According to MasterCard contactless card
use grew 40% in the ﬁrst quarter and is three times higher than the norm in US and
two times higher in international markets.
So people are using contactless cards and what we call tap to pay. In the second
quarter, Visa said that 60% of face to face transactions were tap to pay or contactless
and that could very easily include a mobile wallet or tap to pay. So 60% of those face
to face transactions which have to pay and that growth is 40%. So we're seeing very
clear increases in use of these electronic contactless payments. The other positive on
the e-commerce side these trends have been really, really impressive.
We have some numbers from Visa, what they refer to as card-not-present transaction
essentially online transactions. The spending was down 10% in the ﬁrst half of April,
up 10% in the second half of April. If you exclude travel, the spending was up 10% in
the ﬁrst half of April, which was sort of the worst of it and then by the second half of
April, it was up 30%. And that's better than what it was before. So these trends are
really driving some important shifts in the way people behave, they're moving away
from cash faster to cards and to mobile payments like Apple Pay and that should
rethink in the case of well positioned companies like Apple should help to oﬀset the
slowdown in consumer spending overall.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Julie, what's the -- I mean sort of the case for Apple Pay and potentially the
expansion there is obvious, but the one thing is that the growth rates are staggering
number one. But what does Apple want to do potentially with Apple Card and
compare and contrast this with where Apple could take its -- is it trying to become a
ﬁnancing engine, is this their leasing business equivalent of a Dell or an HP that
provides customer ﬁnancing, what does it want to do with Apple Card in your mind.
And how does that compare and contrast to its peers, potentially?
{BIO 17144999 <GO>}
Yeah. So we have sort of the near-term picture and the longer-term picture. Near-
term picture on Apple Card, a little bit tough, they've oﬀered deferrals on payments
to customers in March and April. We've heard about 20% of cardholders taking
advantage of this. So we'll see some loan loss reserves, but ultimately, we think
there's lots of opportunity with the card. They are already oﬀering incentives for
holders of the Apple Card to use the Apple Card in their mobile wallets. So with
Apple Pay, right and give it in extra cash back as incentive to use it. So that's the way
to start, it can use Apple Pay to driving more usage of an Apple Pay.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Anand SrinivasanSo that's one beneﬁt of Apple Card. Over time, the company is accumulating data on
its consumers, right. It's accumulating data on the credit worthiness of them, who --
how much credit are they taking on their available -- on their available balances?
How well are they paying? Are they paying on time? Are they paying more than a
minimum payment and they could use that data to do more potentially in the
consumer loan side likely with a partner on the bank, whether it's Goldman or
another partner. They can look to do other things in digital banking like oﬀering
savings or oﬀering investment accounts.
This by the way works with Apple Pay as well, right. Apple Pay extensively is a wallet.
There's a lot, you might want to do with your wallet. So there are a lot of
opportunities that we see there down the road and it comes from the data that the
Company is gathering. They've been one of the pioneers in oﬀering installment
payments. So you can buy your Apple products in installments, pay over 24-months
and installments have been used elsewhere in the world, but haven't been that
popular in the US, but they seem to be gaining some nice traction for Apple as sort
of the unique thing that they can do with the data that they have and helping to
support general purchases of Apple products. One more single add on the card that
I think could be interesting is the rewards -- points kind of opportunity. If you think of
the hiring nature of the Apple user, and let's say an Amex does bringing in retail
partners that if those retail partners can oﬀer incentives.
So that an Apple cardholder can get -- can earn points to use with those retail
partners, could be a very powerful ecosystem for the Apple Card.
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Got it. And the interesting thing was, this is both the ﬁnancing angle as well as the
breakup of payments or the partial payment plan has a dramatic impact and their
trade-in program has a dramatic impact on helping iPhone shipments. So, and --
yeah, so that -- that has some value. Thank you, Julie Chariell.

{BIO 16652971 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 13 of 17Got it. Thank you, Julie. We're going to dive deep a little bit and go into the supply
chain, little bit and talk about Apple's chip ambition. The interesting is very quietly
Apple is already a top 10 semiconductor revenue company with only one customer.
It's a closed ecosystem. It's a captive silicon provider, $8.5 billion of revenue in 2019
quote, unquote revenue and that compares very favorably to something like an AMD
for example, and you can see that it stacks up pretty nicely against the other leaders
in this space, obviously it makes very few kind of chips mostly focused on --
exclusively focused on Logic or not exclusively, because there is the power
management which is technically analog.
So logic and secondarily analog, but the one thing I want to point to is one, Apple's
chip ambitions are going to rise and it's going to try and make a lot more chips part
of its ecosystem, that's number one. Number two is those chip selections of which
chips need to be made by Apple are not going to be necessarily a long cost savings
lines exclusively. So the cheapest chips they're not going to be made by third parties
and the most expensive chips are going to be made by Apple that's not necessarily
of a constraint. And so we think that the vectors along which Apple is going to bring
chips in-house are one of -- one tightness of integration the potential feature set that
Apple can enhance by making its own chips, number one. Number two is potential
cost savings and number three, not to be minimized is the cadence. I remember
when we were talking to companies that made WiFi chips and made cellular chips or
this was 15-years ago and they both had separate cadences and as to why there was
no integration potential between a cellular modem, and a WiFi chip outside of the
design constraints. And the answer for that was each one operated on a diﬀerent
cadence, cellular refreshed less or less frequently than WiFi and people have been
wanted to have -- trade one beneﬁt for the other.
And as a result, WiFi still has integrated with Bluetooth, and FM stereo, but still hasn't
integrated with cellular modems. This is a quick breakdown of the billing materials
for the iPhone Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max and you can see that the App processor is at
the high end of the stack from a price perspective or cost perspective. But the PMIC,
the power management chip for the App processor as well as for the audio is at the
low end of the stack. There are potentially higher ASP products that could be
brought in-house, the display, the cameras, et cetera, but those are unlikely to be
brought in-house only because the cadence of that is diﬀerent and you have a
specialty supplier that does very few things, but does those things well and it's not in
the best interest of Apple to potentially bring that back in-house.
If you look at the supply chain, talking a little bit more extensively as well. And
looking at the US supply chain on the left. The supply chain is volatile. We've been
through multiple iterations of everything from the TouchPad on the iPod, which had
the track wheel to power management to audio codecs, where suppliers have been
changed willy-nilly or supposedly from the outside in and it looks that way but Apple
has a process where it changes suppliers, once every two to three years, and that has
dramatic consequences to the supply chain because those suppliers over the course
of a year or two have become substantially wedded to the Apple business to the
point where it's nearly 80% of Cirrus, it's 20% of Broadcom, it's substantially 7% of
Intel.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 14 of 17Woo Jin HoSo it has substantial consequences but for Apple, Apple is starting to either be very
speciﬁc about the design or is going in for a cheaper price. And as a result, makes
that swap, which has consequences. The one critical partner for Apple in our minds
is TSMC, and even though it's a small partner, it enables the manufacturing of
Apple's in-house design chips and this is a critical partner. So given the drama that is
going on trade war part 2, if you may, and TSMC's involvement as a pressure point
for Huawei's manufacturing. This could be -- this could have some consequences
where the US and China use TSMC as a pinch point. And the third point I would
make here is, this is not going to drive the margins in the near term. The -- even if
Apple were to bring a substantial portion of its chip manufacturing in-house or its
chip design in-house, the mix between the product business and the services
business is a bigger driver of margins relative to the impact of chip in-sourcing
versus not.
And on that subject. So I -- I want to be clear, we actually have gross margins
potentially weakening. And I want to have Woo Jin Ho come in and talk about why
that might potentially happen and -- prices are not likely to change in '20 calendar
year 2020 and you've introduced a low-end priced phone. So you have price
pressure on the numerator, you have cost pressure on the denominator which
weakens product's margins and -- so the services improvement is the key driver of
gross margin improvement on the Apple business, but I want to talk a little bit about
potentially the iPhone franchise and why speciﬁcally there could be pain points or
the costs or the billing materials for future generations of the iPhone, speciﬁcally on
5G.
Woo Jin, what's your take here?
{BIO 15225630 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Anand, and hello everybody. So, I do want to further the silicon
discussion for Apple, from a merchant silicon perspective and then touch on 5G
radio frequency chip and it actually goes beyond the chip itself that would
potentially basically our billing materials. So we are on the billing materials page.
And as you can see that Apple has aggressively spent on certain areas number one,
application processors and modems that went up, the battery that went up as well as
RF mixed signal that went up and I want to throw in the Apple chipmaker into three
big buckets.
One, they want to diﬀerentiate from an operational and performance perspective.
Now some of these include faster download speeds which may sustain radio
frequency chip improvements in every generation, better battery life, which means
better PLICs [ph] and newer architectures to support more Subpmex [ph] over time
and this is what I'd like to call the under the hood chips. Number two. They want to
diﬀerentiate from the user experience or sensory experience to support some of
these services. Think of their audio chips as Anand said an ampliﬁers in the phone,
EarPods and AirPods to complement their music services or to the camera image
sensor to complement their video and photo applications. So these -- Apple is
always going to invest in these kind of chips. And then the last bucket is bringing in
new technologies to support existing or upcoming services.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 15 of 17Now some of the specs on the iPhone may lag. Some of what Samsung may provide,
but they also introduced some really cool things and newer chips that other vendors
did not provide. Number one, think about the near ﬁeld communications for Apple
Pay that helps. Think about the Touch ID for a single touch and that evolved over to
Face ID to the Face ID module and that will potentially provide augmented reality
applications. So from an Apple perspective, it's always looking to innovate the
iPhone and the iPhone ecosystem and it's going for the best of breed chips.
However, from a merchant silicon perspective, as Anand said, it is piece of famine. If
you secured an -- content on an iPhone, it's fantastic. iPhone volumes are high, if you
decide in to -- to the entire portfolio from the low end to the high-end ARPU
represent $800 -- to 180 to a 200 million plus unit opportunity. So if you are a sole
supplier that's quickly going to be $200 million of sales. If it's a $1. If the content is a
dollar per chip and it's a high-margin sale at 40% to 50% gross margin. However,
like Anand said, Apple likes dual source or multiple source vendors, but that's part of
it trying to manage supply risk and the other is to manage pricing, but also as Anand
said being over reliant on Apple does come with meaningful risk. There is
replacement risk, the Apple -- the chip ecosystem is highly competitive and some of
the more mature chips can be replaced by another vendor or by Apple month --
such as the case was dialogs main PEMEX being in sourced. Cirrus Logic displacing
Maxim Integrated for audio chips and the technology risk some technologies don't
have a long shelf life such as a Touch ID, ADI's Touch ID and 3D touch that was
eventually displaced with Face ID and that was a to $600 million to $700 million
sales opportunity that eventually was gone in the span of 2 years, now as we move
forward from a radio frequency perspective, as I said, Apple has always emphasized
performance other than the apps processor or modem, the architecture has been an
area of emphasis.Apple has relied on the RF market leaders, Broadcom, Skyworks
and Qorvo and as you could see in the billing materials where RF has always been
the area that they will meaningfully invest in as the RF mixed signal chain investment
bond increased 37 in the iPhone 11 Pro versus the 10 Max. Now we're all anticipating
a 5G iPhone later this year and based on the chipmaker results call this prior quarter,
Apple, should be shipping a 5G device later in 3Q or early in 4Q. IDC is forecasting
roughly 36 million 5G shipments in 4Q and that supports what the chip providers are
saying.
Now the 5G, the 5G requirements will need greater spectrum support. So 5 for sub 6
gigahertz, you'll need support for 5.2, 5.6, 5.8 gigahertz band as well as a 3.5-
gigahertz band and that will create -- do still create power -- ampliﬁer opportunities
for Broadcom and Qorvo but the iPhone 5 G will also support millimeter wave
spectrum and if Apple produces a global phone, it will be to support 24.25 to 29.5-
gigahertz spectrum and that's going to create opportunity for Qualcomm, because
Qualcomm is the only gaming tail for millimeter wave modules. So for standard 5G
phones, the RF content opportunity increased for the front end goes from 18 to 25.
Apple already has roughly $30 to $32 in its 4G devices. If you add sub 6 as well as
way as middleware content that's going to yield roughly $45 or more right in RF
content in a 5G phone. Now we're just talking about inside the phone because of
the radio propagation properties of phone, your all class phone will actually need to
have less aluminum on the housing and that's going to create opportunities forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 16 of 17Anand SrinivasanCorning as well because you do need more glass to help the radio propagation
around the phone.
So you -- there are incremental dollars to provide that premium connectivity
experience for your devices. I'll stop right there. Anand??
{BIO 16652971 <GO>}
Thank you, Woo Jin Ho. The one interesting thing about radio frequency is that this is
not a chip that is likely to be made in-house now or later. Only because radio
frequency uses specialty manufacturing is unlikely to be made on complementary
metal oxide semiconductor, is typically made on gallium arsenide, built in relative to
silicon phosphorus or boron or phosphorus and silicon, which are typical digital
chips, if you may. So these are chips that are continuing to be made -- will likely
continue to be made where Broadcom, Qualcomm, Skyworks, Qorvo. So this content
increase is a beneﬁt to them and will pinch costs. I know that we didn't discuss a
whole lot of businesses with Apple, it's hard to given the timeframe of this call, we
didn't discuss AirPods, we did discuss iPad, we didn't discuss, Mac.
Again we're seeing on those two vectors iPhone installed base and services, but I
wanted to take a moment to talk about valuations. Obviously, we have seen dramatic
inﬂection of valuations and if you look at the 24 times fee that we're at well above
average, but we think that this is an anticipatory eﬀect of potentially not only
healthier iPhone shipments or iPhone installed base in the future number one, but
also that the price point of the installed base and the technology behind the
installed base in this case 5G that is going to buoy the platform, which again brings
in the second golden egg, which is the Services business, we think that there is
potential for inﬂection there.
Again, we have for calendar year 2021, our total revenue expansion that is notably
above consensus and we would urge you to look up our -- both our model on VI
space MODO. It has, or excuse me APL, US equity, MODO, it has the -- our model
attached to it and also look at the -- our primer on the Bloomberg Intelligence
System, you can do that by hitting BI go or you can look at the ticker and type BICO
as a tail to that ticker. Last point on PEs, it's comparable to tech peers. So before we
get away, we're saying dramatically expensive. Yes. Scale is an impediment. But we
think that there is -- it is both a beneﬁt and a burden and we are focused on the
iPhone installed base and the drag of the services, the continuing attach of the
services business.
With that, let's close up the presentation, I know we didn't have too much time for
Q&A, but you have all of our emails up on the screen. The presentations will be
shared and feel free to ping us directly with questions, we'll be happy to answer
them. Thank you very much for your time and if you look at BI GO all of the
information discussed can be found on there and you have our analyst emails as
well. Thank you very much for your time, and have a great week. With that, Angela
