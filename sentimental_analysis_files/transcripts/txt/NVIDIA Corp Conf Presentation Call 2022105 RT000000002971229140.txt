Good morning. Happy New Years and welcome to our 20th Annual CES Virtual Tech
Investor Forum. My name is Harlan Sur, I'm the semiconductor and semiconductor
capital equipment analyst with the ﬁrm. Very pleased to introduce Colette Kress,
Chief Financial Oﬃcer of NVIDIA. It's been a tradition to have the NVIDIA team to be
ﬁrst present in our conference, because the team is driving much of the trends that
you will be hearing about today, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Compute Acceleration, Next-
Generation Compute Architectures and Automotive, Next-Generation Gaming
Technology along with emerging software and services ratable revenue stream.
So, I'll ask Colette to start us oﬀ with an overview of what the team announced
yesterday, at its special CES Address, and then we'll go ahead and kick oﬀ the Q&A.
So Colette, thank you for joining us today and let me go ahead and turn it over to
you.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thanks so much, Harlan for having us here. We appreciate the time to kick [ph] you
oﬀ every single year. But I do need to start oﬀ with an open reminder, that the
presentation may contain forward-looking statements and investors are advised to
read our reports, ﬁled with the SEC for information related to risks and uncertainties
facing our business.
So we're here at CES primarily just virtually and we had an opportunity to both
discuss some announcements and things that are aligned to our growth drivers
moving forward. Let me ﬁrst start with our gaming and graphics. We're seeing a
signiﬁcant growth opportunity in GeForce and Omniverse.
First, we've had record PC gamers. If you've seen in the previous part of this week,
Steam had announced that the concurrent users on Steam had reached record
levels. Additionally, we have the creator Metaverse economy in front of us. Recently,
companies such as Nike and Gucci have announcements in the Metaverse, a big riseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-05

Page 2 of 10of inﬂuencers and broadcasters. This is aligned to our strategy here with both studio
and Omniverse.
But some of the announcements that we did at CES yesterday regarding gaming and
Omniverse. First, the new laptop inclusive of GPUs. Laptops that we discussed are
available starting on February 1. First one's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti laptops, starting just
under $2,500, faster than the desktop of NVIDIA, Titan RTX.
Additionally, we announced the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti laptops, starting at just under
$1,500. These are 70% faster than RTX 3070 super laptops. So unveiling more than
160 gaming and studio laptop designs for this New Year. These are on the fourth
generation of our Max-Q technology. To remind you, our Max-Q technology is
essential in creating the thin and light, and also the high-performance laptops that
we all know. These new studio laptops are also based on the 3080 Ti and the 3070
Ti. These on average are 7x faster for the 3D rendering than the latest MacBook Pro
16, and they support more than 200 creative applications.
Additionally, we have the new GeForce RTX 3050 for desktops. The ﬁrst 50 class
desktop GPU to power the latest ray-traced games at over 60 frames per second. It
starts just under $250 and will be available later this month, January 27 from
NVIDIA's worldwide partners.
We also announced new RTX games, 10 new RTX games, including titles, like The
Day Before, The Escape from Tarkov and the highly anticipated Ubisoft title, Rainbow
Six Extraction. Over 20 million GeForce gamers compete with Reﬂex each month as
well. So our RTX games are here to work seamlessly with our RTX infrastructure as
well.
Moving to GeForce Now. GeForce Now is our cloud streaming GeForce service. We
have extended the partnership to Electronic Arts, bringing Battleﬁeld 4 and
Battleﬁeld 5 to GeForce Now streaming today. We also announced a partnership
with Samsung to integrate GeForce Now in its smart TVs, starting in Q2 of this year,
and then partnerships with AT&T. AT&T, starting in January, customers that are on 5G
can get a six-month GeForce Now priority membership at no charge.
NVIDIA Omniverse is now also available at no cost to individual creators on RTX
GPUs. This new platform feature Omniverse Nucleus cloud enables simple one click
to collaborate sharing of large Omniverse 3D screens. This new platform
developments are also available, such as Omniverse Machinima and Omniverse
Audio2Face. Since its open beta just a year ago, Omniverse has been downloaded
by more than 100,000 creators. Today's there -- today, there is 14 connectors to
applications like Autodesk and Autodesk Maya, and Epic Games' Unreal Engine.
So these are important announcements that we've made just here now at CES this
year, but we also took this opportunity to talk about Auto. Auto has seen an
important inﬂection in the world of electric vehicle adoption. This will beneﬁt ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-05

Page 3 of 10Q - Harlan Surbusiness as we start shipping Orin this year, as our designs with -- design wins with
Orin in electronic vehicles are signiﬁcant.
In China and U.S., they are positioned as tech companies with software-deﬁned
strategy, these new electronic vehicles. Hyperion 8 adoption opened up the
opportunity for ADAS and also auto opportunities include Omniverse Replicator,
Omniverse Sim, NVIDIA AI DGX, and NVIDIA AGX.
When we talk about our announcements that we made here at CES for auto, it ﬁrst
starts with our leading Tier 1 partners that have adopted the DRIVE Hyperion 8
platform. Hyperion 8 is our computer architecture and sensor set for full driving
systems. And we have many of our OEM partners today, including Desay, Flex,
Quanta, Valeo and ZF also, who have adopted the platform. They help manufacture
production-ready DRIVE Hyperion systems. DRIVE Hyperion platforms have been
adopted by all of these new energy vehicle OEMs.And we also are seeing the
upcoming cluster three SUV features, a centralized computer architecture powered
by NVIDIA DRIVE.
DRIVE Orin adoption by these NEVs in China, NIO, Xpeng, Li Auto, R Auto and SAIC
are also key at this time. These are the world's largest automakers, very successful
driving transition to the NEVs. Nearly 20% of all cars sold in China in this past quarter
were electric.
And then lastly, TuSimple. We are building its autonomous trucking platform on
NVIDIA DRIVE Orin. Consumer shopping has dramatically shifted online, resulting in
increased demand for trucking and last mile delivery. So a lot of great things,
announcements, both driving growth in key areas such as graphics and gaming, but
also a focus of auto here at CES.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
It's a great overview, Colette. Thanks a lot. Let me kick it oﬀ with the ﬁrst few
questions. For clients tuning in, you can feel free to use the Q&A button on your
digital dashboard to type in a question. So, let's start oﬀ with the overall business
trends and supply-side situation as we head into calendar '22.
So, last time at this year, the consensus view was that the NVIDIA team would grow
their revenues 20%, 25% in calendar '21. If you hit your guidance this quarter, the
team is set to grow its business 60% plus in calendar year '21. So, quite a bit of
upside relative to prior expectations and the Street has to team up another 18% to
20% for this calendar year, which is your ﬁscal '23. Help us understand the trends
and product cycles that are going to drive your ﬁscal '23 and longer term? HowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-05

Page 4 of 10A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kressshould we think about the overall growth proﬁle for the diﬀerent business segments,
gaming, data center, ProVis and automotive?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. A great question. So, let me ﬁrst start with one of our key opportunities that has
been with us and that is RTX. RTX has been powering graphics for both the gaming
and our ProVis businesses. This technology continues to fuel remote collaboration. It
allows distributed virtual workforce and it also helps the creators in their work that
they do. Omniverse now adds a signiﬁcant growth vector to gaming and enterprises
with virtual worlds and digital twins. RTX will still be powering our growth as we
move into this new calendar year.
Secondly, data center demand led by full scale deployments of AI are now being
seen inferencing and AI continue to outpace overall data center growth. Our
software opportunities help enterprises easily deploy AI solutions from our
enterprise AI software to our over 150 SDKs tailored to speciﬁc industries to
advanced AI, computer vision, inference and natural language processing. So data
center will continue to be an important growth as we move forward.
And then lastly, our $8 billion autonomous pipeline in automotive will begin to take
oﬀ in the second half of this calendar year or our ﬁscal 2023. From designs across
the passenger vehicles, the robotaxis and the trucking. We have announced many of
our NEVs additional piece as well, including Orin which will be an important factor as
well.
So those are some of the things that we think about as we start this new calendar
year. Much of the growth that we started to see in this last ﬁscal year will also be very
important for us as we move into the new ﬁscal and calendar year.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
From a supply side perspective, near term like many others, NVIDIA is supply
constrained and I would assume across most of your product lines. Gaming GPU
channel inventories, for example, were low entering into this past holiday season
and we just checked some of the online retail sites and NVIDIA GPU gaming card
pricing is still 3x to 4x higher versus MSRP suggesting that tight supply situation still
exists in the channel. You guys also pointed out in the last earnings call that data
center networking sales are also impacted by supply constraints.
So I guess the ﬁrst question is, what products are the most bottlenecked? And with
the forward supply purchase commitments stepping up here, any sense on when we
should expect to see the team making progress on narrowing the supply-demand
gap?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Over this last ﬁscal year, we've been working on our supply chain as well as our
ecosystem supply chain each quarter to make great progress as right now, we see
strong demand and we've experienced that across the board. Our demand hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-05
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 10Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Harlan Surexceeded our supply, primarily in our gaming business throughout this year, but we
were able to continue to grow our gaming business this last ﬁscal year, each and
every quarter sequentially.
At the same time, we are securing supply for current demand. We are also
partnering with our supply chains to assist in our future capacity needs. In the
second half of calendar year '22, we believe we'll be in great shape in terms of
supply, being able to meet the demand that is out there. But for right now, we'll
continue to work to gather more supply and eﬀectively work with the ecosystem to
provide more products faster than market at this time.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
The team committed $1.6 billion of prepayments for supply in ﬁscal Q3. And you
have commitments for another $6.9 billion till the end of calendar year '22 this year.
So given the better visibility from a supply perspective and a strong demand
environment, is it fair to assume that revenue growth for NVIDIA is really more
dependent on supply growth? And given that demand is strong, is it also fair to
assume that if you increase supply sequentially for the next few quarters, you can
drive better than the seasonal trends, even, let's say, for the seasonally weaker April
quarter as well?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So our demand has been stronger than supply for several quarters. And yes, we
continue to drive for these long-term supply commitment to help meet that future
demand. And they will start kicking in, in the future but right now, we are still working
with our supplier partners today to enhance our overall supply.
Now, normal seasonality in our businesses like gaming have not really materialized
due to the lean H1[ph] levels and the strong demand. This situation probably will
continue until the channel levels start to increase. It's too early to comment at this
time in terms of Q1, but our holiday demand was strong and we believe the channel
still remains lean [ph].
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Right. So let's start oﬀ with some of your product segments, especially on data
center. So, data center, 40% of your overall revenues, the business is tracking
towards 50% year-over-year growth in calendar '21. The team has driven a 65%
CAGR on this business over the past ﬁve years, phenomenal growth, and the team
guided for further acceleration on a year-over-year basis here for this quarter.
Our hardware team is seeing strong cloud and hyperscale CapEx spending for this
year. It's targeted to be up about 30% year-over-year, which is consistent with your
view that hyperscalers will be a strong driver of the data center business this year.
Combine this with continued strong enterprise adoption, strong networking demand
pull, can the team continue to drive its data center growth proﬁle sort of north of
30% this year you think?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-05

Page 6 of 10A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. In our data center business, we're at this point dedicated to build the best
accelerated computing platform for the world. NVIDIA AI has outperformed DC
growth this last year. NVIDIAs have the best chips for accelerated computing, our
A100. And NVIDIA's architecture is also better, that are not only overall in terms of
TCO, but also better in terms of delivering performance, as it become very notable
in our MLPerf performance. It delivers both highest performance, both on training
and in inferencing.
Our platform is also programmable. It's versatile and it oﬀers this high TCO for the
hyperscales as well as the enterprises. The NVIDIA AI platform is available from the
major CSPs as they create incentives, as well as our certiﬁed OEMs and our ODMs in
terms of these servers' makers. It is the only full stack platform that serves a broad
range of applications and supporting AI. We believe our AI priorities are aligned to
the enterprises and the hyperscale priorities as we move into this new ﬁscal year. The
data center growth will be a driver for us in this new calendar year, just as it was in
this last year.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Then the enterprise market I think for most semi companies including NVIDIA,
obviously seeing strong demand recovery combined with for NVIDIA, expanding
adoption from enterprise and vertical customers for new applications, like
accelerating, computing, AI, natural language processing, recommendation engines.
The team is driving very strong growth here. Are we at an inﬂection point where
enterprise and vertical's growth could match or continue to match the growth of
your hyperscale customers? And maybe even be a bigger revenue contributor going
forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So ﬁrst, let's start oﬀ and our enterprise and hyperscale mix in the data center today
is about 50-50 with also a small percentage going to supercomputing. Keep in
mind, in those hyperscales 50%, there is a portion of that is also available for cloud
computing. The cloud computing is an ability for researchers, higher education as
well as enterprises to quickly on store [ph]. They may be at the start, but they may
continue to maintain in the cloud. So it's diﬃcult for us to say speciﬁcally from an end
customer perspective, how large the enterprise is. But it's an important piece.
We've been expanding our TAM in the data center. We've expanded our TAM in the
data center to include Enterprise software, also inclusive of Omniverse infrastructure
on the software and then also our great GPU. So we have more than 150 software
development kits that are geared towards the Enterprise industries, 65 of them for
example are even new or updated most recently with our GTC announcements a
couple months ago. So now as we look at Enterprise AI software, it's available for
Enterprises to take advantage of our full stack of AI software that we use here at
NVIDIA, also having it aligned with VMware to enable the easy deployments.
Omniverse Enterprise is also in general availability. We're seeing 700 companies
evaluate, we're seeing more than 70,000 downloads as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-05

A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Harlan SurSo, enterprises are purchasing AI platforms through these hyperscale clouds, but
also directly. Now, as we see going into this year, Enterprise's growth will continue to
be a huge opportunity for us in the data center.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Let's talk about the software, because you did mention it in your commentary just
now. So you're enabling customers to come to market rapidly, but developing full-
stack turnkey solutions. You're monetizing your software and platforms to
subscription and licensing-based services. AI LaunchPad for Enterprise is a good
example. GeForce Now on the gaming side is another great example. In automotive,
you've got the revenue sharing partnerships and you're just now starting to
proliferate as you mentioned, Omniverse Enterprise through a subscription and
licensing model.
It's for sure a multi-billion dollar opportunity longer term, but near-to-mid term, what
percentage of your revenues today are generated by these annuity like very high
margin revenue streams? And any way to help us frame the aggregate opportunity
looking out over the next three to ﬁve years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So it's true. Our software opportunity that we see in front of us is a multi-billion
dollar opportunity, with all the diﬀerent opportunities that we have put out there,
whether that be Omniverse, Enterprise, AI. We have base command, ﬂeet command,
many diﬀerent forms in their early stages. The most important thing with the software
is most of it is also available with the infrastructure the hardware purchases. These
will be an important combination as we move forward.
Software is not new to us. We've been key with software for more than 10 years.
Many of our platforms that are sold today, incorporate software that is essentially
coming with the infrastructure for free. So, software as a standalone purchased, is
with us for software support and enterprises are very interested in receiving that
support for their mission-critical applications. We believe that this will grow, but
we're still in the early stages of this enterprise, but realize that it is an important
driver of adoption with the enterprise.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
At some point when it gets to a certain scale, will you guys be breaking out software
and services, you think?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We will certainly -- yes, we will certainly through this time be able to help our
investors, both to understand our progress that we have made with metrics along
the way. And at some point in the future, we'll be able to comment in terms of the
absolute size.

Q - Harlan SurGreat. Thank you for that. Let's touch upon gaming. So 45% of your overall business,
demand continues to be quite strong here. Business is on track for 60% year-over-
year growth in calendar '21. The new RTX 30 series is driving a strong upgrade cycle.
You just announced RTX 3050, 3090 Ti products yesterday. But enthusiast class
gamers still can't easily get their hands on a 30 series card, both desktop and
mobile. You mentioned that 30 series and ray tracing are only about 25% penetrated
in the installed base. If you have the supply or looking at the historical adoption
rates, where would we be normally in terms of penetration on 18 months post launch
of a new architecture?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So let's ﬁrst start with RTX. RTX is in its second generation and RTX is about 25% of
our installed base, based on our estimates. Now Ampere is our most successful
architecture at this point. And the price points launched so far, we have enabled RTX
at manufacturer's suggested retail prices, even below the $350 price point. Its
adoption within our installed base is almost 2x the pace of Turing and more than 3x
the pace in terms of what we saw with Pascal and Pascal was a successful
architecture.
Ampere has continued to drive strong unit and ASP growth. For the ﬁrst nine months
of our ﬁscal '22, for example, both units and ASPs grew about the same across our
desktops and notebooks. Our holiday demand was also very strong, especially in
laptops as well as with the OEMs and the system builders who are working to get
RTX systems to gamers.
Over the last couple of years, though we will continue to see RTX growth to be a
more signiﬁcant portion of our installed base. We do hope that the manufacturer's
suggested retail prices can come down, as we serve more supply into the market.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Perfect. And then I've got a question from an investor. So based on some of your
competitors' other press announcements yesterday, how is the NVIDIA team thinking
about market share in GPU with both AMD and now Intel introducing new discrete
GPUs and bringing them to the markets fairly soon here?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, we're not a stranger to the competition in discrete GPUs. This has been such an
important part of our history and we will continue to work on building the best
discrete GPUs for the consumer market. That is both for gaming, that is for creators,
and it's also for the Enterprise world. Our brand stands up for a reason. It is not only
just about an important architecture on the chip, it is about a full ecosystem
surrounding our overall chip for the consumer industry. Now what we have seen is
our performance and our overall architecture outperform them and we'll continue to
work on doing that as we move forward.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-05
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 10A - Colette M. KressPerfect. Let's talk about Metaverse and Omniverse. You know there's been lots of
discussion obviously on the Metaverse or what NVIDIA terms Omniverse. This is not
a new concept, right, for the NVIDIA team. You've been helping customers in the
automotive markets, for example, enable 3D simulations, digital driving
environments and creation of digital twins in your automotive business, all hopping
and training your customers automotive AI models.
Now with Omniverse, you're creating a full-stack hardware to software to services
solutions. It enables 3D simulations, digital twins, avatar creation. And now you're
expanding this into many diﬀerent end markets, right? How should we think about
the evolution of the Metaverse or Omniverse from here, right? I would assume that
mid-term, it's focused on digital environment creation, digital twin creation for virtual
simulations and service-oriented avatars, for example, for verticals such as retail. But
wanted to get your views.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, great question. So, Omniverse and the world of Metaverse will continue to grow,
and we'll hear more and more about these opportunities as we move forward. So,
let's step back and look at the Omniverse and what it addresses. It addresses two
distinct opportunities: one, digital twins; and two, the 3D virtual world creativity that
is out there. Omniverse is powering the next era of AI. It is allowing to use all of the
key capabilities, whether that be ray tracing, whether that be AI, whether that be
really just simulating physics in the new world of Omniverse.
We have the availability of Omniverse for autonomous machines and SDCs -
Synthetic Data Generation, ability for just testing and validation. So it's not
necessarily testing and validating in the true world, but you're able to build products
and test those products in a synthetic built world on Omniverse. Omniverse also has
the ability for Omniverse Replicator, an ability to use DRIVE Sim, or for example Isaac
Sim to help also in the simulation.
Omniverse is also for human AI interaction. This is where we talk about Omniverse
Avatar for our DRIVE Concierge, but also Omniverse Avatar for Project Tokkio. These
are important things where digital twins and virtual worlds will come to life.
Omniverse Enterprise right now has about 700 companies evaluating 100,000
downloads, 70,000 now as of that November update that we provided at earnings.
But building Metaverse has already started. We're seeing content for creators, cloud
gaming infrastructures and also enterprises who are building digital twins.
Omniverse addresses 40 million designers and engineers and will produce a
subscription-based model for these designers and engineers. And this could be
something where $1,000 a year for each designer or you can go in terms of a
working group at a higher price point for them to receive the software. But the
software will have a multiplier -- a multiplier of the systems and the chips that will be
important for enabling these environments. It could be a multi-billion opportunity
over time. But as we move into ﬁscal year '23, we're going to start to see the onsets
of Omniverse from an infrastructure and the beginning of the software purchasing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-01-05
