Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Alphabet's 2019 Annual Shareholders
Meeting. I'm John Hennessy, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alphabet. And I'll
be presiding over this meeting. Each of you should have registered as you arrived. If
anyone has not registered for this meeting, please register with us before you leave.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19

Page 2 of 40Sundar PichaiEach of you should've also been presented with an agenda. On the reverse side of
the agenda is a list of rules of procedure for this meeting. Failure to abide by these
rules is grounds for removal from the meeting. We'll provide a question-and-answer
period after we have ﬁnished the formal business of the meeting.
Here with me today are fellow members of Alphabet's Board of Directors. John
Doerr, Ram Shriram. And Sundar Pichai, also the Chief Executive Oﬃcer of Google.
Our colleague, Ann Mather, is also joining the annual meeting via live stream.
We have other members of the management team here as well, including Ruth Porat,
our CFO; David Drummond, Head of Corporate Development and Chief Legal
Oﬃcer of Alphabet; Kent Walker, Head of Global Aﬀairs and Chief Legal Oﬃcer of
Google; and Eileen Naughton, Head of People Operations.
Before we move on to the formal business of the meeting, I'd like to say a few words.
And then I'll have Sundar and Ruth come up to share a few remarks. After their
remarks and the formal business of the meeting, we'll be open for questions.
I'd like to note that our remarks, presentations and answers to questions you may ask
may contain forward-looking statements about our business outlook and other
matters. Actual results or outcomes from these forward-looking statements due to a
number of risks and uncertainties are due -- inﬂuenced by a number of risks and
uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in our annual report on Form
10-K and other public ﬁlings with the SEC.
As I mentioned earlier, I have had the great privilege of serving as the Chairman of
the Board and have been a member of the Board for the past 15 years. It has been a
tremendous honor and an exciting time to work closely with Google, with Alphabet,
with Larry, with Sergey, Sundar. And the entire management team. And my fellow
directors.
We try to build technologies that every day will improve the lives of people around
the world. Of course, this also comes with a deep and growing responsibility to
ensure that the technology that we create beneﬁts society as a whole. We are
committed to supporting our users, our employees. And our shareholders by always
acting responsibly, inclusively and fairly. Our Board works closely with the
management team to ensure appropriate oversight over important areas critical to
the long-term future of Alphabet, such as diversity, sustainability and societal impact.
We are deeply committed to do the right thing on these complex issues as a Board
and as a company. And now I'd like to turn the podium over to Sundar.
{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. It's good to be here. I've been
traveling a bit lately. Last week, I was in Pryor, Oklahoma to announce an expansion
of our data center there. It was amazing to see how Google's investment over theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 40Unidentiﬁed Speakerlast decade has helped transform an entire community. I left Oklahoma feeling
inspired by our work and the impact it can have. And it all starts with our mission: to
organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
I feel fortunate to have a mission that feels as relevant today as ever before. But the
way we approach our work is constantly evolving. We are moving from a company
that helps people ﬁnd answers to a company that also helps people get things done.
We want our products to work harder for you in the context of your job, your home
and your life, from helping you write your e-mails faster with automatic suggestions
from Smart Reply, or helping you map the best route home at the end of a long day.
We want to be there in moments that matter, big and small, over the course of your
day. Simply put, our goal is to build a more helpful Google for everyone. And when
we say helpful, we mean giving you the tools to increase your knowledge, success,
health and happiness.
We feel privileged to serve billions of users every day around the world. And with
that scale comes a deep sense of responsibility to create things that improve
people's lives. By focusing on these fundamental attributes, we can empower
individuals and beneﬁt society as a whole. Of course, building a more helpful
Google for everyone always ﬁrst starts with search. Our users trust us to answer
billions of questions every single day. And there is so much more we can do to help
them ﬁnd information and even new opportunities.
One of the way we do this is through jobs in Google Search. We want to connect
companies who are looking for qualiﬁed workers, with job seekers trying to ﬁnd a
good job close to home. Since we launched jobs in Google Search, we have
connected over 100 million people around the world to new opportunities. I want to
invite Nick up to the stage to tell us more about it as well as some other ways we are
making search more helpful for our users. (Nick), come on up.
Good morning. People often turn to Google when facing important decisions in their
lives. For job seekers, this means ﬁnding the next step in their career journey. That's
why we've built a job search experience within Google Search. And we've been hard
at work improving it to make it more helpful every day.
For example, many people are interested in ﬁnding great jobs that they can do from
home. Today, via search, our users can go to the location ﬁlter, simply select work
from home and ﬁnd great jobs that they can do remotely. This feature is especially
important for certain groups such as military spouses, who often struggle with job
security due to frequent moves.
We've also launched features like salary range estimates, ﬁltering by precise location
and even a way for U.S. veterans to ﬁnd jobs matching their military experience. And
of course, we're working on bringing more tools to job seekers in the future. For
example, we're working on a new initiative called Pathways, which connects users to
job training opportunities, apprenticeships and occupation-oriented education. OurFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 40approach is to make upskilling and reskilling programs available directly on Google,
alongside important information such as salaries. So that people can make the best
decisions about their future. Pathways will launch in Virginia in just a few weeks. And
we plan to expand rapidly from there.
Another aspect of building a more helpful Google for everyone is improving how
our products work during times of crisis. We know that during emergencies, people
often turn to the products that they already know and trust, such as Search and
Maps. Through our SOS alerts, we've already helped more than 8,000 local
governments send more than 550,000 emergency alerts via our public alerts
platform.
In preparation for the 2019 hurricane and monsoon seasons, we're bringing a slate
of new features to both Search and Maps. During earthquakes, hurricanes. And some
ﬂoods, anyone near a crisis area will now receive alerts and be able to see
comprehensive visualizations right on Google Maps, such as the epicenter of an
earthquake, the forecast cone of a major hurricane. So that they have a better
understanding of the situation on the ground. And if we think your route may be
impacted by a nearby crisis, we'll do our best to safely route you out of harm's way.
Even better than reacting to a crisis is helping you prepare for it. We believe we can
help with this, too. We're starting with ﬂoods, which is one of the most common and
deadliest natural disaster types, aﬀecting more than 250 million people every year,
globally. We've developed a machine learning-based approach. This is able to
forecast a ﬂood's path and be able to alert exactly those most at risk.
For the 2019 monsoon season, we've already made these alerts available in India in
the Patna and Guwahati regions. And we will soon be expanding across the Ganges
and Brahmaputra.
These are all examples of how we're making search more helpful for our users,
surfacing the right information in the right context. But sometimes, understanding
the world around you, you need to be able to search what you see. To tell you more
about how we're doing that, I'd like to invite (Aparta) up to the stage.
Thank you, (Nick). Hi, everybody. The smartphone that we all use is one of the -- is
the most widely used computer ever in the history of mankind. And the camera on
these phones is one of the most widely used features on the phone. With advances
in AI and computer vision, we think that the camera can be a powerful tool to search
what you see. And that's the idea behind Google Lens. So today, I'm going to show
you a couple of examples of how we think that the camera can be helpful through
the day. I have (Andrew) here to help me with the demo.
Okay. So ﬁrst scenario. Imagine you're at a restaurant, that happens. And you are
trying to ﬁgure out what you want to order, right? Instead of going back from
diﬀerent apps on the phone, back to the menu and so on, now what you can do is
you can simply point the camera at the menu. And what happens here is that it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 40Unidentiﬁed Participant
Unidentiﬁed Speakerhighlighted automatically the most popular dishes at this restaurant. And what's
interesting here -- okay, now what do you want to do next? You want to know more
about, say, any particular dish. You can tap on any dish. And you get to see what it
looks like and, of course, what other people are saying about this, thanks to user
reviews from Google Maps.
We all know not every burger is made the same. So this is really handy. And what's
happening under the hood is that Lens needs to, ﬁrst, of course, read the menu.
What that means is that not just words on the paper, actually understand, this is a
menu, this has dish names and descriptions, et cetera. Second, match those dish
names to the right photos and reviews from Maps. And third, put that information
back on the menu right in front of you, in context. And so a lot happening under the
hood. But we think of this as a great handy feature.
Essentially, one way to think about this is we are trying to teach the camera to read.
And so we asked ourselves, well, what if we use the camera to help people read?
Now this is useful, of course, when many of us are in an unfamiliar place, foreign city,
don't know the language. But it's even more useful when -- if you are 1 of 800 million
adults worldwide who struggle to read everyday things. Think bus schedules, bank
forms. They're just -- there's such a barrier to access to information if you're unable
to read or you're struggling to read. So we're building a capability to help with that.
So let's take a look.
Take this sign. This is a real sign next to an ATM in a bank in India. Now you and I can
read it. But if you cannot, there is important information here that you don't have
access to. So we think the camera can help you. What can you do? You can simply,
again, point your camera at the text, at the sign. And instantly, you have a few
options. You can have it heard, read out aloud, let's try that.
Information for cardholders to all customers using old magnetic stripe cards.
You get the idea. So instantly, the sign becomes a lot more accessible to you. You
can also tap on any word there to search for it, learn its deﬁnition. So that way, even -
- especially if you have some speciﬁc words that you're struggling with, that's useful.
You can also translate it into your own language. In this case, we've done it in
Spanish. Notice how the text is overlaid right on top of the original one. It's almost
like the whole sign was rewritten in your own language to begin with. And so that
way, the whole world again becomes accessible to you.
What's energizing for us here is, of course, this is a sign that you can read. But it is
the power to read. And the power to read is the power to buy a train ticket, follow
news, shop in a store, a lot of everyday things that we all take for granted, many of us
take for granted. But this is the barrier to accessing information for many people
across the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 40Sundar PichaiSo we want to make this feature accessible to as many people as possible. So we're
launching it in Google Go. So this is our search app that we made it work on phones
that cost as little as $35. We also made it work so that it can work in many languages,
including English, Hindi, Indonesian, Portuguese, Spanish, et cetera. So those are just
a couple of examples of how the camera on your phone, combined with Google's
capabilities, computer vision, text-to-speech, translate. And of course, 20 years of
language understanding in Google Search, all come together to help you through
the day as Sundar talked about.
Thank you. And back to Sundar.
{BIO 15004624 <GO>}
Thanks, (Aparta). Search is one way we use technology to help improve the lives of
as many people as possible. Beyond search, Google Cloud gives us an opportunity
to be helpful to a diﬀerent set of users, with tools that help companies, businesses
and institutions power our global economy and drive important changes in our
society. In fact, cloud is one of the largest areas of investment for Google as a
company. Regardless of the type of business, we want to help all customers use the
most advanced technologies to drive innovation. And today, we are already working
with most of the top 10 companies across media and entertainment and retail, half of
the top 10 ﬁnancial services ﬁrms as well as many other sectors and industries.
Helping businesses realize their missions is a big part of how we realize ours. And we
are committed to being a strong technology partner for the long term. So far, we
have talked about building a more helpful Google. It's equally important to us that
we do this for everyone. For everyone is a core philosophy for Google, that's why
from the earliest days, search works the same, whether you're a professor at Stanford
or a student in rural Indonesia. It's why we build aﬀordable laptops for classrooms
everywhere. And it's why we care about the experience on low-cost phones in
countries where users are just starting to come online with the same passion as we
do with premium phones.
An important way we build for everyone is by ensuring that our products are safe
and private. We strongly believe that privacy and security are for everyone, not just a
few. This is why, from our earliest days, powerful privacy features have been built into
our products and services. Our goal has always been to provide users with clear,
meaningful choices around their data. And your Google account is a single place to
review and adjust all your privacy controls.
Last month at I/O, we shared a few ways we are making those controls even easier to
access. For example, making your Google account just one tap away in all our major
products. And order delete controls, which make it easier to manage your data in a
way that works best for you. Privacy and security are the foundation for all that we do.
And our work is never done. And we'll continue pushing the boundaries here to do
more for our users with less data over time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 40Ruth PoratBuilding for everyone also means that everyone can access and enjoy our products,
including the 1 billion people around the world living with a disability. We believe
technology can help us be more inclusive. And advances in AI are providing us with
new tools to dramatically improve experiences for people with disabilities. We have
seen the impact of those advances in products like Live Transcribe. It uses speech
recognition to caption conversations in real time. You can leave your phone open
with the app and when someone speaks you, it transcribes their speech into text.
And recently, we shared how we are expanding this technology further. Live Caption
uses on-device speech recognition to generate captions for web video, a podcast or
even a moment you capture at home. This feature makes all content, no matter its
origin, more accessible to everyone. And it has the potential to improve so many
lives, especially for the 500 million people who are deaf or hard of hearing
worldwide.
I want to close on a video that shares the impact of this -- impact this is having on
some of our early users. Then I will invite Ruth Porat, our CFO, to the stage to share
more about how we are investing for the long term. Let's roll the video.
(presentation)
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Good morning. So I'm going to spend a few minutes focusing on how we continue
to invest to support our growth. And I'll also share some investment highlights
consistent with our commitment to social responsibility and sustainability.
So we have 3 guiding principles as we develop our investment plan. First is to
ensure that we continue to invest for the long term, to make the right decisions to
support long-term growth. Second is we're really focused on continuing to optimize
resources. We have a really keen lens on the trade-oﬀs that we need to make to
ensure that we're being really eﬀective in the way we invest all of our resources. And
third, we focus on operational excellence. We want to have operational excellence in
everything we do, making the necessary investments to ensure the best experiences
for our users, our partners and advertisers.
Our focus on the long term has enabled us to deliver the revenue growth that you
see here. In 2018, we ended with revenues of almost $137 billion and operating
income reaching $27.5 billion in 2018. And as we look forward, we're really optimistic
about the opportunities ahead. And we're making the necessary investments in both
data centers and oﬃces to support our continued growth.
Now as Sundar previously announced, in the United States alone, we're investing $13
billion this year. And just last week, we announced further data center expansion in
Oklahoma and Texas. We're also investing meaningfully outside the United States,
including our recent announcements that we will spend more than EUR 1.2 billion to
expand our data centers in Belgium and in Finland.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 40And as we continue to grow our business, we're really focused on remaining a
leader in sustainability. And we're proud of our key metrics. Google has been carbon
neutral since 2007. We're the largest purchaser of renewable energy. And in 2017
and in 2018, we matched 100% of our energy consumption with renewable energy.
We're the ﬁrst company to reach that important milestone.
In part, we achieved this by making sure that our data centers are run as eﬃciently as
possible. Compared with ﬁve years ago, we now deliver around 7x as much
computing power with the same amount of electrical power. We're also increasingly
using machine learning to further improve data center eﬃciency. And we then take
those insights and eﬃciency opportunities. And apply them. And leverage them,
oﬀer them to our Cloud customers.
And we're also very focused on sustainability in our products. And we're engaged in
collaborative work with many to build tools to reduce the impacts of climate change,
the global environmental impact.
Now an additional element of our commitment to social responsibility is the way
we're investing in the communities in which we operate. And as an example, just
yesterday, hopefully you saw, we announced $1 billion investment in housing right
here in the Bay Area. And that's going to lead to the development of 20,000 new
homes at all income levels. What this includes is repurposing $750 million of
Google's land for residential housing, a $250 million fund to support developers
building new homes. And a $50 million Google.org grant to support nonproﬁts that
are tackling the housing crisis in the Bay Area.
Now another element to social responsibility is our commitment to digital skills
training. And here, we're focused on helping individuals and small businesses
around the world best position themselves for the changing needs in the economy.
And under our program, which we call Grow with Google, we oﬀer free digital skills
training and tools to help people ﬁnd jobs and help them grow their businesses,
build their businesses. Just last week, I was in Detroit to kick oﬀ a Grow with Google
event. And this is one of many that is being held around the globe. We've already
trained 43 million people in digital skills globally. And we expect that number will
rise to more than 60 million by 2022.
So these are just a few of the highlights of our eﬀorts to promote long-term growth.
And that is growth that is sustainable and responsible. And as Sundar said, core to
our mission is building products for everyone, as he went through. So -- and
business anywhere in the world can have the same access as a developer right here
in the Bay Area.
Now as the CFO, I love numbers. So I'm going to end with one more data point. In
2018, our search and advertising tools helped create $335 billion in economic
activity for millions of businesses, websites, publishers and nonproﬁts. And that's in
the U.S. alone. We're really proud of the economic impact from our products and
services. So I love the statistic.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19

of Directors has unanimously recommended that our stockholders vote against all
stockholder proposals that will be presented.
In the interest of time and to allow our stockholder proponents suﬃcient time to
speak on behalf of the proposals, we will not be presenting the company's position
on the proposals here today. Please refer to our proxy statement for our responses
to these stockholder proposals.
The ﬁrst stockholder proposal is brought by The NorthStar Asset Management

{BIO 18778582 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Christine Jantz from the NorthStar Asset Management in
Boston, the beneﬁcial owner of 8,508 shares of Alphabet Class A stock.
Fellow shareholders, I am here to represent Resolution #4, a request that our Board
take all practicable steps to initiate and adopt a recapitalization plan for all
outstanding stock to have one vote per share. When shareholders of common stock
do not have an equal right to weigh in on signiﬁcant matters of corporate policy, we
lose our right to oversee management through Board elections, enabling the CEO
and insiders to appoint a Board that only serves the CEO and management, not
shareholders.
We think that the growing number of shareholder proposals is indicative of a
corporate governance problem, which needs to be addressed through providing
one vote per share so that there will be appropriate shareholder oversight.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 40Kathryn W. Hall
Max KapczynskiWhen Alphabet went public, the shareholders already lacked the opportunity to give
substantive input into company policies. Alphabet's voting structure is heavily
weighed to favor insiders given that Class B shares are granted 10x the voting rights
of Class A shares. Shareholder rights were further weakened when Class B insiders
voted in a brand-new class of stock with 0 voting rights. The fact that new share
structure was approved is particularly remarkable, because our calculations show
that only 15% of Class A outside shares that voted to approve, establishing Class C
nonvoting stock.
How is this possible? Well this measure passed because Mr. Brin and Mr. Page
supported it, insiders who control over 50% of the voting power, while owning far
less an economic stake. While shareholders might accept this lack of input when
proﬁts are up, this voting structure constitutes a considerable risk to governance and
shareholder value. All we need to do is to look to Facebook headquarters to see
what might happen when shareholders are unable to provide any meaningful
feedback.
Facebook's past two years of data scandals, election interference allegations, privacy
concerns stemming from irregularities in companies' platforms can be laid at the feet
of its founder and controlling shareholder, Mark Zuckerberg. We're very concerned
about the governance risks that come from relying upon merely 2 or 3 people's
vision and their ability to reduce threats to the company long term without broad
input. The founders of this company brought this company to fruition, led it to
proﬁtability. But the company's decision to oﬀer common shares of the company in
public exchanges, making Alphabet a public company, brings with it a responsibility
to shareholders to practice good governance. Shareholders, we urge you to vote for
proxy item #4.
{BIO 2353425 <GO>}
Thank you for presenting this proposal. The next stockholder proposal is being
brought by the Comptroller of the City of New York, Scott M. Stringer, as the
custodian and a trustee of the New York City Employees' Retirement System, the
New York City Teachers Retirement System and the New York City Police Pension
Fund. And custodian of the New York City Board of Education Retirement System.

Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the Board. And fellow Alphabet
shareowners. Before I get started, I'd like to spend a little time sharing my story and
why I'm here. My name is Max Kapczynski. And I'm a full-time employee at Verily.
Last fall, 20,000 of us, employees and TVCs at Google and Other Bets, walked oﬀ
our jobs. And I walked with them. Our ﬁrst demand was to remove forced arbitrationFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 12 of 40Kathryn W. Hallfrom our employment contracts. After months of continued pressure from my fellow
workers, you did remove forced arbitration for Google's own full-time employees.
But you did not extend this legal right and protection to me, my coworkers at Verily,
or the many contractors at Alphabet.
Why not? Are we worth less than other engineers at this company? Do we not all
deserve these same rights and freedoms? Coming here today wasn't easy. As an at-
will employee, I can be let go at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all. But I
came here today because I believe in an equitable Alphabet for employees and
contractors, for Google and for Other Bets, for people of all backgrounds. I am here
today to add my voice to the growing number of workers, community members and
shareholders that are demanding that Google do better.
To that end, I'm here to present proposal 5 on behalf of New York City Comptroller,
Scott Stringer. And 4 of New York City's 5 retirement systems, which are substantial
long-term Alphabet shareowners, with roughly 560,000 Class A shares valued at
roughly $643 million and an equivalent investment in Class C shares. Proposal 5 calls
on the Board to adopt a policy that Alphabet will not engage in any inequitable
employment practices. This includes forced arbitration of employment claims, non-
compete agreements. And involuntary nondisclosure agreements in harassment or
discrimination claims.
We all know what it means to work under these policies. And I've seen what it does
to my coworkers to not just fear harassment. But to also watch harassers walk free
with a huge payout. We believe these practices are not only inequitable. But
incompatible with creating a sustainable long-term value for the company. The New
York City Retirement Systems' view on human capital aligns with that of the UK
Corporate Governance Code, which regulates U.K. companies. This code states that
the Board should ensure that workforce policies and practices are consistent with the
company's values and support its long-term sustainable success. This includes the
complex contract relations with all individuals working for Alphabet.
Consistent with the spirit of the code, The New York City Retirement Systems
encourage that the Alphabet Board consider how the company's actions impact all
the individuals who are paid to work for the company and whose work is
fundamental to the creation of long-term value for Alphabet and its shareowners.
Comptroller Stringer's oﬃce stands ready to work with the Board to develop and
implement a mutually agreeable strategy to prohibit inequitable employment
policies. Until then. And on behalf of the New York City Comptroller and Retirement
Systems, I urge shareowners to vote for proposal 5. Thank you.

My name is Andy Mims. And I am the lead proponent of proxy item 6. I'm a partner
at the sustainability group of Loring, Wolcott & Coolidge, a Boston-based investment
ﬁrm that traces its history back nearly 200 years.
We're long-term shareholders of Class A shares. And consider it a core holding of
the ﬁrm. As such, I would expect that our interests are well aligned with those of
management and the Board. In that spirit of aligned interest, we have requested
meaningful dialogue with the company on several issues for years, requests that
have largely been ignored by the company. And in that same spirit, we have ﬁled
proxy item 6.
Proxy item 6 asks the company to create a societal risk oversight committee of the
Board, composed of independent directors. And suggests that the Board formally
draw on the expertise of individuals who have speciﬁc relevant professional and/or
academic expertise. The company has repeatedly acknowledged the materiality of
this broad topic and should be commended for the steps they have taken to date.
But unfortunately, those steps are not adequate.
Further, recent controversies around AI, data breaches and the abuse of certain
Alphabet platforms strongly suggest that the company has neither an appropriate
holistic oversight structure, nor an independent review process in place to anticipate
and address the societal impacts of business decisions, products and services or the
ethical questions that they raise.
We are proud of the countless ways that the company has positively impacted our
world, some of which were showcased just minutes ago. We respect the broad
nature of this topic, of business ethics. And do not anticipate the formation of a
societal risk oversight committee leading to the elimination of complex ethical
quandaries. However, to remain successful, Alphabet must be considered
trustworthy. Adopting such a committee or its equivalent would allow important
stakeholders, including shareholders and the company's very own employees, to
retain, or in some cases, regain that trust by demonstrating that genuine eﬀorts are
being made to address potential blind spots and to meet expectations for
transparency around managing related issues.
In closing, I'd like to state that these comments are not just an appeal to fellow Class
A shareholders. But also an appeal to Class B shareholders, who, as proposal 4
astutely points out, control the company. And while the 2 controlling shareholders
have avoided this meeting. And therefore, the chance to address concerned
stakeholders, it's my hope that they still value the long-term importance of aligned
interests.

My name is Christine Chow from Hermes. I represent asset owner and asset
managers, who have, together, $5.7 billion invested in Alphabet.
I'm actually disappointed that Larry and Sergey are not here. But I would still like to
acknowledge that Alphabet has made notable eﬀorts to improve the responsible use
of technology. However, we believe it has a great opportunity to go further to set
industry standards. Active employee movements are helping the company to
address issues such as sexual harassment, gender inequality and workplace
practices. The ethical consciousness should be considered a real asset. If a company
can channel this positive energy appropriately, it can set the trajectory for the next
phase of development.
Today, I'm speaking in favor of stockholder proposal 6. In our view, there's a gap in
the necessary skills in the Board to provide the required oversight. We ask the Board
to consider director candidates with experience in statistical analysis to ensure that
the probabilistic nature of AI system is adequately explained; social sciences, to
enable the social impact of technology to be properly considered; and
neuroscience, as the functioning of neural network system is somewhat diﬀerent
from the operation of the brain, still.

is an important part of societal risk oversight. Thank you very much.

I can't ﬁgure out why the company opposes this proposal on sexual harassment after
pledging to do all it can about sexual harassment. Well maybe it's because there is
not one ounce of sincerity in any of the reasons Alphabet cites. The real reason isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 15 of 40Kathryn W. Hall
Peter Flahertythat this company. And most of the rest of corporate America, is not governed by
what is in the interest of shareholders or even society as a whole. Instead, it's
governed by what the left-wing mob demands.
Alphabet will only support initiatives that advance an agenda. I guess combating
sexual harassment in the workplace is desirable, only if it helps build a political
movement and reinforces identity politics. It doesn't really matter what happens to
women. In my supporting statement, I argue that more ideological and political
diversity would create a more respectful workplace. I guess that was the poison pill
that doomed my resolution. You would think the people that run this country. So rich
and supposedly so powerful, could stand up to the mob. But they don't.
Witness what happened to Kay Coles James, the President of the Heritage
Foundation. She was invited to serve on something called the Advanced Technology
External Advisory Council. And then disinvited when a mob showed up with torches
and rope. In fact, the people sitting up here were so freaked out that they abolished
the council altogether.
Who was Kay Coles James? She is African-American. When she was 12, she endured
jeers and insults as she was one of the ﬁrst black children to attend an all-white
middle school in Richmond, Virginia. And she rose to the top of America's most
inﬂuential conservative institution. How did that happen? Well maybe it's because
Kay is a very special person. And who did her in? 2,500 Google employees. And
who are they? Well they went to the best schools, many were so smart that other
people paid their tuition. They make a multiple of the money made by anyone who
is paid by the hour or does physical labor. Talk about privilege.
What was Kay James' sin? Among other apostasies, she opposes the misnamed
equality act, reﬂecting the views of Heritage's 500,000 members and millions of
other Americans. Heritage was founded to promote a particular point of view.
Google was not. It was founded to make money by cataloging the world's
information. To do that, it has to be trusted by consumers. To be trusted, shouldn't
the company be carefully neutral on controversial public policy issues? Why does
Alphabet itself have a position on this so-called equality act? Why does it lobby it --
for it, even though it has nothing to do with its core business? This legislation would
essentially abolish gender before the law. Without gender, there's no feminism.
There's no Title IX, meaning the end of women's sports.

Proposal 8, elect directors by majority votes, sponsored by James McRitchie and
Myra K. Young of Elk Grove, California. Shareholders request that the Board of
Directors amend our company's articles of incorporation and our bylaws to provide
that director nominees shall be elected by the aﬃrmative vote of the majority of
votes cast at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This proposal includes a director
who receives less than such a majority vote be removed from the Board immediately
or as soon as a replacement director can be qualiﬁed on an expedited basis.
To provide shareholders a meaningful role in director elections, our company's
current director elections standard should be changed from a plurality vote standard
to a majority vote standard when only Board-nominated candidates are on the
ballot. This will establish a more meaningful vote standard for Board nominees and
could lead to improved company performance.
Under our company's current voting system, a director can be elected if all
shareholders oppose the director. But one shareholder votes for even if by mistake.
More than 89% of the companies in Standard & Poor's 500 have adopted majority
voting for uncontested elections, 84% of Netﬂix shareholders voted for a similar
proposal in 2018. BlackRock's voted -- proxy voting guidelines include the following,
"Majority voting standards assist in ensuring that directors who are not broadly
supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives."
It is all the more important to adopt this one corporate governance reform since
Alphabet operates essentially as a dictatorship. Under our company's multi-class
voting structure, each share of Class A common stock is one vote. Meanwhile, each
share of insider Class B common stock has 10 votes. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin control
over 51% of voting power, while owning less than 13% of Alphabet's stock.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19

by written consent or proxy access to nominate directors. Additionally, a super
majority vote is now required to amend certain bylaws.

Hello, everyone. My name is Sky Kelley. And today, I'm representing TIME'S UP to
move proposal #9 on behalf of the ﬁlers, Arjuna Capital and Proxy Impact, asking for
a report on the global median gender and racial pay gap.
By way of introduction, I started a company called Avisare, which is a procurement
platform that drives inclusivity and innovation by helping big companies and
governments hire small and diverse businesses.
I can tell you ﬁrsthand that being a woman in tech is hard. And being a woman of
color in tech, harder. Our struggle is only made worse when companies like Google
refuse to release data about both equal pay and equal opportunity, also known as
the median pay gap. The median pay gap for women working full-time in the U.S. is
20 points. In other words, women make $0.80 on the dollar versus men. But when
you intersect race and gender, the diﬀerence is even more profound.
Black women make $0.60 on the dollar. And Latinas only $0.55. But what's the cost
of this? What does this mean? The cost is $0.5 million over the course of a career.
$0.5 million. That's owning a home, that's sending our kids to college, that's being
able to retire and to retire with stability. This is the fourth year this proposal has gone
to a vote. And while we commend Google for taking a ﬁrst step last year when it
published statistically-adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers, we request more.
Because those numbers only tell half the story.
It's time that you do for your company worldwide what you are already obligated to
do in the United Kingdom: Release the data about median pay for women andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19

out of the global reckoning sparked by the abuse of women by powerful men across

But I don't need to tell you who TIME'S UP is. You feel our inﬂuence even today, as
your employees continue to protest harassment and discrimination at Google,
including pay inequities that even the U.S. Department of Labor has called extreme
and systemic.

Emma BayesWe believe that Alphabet has grown to a size and complexity that is unmanageable,
as evidenced by numerous failures of oversight in management. It is to the
advantage of shareholders to be proactive in determining the company's next steps
rather than waiting for antitrust regulators to set a path.
I come from a country where people are imprisoned for using search terms that the
Chinese government doesn't like and considers sensitive. These human rights
violations are real. And Google must not be complicit. Front-line communities don't
have the luxury of waiting for all your hypotheticals to turn into real risks for us. You
have violated the trust that your customers placed in you. And that is bad for
shareholder value.
Google's willingness to collude with the Government of China sets an extremely
dangerous precedent for Internet freedom around the world. Alphabet has been
extremely slow to restrict the spread of hateful and extremist content on its
platforms. It's time Alphabet accepts responsibility for the part it's played here and
take steps to make the company more manageable and its management more
accountable.
Over 86,000 SumOfUs members have signed a petition asking Google to cancel
Project Dragonﬂy, including 1,401 Alphabet shareholders and 96 workers. The
reputational risks is real. In addition, over 1,300 SumOfUs members wrote to their
pension funds, asking them to support this proposal.

ways. But I ask that you remember, above all, your vote impacts human beings. Vote

On behalf of the CtW Investment Group, I hereby move proposal 11, requesting the
inclusion of a nonexecutive employee representative in the Board's slate of director
candidates.
An employee director will help restore employee conﬁdence in Alphabet's
leadership, an imperative given its heavy reliance on intellectual capital and the
extraordinary competition for talent in the industry. Alphabet has repeatedly stated
that employees are its most valuable asset. But it's currently embroiled in a cultural
crisis stemming from its ethical conduct and treatment of employees, placing thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 20 of 40Kathryn W. Hallcritical asset in jeopardy. Employee conﬁdence in management decreased 18% last
year. Much of this decrease stems from failures in communication between senior
leadership and employees. Employees increasingly feel that they have no voice and
are concerned that the employee is no longer being steered by its "Don't be evil"
ethos.
Last year, 4,000 employees signed a petition demanding that the company promise
to cease building warfare technology. 20,000 employees walked out in protest of
the company's handling of sexual harassment allegations. Google's censored search
engine, Project Dragonﬂy, resulted in substantial employee demonstrations. Each of
these controversies prompted resignations and protest.
Appointing an employee representative would help the company be proactive and
ensuring it has employee buy-in for controversial decisions, hopefully preventing
these embarrassing mistakes and the loss of valuable talent.
Alphabet's Board exhibits hallmarks of entrenchment and of a permissive tone at the
top. Of the 10 members of the Board, only 3 are not either current or former
executives or highly-tenured directors. The Board has also failed to foster ethical
management and has displayed a pattern of rewarding poor behavior by executives.
The Board approved over $100 million in payout to senior executives after
accusations of sexual misconduct were deemed credible by the company's own
internal investigations.
David Drummond was promoted to Alphabet's Chief Legal Oﬃcer despite the fact
that he himself conducted a sexual relationship with a subordinate. An employee
director would help counterbalance this executive-heavy Board. Nonexecutive
employees can provide guidance independent of management and have been
found by the SEC to be considered independent for the purposes of Audit
Committee membership under Sarbanes-Oxley.
Adding a nonexecutive employee director will add an on-the-ground perspective
critical to mitigating the ongoing risk to the workplace, brand and corporate culture.
Today, Alphabet sits at an inﬂection point, facing widespread reputational and
regulatory risk due to rising antitrust, data privacy and propaganda concerns. It
cannot aﬀord to ignore the storm brewing in its most valuable asset, its employees.
Therefore, we urge you to support proposal 11.

Proposal 12, simple majority vote, sponsored by John Chevedden of Redondo
Beach, California.
Shareholders request that the Board of Directors take the steps necessary so that
each voting requirement in the charter and bylaws that calls for a greater than simple
majority vote be replaced by a requirement for a majority vote -- the votes cast for
and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority.
Shareowners are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have
excellent corporate governance. Supermajority voting requirements have been
found to be 1 of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company
performance according to What Matters in Corporate Governance? by Lucian
Bebchuk of the Harvard Law School.
Supermajority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most
shareowners. But opposed by a status quo management. This proposal topic won
from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, (Alcoa) Waste Management, Goldman
Sachs, FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill. And Macy's. These votes of 74% to 88% would have
been higher if more shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice.
Currently, a 1% minority can frustrate the will of our 66% shareholder majority.
In other words, a 1% minority could have the power to prevent shareholders from
improving management accountability. Currently, the role of Alphabet shareholders
is diminished because management can ignore a 66% vote of shareholders on
certain issues. This proposal is especially important for Alphabet shareholders
because management had it rigged in so many ways that shareholders have hardly a
voice in the fate of Alphabet.
The voice of regular shareholders is diminished because certain insider shares have
10x as many votes as -- per share as regular shares. Plus, we have no right to act by
written consent. Our Board was stacked with insider directors, including our
Chairman. And directors who have 14 to 20 years' long tenure. Insider status and
long tenure result in a lack of director independence at the expense of regular
shareholders. Independence is a priceless attribute in a director.
Clearly, there is shareholder dissatisfaction. Three directors received up to 20x as
many negative votes as some of their peers on the Alphabet Board in 2018. And
these 3 directors received such high negative votes even though they probably
received 100% support from the insider shareholders who have 10x as many votes
per share as regular shares.
Please vote yes, simple majority vote, proposal 12.

My name is Irene Knapp. And I am an engineer at Google. On behalf of Zevin Asset
Management and concerned employees of Alphabet and its subsidiaries, I hereby
move proposal #13.
Last year, I spoke to you about long-term human capital risks. Since then, nearly all of
the people I admired as thought leaders have left the company. In their resignation
letters, many of them cited the company's betrayal of its stated values. The human
capital risks are not theoretical or long term. They are already here. We continue to
believe that linking senior executive compensation to inclusion, sustainability. And
community impact metrics will further Alphabet's values. These are also key
components of business sustainability and success.
McKinsey & Company research shows that companies in the top quartile for gender
and racial diversity are more likely to see above-average ﬁnancial returns.
Furthermore, Alphabet's failure to substantially improve diversity and inclusion is
directly linked to its ongoing ethical crisis. A recent report by the AI Now Institute
concluded that bias in artiﬁcial intelligence is closely intertwined with the diversity
crisis in the industry.
Alphabet workers from marginalized backgrounds are ﬁghting not only for what is
right. But for the survival of ourselves, our friends and our families. The world today
faces a crisis largely created by the indiscriminate application of technology. The
impact that Alphabet has on society cannot be overstated. And those of us who both
understand the problems and are in a position to do something about them have an
obligation to step up. This is why I'm speaking to you today and why my colleagues
and I will continue to ﬁght.
Proposal 13 calls on Alphabet to consider tying senior executive's compensation to
performance on key sustainability metrics. These include racial and gender diversity
within its leadership and operations; labor practices within Alphabet's largely
minority subcontracted workforce; and the impact of the company's burgeoning real
estate development on gentriﬁcation, displacement and homelessness. It is our
belief, as engineers, as investors and as technical professionals, that a lack of
transparency and accountability fundamentally hurts the quality of products
Alphabet can deliver.
With the advent of modern machine learning, our industry stands at a crossroads. To
be a leader in this area, Alphabet must credibly integrate diversity and sustainability

My name is Tyler Holsclaw. I work at Google. And today, I'm representing a coalition
concerned about the impact of government censorship and surveillance on human
rights. And our company's stance on this issue.
On behalf of Azzad Asset Management and 8 co-ﬁlers, I hereby move proposal #14,
which asks Alphabet to publish a human rights impact assessment, examining the
potential impacts of a Google Search product in China. As we debate the ethical
obligations of a massively inﬂuential company like Alphabet, we must remember that
Dragonﬂy is not just a product. We have to consider it in the context of the
environment in which it would be placed. China already engages in invasive cyber-
surveillance and uses the data to crush dissent, destroy cultural and religious
identities. And torture and imprison its citizens.
Google's powerful technology could give China data that it wouldn't otherwise get.
We must think about what it means to partner with such a government. This further
endangers the human rights of more than 1 billion people and can set a dangerous
precedent for the entire world. 60 human rights organizations and 1,400 Google
employees have urged our company to cancel Dragonﬂy.
As a reminder of the personal impact of government surveillance and the control
that Dragonﬂy could further enable, I'd like to read a statement by one of my fellow
Google employees.
"I'm a Googler who grew up in China. And I am afraid. This past year, I watched my

My name is David Huerta, President of SEIU United Service Workers West. Our
organization has been at the forefront of combating sexual assault and harassment
of janitors in the commercial real estate and high-tech industry. It is unfortunate that I
cannot say the same when it comes to Alphabet's commitment to its own
employees.
Sexual harassment is a major problem in workplaces across the country. The Me Too
Movement has shed light on the impact it has on working women every day. It also
poses signiﬁcant risk for investors. This is why Alphabet should adopt an executive
compensation clawback policy in the wake of the ﬁnancial and reputational damages
the company suﬀered last year due to its handling of sexual misconduct allegations.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19

Kathryn W. HallLast November's walk out of 20,000 Alphabet employees and contract employees,
by one estimate, accounted for more than 20% of Alphabet's global workforce.
Alphabet is also facing multiple shareholder lawsuits relating to the sexual
misconduct allegations, with one of the plaintiﬀ's attorneys arguing that the fallout
from this scandal cost Alphabet billions of dollars in share value.
The SEIU Pension Plan Master Trust proposal ask you to follow your peers and take
responsibility to deter misconduct by executives seriously. 97% of largely publicly-
traded companies surveyed about their compensation packages have adopted
some form of clawback policy. Many companies have the same policy that this
proposal calls for.
For example, 29% of the companies, including Verizon, Wells Fargo. And Equifax,
include ethical misconduct without requirement of ﬁnancial restatement as a
clawback trigger. Given the sexual misconduct issues you have faced, there is no
excuse for Alphabet to lag its peers. The Board needs to take action and adopt this
strong clawback policy to protect Alphabet's workforce and its investors.
{BIO 2353425 <GO>}
You have about 1 minute 20 seconds left.
Okay. We believe that Alphabet would beneﬁt from a misconduct clawback policy
like the one we propose. Clawback provisions can serve as deterrents and contribute
to a tone at the top, emphasizing ethical behavior.
Google, Alphabet's wholly-owned subsidiary, has recently come under ﬁre for
paying male executives ﬁred after being accused of sexual harassment, millions in
severance packages and for continuing to employ some executives despite
harassment complaints. These revelations of course spurred the protest by Google
employees who connected Google's treatment of harassment complaint -- claims
with broader concerns over sexism at Google.
We urge shareholders to vote for this proposal. Thank you.

{BIO 14001405 <GO>}
Mr. Chairman, fellow shareholders, my name is Patrick Doherty. And I'm here today
on behalf of the New York State Common Retirement Fund to introduce our fund's
proposal, calling on Alphabet to issue a report to shareholders reviewing the eﬃcacy
of its enforcement of its terms of service related to content policies and assessing
the risks posed by content governance controversies, including hate speech and
sexual harassment, to the company's ﬁnances, operations and reputation.
A leading proxy advisory ﬁrm, Glass Lewis, recently recommended support for this
resolution, citing the serious risks these controversies pose to the company.
They said. And I quote, "Although the company has proposed some disclosure --
provided some disclosure and taken some action with respect to the issues raised by
the proponent, we believe that support for this proposal would provide disclosure of
an important area that we do not believe is being properly addressed by the
company, namely, its assessments of its ﬁnancial and reputational risks on account of
the recent content management controversies.
Given the recent warnings from regulators and legislative attempts at exposing
Internet platforms to more liability on account of their -- of the content of their
websites, we believe that shareholders would be served by additional disclosures of
how the company is managing these issues."
In New York, we agree with this assessment. And therefore, on behalf of The New
York State Common Retirement Fund, holders of more than $1 billion worth of
Alphabet stock, I submit the proposal on content management found in your proxy
materials. Thank you.
{BIO 2353425 <GO>}
Thank you. In addition to the 16 items of business described in our proxy statement,
(Joel M. Miller) has provided notice of his intent to present a proposal today
regarding Alphabet's compliance with sanctions programs administered by the
United States Oﬃce of Foreign Assets Control. (Joel Miller) will be presenting this
proposal.
You'll have a total of 3 minutes to make a statement about this proposal. I'll advise
you when your time is about to expire.
My proposal concerns Alphabet's activities related to entities sanctioned by the U.S.
Treasury's Oﬃce of Foreign Assets Control, the OFAC. A request that the companyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 27 of 40Kathryn W. Hallestablish a sanctions compliance program, an SCP, as recommended by the OFAC to
identify and close accounts held by sanctioned entities.
This proposal does not concern limiting any particular services, removing any type of
content, enforcing general community standards or the like. It's about closing the
accounts of listed entities. The present proposal would supplement existing content-
based screening without requiring the company to judge the value or the meaning
of particular content to infer its long-term intent.
The OFAC administers and enforces economic sanctions, prohibiting transfer of
technology and services including Internet communications to or from sanctioned
entities. It maintains a list of sanctioned entities, including money launderers,
narcotics traﬃckers, supporters of terrorism. And others deemed a threat to national
security, many of whom would not trigger content-based removal.
The OFAC describes the elements of a credible sanctions compliance program with
respect to these speciﬁc entities. These elements include management commitment
to risk assessment, auditing, training and the like. Of course, there's a moral
dimension, which deeply disturbs many of our customers. Through its proxy,
Hezbollah, the Islamic Republic of Iran, for instance, murdered 241 American service
persons in their Beirut barracks. The company should move decisively to ensure it
does not provide communications and public relations platforms to sanctioned
entities with American blood on their hands.
Islamic Republic of Iran broadcasting, IRIB, a sanctioned entity, which owns Iran's
press TV, maintains several YouTube channels. The proposed approach would deny
IRIB and its subsidiaries all access to company services. Similarly, all services would
be denied to the government of Iran and yet be targeted more narrowly than denial
by country, thereby serving the desirable aim of facilitating Internet communications
by and with the people of Iran.
Individuals and entities that knowingly violate federal sanctions may face criminal
prosecution by the Department of Justice, with ﬁnes up to $1 million and
imprisonment up to 20 years per violation.
Absent an eﬀective sanctions compliance program, a violation may be deemed what
they call egregious. Establishing an eﬀective OFAC list-based sanctions compliance
program is a simple and eﬀective way for the company to honor its moral and legal
obligations, protecting itself and its oﬃcers from civil and criminal penalties and
from reputational damage consequent to violation of federal law. Thank you for
considering this proposal. If you're inclined to vote on it, the form looks like this.

Questions And Answers
(inaudible) project. Why is this world company so afraid of viewpoint diversity? When
I ﬁled the shareholder proposal asking the company to consider the idea of
expanding viewpoint diversity on the Board, the company scoﬀed. In April, Google
ended its AI Advisory Board before it even got oﬀ the ground because a few closed-
minded Googlers objected to the inclusion of Heritage Foundation President, Kay
Coles James, on the project. This outraged mob called James so many words that
I'm not going to say in this public forum.
Regarding her experience with Google, James wrote this, "In 1961, at age 12, I was
one of 2 dozen black children who integrated an all-white junior high in Richmond.
White parents jeered at me outside the school. And inside, their kids stuck me with
pins, shoved me in the halls and pushed me down the stairs. So when a group of
Google employees resorted to calling names and making false accusations because
they didn't want a conservative voice advising the company, the hostility is
reminiscent of what I felt back then, that same intolerance for someone who is
diﬀerent from them."
Shame on Google and every single person involved in ending the AI Board and
giving into this mob. The company's intolerance is staggering. From working with a
racist, bigoted and discredited Southern Poverty Law Center...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19

our information is open and reliable very seriously. And we work extensively with lots
of diﬀerent groups across the political spectrum in the United States and around the

Hi. I've been to many shareholder meetings over the years. And I was wondering
where the CEO is of Alphabet. When I come here and I don't see the CEO, maybe
one year, he's sick or something comes up. But year-after-year, there's no CEO here.
It's a glaring omission, especially someone who has such a large stake in the
company, that we can't address him directly once a year. I think that's disgraceful.

My question is in term of autonomous driving, what's your vision there? When do
you think it will be accessible to the general public? And do you think the barriers of
entry are in the U.S. market lower maybe in terms of regulation than in Europe or
maybe even in China? Thank you very much.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So in terms of autonomous driving in our business, Waymo, what really motivates our
team is the opportunity to save lives, over 1.2 million lives lost every year on the road.
That's the equivalent of a 737 airplane going down every day of the week -- every
hour of every day of the week. And so we're working really hard on it. We have a
pilot program going on in Phoenix. We're continuing to enlarge the number of riders
and the land traveled. We're also exploring a host of other things with our self-
driving car program like logistics and licensing the technology. Regulation is one of
the gating factors. We're continuing to work with quite a number of places that are
excited about the opportunity to have self-driving cars because of the opportunity to
help make -- to save lives. We do look at this as very early days and something that is
a much longer-term evolution. And we see opportunities globally for that. So it's
early days. But appreciate your question because we do think it's such an important
area.
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
Let's come to the left.
My name is (Marie). I'm a Googler of 6.5 years. And I have a question, a follow-up
about the worker representative on the Board proposal. Like many others, when I
joined the company, I was ﬁlled with excitement and enthusiasm and curiosity, in
large part because of the exciting things that I thought a company as large as
Google could do in the world, the good it could do. And I've seen so much good
happen since I've been here. But what really stuck out to me recently is the shift
when we are challenged, the shift when we realize that something we are doing is
not actually helping or it's having an unintended consequence. And as the years
passed, I've seen executives start to feign powerlessness when faced with these
challenges as if we aren't a company of the size of the economy of a certain -- of
other countries. And it's become clear that there's a disconnect.
People at the top do not understand the reality that workers and users are living in
and their own responsibility in that reality. We're told we can't simply choose to treat
workers with respect and end this artiﬁcial caste system of TVCs and FTEs because
that would violate U.S. co-employment law. We're told that we can't take dramatic
action to halt climate change because we need to sell tools that allow the fossil fuel
industry to extract fuels more eﬃciently so we can meet quarterly sales. But when weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantrespond this way, it's disingenuous. It's not that we, Google, are powerless to behave
diﬀerently. It's that we're choosing to use our immense power to solve the wrong
problems. And we can do better.
So my question is this. You've hired a global workforce of 200,000-plus people with
the diversity of experiences and knowledge to collectively understand the scale of
the challenges this company and the planet face right now. We see these problems
because we live them. And we know what needs to be done to build a better
company that serves the world in that process. And as you can see, we have the
energy and motivation to do it. We're already organizing with or without you. If I'm
no longer employed here in a year, 5 others will be here to ﬁll the spot. So what
more will it take for you to decide to accept our experience and our oﬀering to help
and start ﬁxing these problems together with us by putting a worker representative
on the Board?
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
Let me just say on behalf of the Board, we are constantly looking for new Board
members to create a Board that has the very best people to advise the management

issues.
Before asking a question, let me just tell you that I'm extremely impressed by
Google. Just an amazing company in the space, extremely (inaudible). (Have used it)
and it's a fantastic service that I get.
All right. I want to ask about the self-driving car. You have been working on this for
about 10 years now. I see the self-driving cars all the time running around. There are
a lot of technical stuﬀ. So -- but I don't think that the technical issues are really the
problem right now. There are tons of stakeholders that are heavily impacted by the
self-driving car. And there's 1 stakeholder that I have not yet seen being mentioned
and discussed in the press. And it is actually the government. Transportation sector's
about 10% of GDP. The self-driving car has the possibility to eliminate 60%, 70% of
the private cars. All the stakeholders in that business, of course, will be impacted. But
it seems to me that the government itself will lose a tremendous amount of taxable
input sources, revenue sources. How do you plan to deal with the headwinds that the
government could provide -- could generate against the self-driving cars?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
There are a couple of points. Throughout history, when new technologies have
emerged, new roles that we didn't envision at the time of creation have also
developed. If you think about ATMs, for example, with banks, as they came about,
there were diﬀerent services that also were developed. And as we're looking, even in
our small pilot here in Phoenix, at some of the work that we're doing, we're teaming
up with players like Lyft and Avis and others. We're looking at diﬀerent elements of
what is that whole process. So that is one part of it.
The other part. And I'm glad you brought up cities, a really interesting area to
address is this last mile challenge. We have trains that may get you from Point A to
Point B. How do you then get people home? And so there are a host of, again, other
services that are continuing to evolve. And as I answered in the prior question, we're
very early days here. We think the opportunity to make a diﬀerence and save lives.
And also to your point about cities, repurpose space that may have been sitting idle
for parking lots. And to put it into some more productive use like the money freed
up to go into education or playgrounds, creates new opportunities that have not yet
been addressed. But it's still early days. Thank you.

(Interpreted) Our hope is that the approximately 8,000 subcontracted service
workers in food, janitorial, security and shuttle driver roles who will work in the future
San Jose campus have a voice at work and the ability to join together to negotiate
better working conditions.
(foreign language)
(Interpreted) We are also concerned with Google promoting local hiring and
investment in training and education programs to ensure that local youth have the
opportunity to get jobs at the future campus.
(foreign language)
(Interpreted) What commitments will you make to ensure that the workers in your
new campus will have a voice at work and that youth in the community have a real
pathway to work at Google in San Jose?
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
We take the issue of digital skilling and making sure that there are new paths for the
next generation very seriously. A lot of the work that Google.org, our philanthropic
subsidiary, does is very much focused on the notion of economic empowerment and
bringing skills, not just coding. But a range of diﬀerent skills to the next generation
of workers and learners. So we are doing that eﬀort in the Bay Area. Even this week,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19

Q - Tejal Patelwe have a variety of diﬀerent programs going out to try and reach out to the
community. But we also want to make sure that, that goes across the country. So we
have a number of diﬀerent eﬀorts that we're very active on, on this front. Thank you
for your interest and support.
{BIO 21612778 <GO>}
My name is Tejal Patel. I'm with the CtW Investment Group. I think this question
would have been preferable to ask of the entire Board. But we only have
management sitting up there. So if Mr. Chairman can answer it. What's the Board
doing to address Alphabet's high dependence on its contractors and this growing
shadow workforce, which I think one of the Verily contractors noted has led to this
huge discrepancy in -- related to its workforce beneﬁts, health insurance plans and is
contributing to this idea that Alphabet doesn't value their work the same way that it
does with the rest of its employees?
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
Actually, I think probably Eileen is the best person to answer this.
{BIO 3041372 <GO>}
Yes. Probably. Well able to answer your question. So we do have a sizable workforce
outside, an extended workforce. It's been reported that it's about 110,000 workers. A
large proportion, 97% of that workforce, works for vendor companies like Adecco
and Cognizant, large global employers. We have a structured supplier Code of
Conduct with our preferred vendors. And those govern things like wage rate, time
oﬀ, sick pay, parental leave now. And we've -- we are requiring a $5,000 education
tuition beneﬁt be imposed. And we're hoping to have that rolled out by sometime
next year with all of our vendors.
So this workforce is super important to Google. It's not just foodservice workers.
There are architects. There are physical therapists. There are attorneys. And they are
paid a fair wage relative to the market wage. So I'd like to dispel the notion that it's a
second-class workforce that's predominantly underrepresented groups. It's a broad
and global workforce, the largest proportion of which is outside the United States.
So I respect and take your question. But we have taken real measures to ensure that
supplier Code of Conduct is in place and audited each year and that the folks who
work alongside Google employees have similar workplace conditions as Google
employees.
{BIO 21612778 <GO>}
May I ask one clarifying question? Is -- the supplier Code of Conduct, does that apply
to all of your vendors or you said a large portion of...
{BIO 3041372 <GO>}
It's applied to all of our vendors.

Q - Patrick DohertyOkay. That they would receive health insurance beneﬁts, PTO and things like that?
{BIO 3041372 <GO>}
Yes. That -- we introduced that new work condition around extended health beneﬁts,
parental leave and educational reimbursement in April. We are renegotiating
contracts with all of our vendors to make sure that happens. The largest of them that
supply to the bulk of our workforce, extended workforce, those terms have been --
are in place. And we expect that to be converted by January 1.
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
The last question.
Hi. I'm just curious as to what the rationale was behind deciding to enforce
arbitration for Googlers but not for all employees in Alphabet.
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
So I can take that one. We have, at the time, made the change to ending forced
arbitration, as you noted, eﬀective as of this spring. At the time we did that for our
employees, we communicated to our outside vendors who employ the extended
workforce that Eileen referred to that we were doing this. We don't control those
terms and conditions of employment, of course. But we hope that many of them will
follow the path that we've laid out.
What about Verily or Waymo or ones you do control?
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
Yes. So individual Alphabet subsidiaries are diﬀerently positioned or make their own
decisions here. But I think the general direction of travel has been clear. And we've
laid out our approach for Google.
{BIO 1433018 <GO>}
Okay if it's quick.
{BIO 14001405 <GO>}
Yes. Real quick. It's Patrick Doherty from New York. 15 years ago, I attended my ﬁrst
Google AGM to present New York's concern over the company's cooperation with
Chinese government censorship. And the conﬂict that, that collusion placed was --
and we made to the point that, that collusion constituted an inconsistency with the
company-stated values. Subsequently, the company concluded that it could not
continue to operate in China under these conditions. And we, in New York, hope that
the company continues to remember that commitment that was made and its own
values in this context. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-19
