Good morning, welcome to WWDC, and welcome to Apple Park for this very special
day of announcements about our latest technologies and platforms. We love to see
our amazing developers dream out big ideas and bring those ideas to life in the
incredible apps they create. It's remarkable to think that this year marks the 15th
anniversary of the App Store, which changed everything.
Together with the iPhone developers apps have helped create entirely new
industries, enrich the lives of our users and change the world. We are committed toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Kate Bergeronproviding developers with resources, tools, and opportunities to help them do their
amazing work. One of these important resources is our Worldwide Developers
Conference. We are excited to kick things oﬀ with this morning's announcements.
Our teams are continuing to innovate, creating breakthrough experiences for our
customers, driven by the deep integration of hardware, software, and services. These
experiences delivered the magic that comes when using our products. It's
something only Apple can do.
Today, we're going to make some of our biggest announcements ever at WWDC.
We'll be talking about the future of our incredible software platforms, as well as
introducing some exciting new products.
So to get it started, I'd like to hand it over to John to talk about Mac.
{BIO 22135753 <GO>}
The Mac has been completely transformed by the transition to Apple silicon, with
industry-leading performance, new capabilities, and extraordinary battery life. Apple
silicon had also enabled developers to take their ads further than ever and do things
that simply weren't possible before. And its power-eﬃcient performance enables us
to create new systems, we could only dream of making in the past, like the amazing
13-inch MacBook Air with M2. With this incredible performance, brilliant display, all-
day battery life, and striking design, it's our most loved Mac, and it's also the world's
best-selling laptop.
Well, today, we have even bigger news to share on another product, made possible
by Apple silicon, here it is.
(Video Presentation)
Introducing the 15-inch MacBook Air. It's the world's best 15-inch laptop and here's
Kate to tell you all about it.
{BIO 20311790 <GO>}
The new Air has everything you could one in a 15-inch laptop. It starts with a design
that's astonishingly thin and light. It feels incredibly solid and durable. It's only a 11.5
millimeters thin, making it the world's thinnest 15-inch laptop. And it's easy to carry
around at just over three pounds. It features MagSafe charging, two Thunderbolt
ports, and a headphone jack for versatile connectivity. And it comes in four gorgeous
ﬁnishes, including Midnight and Starlight. The Air has a brilliant Liquid Retina display,
with an expansive 15.3-inch screen that's surrounded by thin 5-millimeter borders. So
you can see even more of your content and with up to 500 nits of brightness and
support for one billion colors, everything looks remarkably rich and vibrant. It has a
great 10 ADP camera for video calls, along with three micro array. So you come
through loud and clear. And the new Air sounds awesome with six speakers
including force canceling wafers, it delivers immersive spatial audio.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 35John TernusAll of this is enabled by the M2 chip, which delivers amazing performance and
battery life. In fact, the new Air is 12 times faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook
Air and it gets an astonishing 18 hours of battery life. So what makes the new Air the
world's best 15-inch laptop? Well, 15-inch PC laptops are full of trade-oﬀs between
performance, display resolution, battery life, and design. When compared to the
best-selling 15-inch PC laptop with a Core i7 processor, MacBook Air is up to twice as
fast, and is display is twice the resolution and 25% brighter. Even with better
performance and a better display, you still get up to 50% more battery life than on
the PC.
When it comes to design, the Air is nearly 40% thinner and half a pound lighter than
the PC. And it's fairless design runs completely silent. With all these great features in
the new Air, it's the only 15-inch laptop that has it all.
If this is your ﬁrst Mac, you'll enjoy how easy it is to set-up and use. And once you
start using it, you'll see how seamlessly it works with iPhone. So you can do things
like copy something on your phone and paste it with your Mac, using Universal
Clipboard. Or pick up where you left oﬀ on a thread and messages with Handoﬀ. So
that's the new 15-inch MacBook Air. It has an expansive display, the incredible
performance of M2, as six speakers sound system, and tremendous battery life, all in
the world's thinnest 15-inch laptop.
Now back to John.
{BIO 22135753 <GO>}
We're super-excited about the all-new 15-inch MacBook Air, the world's best 15-inch
laptop and it starts at just $1,299 and $1,199 for education, an incredible value for
such an incredible laptop. You can order it today, and it will be available next week.
We're also excited that the 13-inch MacBook Air now starts at $1,099, a $100 less than
before. And the 13-inch Air with M1 remains in the lineup at $999. So customers have
more choices than ever to ﬁnd the perfect Air for them. So that's MacBook Air.
Next, let's talk about our Pro products. Earlier this year, we announced M2 Pro and
M2 Max along with a new MacBook Pro, Mac mini and users have been amazed by
their performance. Well, now we have even more exciting news for Pros starting with
Max Studio. Introduced last year, Mac Studio is an entirely new product designed
speciﬁcally for Pros and it's been a breakthrough. Users have been astonished by
what they can do with it and satisfaction is through the roof. They love that it puts
tremendous performance and extensive connectivity in a compact form that was
right on their desk. And you can already ﬁnd it in the heart of hundreds of thousands
of home and pro studios across the world. Like in NBC where they use it to deliver
Saturday Night Live every week. And at Air Studios where sound engineers use it to
bring blockbuster movies to life. And at (inaudible), where software developers rely
on it to create cutting-edge apps, like Halide.
Today, we're excited to give Mac Studio its ﬁrst big update. And here is Jennifer, to
tell you more.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Users love Mac Studio for its incredible performance and connectivity, and today
both get even better. First, Mac Studio is getting the immensely capable M2 Max,
and it's a performance powerhouse. Developers can build new versions of apps at
work speed, with up to 25% faster performance than M1 Max. Motion graphics
designers using aftereﬀects can render up to 50% faster than M1 Max. Max Studio
with M2 Max is also four times faster than the most powerful Intel-based iMac. And
that's not all, today, we're adding one ﬁnal chip to the M2 family taking Mac
performance to new heights. Introducing M2 Ultra, it is a monster of a chip.
Connecting two M2 Macs tied together with our groundbreaking ultra-fusion
architecture, it doubles the performance of M2 Macs. The 24-core CPU in M2 Ultra
delivers 20% faster performance than M1 Ultra. And its 76-core GPU is 30% faster
than M1 Ultra.
Finally, the 32-core neural engine is 40% faster. And M2 Ultra can support an
enormous 192 gigabytes of uniﬁed memory, which is 50% more than M1 Ultra,
enabling it to do things other chips just can't do. For example, in a single system, it
can train massive ML workloads, like large transformer models that the most
powerful discrete GPU can't even process because it runs out of memory. So that's
M2 Ultra, our largest and most capable chip ever. With a mighty CPU and GPU
combined with massive memory bandwidth in a single SoC, it's the most powerful
chip ever created for a personal computer.
And today we're bringing M2 Ultra to Mac Studio taking performance even further.
Compared to Mac Studio with M1 Ultra, colorists using DaVinci Resolve, will see up to
50% faster video processing than before. 3D artists using Octane can now render
upto three times faster. And with M2 Ultra's Media Engine, video editors can
playback a mind blowing 22 streams of 8K ProRes video. No other computer in the
world comes close. Mac Studio with M2 Ultra is also a whopping six times faster than
the most powerful Intel-based iMac.
M2 Max and M2 Ultra take Mac Studio performance to a whole new level. For
connectivity, Mac Studio now has higher bandwidth HDMI, enabling up to 8K
resolution and 240-hertz frame rates. And with M2 Ultra, it can support an incredible
six Pro Display XDRs, driving over 100 million pixels, so that's the new Mac Studio. It's
a performance Powerhouse taking demanding workﬂows to the next level and we're
not done yet. There are some pro users who want ultimate performance, yet depend
on internal PCI expansion as well. Like audio engineers at Skywalker Sound who
work on feature ﬁlms like Oscar winner Top Gun: Maverick and artists at Color
Collective, who grade ﬁlms like Oscar winner, Everything Everywhere All At Once.
So today we're bringing Apple silicon to one more pro product. Introducing Mac Pro
with Apple silicon. It combines our most powerful chip with PCI expansion to tackle
the most demanding workﬂows. First, every Mac Pro comes with the outrageous
performance of M2 Ultra, compared to the fastest Intel base macro many real-world
pro workﬂows, like video transcoding and 3D simulation are three times faster, a key
reason is the amount of uniﬁed memory, and M2 Ultra, which is up to a gigantic 192FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Page 5 of 35John Ternus
Timothy D. Cookgigabytes. It enables the new Mac Pro to do things, simply not possible before, like
render Disney's Moana Island scene with massive geometry and textures. Another
reason is M2 Ultra's Media Engine, which accelerates video processing. The Intel-
based Mac Pro does this using Afterburner, a card that can play three streams of 8K
ProRes video.
Now every Mac Pro has Afterburner performance built-in and not just one, but the
performance of seven Afterburner cards. It's incredible. In fact, when using six video
IO cards, Mac Pro can ingest 24 4K camera feeds and encode them to progress in
real-time, all on a single machine. And the wide array of advanced connectivity on
Mac Pro gets even better with a built-in thunderbolt port, six on the back and two on
the top, which is twice as many as before.
Finally, Mac Pro brings PCI expansion to Apple silicon, it features six open expansion
slots that support Gen4, which is two times faster than before. So users can
customize Mac Pro with the central cards including audio and video IO, networking,
and storage. Finally, it's available in both tower and Rackmount closures. So that's
the new Mac Pro powered by Apple silicon with incredible M2 Ultra performance,
tremendous connectivity, and the versatility of PCI expansion, it takes even the most
demanding workﬂows to a whole new level.
Now back to John.
{BIO 22135753 <GO>}
Today, we've announced, not just one, but the two most powerful Macs we've ever
made. Mac Studio with M2 Max still starts at 19.99, an incredible value for pro users.
And with huge performance increases from M2 Ultra, Mac Pro starts at 69.99. You can
order both products today and there'll be available next week. They joined our other
Pro systems to give our users the most powerful and capable lineup of pro products
that Apple has ever oﬀered. This completes the transition to Apple silicon, which has
completely transformed the desktop and laptop experience and we're just getting
started. For Intel-based Mac users every Mac is now a gigantic upgrade. And for PC
users, there's never been a better time to switch to a Mac.
Now back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
With Apple silicon, it's remarkable how far we've taken the Mac in such a short
amount of time. It's the best and most capable lineup in the history of the personal
computer and I couldn't be more excited about its future. And it's the integration of
our hardware and software, that brings our amazing products to life. Our software
platforms enable our developers to do their amazing work, as well as provide
incredible experiences for our users.
So to tell you what's new with our software platforms, here's Craig.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Kim Beverett{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Let's start with iOS. This year we looked across the entire iPhone experience to
provide delightful new features that make the things you do on iPhone more
personal and intuitive. Our next release iOS 17 delivers more expressive
communication, simpliﬁed sharing, more intelligent input and all-new experiences
for your iPhone. Let's begin with some major updates to three apps that are central
to how you communicate with people everyday: phone, FaceTime, and messages.
The phone app is essential to the iPhone experience. Some of our most special
moments start with a phone call. And we're making a big update to the phone app
this year.
First, we're giving you a brand-new way to express yourself with personalized
contact posters. You get to customize exactly how you're represented when you give
people a call. Contact posters feature beautiful treatments for both photos and
emoji, paired with eye-catching topography. And in Chinese and Japanese, the new
layout with vertical text looks incredible. This rich new visual identity doesn't just
show up in calls, it's also part of your contact card. So you'll have a consistent look
across the places where you communicate and share. With posters, you're in control.
Customizing your poster works a lot like personalizing your lock screen. Decide on
the image, font, and color. The possibilities are endless. And when calls come your
way, whether they're from your neighbor, your friend, or your boss, they're going to
stand out in a whole new way. And for developers, this all works with call kit, so
posters will appear for calls placed via third-party VoIP apps too.
Next, we have a powerful new feature to help you make a more informed decision
about when to answer an incoming call, live voicemail. Sometimes when a call
comes in from an unknown number, it's hard to know whether it's one you want to
pick up. Now, when someone calls you and leaves a message, you'll see a live
transcription in real-time as they speak. If it's something you want to address right
away, you can pick up the call to talk to them, right then and there. This is great for
calls from friends and family too. Imagine you get a phone call in a meeting and
want to know whether it's something urgent or if you can wait until the meeting is
wrapped. You'll see the voicemail right on your screen, so you can decide whether to
step out and take the call. Thanks to the power of the neural engine, live voicemail
transcriptions are handled on device, preserving your privacy.
And there is another type of call, getting a big update, FaceTime, where we've
added one of our most requested communication features. Now when you call
someone on FaceTime, and they aren't available, you'll be able to leave a message.
So whether you're just calling to say, hey, I want to share a precious moment. You can
record a message, so that they can enjoy it later.
Next, to tell you about some updates to another way we'd love to share and
communicate every day, here is Kim.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 35Messages is the way we stay connected with the people who matter most. To start,
let's quickly cover some key improvements that make using messages even faster
and more convenient. First, search is more powerful and precise with the addition of
search ﬁlters. So now you can start to search and then add additional terms to
narrow the results to ﬁnd exactly what you're looking for.
Next, a new catch-up arrow in the top right of your conversation, lets you jump to the
ﬁrst message you haven't seen. It's perfect on busy days when the Group Chat is
blowing up. We've also made replying inline faster than ever, just swipe to reply on
any bubble. And for those times when you get an audio message where you aren't
able to listen right away, they're now transcribed, so you can read them in a moment
and listen later.
Finally, location sharing, now lets you keep track of your friends location directly in
the conversation. Next, I'd like to share an important new feature for those situations
where you want to let a loved one know, you made it back home safely. Check-in.
Whether you're walking home after dark or going for an early-morning run, you can
start check-in with a family member or friend to let them know when you get home
safely. As soon as you arrive check-in automatically detects that you're home and
that's your friend know. But if something unexpected were to happen while you're
on your way, it can recognize that you're not making progress towards your
destination and check-in with you. And if you don't respond that can automatically
share useful information such as your current location and the route you took, and
they'll also be able to see your battery level and cell service status, so they know if
you might be able to take their call. And any information shared with your friend is
end-to-end encrypted. So that's check-in, an easy way to feel reassured that your
loved ones have your back.
We also have an updated design for how you get all your iMessage apps. They used
to live above your keyboard and now they are gracefully tucked away, given your
conversations, the sleek new look. With just a tap of this new plus button, you'll see
all the things you send the most, like your photos, audio messages, and location.
And when you swipe up, you'll see all your iMessage apps there too. Also inside this
menu is something you're going to love, a brand new stickers experience. Let me
show it to you. By tapping the plus button, and then tapping stickers, you'll see the
brand-new draw that brings all my stickers into one place, like my recently used
stickers, emoji, and any sticker packs I've downloaded. And we've made all emoji
into stickers. I can peel and stick an emoji sticker, and I can rotate and resize it too.
Last year we introduced the ability to lift a subject from the background of your
photos. And now those subjects can be turned into stickers. By tapping the new live
stickers tab, I see all the stickers I've made with my own photos. Let me show you
how I made these. I'll tap the plus button, I can pick any one of these photos and
turn it into a sticker. And check this out, when I tap on the live photos tab, I see all of
the live photos that will make great animated stickers. Why don't we make a sticker
out of just one? And just like that, it gets added right into my live stickers tab. From
there, I can send my sticker inline or here in stick like this.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 35Craig FederighiYou can also add eﬀects to live stickers. When you took your phone and messages
they really come to life. Best of all, you can now react to messages by adding stickers
directly to any bubble from the tap, back menu. And the fun doesn't stop in
messages, we've added stickers system-wide, so you can access your full sticker
collection in markup and anywhere you can access emoji today, including in third-
party apps. So that's messages.
Now back to Craig.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
These updates to messages, FaceTime, and phone, will enhance the way we
communicate every day. iPhone provides many ways to share content with others
and we have some exciting updates to how we share with AirDrop. AirDrop makes it
easy to share a ﬁle with a colleague or send photos to a friend in seconds. And this
year we're expanding how you can use AirDrop to share in all new ways, starting with
how you swap your number with someone new.
Today, you either hand your phone to them or when have you dictate your
information, while the other types it. Now there is a better way, NameDrop. With
NameDrop, you can just during your phones close together, you'll see the same
contact poster we talked about for phone calls and you can easily choose the phone
numbers and email addresses you want to share along with it. And share them just
like that.
And to make exchanging context even more convenient, you can use NameDrop
with an iPhone and Apple Watch too. And we're also using this same gesture to
make it easier than ever to AirDrop content and even kick-oﬀ shared experiences.
When you want to share these stunning photos you took on your latest adventure,
again just bring your phones close together, it's that simple. And for those times
when someone is sending over a ton of photos or a large video ﬁle, and you need to
step away, you can now leave AirDrop range and your content will continue to send
securely, in full quality over the Internet.
You can also bring your devices together to instantly kick oﬀ a shared activity, using
SharePlay. Like when you're going for a one, and want to share some music to stay
on the same beat. And for developers, this will work automatically for apps that
support SharePlay. So you can bring your phones together to watch the same live
stream on Twitch or jump into a coding game together with the margin, it's never
been easier to share.
Next, let's talk about some enhancements that will make text input even more
intelligent with the keyboard and dictation. iOS 17 brings big updates to the
intelligence in the keyboard, that improve the experience every time you type. It
starts with the feature at the core of typing accurately on iPhone autocorrect.
Autocorrect is powered by on-device machine learning. And over the years, we
continued to advance these models. The keyboard now leverages a transformer of
language model which is state-of-the-art for word prediction, making auto-correctFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 35Adeeti Ullalmore accurate than ever. And with the power of Apple silicon, iPhone can run this
model every time you tap a key. Autocorrect is also getting more capable with
refresh design to better support you, as you type.
Sentence-level auto corrections can ﬁx more types of grammatical mistakes. If an
auto-correction isn't quite what you wanted, tapping the underlying word shows
what you originally typed with the option to quickly revert back to it. And then those
moments where you just want to type a talking word, well, the keyboard will learn it
too. When it comes to speeding up you're typing, predictive text already helps you
quickly ﬁnish add or change a word. And now you'll get predictions inline as you
type. So ﬁnishing a word or even the whole sentence is as easy as tapping the space
bar. And predictions improved based on the phrases and words you use, so they're
more personalized. Another core part of the keyboard is dictation which gets a new
transformer-based speech recognition model, that leverages the neural engine to
make dictation even more accurate. These updates make typing on iPhone better
than ever.
Last, let's talk about some exciting new experiences we're bringing to iOS 17, starting
with a new way to reﬂect on and relive special moments. Here's Adeeti to tell you
more.
Being reminded of life's special moments is a really powerful thing. For instance, we
often hear about how much people love watching memory movies created from
their photos. So we wanted to create a new way to help people not only remember
but also write about their experiences, inspired by rich details from their day,
including people, places, activity, and even music, in addition to photos.
Today, we're excited to introduce, Journal, a brand-new app coming to iPhone later
this year. Journaling is a great way to practice gratitude and has been shown to
improve your well-being. Journal makes it easy to get started and enjoy these
beneﬁts. Using on-device machine learning, your iPhone can create personalized
suggestions of moments to inspire your writing. Suggestions will be intelligently
curated from information on your iPhone, like your photos, location, music, workouts,
and more. And you control what to include when you enable suggestions and which
ones to save tier journal.
And for developers, suggestions will be available as an API, so they can be used in
their apps too. Some suggestions are personalized and some are reﬂection prompts,
to inspire writing across a range of themes. You can pick any of them to start a new
journal entry.
Let's look at this one of a trip. It includes where you went, the music you listen to, and
photos you took there. You can add these tier journal in one tap. And when you do
there's even a writing prompt like what was the highlight of your visit? So it's easy to
get started. As you capture life's precious moments, you can mark important ones
and revisit them later, to help you ﬁnd new insights or set new goals. And to stayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 10 of 35Craig Federighiconsistent you can schedule notiﬁcations for the start or end of your day, to remind
you to write. And to tell you when new suggestions are available. Of course, your
suggestions and entries are incredibly personal and Journal is designed to keep
them private. With on-device processing end-to-end encryption and the ability to
lock your Journal, no one, but you can access it, not even Apple. So that's Journal.
And now back to Craig.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Journal will be a great way to preserve rich and powerful memories and practice
gratitude. Now, I'm really excited to tell you about another new experience coming
to iOS 17. With iPhone in your hand, you have all the information you need, right
when you need it. We saw an opportunity to create something new and diﬀerent for
those moments when you set iPhone down, we call it standby. Just by turning iPhone
on its sidewall charging, you get a new full-screen experience with glanceable
information designed to be viewed at a distance. Standby is perfect for your
nightstand, kitchen counter, or desk. And with the always-on display on iPhone 14
Pro, it's always available. When you wake up it's easy to see the time with the clock
and it's easy to personalize.
Swipe up to choose from a range of beautiful clock styles. Swipe to the side and you
can look back on your favorite moments in photos. Standby automatically shuﬄes
through your best shots, taking full advantage of the screen. It also embraces the
power of widgets, which are more glanceable than ever. With a quick swipe on each
widget stack, you can see the current weather, home controls, or your favorite third-
party widgets. And since these are SmartStax, just like on the home screen, they
automatically surface the right information at the right time, like your schedule
before a meeting starts.
We support for live activities, you can also see the score of the game or when your
food delivery is arriving. Siri in standby works great with rich visual results that are
easy to view and it's just as easy to ask to play music or set a timer hands-free. At
night when you're charging iPhone, standby adapts to low light taking on a beautiful
red tone to help you sleep. And for each place you charge with MagSafe, standby
will remember your preferred view. So that's standby. We think it's going to make
iPhone even more useful in those moments when you set it down.
IOS 17 has many more features, including the ability to simply say, Siri, to activate Siri.
And now you can issue back-to-back comments without needing to say, Siri, again. In
maps you can select an area and download a map to your device to use when you're
oﬄine. And in photos, the people album is better than ever, it's spotting your favorite
people and now can even recognize the cats and dogs that are part of your family
too. And that's iOS 17, with big updates to the phone app with new contact posters
and live voicemail, messages improvements with a new stickers experience, more
ways to share with AirDrop, and improved typing indication, along with all new
experiences like journal and standby.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Page 11 of 35Now let's head downstairs to talk about iPadOS. IPadOS powers iPad, our most
versatile device. And it enables our users to do so many things. Over the years,
we've added features that make it even more capable from jotting down your latest
ideas and notes, to working with multiple apps to spreading out your projects across
displays. And just last month we further stretch the bounds of what's possible on
iPad by bringing Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, our industry-leading professional video
and music creation apps to iPad, redesigned from the ground up to be a touch-ﬁrst
all Pro experience for the next generation of creators.
Our next release, iPadOS 17 takes iPad even further, bringing new levels of
personalization and making iPad even more capable, starting with widgets and the
lock screen. Let me show you.
Widgets were designed to quickly convey information at a glance. Now we've made
widgets interactive and I can take action directly in the widget, without even opening
an app. So I can not only see my reminders, I can also tap one to mark it as complete
right here. And as I do to, the widget gracefully animates it away. These types of
quick interactions are useful in many scenarios. At home, I can control my lights right
from the home widget, and start playing an album, with the music widget. And
developers can add interactivity to their widgets too. I can learn something new with
ﬂashcards from Quizlet. And track it with streaks right away. We think these
interactions with widgets are going to make the home screen so much more
powerful.
Next, we want to bring a greater level of customization and personalization to
another space, the lock screen. Our users love personalizing the iPhone lock screen.
So we're bringing that experience to iPad, just tap and hold to get started. There are
so many wonderful wallpaper options like photo shuﬄe, weather, and emoji, and
new ones like kaleidoscope with those vibrant jewels and ﬂowers.
Now, I've already got a few wallpapers setup that I'm excited to show you. Enjoying
my photos on the iPad lock screen it's just delightful. And when you select a live
photo, we use an advanced machine-learning model to synthesize additional frames
to create a gorgeous, smooth, slow-motion eﬀect whenever you wake iPad. Also
we've optimized wallpapers like astronomy for the large display on iPad. Of course, I
can personalize it and now choose from any of the planets in the solar system, each
with incredible detail and earth just looks stunning at this scale. I can tap the time, to
adjust the font and the color and even change the font weight, to get it just right.
Here on the left, there's also a space to add widgets. The lock screen is a great place
to see information at a glance and even perform quick actions. All right. This looks
perfect. And that's how you can customize your lock screen with iPadOS 17, it's really
cool. The lock screen gets one other feature that makes it even more useful, live
activities. So now, right from the lock screen, you can keep track of a food order with
Uber Eats, travel plans with Flighty, the score with Major League Soccer, or a timer.
And we're happy to report, that now you can even keep track of multiple timers. We
truly live in an age of wonders. The new lock screen experience and iPad, combinedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Craig Federighiwith interactive widgets on the home screen. It's a big step forward for how you can
personalize and use iPad.
Next, let's talk about an app that we're excited to bring to iPadOS for the ﬁrst time,
Health, the Health app, is when designed to take advantage of the larger screen on
iPad, so you can see rich details at a glance. And because your health data is
securely synced, you can see your health information from your iPad, iPhone, Apple
Watch, as well as compatible third-party apps and devices, all in one place. It's easy
to see your activity, keep track of your medications, and view your trends and
highlights. Interactive charts make your health data come to life, letting you dive
deeply into the details. And for developers health kit comes to iPad, opening up new
ways to build innovative health and ﬁtness experiences. Like Rise, who has built
these compelling visualizations as part of their new iPad app.
Next, let's take a look at improvements we're making to the way you work with an
important type of document, PDFs. To tell you all about it here is, Jenny.
{BIO 20335880 <GO>}
IPad is the best device for PDFs. They have built the right into iPadOS, so you can
open them anywhere and they render beautifully. We use PDFs for so many things
that we wanted to make them even easier to work with. Thanks to new machine-
learning models, iPadOS may identify the ﬁelds in a PDF. So you can use autoﬁll to
quickly ﬁll them out with information like names, addresses, and emails from your
contacts. This even works on documents you scan with the camera. And if you need
to sign it, you can add a safe signature or make a new one with Apple Pencil. When
you're ready, you can easily reply back with your completed form in mail.
Now another place where we keep PDFs is in the Notes app. It's great for capturing
almost any information. And it's getting a big upgrade, that gives you a brand new
ways to organize, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs. PDFs sit right inside your
notes. You have all the note, taking capabilities of the App and the PDF is expanded
to a fall with view. You can quickly review the document, ﬂip through pages, and
annotate using Apple Pencil. You can keep multiple PDFs in the same note, which is
great for keeping related ﬁles together as you work. PDFs and notes are also
fantastic for collaboration.
When you're working together, you see each other's updates in real time. So as you
scribble something down, the changes you make appear right away, images. And
when you drop an image into a PDF, you can still annotate right on top of it. If you
need to ﬁnish later you can use live collaboration from anywhere, it's even great
combined with a FaceTime call. With PDFs announced, no taking a markup or going
to be abrased.
And now back to Craig.

Page 13 of 35So that's a look at iPadOS 17, but of course, there's even more. Like improvements to
stage manager, where we're adding even more ﬂexibility to position and size of your
windows, giving you more control over your workspace. And you can now take
advantage of the built-in camera on your external display for FaceTime and
conference calls. And free form which gets new drawing tools like watercolor,
fountain pen, and shape recognition, along with a new feature called Follow Along,
that let you follow a collaborator and track as they move around the canvas. These
joined other great features like the redesigned lock screen and interactive widgets.
Along with the health app and great new ways to work with PDFs, as well as other
features you heard about in iOS, like leaving a video message in FaceTime, in line
typing predictions, and updates to messages.
Now let's turn our attention to macOS. MacOS is the heart of the Mac. And with
Apple silicon the Mac lineup has never been stronger. Combined with macOS,
enables you to be more productive and creative. For our next release, we focused on
helping you get even more done. Now when it came to naming this release, we
turned once again to Apple's legendary crack product marketing team.
The instructions were simple and explicit. Travel far and wide, leave no stone
unturned. Well, as far as we can reconstruct that search consisted of piling in their
micro bus, punching in the words, awesome vineyard into maps, and beelining
straight to one of the most famous wine regions in the world. A place celebrated by
the team perhaps a bit too much and beloved by millions. Introducing macOS
Sonoma a big new release that will make your Mac more delightful and even more
productive.
First, many of the features we talked about earlier on iOS and iPadOS are going to
be great on the Mac. And macOS Sonoma brings a rich set of features that elevate
the experience of macOS, starting with stunning new screen savers, that show
beautiful slow-motion videos of places around the world like the sweeping skyline of
Hong Kong. The sandstone buttes of Monument Valley and the rolling hills of
Sonoma. And when you log in, this inventory settles beautifully into your desktop.
Next, let's talk about making your Mac more personal through widgets. Not only are
they becoming more powerful, they are also now available somewhere new, let's
take a look. Before widgets on Mac, we're available here in Notiﬁcation Center. But
sometimes you want to see information at a glance, while you're using your Mac.
Now you can, by simply bringing your widgets right into view here on the desktop. I
love to catch a glimpse of my favorite photos throughout the day, and weather too.
And I can put these anywhere.
So what's that shortcuts here to the bottom left. To make sure widgets are distracting
while you're working with apps, we also came up with a way to make them glancable
without feeling intrusive. If I open a mail, my widgets instantly fade into the
background, so I can focus on the task at hand. If I switch my wallpaper, you'll see
the widgets are intelligently tempted based on the color behind them, so they
maintain ledgeability and the look of my desktop. Even the photos which it adapts
it's really gorgeous.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 14 of 35Jeremy SandmelTo add more widgets, I can bring up the widget gallery, where I have all the widgets I
know and love on my Mac. But I also have some amazing widgets on my iPhone and
through the magic of continuity, I can now access them all right here on my Mac. So I
can see my Apollo for Reddit, HiCoﬀee, and even my car widget. I don't need to
install these apps on my Mac to use the widgets. My iPhone just needs to be nearby
or on the same Wi-Fi network.
And just like on iPad and iPhone, widgets on the Mac are now interactive. So you can
use your car widget from your iPhone to start cooling oﬀ your car. And interactivity
can unlock new workﬂows too. For example, photographers can select photos on
their desktop, and with the shortcuts widget, they can tap into Pixelmator Pro to
apply a signature look and get them ready to submit for a campaign, all with a single
click. And that's widgets on Mac, an entirely new way to personalize your desktop
and get things done throughout your day.
Next, let's talk about gaming, a space where so much action is happening. To tell you
more, here's Jeremy.
Apple silicon fundamentally changed the game, delivering incredible graphics
performance to every Mac. And now, tens of millions of Macs can run demanding
games with great performance, long battery life, and breathtaking visuals, presenting
an unprecedented opportunity for developers to bring their games to more players
than ever before. And since introducing Metal 3 with powerful new features like
MetalFX Upscaling, demanding games like Resident Evil: Village have seen huge
performance gains.
This year, macOS takes the gaming experience even further with Game Mode, giving
players an edge when performance is measured in precious milliseconds, ensuring
the game gets the highest priority on the CPU and GPU, keeping your background
tasks to a lower usage, and delivering an optimized gaming experience with even
smoother and more consistent frame rates. And Game Mode makes gaming on Mac
even more immersive, dramatically lowering audio latency with AirPods, and
signiﬁcantly reducing input latency with Xbox and PlayStation controllers by
doubling the Bluetooth sampling rate, providing in-game responsiveness you can
really feel.
Game Mode works with any game, including all of these recent and upcoming Mac
games. We are so excited to see developers bringing more games to the Mac. And
to help with that, Metal provides a new game porting toolkit to make it even easier
for developers to port their games from other platforms. These new tools enable
developers to quickly evaluate just how well their game could run on Mac. A process
that used to take months can now be done in days. And they dramatically simplify
the process of converting the game's shaders and graphics code to take full
advantage of the powerful features and performance of Apple silicon, signiﬁcantly
reducing the total development time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
Thanks, Kojima-san. Now let's shift to the ways macOS will help you be more
productive, starting with video conferencing. We spend a lot of time on video calls,
but when you share your screen, your face and presence can get lost. This year, we
have great new ways to help you present remotely. A new video eﬀect called
Presenter Overlay elevates your presence by including you on top of the content
you're sharing. With small overlay, your face appears in a movable bubble. So it's
easy to be seen while showcasing your work. With large overlay, you remain
prominent, while your shared screen is framed beautifully next to you.
We separate you from the background and layer your screen in between. So you can
walk, talk, and move in front of your content. Thanks to the neural engine in Apple
silicon, you get amazing quality. We also have a new reactions video eﬀect. When
you want to let others know how you feel, you can add a reaction that seamlessly
blends your video with balloons, confetti, hearts, and more. They're fun and have a
cinematic quality with depth and focus. And you can trigger these eﬀects with a
gesture. When you're really impressed, two thumbs up brings on a celebratory
display of ﬁreworks. You can use these new video eﬀects with any app, like
FaceTime, Zoom, Teams, Webex, and more.
Next, let's talk about Safari, and how we're taking it to the next level. To tell you
more, here is Beth.
Safari is the best way to browse the web. With macOS Sonoma, Safari is the world's
fastest browser. It renders cutting-edge websites with amazing speed. Safari is
powered by WebKit, which provides incredible technology that is used by over a
million apps. We're constantly updating WebKit. In just the past few months we've
added even more features for developers and we're adding even more, including
beautiful advancements to typography.
Another cornerstone of the Safari experience is privacy. Safari was built from the
ground up to protect your privacy and was the ﬁrst browser to introduce private
browsing. This year, we're taking it a step further. Private browsing now locks your
private browsing windows when you're not using them, completely blocks known
trackers from loading on pages, and removes tracking from URLs as you browse in
private browsing. Of course, one of the best ways to protect yourself on the web is
with a strong password, or even better, a passkey. We're now adding the ability to
securely share passwords and passkeys with the people you're closest with.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 16 of 35Craig Federighi
Ron HuangEveryone in a group can add and edit passwords to keep them up to date. And since
sharing is through iCloud Keychain, it's end-to-end encrypted.
We have another exciting update to help you stay organized with proﬁles. Many of
us use Safari for a mix of work and personal browsing and would love a way to
separate browsing between topics. Proﬁles help you separate your cookies, history,
extensions, tab groups, and favorites. So you can sign into the same site with your
work account and personal account and quickly switch between them. And if you're
a student, set up a unique collection of extensions and favorites just for school.
Last, we're giving you a faster way to access your favorite sites with web apps on
Mac. Let's check them out. With web apps, we're elevating the websites you use
most often with some of the same great features as apps. I use Conﬂuence all the
time. I'll make it a web app so it doesn't get lost in my other browsing. From the ﬁle
menu, I can click add to doc, and the title and icon load automatically. When I click
add, the icon instantly appears in the doc. Now I can close this window in Safari.
When I launch my web app, I get an app-like experience with a simpliﬁed toolbar.
On Mac, you can create a web app for any website, and developers don't have to do
any extra work for their web app to look great. Web apps are integrated right into
my experience on Mac. So I can command tab to access my Pinterest web app. It
also works great with Stage Manager, Mission Control, Spotlight, and other ways you
access apps. You can get notiﬁcations too. So Instacart can let me know my order has
been delivered. And with a click, I'm into my Instacart web app. Web apps make it
even easier to get to your favorite websites on Mac.
Back to you, Craig.
{BIO 6190419 <GO>}
With proﬁles, web apps, and a huge update to private browsing, Safari is simply the
best way to browse the web. And that's macOS Sonoma, featuring more ways to
personalize with widgets and stunning new screensavers, new levels of gaming
performance, and powerful productivity for video conferencing and Safari.
Now let's take a look at audio and home experiences. Whether you're rocking out to
your favorite '80s metal band or watching the latest show to relax after work, we
continue to focus on features that entertain, inspire, and bring us closer together. So
let's start oﬀ with what's new for AirPods.
Here's Ron to tell you more.

even more we can do. That's why we are excited to announce Adaptive Audio. It
combines the best of both listening modes into one, making it even easier to move
through environments and interactions that are constantly changing.
Adaptive Audio dynamically blends transparency and active noise cancellation to
match the conditions of your surroundings. So you can stay present within your
environment while distracting noises are automatically reduced. Adaptive Audio also
helps you focus on your favorite music or podcast. And now with personalized
volume, we use machine learning to understand your listening preferences over
time, together with the outside conditions, to deliver the best media experience for
you in the moment. We're also adding an incredible new way to engage with others
around you while wearing AirPods Pro. Just start speaking, in conversation
awareness we'll automatically lower your music, focus on the voices in front of you,
and reduce background noise.

proactively reducing the noise around you. And for added convenience, you can
press to quickly mute or unmute yourself as needed. We're also improving the
AirPods automatic switching experience across the ecosystem. Now it is signiﬁcantly
faster to transition from a conference call on Mac to your favorite playlist on iPhone,
all without missing a beat. And for the moments when you want to share your
content with those around you, there's AirPlay.
I'll hand it over to Anne to tell you about what's coming.
AirPlay is the easiest way to share your audio, videos, and photos to nearby speakers
and screens. And we're making AirPlay more seamless than ever. Your iPhone and
iPad now use on-device intelligence to learn your AirPlay preferences. So if you
usually listen to music while you cook dinner, the nearby HomePod in the kitchen will
automatically show up. And not only can you start to play music using AirPlay from
your iPhone, you can now also ask Siri on your HomePod to start an AirPlay session,
letting you play even more of your favorite content using just your voice. Just say,
Siri, play Arlo Parks on SoundCloud. With so much media at your ﬁngertips on your
iPhone and iPad, you can enjoy your content from anywhere, even when traveling.
That's why we're excited about launching AirPlay in hotels. With AirPlay support in
hotels, it's easy to take advantage of the big screen in your room to watch an
episode of your favorite show, or practice tomorrow's presentation.
Pairing is simple. Just scan the QR code and tap the conﬁrmation. That's it. You're
automatically connected to Wi-Fi and ready to resume watching from right where
you left oﬀ. AirPlay will be available in select hotels before the end of the year, with
more to follow. And to make your next trip even more enjoyable, we have some
exciting updates coming to Apple Music and CarPlay. Today, adding a song to a
road trip might mean sharing a phone, passing a cable, or sending a link. We want to
make it easier for others in the car to control the music and add to what's playing,
even passengers in the back seat. That's why we're thrilled to bring SharePlay to the
car.
Now, when the driver's iPhone is connected to CarPlay, any passenger's iPhone will
automatically suggest joining their session. Just tap to connect. From there, it's easy
to play your favorite music, control playback, and enjoy the ride together.
Next, let's turn to tvOS and Apple TV, which work incredibly well with all your Apple
devices to deliver the best of television, along with all of your entertainment. In tvOS
17, we've completely redesigned Control Center, making it more intuitive to do
things like access AirPods settings, home cameras, system controls, and user proﬁles,
all with a touch of the Siri Remote. And for the times when you can't ﬁnd your Siri
Remote, you can now use your iPhone to locate it, and get back to watching TV.

Our home is also where we connect with loved ones. And for times when we're not
in the same place, we're excited to introduce a new feature that will transform your
living room. FaceTime is coming to Apple TV. Now everyone can gather on the
couch and catch up with friends and family on the big screen. The new FaceTime
app on Apple TV takes advantage of Continuity Camera to unlock incredible shared
experiences at home. So when you launch FaceTime on Apple TV, it wirelessly
connects to your iPhone or iPad and lets you use their camera and microphone to
join a call.
Let's check it out. You can place a call on your iPhone or from Apple TV. Or you can
pick up a call from a friend on your iPhone and easily move it to Apple TV. Apple TV
takes full advantage of the cameras on your iPhone and iPad for eﬀects like Center
Stage. As you move around or when someone enters the room, you'll always stay
perfectly framed. At any time, you can interact using gestures that'll show up on
everyone's screen. And because it's Apple TV, you have access to all of your favorite
shows and movies.
With SharePlay, you can easily watch together and everyone stays in sync. So that's
FaceTime on Apple TV. And for developers, we're adding Continuity Camera APIs to
make the biggest screen in your home more connected and entertaining. So apps
like Zoom and Webex will be coming to tvOS for the very ﬁrst time by the end of this
year. These are some of the features coming to Audio and Home. AirPods take
personal audio to the next level with Adaptive Audio. AirPlay is coming to hotels, so
you can enjoy your content on the big screen when traveling. Apple Music lets
everyone control music in the car with SharePlay. And FaceTime comes to Apple TV,
bringing everyone closer together through incredible new experiences.
Next, here's Kevin to tell you about the updates coming to watchOS.
{BIO 1958128 <GO>}
WatchOS is the world's most advanced wearable operating system, and it's
redeﬁned how people all over the world think of what a watch can do. We've
continued this transformation through new features designed to help keep you
connected, active, healthy, and safe. As Apple Watch has evolved over the years, it's
become even more intuitive, and more powerful, providing easier access to vital
information. And today we're excited to take this further with watchOS 10. We're
celebrating this huge milestone with a new way to view information quickly from any
watch face and comprehensive app redesigns across watchOS.

you can simply turn the Digital Crown to reveal widgets in a Smart Stack. I can start
oﬀ my day with a glance at the forecast and headlines. And the Smart Stack uses
machine learning to show you relevant information, right when you need it. So later
in the day, you'll see some upcoming meetings, tasks you need to complete, or
medications to log.
It's so convenient to check what you have to take care of next. And you can long
press to add a widget to the Smart Stack, like Sleep Data. And there's even a widget
that can hold your favorite complications, like Timers. Let's start a timer. Now, when
I'm back at my watch face, I can simply scroll up, and the timer shows up right here,
so you can easily see how much time is left or pause it with a tap. This also works
great for other active sessions like Stopwatch, Workouts, or listening to Podcasts. This
is a fast new way to view information from any watch face. We've also redesigned
apps across watchOS 10.
Let's take a look at a couple of examples, starting with World Clock, which now
features dynamic background colors that reﬂect the time of day. And I can easily see
when it might be a good time to call a friend in a diﬀerent time zone. Let's also check
out the Activity app. The app redesign includes corner icons that I can tap to get to
my weekly summary, sharing, or awards. And we've even redesigned the trophy case
so you can see awards in progress and challenges you've completed.
And when you rotate the Digital Crown, it shows new full-screen views for move,
exercise, and stand. Developers can also use this new design language to update
apps. Streaks now utilizes the entire display so you can easily see your progress and
access your tasks. NBA makes keeping up with your favorite team even more
compelling with team colors and new game details. And with Waterllama's redesign,
you can see your hydration details from the last seven days with just a turn of the
Digital Crown.
We're also introducing two new watch faces. Palette is a beautiful new face where
time is depicted in a wide variety of gorgeous colors using three distinct overlapping
layers. As the time changes, the colors on the display shift as well. And to celebrate
watchOS 10, we're bringing Snoopy and Woodstock to Apple Watch. These beloved
comic strip characters come to life in many diﬀerent animations. They can be playful
with the watch hands, react to the weather conditions in your area or even get active
with you. It's terriﬁc to have Snoopy on Apple Watch.
We're so excited for you to experience your Apple Watch in a whole new way, with
redesigned apps that provide more information at a glance, and new ways to
navigate and quickly access your content, all powered by the intelligence of
watchOS 10. And if that wasn't enough, we have more features to keep you active,
starting with cycling. It's a competitive sport for some and a great way to exercise for
others.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Page 21 of 35Eric CharlesHere's Eric to tell you about some new features that will make Apple Watch an even
more essential companion for cyclists.
{BIO 1401412 <GO>}
Apple Watch has a lot of great cycling features already, like notifying you to start a
workout if you forgot and the safety potential of Fall Detection. For many riders,
accessories like speed and cadence sensors, as well as power meters, provide
important training data. In watchOS 10, Apple Watch can now connect to Bluetooth-
enabled bike sensors. So you can add cadence and power to your standard metrics
and even try out a new cycling power workout view.
Using power, heart rate, and motion data, Apple Watch will estimate your Functional
Threshold Power, known as FTP, which is the highest level of cycling intensity that
you could theoretically maintain for an hour. And by taking a percentage of your FTP,
we can provide power zones, where you can easily see which zone you're in and
track how long you spend in each. It's an eﬀective and reliable way of improving
your performance on a bike. We knew that we could do even more for our entire
cycling community, so we built a new feature that requires no additional equipment,
except your paired iPhone.
In watchOS 10, cycling workouts from your Apple Watch now automatically show up
as a live activity on your iPhone. Tapping the live activity will take over the entire
display. This is perfect for views like heart rate zones, elevation, power zones, as well
as a new view for current and max speed, distance, and more. You're going to love
these new workout metrics, views, and experiences on your next ride.
Next, let's talk about hiking and how we're updating compass and maps for your
outdoor adventures. In watchOS 10, compass will automatically generate two new
waypoints for you. A new cellular connection waypoint will indicate the last place you
had reception with your carrier if you ever need to check your messages or make a
call to your family. And in the case of an emergency, another new waypoint will
indicate where on your route you can make an emergency call using any available
carrier's network. We're also introducing a new elevation view. Using altimeter data,
you can see a three-dimensional view of your saved waypoints.
In addition to these new compass features, we're also updating maps. Starting in the
U.S., we're introducing a new topographic map with contour lines, hill shading, and
elevation details, along with points of interest and trailheads. You can use search to
discover nearby trails and trailhead categories. And before you head out, you can
review additional information, such as trail name, diﬃculty level, length, elevation
gain, and more. watchOS 10 also introduces new APIs for developers to create
compelling workout experiences. The powerful motion sensors on Apple Watch
Series 8 and Ultra can detect rapid changes in direction and acceleration, like when
swinging a golf club or a tennis racket.
Developers will have access to this high-frequency motion data. For example,

Apple Watch and iPhone oﬀer many important health features, like medications,
sleep, and mobility. With watchOS 10 and iOS 17, we're moving into two new areas
that as always are grounded in science with privacy at the core. First, let's talk about
mental health. We believe mental health is as important as your physical health, and
even contributes to it. This is something that impacts each and every one of us. So
this year, we want to shine a light on mental health and empower you to care for
your mind just as you do for your body. Reﬂecting on your state of mind can help
you build emotional awareness and resilience. Experts say, identifying our feelings
has been shown to help us manage diﬃcult emotions, appreciate positive moments,
and improve wellbeing.
So you'll now be able to log your momentary emotion and your daily mood in a
discreet and convenient way from the Mindfulness app in watchOS 10. You can use
the Digital Crown to scroll through the engaging multidimensional shapes and
choose how you're feeling. For added beneﬁt to your well-being, you can also
identify what's making you feel that way. Maybe it's your family or travel, and you can
describe your feelings further, like grateful or excited. Even if you don't have an
Apple Watch, you can use the Health app on iPhone and iPad to log your state of
mind. You can see insights, like what's been contributing most to your state of mind,
and how your lifestyle might be playing a role, such as exercise, mindful minutes,
and sleep.
There may be times when it would be helpful to more deeply understand your state
of mind and if you beneﬁt from some additional support. So you'll now be able to
take standardized assessments often used in clinics to answer questions about how
you're feeling right in the Health app, and then see your current risk for depression
or anxiety, to very common and treatable conditions. This will help you understand if

to prioritize mental health to build emotional awareness and resilience by reﬂecting
on your state of mind, and have screening tools and resources to support you on
your overall health journey.
The other important area of focus for us this year is vision health, and speciﬁcally the
reduction of myopia, which is nearsightedness that's caused by physical changes in
the eye. It's the leading cause of vision impairment globally. It's currently estimated
to aﬀect over 30% of the population. And that's expected to grow to 50% by 2050,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Timothy D. Cookimpacting ﬁve billion people. Myopia typically starts in childhood, and there are a
few behaviors that can lower a child's risk of developing it. One is to spend more
time outdoors in daylight. Experts recommend at least 80 to 120 minutes a day, but
it's hard to know if your child has done that. Now Apple Watch can measure the
amount of time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor, and it can be
viewed in the Health app. With family setup, time in daylight can be measured from a
child's Apple Watch even if they don't have their own iPhone.
And with Health Sharing, parents will be able to keep track of it. Another behavior
that can lower myopia risk in kids is to increase the distance at which they view
something, like a device or a book. To help with this, we're introducing a new feature
called Screen Distance. It uses the same TrueDepth camera that powers Face ID on
iPad and iPhone to measure if a child is holding their device too close for an
extended period of time and then encourages them to move their device farther
away. Screen Distance can also help adults reduce digital eye strain. We are thrilled
to provide new ways to track and manage vision health.

Page 24 of 35Alan DyeThanks, Craig. Today we introduced some amazing new Macs and showed you
where we're taking the incredible software platforms that drive our products. It's
already been a big day, but we do have one more thing. This is a day that's been
years in the making, one that I've really been looking forward to. I believe that
augmented reality is a profound technology. Blending digital content with the real
world can unlock experiences like nothing we've ever seen.
So today I'm excited to announce an entirely new AR platform with a revolutionary
new product, and here it is.
(Video Presentation)
Introducing Apple Vision Pro. Vision Pro is a new kind of computer that augments
reality by seamlessly blending the real world with the digital world. It's the ﬁrst Apple
product you look through and nod at. Vision Pro feels familiar, yet it's entirely new.
You can see, hear, and interact with digital content just like it's in your physical space.
And you control Vision Pro using the most natural and intuitive tools: your eyes,
hands, and voice. With Vision Pro, you're no longer limited by a display. Your
surroundings become an inﬁnite canvas. Use your apps anywhere and make them
any size you want. Capture photos and videos, and relive your most important
memories in an entirely new way. Watch your movies, shows, and sports, and
immerse yourself in games on a giant screen surrounded by Spatial Audio. And
connect with people, as if you're sharing the same space. These are just some of the
ways that Vision Pro blends digital content into the space around us.
So in the same way that Mac introduced us to personal computing and iPhone
introduced us to mobile computing, Apple Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial
computing. This marks the beginning of a journey that will bring a new dimension to
powerful personal technology. To tell you about the experience of using Vision Pro,
here's Alan.
{BIO 19177610 <GO>}
Apple Vision Pro allows us the freedom to imagine an experience, unlike anything
we've created before. For the ﬁrst time, we've designed a fully three-dimensional
interface, one magically controlled with just your eyes, hands, and voice. When you
ﬁrst put on Vision Pro, you see your space and everything in it. The home view lives
right in front of you, it's where you ﬁnd all of your apps. It's familiar, yet revolutionary.
The entire interface looks and feels truly present in your room. Every element has
been crafted to have a sense of physicality. They have dimension, respond
dynamically to light, and even cast shadows to help you understand scale and
distance.
Experiences in Vision Pro aren't constrained to the boundaries of a display, they can
freely ﬁll the space around you. It's easy to make apps on any scale, even larger than
life. And you can place apps exactly where you want them, anywhere in your space. It
feels natural, like moving real objects. And launching new apps doesn't take space
from existing ones, they simply occupy a new space, centered around you. There'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 25 of 35something truly extraordinary about seeing your favorite apps and experiences right
there in the room with you. And apps can expand fully into your space, like during a
mindfulness session, where you can create a private moment of calm.
And with Vision Pro, apps and experiences can do something else remarkable. They
can grow beyond the dimensions of your physical room with environments.
Environments extend and transform your space, enabling otherwise impossible
experiences, and they've been captured fully volumetrically. So you can control how
immersed you are by simply turning the Digital Crown. Whether extending a small
portion of your room or being fully immersed within an environment, you can use
these beautiful landscapes to focus, reduce clutter in busy spaces, or as an inspiring
new view.
Every major Apple platform was driven by an innovative new input model. Mac with
the mouse, iPod with the Click Wheel, and iPhone with Multi-Touch. With Vision Pro,
we set the ambitious goal to design an incredibly intuitive input model for spatial
computing, one that could be used without controllers or additional hardware.
Apple Vision Pro relies solely on your eyes, hands, and voice, it's just you and your
content. It's remarkable, and it feels like magic. You browse the system simply by
looking, it's eﬀortless. App icons subtly come to life when you look at them. In fact,
every graphical element has a sense of vitality and responds to your eyes. Simply tap
your ﬁngers together to select and gently ﬂick to scroll.
The combination of hands and eyes together truly feels like magic, as if your mind is
guiding the experience. And we designed every gesture to be as subtle and natural
as possible, so you can keep your hands where they're most comfortable, like resting
in your lap, or on the sofa. And the entire experience is made better with voice. With
Vision Pro, you can look at a search ﬁeld and just start dictating. Voice input has
never been this seamless. And with Siri, you can quickly open or close apps, play
media, and more.
Another foundational design goal for Vision Pro was that you're never isolated from
the people around you. You can see them, and they can see you. Your eyes are a
critical indicator of connection and emotion, so Vision Pro displays your eyes when
someone is nearby. It's incredible. This breakthrough innovation is called EyeSight.
Not only does Eyesight reveal your eyes, it provides important cues to others about
what you're focused on. This is how it looks when using apps. And this changes
when you're fully immersed in an experience, sending a clear signal to those around
you that you can't see them at the moment. But even if you are fully immersed,
Apple Vision Pro helps you stay connected to those around you. When someone is
nearby, they will appear in your view.
And Vision Pro will simultaneously reveal your eyes to them. The spatial experiences
of Vision Pro seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds, transforming what's
possible. Whether at home or at work, it unlocks magical new experiences.
To show you what it's like to use Apple Vision Pro, here's Allessandra.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Let's see Apple Vision Pro in action for work. Vision Pro has the apps you love and
count on every day. But now, these apps are freed from the conﬁnes of a display and
live in your space, transforming how you use notes, messages, keynote, Safari,
FaceTime, and more. And of course, Vision Pro is always in sync with your iPhone,
iPad, and Mac. All your notes, messages, photos, and documents stay up to date
automatically with iCloud.
This is what you see with Vision Pro. Your entire world is a canvas for apps, so you can
arrange them anywhere at the perfect size for whatever you're doing. Let's look ﬁrst
at Safari. Browsing the web is fantastic, web pages are large, making it amazing to
watch videos or read articles. As you scroll down the page, small text is crisp and
easy to read at any angle. And Safari expands so you can see all your open tabs. You
can arrange multiple apps around you in space, however you want. Layer them on
top of each other, or place them above, below, or to the sides of other apps. Like
here, where you simply turn your head to change focus from Safari to work on your
Freeform Board. And the content within your apps isn't limited to two dimensions.
You can receive a 3D object in messages, pull it out, and look at it from every angle,
just as if it was there in front of you. It's magical. Because you can see the world
clearly while wearing Vision Pro, you remain present in your space and connected to
others. And it's easy to interact with the world around you.
So with Apple Vision Pro, you can create your perfect setup for whatever you're
doing, and multitask with ease. You can review your to-do list in notes, research your
next trip in Safari, and discuss plans with friends in messages, all while listening to
your favorite playlist in Apple Music. Use the virtual keyboard or dictation to type.
With Vision Pro, you have the room to do it all. Vision Pro also works seamlessly with
familiar Bluetooth accessories, like Magic Trackpad and Magic Keyboard, which are
great when you're writing a long e-mail or working on a spreadsheet in numbers.
And you can even bring your Mac wirelessly into Apple Vision Pro just by looking at
it.
Place your Mac screen wherever you want and expand it, giving you an enormous,
private, and portable 4K display. Vision Pro is engineered to let you use your Mac
seamlessly within your ideal workspace. So you can dial in the White Sands [ph]
environment, and use other apps in Vision Pro side-by-side with your Mac. This
powerful combination of capabilities makes Apple Vision Pro perfect for the oﬃce, or
for when you're working remote. Because Vision Pro is great when you're traveling. It
makes it easy to stay connected and collaborate with colleagues. For example, you
can collaborate remotely with your team on the same document.
And of course, Apple Vision Pro has an amazing FaceTime experience. FaceTime
now becomes spatial, taking advantage of the room around you. You can join a
group call and see everyone (inaudible). As new people join, FaceTime simply
expands. With Spatial Audio built right into Vision Pro, you hear each person's voice
coming from the location of their tile, making group conversations easier and more
natural. And within FaceTime, you can share apps with others, and use themFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

Page 27 of 35En Kellytogether with SharePlay. And you continue to see everyone in large video tiles while
sharing an app. This is powerful for so many activities, like reviewing a presentation,
sharing photos and videos or watching a movie together. FaceTime on Vision Pro
works seamlessly with other Apple devices like iPhone, iPad, and Mac, so everyone
can join in.
For work, Apple Vision Pro gives you powerful ways to connect with others and the
freedom to create the ultimate workspace for whatever you want to do, wherever
you are.
To tell you about how Vision Pro transforms experiences at home, here is En.
Apple Vision Pro brings the power of spatial computing to so many of the things you
do at home. It redeﬁnes how you can relive precious moments in time because you
can capture and experience photos and videos in magical new ways. Select a photo,
and watch as the room dims around you. Your library of photos and videos looks
incredible on Vision Pro with brilliant color and spectacular detail. Make it as big as
your room, or zoom in, letting you feel even closer to that moment. And panoramas
are stunning.
In Vision Pro, every panorama you've ever taken on your iPhone now expands and
wraps around you life-size. You feel like you're standing right where you took them.
Because of the powerful capabilities of Vision Pro, we were able to go even further,
adding a new dimension to photos and videos. Vision Pro is Apple's ﬁrst 3D camera,
it lets you capture and relive your memories in 3D with Spatial Audio. It's magical
and impossible to fully appreciate on a two-dimensional screen. It lets you feel like
you're right back in a moment in time. Imagine being able to relive a special
moment from your daughter's birthday. The incredible depth of this spatial video
makes it feel like you can peer into that memory. It's easy to capture a spatial photo
or video with just the press of a button. And EyeSight makes it clear to those around
you when you are capturing one. You can capture a spatial video of a fun moment
with your kids to share it with your family or to experience all over again for years to
come. Spatial photos and videos bring you closer than ever to the moments and
people you care about.
Apple Vision Pro also delivers an extraordinary entertainment experience. We love
watching a great movie in a dark theater with incredible sound. Vision Pro lets you
have this, and so much more, with a spatial cinema that transforms any space, like
this apartment. You have a gorgeous screen, you can adjust to the perfect size. Vision
Pro automatically dims the surrounding light, casts a beautiful glow into your space,
and surrounds you with Spatial Audio. And for a super cinematic experience, open
an environment like Mount Hood to scale your screen beyond the dimensions of
your room, so it feels 100 feet wide, giving you the most majestic viewing experience
ever.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 28 of 35Timothy D. Cook
Robert IgerAnd with the Cinema Environment, turn any room into your own personal movie
theater. This environment lets you focus fully on the movie, and is built to give you a
fantastic viewing experience that you can take anywhere, like on an airplane. Use
your AirPods, sit back, and dial in an environment, and you can enjoy a movie while
the seats and sounds around you disappear. It's amazing.
And of course, your favorite movies and TV shows from Apple TV+ and other content
services will be available on Vision Pro. This amazing cinematic experience goes
beyond two dimensions. You can watch 3D movies as well. In Vision Pro, 3D movies
have incredible depth and crisp motion. Although impossible to see on a 2D screen,
it feels as if you are looking right into the movie itself. There is no other device in the
world that can deliver this quality of 3D movie experience.
And beyond video, you can experience interactive storytelling in amazing new ways.
Like with Encounter Dinosaurs, where you can look back into a prehistoric time
seeing dinosaurs interact right in front of you, in 3D with Spatial Audio. In addition to
watching movies, you can play your favorite Apple Arcade games, like NBA 2K23 on
a screen as large as you want, with incredible audio and game controller support.
There will be over 100 Arcade titles available for you to play on day one. This is just
the start of how gaming will evolve on Vision Pro. Whether watching a season ﬁnale,
3D movie, or immersive video, Vision Pro is the best way to enjoy your favorite
entertainment. And with spatial photos and videos, you can capture and relive
cherished moments in magical new ways.

{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Thank you, Bob! We are excited to work together to see all of the amazing things
Disney will do with the capabilities of Apple Vision Pro. These groundbreaking
innovations required remarkable breakthroughs in design and technology.
To tell you about the incredible new design of Vision Pro, here's Richard.
{BIO 19177604 <GO>}
It's not often we get the chance to deﬁne an entirely new category to establish the
principles that will inﬂuence the design for years to come. Apple Vision Pro is the
result of decades of our collective experience, designing high-performance
products like Mac, mobile products like iPhone, and wearable products like Apple
Watch. All that learning has culminated in the most ambitious product we've ever
created. To achieve our goals of performance, mobility, and wearability, we utilized
the most advanced lightest-weight materials possible. The entire front of the product
is a singular piece of three-dimensionally formed and laminated glass. It's polished
to an optical surface allowing it to act as a lens for EyeSight and a wide array of
cameras and sensors that need to have a view of the world.
The glass ﬂows seamlessly into a lightweight frame that houses a button to capture
spatial photos and video, and a Digital Crown that summons the home view and
rotates to control immersion levels of environments. It's machined from a custom
aluminum alloy that gently curves to wrap around your face. This frame completes
the form and is the primary structural element of Vision Pro, holding and protecting
the components inside.
This surprisingly compact form encapsulates an extraordinary amount of technology:
displays, cameras, sensors, and even a high-performance computer, all kept cool by
an eﬃcient thermal design that quietly draws air through the system. In contrast to
the high-precision front of the product, we created a rich combination of soft textile
parts, that provide comfort and wearability. We studied thousands of heads to get a
detailed understanding of the huge variation in cheek width, face angle, and head
shape. This led us to design a modular system that allows us to tailor the product to
ﬁt you perfectly.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 30 of 35Michael RockwellThe LightSeal [ph] comes in a range of diﬀerent shapes and sizes, and ﬂexes to
conform to your face, delivering a really precise ﬁt. Extending from the frame are
ﬂexible straps that conform to the head, ensuring the audio pods remain close to
your ears. They deliver rich Spatial Audio while keeping you aware of your
surroundings. The headband is 3D knitted as a single piece to create a unique rib
structure that provides cushioning, breathability, and stretch. The band attaches with
a simple and secure mechanism, allowing you to change it for a diﬀerent size, or
even a diﬀerent kind of band.
An easy-to-reach adjustment dial helps you secure the device comfortably and
enables micro-adjustments during use. For those who wear glasses, we teamed up
with Zeiss [ph] to create custom optical inserts that magnetically attach to the lenses.
They accommodate a huge range of vision correction without compromising display
performance, or eye-tracking accuracy.
Vision Pro supports all-day use when plugged in, and up to two hours of use with the
external high-performance battery. A separate battery means that you don't wear
that weight on your head. The soft aluminum form slips easily into your pocket and
connects via a supple woven cable. So that's the design of Vision Pro, our ﬁrst-ever
wearable, spatial computer. An incredibly capable and powerful tool that blends
digital content with your world.
To tell you about the technology we developed to enable these extraordinary
experiences, here's Mike.
{BIO 3482166 <GO>}
Creating our ﬁrst spatial computer required invention across nearly every facet of the
system. Apple Vision Pro needed to deliver huge amounts of compute performance
in a compact, wearable form factor. It needed an advanced real-time sensor system,
as well as incredibly convincing Spatial Audio. And of course, technological
breakthroughs in displays. Your eyes see the world with incredible resolution and
color ﬁdelity. To give your eyes what they need, we had to invent a display system
with a huge number of pixels, but in a small form factor. A display where the pixels
would disappear, creating a smooth continuous image. It starts with a micro-OLED
Apple silicon backplane that ﬁts 64 pixels in the space of a single iPhone pixel,
they're just 7.5 microns wide.
Combined, Vision Pro has 23 million pixels across two panels that are each just the
size of a postage stamp. That's more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye. To magnify
these panels and wrap them around you, a sophisticated lens solution was needed.
We designed a custom three-element lens with incredible sharpness and clarity. The
result is a display that's everywhere you look, delivering jaw-dropping experiences
that are simply not possible with any other device. It enables video to be rendered at
true 4K resolution, with wide color and high dynamic range, all at massive scale. And
ﬁne text looks super sharp from any angle. This is critical for browsing the web,
reading messages, and writing e-mails.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 31 of 35Now let's talk about audio. What you hear is critical to how you perceive the world.
We wanted sound to feel like it was coming from the space around you, blending
with the real world. So Vision Pro features an entirely new Spatial Audio system.
Personalized sound is delivered through the integrated dual-driver audio pods,
allowing us to create ambient Spatial Audio, where your brain is totally convinced
that sounds are coming from the environment around you.
Beyond personalizing sound to you, Vision Pro matches the sound to your room by
analyzing the features and materials of your space, using a technique called audio
ray tracing. Precisely matching sound to your room is just one example of how Vision
Pro makes use of its advanced sensor array. This system also provides high-
resolution video to the displays, enables precise head and hand tracking, performs
real-time 3D mapping, and more. A high-performance eye-tracking system uses
high-speed cameras and a ring of LEDs that project invisible light patterns onto the
eyes for responsive, intuitive input. It's so precise, it completely frees up your hands
from needing clumsy hardware controllers. Processing all the information from these
sensors, while simultaneously delivering an ultra-high resolution experience,
requires a system with massive sustained computational power. It also has to remain
cool and quiet.
At the foundation of this system is Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design. It starts
with the Apple M2 chip, it delivers phenomenal compute performance while
allowing Vision Pro to maintain a comfortable temperature and run virtually silent.
Running in parallel is a brand-new chip called R1. This specialized chip was designed
speciﬁcally for the challenging task of real-time sensor processing. It processes input
from 12 cameras, ﬁve sensors, and six microphones.
In other head-worn systems, latency between sensors and displays can contribute to
motion discomfort. R1 virtually eliminates lag, streaming new images to the displays
within 12 milliseconds. That's eight times faster than the blink of an eye. So while M2
ensures that Apple Vision Pro delivers incredible standalone performance, R1
ensures that experiences feel like they're taking place right in front of your eyes. We
also thought hard about how others can interact with you while wearing Vision Pro.
EyeSight utilizes a unique curved OLED panel with a lenticular lens to project the
correct perspective of your eyes to each person looking at you. The result is a 3D
display that makes the device look transparent. For digital communication like
FaceTime, Vision Pro goes beyond conveying just your eyes and creates an authentic
representation of you. This was one of the most diﬃcult challenges we faced in
building Apple Vision Pro.
There is no video conferencing camera looking at you, and even if there were, you're
wearing something over your eyes. Using our most advanced machine learning
techniques, we created a novel solution. After a quick enrollment process using the
front sensors on Vision Pro, the system uses an advanced encoder-decoder neural
network to create your digital Persona. This network was trained on a diverse group
of thousands of individuals. It delivers a natural representation, which dynamically
matches your facial and hand movement.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 32 of 35Susan PrescottWith your Persona, you can communicate with over a billion FaceTime-capable
devices. When viewed by someone in another Vision Pro, your Persona has volume
and depth not possible in traditional video. None of this advanced technology could
come to life, without a powerful operating system called Vision OS. It's built on the
foundation of the decades of engineering innovation in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. To
that foundation, we added a host of new capabilities to support the low-latency
requirements of spatial computing, such as a new real-time execution engine, that
guarantees performance-critical workloads, a dynamically foveated rendering
pipeline that delivers maximum image quality to exactly where your eyes are looking
for every single frame, a ﬁrst-of-its-kind multi-app 3D engine, that allows diﬀerent
apps to run simultaneously in the same simulation, and importantly, the existing
application frameworks were extended to natively support spatial experiences.
Vision OS is the ﬁrst operating system designed from the ground up for spatial
computing. All of the incredible innovations in Vision Pro make it truly a one-of-a-
kind device. There is simply nothing else like it. Apple Vision Pro is more than just a
new product. It's the start of an entirely new platform.
To tell you more about what this means for developers, here's Susan.
{BIO 21357363 <GO>}
We've been preparing for this day for years, and we're really excited about the
possibilities Vision Pro opens up for developers. Vision Pro lets developers
reimagine existing apps and create brand-new ones. Spatial experiences can take
many forms and can include 3D objects that look and feel real. We've given a few
developers an early look at Vision Pro to see what they could do, and they created
some apps that are truly incredible. Complete HeartX creates an interactive 3D
beating heart, giving students a whole new perspective on the body's most
important function.
JigSpace lets designers collaborate to review a concept, like the design of the Alfa
Romeo F1 car. And businesses can use stages from PTC to review and approve a new
production line before manufacturing begins. Mix your favorite tracks with djay, with
a reimagined spatial interface. And with Sky Guide you are transported into your
own personal planetarium, with views you can't see with the naked eye. And Vision
Pro is amazing for everyday productivity too. Microsoft apps like Excel, Word, and
Teams make full use of the expansive canvas and sharp text rendering of Vision Pro.
And popular video conferencing apps can leverage your digital Persona to make
collaborating easy on this device. And of course, our developer tools have been
built with Vision Pro in mind. Developers can use familiar tools and frameworks like
Xcode, SwiftUI, RealityKit, and ARKit, to make new apps for Vision Pro. And to
streamline the preparation of 3D content for spatial apps, we built Reality Composer
Pro, which makes it easy to assemble complex scenes with realistic objects. The same
frameworks available in iPadOS and iOS are also included in Vision OS. This means
hundreds of thousands of iPad and iPhone apps will be available on Vision Pro at
launch.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 33 of 35Michael RockwellSo you can use apps like Adobe Lightroom on a massive screen and easily control
these apps with just your eyes and hands. We know there is a community of
developers who have been building incredible 3D apps for years. And today, we are
excited to share that we've been working with Unity to bring those apps to Vision
Pro. So popular Unity-based games and apps can gain full access to Vision OS
features such as pass-through, high-resolution rendering, and native gestures. And
because these Unity apps are running natively on Apple Vision Pro, they can sit side-
by-side, rendered simultaneously with other Vision OS apps.
And Apple Vision Pro will have a brand-new App Store, where users can discover
and download all the apps built for Vision OS, as well as compatible iPad and iPhone
apps. We'll share more about our tools for developers and everything they need to
kick-start development this afternoon in the Platforms State of the Union. We can't
wait to see what developers will do with this groundbreaking platform.
Now, back to Mike.
{BIO 3482166 <GO>}
We've been building towards this moment for years. Our work together with Unity to
deeply support their tools, combined with the world-class rendering of Vision OS
and powerful displays, makes Apple Vision Pro an incredible platform for game
developers. Our amazing developer and app ecosystem is one of the reasons
people love their Apple products. Another is the relentless focus we place on privacy
and security. And that starts the moment you put on Apple Vision Pro, where it
authenticates you with a secure, yet eﬀortless system called Optic ID. This new
system uses the uniqueness of your iris, which is distinct, even with identical twins, to
instantly unlock Vision Pro. Optic ID data is encrypted, never leaves your device, and
like Face ID, is only accessible to the Secure Enclave processor.
Optic ID works seamlessly with features like Apple Pay, App Store purchase, and
Password AutoFill. We also engineered privacy into Vision Pro in some important
ways. For example, where you look is very personal. It can give away something
about what you're thinking. In Apple Vision Pro, where you look, stays private. Eye
input is isolated to a separate background process, so apps and websites can't see
where you are looking. Only when you tap your ﬁngers do results get
communicated, just like a mouse click or tap on other Apple devices. And camera
data is processed at the system level, so individual apps don't need to see your
surroundings. You can enjoy the experiences in Vision Pro, knowing our world-class
security and privacy features are right there with you. So that's Apple Vision Pro.
With the most advanced displays we've ever made, a revolutionary Spatial Audio
system, two powerful Apple silicon chips, a groundbreaking spatial operating
system, and a gorgeous design made from aerospace-grade alloys, Apple Vision Pro
is the most advanced personal electronics device ever.
In fact, there is so much invention in Vision Pro that we ﬁled over 5,000 patents
during its development. It's hard to believe all the capabilities Vision Pro delivers areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05

you replace a desk full of monitors with inﬁnite (inaudible) estate, so you can be
more productive than ever. It delivers stunning entertainment and Personalized
Spatial Audio. It provides powerful new ways to collaborate and stay connected. And
for capturing and reliving memories, Vision Pro is simply in a class of its own.
If you purchased a new state-of-the-art TV, surround sound system, powerful
computer with multiple high-deﬁnition displays, high-end camera, and more, you still
would not have come close to what Vision Pro delivers. Apple Vision Pro starts at
$3,499. It will be available early next year on apple.com and at Apple retail stores in
the U.S., with more countries coming later next year.
WWDC provides the ideal time to share in-depth information about this incredible
new platform with developers. And we will work with them over the coming months
to create new and innovative apps for the launch of Vision Pro and beyond. And the
Apple Store was built for moments like this. You will be able to engage with our team
to learn more about this new platform, get a demo, and personalize your ﬁt for
Vision Pro. We can't wait for you to experience Apple Vision Pro.
Now, back to Tim.

Thank you, Mike, and thanks to all of our presenters. And a big thanks to everyone at
Apple who made today possible. This has been a huge day. We introduced the all-
new 15-inch MacBook Air, the world's best 15-inch notebook, as well as the two most
powerful Macs we've ever made, Mac Studio and Mac Pro, all of them powered by
Apple silicon. And we showed you where we're taking our amazing software
platforms: iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and the software that powers home and
audio. And of course, we announced Apple Vision Pro. There are certain products
that shift the way we look at technology and the role it plays in our lives.
We believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary product with the performance,
immersion, and capability that only Apple can deliver. Apple Vision Pro, together
with Vision OS, introduces an entirely new spatial computing platform. A platform
that presents incredible possibilities for our users and exciting new opportunities for
our developers. And this is just the beginning. We made an ad for Apple Vision Pro,
and I'd like to share it with you now.
(Video Presentation)
I hope you're as excited about Apple Vision Pro as we are. You'll be hearing much
more about it, as well as Vision OS and our other platforms throughout the
conference.
Thank you so much for joining us. Have a great week and a great WWDC.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-05
