Presentation
Thank you for joining us today to discuss Facebook's Acquisition of Oculus. Now I'd
like to turn the call over to Deborah Crawford, Director of Investor Relations at
Facebook.
{BIO 5934723 <GO>}
Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to the call. And thank you for joining us on
such short notice.
Joining me on the call today are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook; Brendan Iribe,
CEO and co-founder of Oculus; and David Ebersman, CFO of Facebook.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our
remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results may diﬀer
materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause these results to diﬀer materially are set forth in today's press
release and on our annual report on Form 10-K ﬁled with the SEC.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25

{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Thanks, Deborah. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm excited to
announce that Facebook has reached an agreement to acquire Oculus VR, the
leader in virtual reality technology. Our mission in Facebook is to give people the
power to share. And make the world more open and connected.
For the past few years, this has mostly meant building mobile apps that help you
share with the people you care about. We've made a lot of progress on mobile. As of
last week, there are now more than 1 billion people actively using our mobile apps
alone.
More than 20% of the time that people spend in apps on mobile phones is using
Facebook services. And more than half of our ad revenue comes from mobile.
We still have a lot of work to do on mobile. But at this point we feel strong enough in
our position that strategically we also want to start focusing on building the next
major computing platform that will come after mobile.
The history of our industry is that every 10 or 15 years, there's a new major computing
platform, whether it's the PC, the web, or now mobile. History suggests that there will
be more platforms to come and that whoever builds and deﬁnes these, will not only
shape all of the experiences that our industry built. But also beneﬁt ﬁnancially and
strategically.
Mobile is the platform of today. And now we're starting to also get ready for the
platforms of tomorrow. To me, by far the most exciting future platform is around
vision, or modifying what you see to create augmented and immersive experiences.
Today's acquisition is a long-term bet on the future of computing. I believe Oculus
can be one of the platforms of this future. Oculus builds virtual reality technology
with the Oculus Rift headset and the unique software platform and services around
it.
When you put on their goggles, you enter a completely immersive computer-
generated environment, like a game, or a movie scene or a place far away.
The incredible thing about the technology is that you feel like you're actually present
in another place with other people. It's diﬀerent from anything I've ever experienced
in my life and many people who try it also say the same thing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 3 of 15Oculus's mission is to enable you to experience the impossible. Their technology
opens up the possibility of completely new kinds of experiences.
Immersive gaming is the ﬁrst big opportunity and Oculus already has big plans here
they won't be changing. The beta version of the Rift is highly anticipated by the
gaming community. And Oculus has already received orders for more than 75,000
development kits, which is pretty crazy by itself.
These developers are mostly gamers. So this is a strong signal of how much people
want to develop games for Oculus and how excited they are about it as a gaming
platform.
We're going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop
partnerships to support more games and accelerate their plans. And they'll continue
operating independently within Facebook to do this.
But gaming is just the start. After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for
many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court-side seat at a game, studying in a
classroom of students and teachers all over the world, consulting with a doctor face
to face, or going shopping in a virtual store where you can touch and explore the
products you're interested in, just by putting on goggles in your own home.
This is really a new social platform. By feeling truly present, you can share
unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing
not just moments with your friends online. But entire experiences and adventures.
These are just some of the potential use cases.
But if you think about the social applications alone, this can change the way we
communicate with our friends, families and colleagues. Little details like being able
to make eye contact with someone with zero latency makes you feel like you're really
present together.
Oculus has the potential to be the most social platform ever. Today, social networks
are about sharing moments. And tomorrow, they'll be about sharing experiences.
We think people will love using this technology and we're making a long-term bet
that immersive, virtual and augmented reality will become a part of people's daily
lives.
So that's where we see the opportunities ahead for Oculus in future of computing.
I'm really excited to have this opportunity to work with Brendan and his entire team.
They've already achieved signiﬁcant breakthroughs with just a small team. And we're
looking forward to helping them scale their eﬀorts over the coming years.
Now, before I close, I just want to make one more point. For almost the last year, I've
framed our strategy as three high-level goals over the next ten years; connectingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 4 of 15Brendan Iribeeveryone, one; two, understanding the world; and three, building the knowledge
economy.
With this acquisition, now each of those initiatives has an ambitious long-term bet
associated with it, in addition to our important near-term work as well.
For number one, connecting everyone, for the long term we have Internet.org, our
initiative to make free basic internet services available to everyone in the world. And
for connecting everyone, we also have our near-term eﬀorts for our messaging and
growth.
For number two, understanding the world, we have our ambitious AI Research
Group, which is trying to build a uniﬁed model of how every person (inside) the
world is connected to each other. In the near term, our eﬀorts here are in search and
newsfeed. And will help your network surface more useful information to you.
And for number three, building the knowledge economy, that's really about building
future technology platforms. And we now have Oculus joining us, which long term
can be one of the next important computing platforms. And of course we will
continue to focus on our extremely important work of building out our advertising
platform as well, as part of this.
So with this in place, you should now have a clearer view of what our full strategy
looks like over the next three, ﬁve and ten years. I look forward to updating you on
our progress in each of these areas during our regular quarterly updates.
Thanks for joining today. And now I want to turn it over to Brendan.
{BIO 17301790 <GO>}
Thanks, Mark. We're thrilled that Oculus VR is joining forces with Facebook and we're
really looking forward to working together to create the best virtual reality platform
in the world.
In 2012, we started Oculus with the vision of making incredible, aﬀordable and
ubiquitous virtual reality available to the world. Virtual reality deﬁnitely sounds like
something out of science ﬁction. But science ﬁction has a habit of becoming fact.
And we believe that virtual reality will connect people in ways that they never before
thought.
VR opens up entirely new opportunities. They jet a new generation of creative,
compelling and engaging services that will fundamentally change the way we live,
play, share. And communicate.
We started with a focus on next-generation gaming. Now we're teaming up with
Facebook to invent the future. Facebook and Oculus share a common vision for the
opportunities that virtual reality presents to the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 5 of 15David EbersmanFacebook's mission is to connect the world. And Oculus is focused on developing a
new medium that allows people to connect in entirely new ways.
A few months ago, when Mark and his team came down to visit our oﬃces, it was
immediately clear that the two teams share a passion for building a new world-
changing communication platform. Moreover, our teams are culturally aligned with a
focus on driving impact, moving fast. And hiring the best and brightest.
As Facebook has grown, they continue to invest in eﬀorts like the Open Compute
Project, their initiative that aims to drive innovation and reduce the cost of
computing infrastructure across the industry.
This is a team that's used to making bold bets on the future. All of this gives us the
perfect foundation for collaboration. Facebook brings greater scale, with unique
resources and capabilities that accelerate virtual reality's future.
By opening doors to new partnerships, helping develop the core functionality of our
product. And supporting us with recruiting, marketing and infrastructure, the Oculus
team can focus on doing what we do best, solving hard problems and delivering on
the dream of virtual reality.
We have a thriving community of developers and content creators who are building
for the Oculus platform. With more than 75,000 orders for developer kits received so
far, we are dedicated to making the Oculus Rift the best virtual reality platform in the
world. And that vision depends on the creativity and imagination of our incredible
community.
Today's announcement is about bringing even greater energy and resources to our
work. So that we're in an even better position to deliver our platforms to more
people. We're looking forward to building the future with Facebook.
Thank you.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Thank you, Brendan. And good afternoon, everyone. This is David. I now want to start
by brieﬂy reviewing the details of the transaction.
Facebook will acquire Oculus for a total of approximately $2 billion, made up of
$400 million in cash. And 23.1 million Facebook shares.
The agreement also provides for an additional $30 million earn-out to be paid in a
mix of cash and stock-- $300 million, I'm sorry. $300 million earn-out to be paid in a
mix of cash and stock if Oculus achieves certain milestones.
The transaction is expected to close in the Second Quarter of 2014.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25

Q - Mark MayIn the near term, Oculus isn't expected to have a material impact on Facebook's
revenues.
As Mark said, we're very excited to announce this acquisition. In the next 10 years, we
know that the platforms on which we operate will evolve. We see great promise in
virtual reality as a potentially important new platform and we're very impressed by
the leadership position that Oculus is establishing in this space, as evidenced by the
striking progress they've already made and the strong interest in their product by
the developer community.
We believe the combined strength of Facebook and Oculus will help drive the
broader development and adoption of virtual reality technology, enabling over time
a range of services including and beyond games. And making these services
relevant and important for millions of people.
Facebook will bring our capabilities, along with our close relationships with a broad
range of developers, to help accelerate Oculus's growth.
Over the past few months, we've announced two important strategic acquisitions,
WhatsApp and Oculus. These are unique assets that ﬁt well with our strategic goals.
They build out the portfolio of investments we're making to drive future growth and
to ensure that we're well-positioned strategically to create value for our shareholders
over the next decade.
Now, let's open the call for questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 5934723 <GO>}
Operator, we're ready for the ﬁrst question.
Mark May
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Some of the questions that we're getting from
investors after this announcement is, clearly Facebook has been making a few big,
bold bets in the last couple of years; this acquisition, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. But
the questions I'm getting are; can you point me to some of the data points or
milestones?
Even if early on, the management is executing on some of the early strategic
initiatives or outcomes that you're looking to get out if these deals. So I was just
wondering if maybe with Instagram, we're a couple years into that deal. Can youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 7 of 15A - David Ebersman
A - Mark Zuckerberggive investors some conﬁdence that the execution and some of the reasons why you
bought that company have begun to play out, to give us some comfort that, as you
look to do more big, bold bets like this, that we can have conﬁdence in the
management's ability to execute on these large deals? Thanks.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
Thanks, Mark. This is David. I can go ﬁrst. I think with Instagram, the priority for the
Company from the beginning was to continue to grow the networks that they were
building at that time, which we felt had the opportunity to grow from 20 million
active users at the time we announced the deal, to many fold bigger than that. And
we were planning or hoping they would get as big as 100 million people using the
service.
What you've seen in the two years since we announced the transaction is they've
done, I think, considerably better than we anticipated or expected in terms of
growing the size and importance of their network over time.
So we obviously have other objectives for each transaction. It's going have a
diﬀerent set of goals associated with it. But we think Instagram is really a nice proof
point of the eﬀectiveness of the strategy we've taken in terms of really leading these
companies to continue executing on their roadmap, taking advantage of Facebook
only in areas that can really help them to grow more eﬀectively.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Yes, I mean I'll add a little to that. Like David said, whenâ€”our thesis, when we
agreed to acquire Instagram is that one day we thought it could reach 100 million
people or more. And within the ﬁrst two years of working with them, we're already at
200 million.
So that I think, that was an initial test case for us, because before that we had no
experience with having a company join us and continue to operate independently.
So the overwhelming success in the partnership that we've been able to forge with
Kevin at Instagram and showing how that works has really been a great example for
how we want to do things going forward.
It's hard to comment on what we expect will happen with WhatsApp and now
Oculus, because neither of those deals have closed yet. But the theory for
WhatsApp, which I think is extremely likely and compelling, is that they're on a path
to have a billion people using their product in the near future. And there just are not
that many services in the world that can reach a billion people. And all the ones that
do just have to be incredibly valuable.
Similarly, Oculus, there are not that many companies that are built on core
technology that can be the next major computing platform. And the Oculus team is
the clear leader here. I mean theyâ€”the quality of their product, even their
development kit, I mean they probably could ship it as a consumer thing if they
wanted, because it's so high quality and so much better than anything that anyoneFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25

Q - Mark Mahaney
A - Brendan Iribehas built before. And all the best people in the ﬁeld come to work at Oculus,
because this is where you go if you want to work on this technology.
So in each of these cases, there's a clear thesis. With Instagram, we're already way
ahead of where we hoped to be. With WhatsApp, the theory is we're going to get to
a billion people. And with Oculus, it's that they're the clear leader in something that
has the potential to be the next important, or one of the next most important
computing platforms.
{BIO 4280734 <GO>}
Great. Thanks.
{BIO 5934723 <GO>}
Next questions, please.
Mark Mahaney
{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Great. Thanks. Hi. Brendan, can I ask you a question? I know you talked about
theâ€”the press release talks about the applications for virtual reality technology
beyond gaming to be in nascent stages. But as you have built out the (technical
diﬃculty) over the next two or three years, what do you think will be the most
interesting commercial, social, industrial, whatever applications? What do you think
is closest to hitting-- for the ire to hit the ﬁre? Thanks.
{BIO 17301790 <GO>}
Sure. Thank you. So we started in gaming. And that's obviously where Oculus got its
kickoﬀ. John Carmack, who is the creator of Doom and Quake, was one of the ﬁrst to
create the prototype with Palmer Luckey. We got involved shortly after that and we
really had this vision to where it could go with immersive gaming and long-term
entertainment.
Then as we started developing virtual reality. And as we actually got a lot of the hard
problems solved, we started to realize that virtual reality, it was going to be a lot
about gaming. And it was going to be a lot about entertainment and diﬀerent
aspects of that, variations of that.
But something that we didn't expect in the beginning that became really obvious,
was how big the potential was for the social experience. And when you truly feel, in
virtual reality, that you're actually present in another space. And look around and the
brain is just completely convinced that it's comfortable and it's Okay. But it's an
entirely new, impossible place. Something fundamentally changes and you start to
realize how big this can be.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)

Operator
Q - Brian Pitz
A - Mark ZuckerbergThen, in that same sense of presence, in that same sense of a new space, if you can
see somebody else, if you can actually look at them and your brain believes that they
are right in front of you, you're not looking through a screen or a 2D window. But
they're actually right in front of you. You know, you get the goose bumps. You do
really start to realize just how big this can be and how big social and
communications, how big of an impact it'll have on those industries.
And as we realized that. And as we were talking to Mark and the Facebook team, it
just became incredibly obvious and exciting for us to partner up and to create that
new social platform.
{BIO 3027058 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, Brendan.
{BIO 5934723 <GO>}
Next question?
Brian Pitz.
{BIO 6994205 <GO>}
Great. Thanks. You brieﬂy mentioned some other devices out there. We've recently
seen the Sony VR headset for the PS4 and there's been some chatter around
Microsoft maybe working on a similar product. Any concerns around new upcoming
technologies that maybe we haven't seen in the marketplace?
Then just a couple of housekeepingâ€”when does the full-blown headset actually
launch? And will Oculus actually get any Board seats on Facebook? Thanks.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Sure. So what we've seen is the Oculus product that they have now is way ahead of
anything else that's out there. I mean Sony I think has demoed something very early.
Microsoft hasn't even got to the point where they have anything to demo yet.
And not only that. But the team is way further ahead in terms of just having so many
of the most talented people at Oculus, that we feel good about that.
The other thing that I think is important here is that in order to build a really big
computing platform, there are a bunch of important use cases that you need to
support. So whether you're looking at mobile and how people spend their time, or
PC as before, we've measured this more with mobile. But what we see is about 40%
of the time that people spend overall is in gaming. And about 40% is also spent on
social communication. So about half of that is in Facebook, which is nice.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25

Q - Brian Wieser
A - Mark ZuckerbergAnd what we basically believe is that unlike the Microsoft or Sony pure console
strategies, if you want to make this a real computing platform, you need to fuse both
of those things together. And with thatâ€”when Brendan and I were talking about
this and what Oculus is doing and how Facebook can add to that, that I think was the
opportunity that we saw in working together, is to have this transcend the traditional
console opportunity, to really make it more of a ubiquitous computing platform.
And (inaudible) these two companies. They're really the only ones that are set up to
have that happen.
{BIO 17301790 <GO>}
Yes, I couldn't agree more.
{BIO 5934723 <GO>}
Then the launch, there was another question about when we can give a launch;
(inaudible) answer that question and comment.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
We don't have anything to say on that now. There are development kits. You can
order them. They're good.
{BIO 17301790 <GO>}
Really good.
{BIO 5934723 <GO>}
Okay, Operator, next question please.
Brian Wieser, Pivotal
{BIO 16451167 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have a more general philosophical question.
How do you tend to think about M&A and the buy-versus-build consideration? I
mean you mentioned that they're ahead with the technology. But we also talked
about this being sort of a very long time horizon issue. So to the extent that you
could develop internally, I'm just wondering how you think about that more
philosophically. Not necessarily just with Oculus.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Well in this case, the analysis, we did think about what would happen if we tried to
build it from scratch. And the ﬁrst thing that we realized is, in addition to being many
years behind where they are in technology, they already have all the good people in
the industry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 11 of 15A - David Ebersman
A - Deborah CrawfordSo this is not a thing that, at least in terms of really intense graphics systems and
hardware hacking that on consumer electronics that Facebook has done in the past.
So this is a part of the culture that we needed to build out.
What we started thinking about that. And reallyâ€”I mean the way that I started this
process was thinking about now we have this strong position on mobile and we're
feeling increasingly good about that. And we have this position now where we feel
like we should be looking ahead in thinking about what the next platforms are going
to be.
Then we kind of backed into that from there. And decided Okay, well we think vision
is going to be the next really big platform. It might take ﬁve or ten years to get there,
just kind of like how the ﬁrst smartphones were really introduced in about 2003 and
then only reached a billion people about 10 years later. So we were thinking about
what the next platforms are going to be.
Then from there we kind of backed intoâ€”well, all right. Well if we really want to be
able to help push this forward, this is the realâ€”this is the team that we want to work
with they're years ahead. So that actually became a pretty clear decision from our
point.
The bigger question on their side wasâ€”they had so many options in terms of what
they could do, in terms of building this out independently or working with anyone
who they want because they're the clear leaders in a very exciting space.
So it was just through the conversations that we had and each of us getting excited
about what we could add to each other's eﬀorts was what I think made this come
together.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
The only thing I'd add, sort of, to the philosophical point you asked about. I think
we've laid out in our communications over time three consistent strategic pillars that
we're trying to invest in, to try and build the most valuable service that we can.
In each of those areas, ideally we'd like to be making investments that are going to
bear fruit over a shorter term, an intermediate term. And a longer-term horizon. A lot
of those investments are going are going to come from our internal R&D eﬀorts and
our internal product development. But we want to be able to complement those
with M&A where that makes sense.
So we've been pretty selective over the ten-year history of the Company in terms of
the acquisitions we've done. We'll continue to use it selectively as a tool where we
feel we can access really extraordinarily valuable and unique assets.

Q - Ron Josey
A - Mark Zuckerberg
A - David EbersmanRon Josey
Great. Thanks for taking the question. So Mark, just real quick, I really appreciated
your comments on thinking about the next 10 years and Facebook's three key goals.
Just thinking more aboutâ€”do you think there's more to do from a continued
acquisition perspective, or do you think the product set is good to go, at least for
now in the short term, given I know we're 10 years out from really the short term,
medium term and long term?
Then, Mark, if you can talk a little bit more, maybe help us with understanding the
valuation if that's possible. I know we're awfully early here. But that would be helpful.
Thank you.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Sure, I guess you can take the valuation if you want. (inaudible) the ﬁrst question.
Yes, I think the key thing to keep in mind on this, is these are all incredibly rare
companies. Right. So we'll go a long period of time without doing anything like this.
Then I think we're in this kind of rare period now where we've just done two really
close to each other.
So I deﬁnitely don't think you should expect us to make multiple multi-billion dollar
acquisitions within a couple of months, frequently. But I mean the way that we're
thinking about this is, WhatsApp is one of the incredibly rare companies that we
think will reach a billion people. And every company that reaches a billion people is
incredibly valuable.
And also, there are not that many things that are candidates to be the next major
computing platform. And this company, Oculus, has a very clear lead in doing that.
And we felt like we could apply a lot of levers to accelerate their growth.
So these are two kind of rare instances. And in the future where we ﬁnd rare
companies, we'll consider this. But I think that the rate will certainly not continue.
{BIO 2425453 <GO>}
In terms of valuation, the ﬁnancial analysis that we did focused primarily on the
games business because it's the furthest along. And it's the clearest opportunity
where we have other businesses we can compare it to. And we felt comfortable we
could justify the sole value of the acquisition just on the games opportunity if Oculus
continues to execute it as we expect.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25

Q - Youssef Squali
A - Mark ZuckerbergOn top of that, we see tremendous ﬁnancial and strategic upside if we're successful
in taking the platform into other areas like communications and entertainment. And
we know there's already people in various industries that are interested in the
technology.
So if we can make that happen together, we think the technology will be worth
multiples of the purchase price.
Thank you very much.
{BIO 5934723 <GO>}
Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Youssef Squali
{BIO 1506420 <GO>}
Thank you very much. So I guess to us, it seems like we've been hearing about virtual
reality technology for a while and without really having seen any major mass
adoption, maybe with the exception of some gaming.
So I guess the question is; why now? Why do you feel that we're on the cusp of
something big, if that's what you doâ€”if that's how you feel? But also I think you
made a comment about opportunity in ﬁve to ten years. So maybe a little clarity on
that.
Then what do you envision the Oculus business model to look like eventually? Is it
mostly hardware sales? Is it advertising/licensing? Or all of the above? Maybe you
can help us there. That would be great. Thanks.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Sure. So in terms of timing on why VR is now possible. And Brendan should jump in
if I miss anything here. But my understanding is technically, one of the things that's
driving this is that folks can now start to reuse components that are being mass-
produced for phones at low prices that are small enough and powerful enough, that
you can repurpose to do the really intense graphics work that's necessary to render
a full world quick enough to not make someone motion sick.
So I mean just to give you a sense of how this goes, you kind of need to getâ€”as
soon as you move your head, you need to get down to generating and rendering on
the screen in front of the person a completely updated world withinâ€”so about 15 to
20 milliseconds, or else it's just too jarring to feel real to a person.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-25

Q - Youssef SqualiAnd this team now, for the ﬁrst time, has been able to do that at a cost-eﬀective price
and then there's advantages beyond this, too. So they're doing that powered oﬀ of a
PC today and hopefully in the future they'll be able to do that powered oﬀ of more
and more ubiquitous computing devices as well. So that I think is why it's possible
now. And why it's going to be exciting now.
In terms ofâ€”and what's going to be possible in the future, you know I do think
gaming is a start and once you start getting a network eﬀect around people gaming,
there are obvious communication cases. There are pretty interesting things that
people have built just using the development kits.
Like people will build a model of a place far away. And you can just go see it, right?
And it's like teleporting. You actually believe that you're there. And that's reallyâ€”so
I feel there's a real breadth of interesting things that just we haven't seen on any
other platform before, because they haven't made sense. Just kind of like how there
are mobile apps that didn't make sense to be on PC. I think you're going to see that
and it's going to take a while for that to develop, which is partially why I think this is a
ﬁve-plus year thing.
In terms of our own business model, we're clearly not a hardware company. We're
not going to try to make a proﬁt oﬀ of the devices long term. We view this as a
software and services thing, where if we can make it so that this becomes a network
where people can be communicating and buying things and virtual goods and there
might be advertising in the world. But we need to ﬁgure that out down the line. Then
I think that's probably where the business will come from, if I had to say.
But for the foreseeable future, the main goal that we have is just building out the
product, using the diﬀerent levers that Facebook has to make the product aﬀordable
to people, to make it ubiquitous. And use the diﬀerent technologies that Facebook
has developed to bring it to market as soon as possible.

(multiple speakers) business models. The only comments I would add is that clearly
the near term focus is going to be on investing in the platform and making it
successful. That's got to be the priority.
If we are successful in building the kind of platform that we think we can build here,
there should be lots of diﬀerent monetization opportunities and it's too early to
make any concrete plans in terms of exactly what our approach will be.
