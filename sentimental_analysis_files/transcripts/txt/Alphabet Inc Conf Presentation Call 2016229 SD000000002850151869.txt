A series of questions about the core Google business, the Other Bets and everything
going on at Alphabet. You've been with Alphabet for about a year now. Can you talk
to kind of what's surprised you most about the Company, as a whole. And what are
the biggest challenges you've seen with the new role?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So what surprised me most is, I think I somewhat alluded to it on the various
earnings calls. When I came in and immediately was able to go deep under the
hood and go through diligence to get ready for the ﬁrst earnings call, I think what
really struck me is how early stage Google is, which is a staggering statement when
you consider the size.
But if you just go through products, services, geography, it really led me to the
position where I -- my biggest surprise was how early stage. You think about Internet
penetration, how many people are online, 5 billion to go. But more than that, when
you look at how we're using our handset today, it's so fundamentally diﬀerent, the
experience gets richer. We have these micro moments, the ability to act, transact,
search when you need it, where you need it. It just continues to get enriched.
If you look at oﬄine advertising still to move online and with the level of activity and
time spent online, we're early stage there.
Look at what's going on in the enterprise and just the cloud opportunity for us.
Machine learning, virtual reality, the list goes on. Next billion users is a big strategic
priority for us.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So that was really the biggest surprise for me in a positive way.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Ad the challenges?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well that leads very naturally to the challenge. We just completed our 2016
budgeting process. And the challenge when you have that breadth of opportunity is
prioritization, which is where we spent a lot of time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

Brian Nowak
Ruth Porat{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. And that was the next question, kind of a glimpse into a day in the life for
yourself at Alphabet. What are you spending -- what's taking up most of your time
nowadays? Is it budgeting, or what are you up to nowadays?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well 2015 was about really launching Alphabet and then, as I just said, the 2016
budgeting. But those were both, actually, continuous dynamic processes.
It's -- neither are actually a once and done. So for example, on Alphabet, I spoke a bit
about it on the Fourth Quarter call. The next phase of what we're doing is really
focusing on capital structure eﬃciency, moving the debt from the Google level up to
the Alphabet level. And that's a process that's ongoing.
And similarly, with budgeting, what was key in the budgeting process is this eﬀort on
prioritization across both Google and the Other Bets, making some tough choices. In
a number of areas, we set up what we call gating, where we established technical or
business milestones and looked at investments in business, products, or areas,
through to hit those milestones, those technical or business milestones before the
next leg of investments available.
So that's something we're continuing to focus on, work on, monitor and manage.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
That's actually one of the most common questions, I think, that myself and my teams
are asked. How do you balance that equation between the core Google growth, the
core Google proﬁtability. And then the Other Bets' investment? Is it that gating?
Does that gating apply to both the Other Bets? And how do you think about
investing in the core business versus letting it ﬂow through?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So we do focus on revenue growth and proﬁtability. So I like the way you've set it up.
And I tried in the various earnings calls, when I talked about expense management,
to really start with something that's so key, which is that revenue growth remains the
priority. It has been and remains the priority.
But as I've said on a couple of calls, that doesn't give us the pass on expenses. And
we're similarly focused on expense management. But I think a very key philosophy is
one articulated by Larry back in that 2013 founder's letter, which is that
incrementalism leads to irrelevance, in particular in technology, where change tends
to be revolutionary, not evolutionary.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 13Brian Nowak

Ruth PoratAnd so, with that in mind, we're very focused on revenue growth and investing to
have long-term revenue growth. And then, what's the expense growth that's needed.
And how do we make sure that we are getting the right balance there.
Within Google, I think one of the beneﬁts of segment reporting has been the
opportunity to see what is the proﬁtability within Google. That being said -- like
we've emphasized that some of our biggest bets are in Google. So we're Clearly
investing meaningfully there, as well.
Then I would say on the Other Bets side, a key focus has been this eﬀort on
prioritization. Part of it is gating. It's ﬁguring where we may want to double down,
where we're pulling back some, how to establish gating as we go through a number
of the businesses. And so, again, a keen lens on making sure we have a managed
approach to expenses there.
I would say the other thing worth noting as we look more inward to 2016, I
emphasized on the Fourth Quarter call that we're investing across the business. And
that's not just CapEx. That's OpEx, as well. Headcount continues to be important.
Talent is what drives that revenue growth. And so, just as a reminder, we have the
senior exec equity refreshes come every other year. This is one of those years. That's
a First Quarter item. FICA and 401(k) that's a First Quarter item.
So when you're thinking about some of the near-term budgeting things that we've
looked at, I'd say the other thing that's -- that is relevant near term is mobile growth
continues to be something we talked about in the third and Fourth Quarter call, in
particular. That has with it higher TAC. So, that's something we're looking at as well
as it relates to margins.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. Talent drives the engine ultimately.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Absolutely.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
I think the change in the disclosure between the core Google and the Other Bets,
that's probably one of the biggest changes that's happened since you've gotten
there. Can you talk a little bit more about the motivation? behind the new segments?
And how do you think about potentially further separating those businesses into
separate operating units or maybe even separate trading entities?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Brian Nowak
Ruth PoratSo the -- the move to Alphabet started with a very deeply held view that we did need
to make sure that our organizational structure mirrored what I just went through
about driving long-term revenue growth. And the view, very strongly, was that with
this organizational structure, we increased the level of focus within Google, as well as
really driving the ability to have innovation into new areas, whether it's life sciences
or driverless cars. But areas that can continue to build revenue growth over the
longer term.
I kind of envision it as these crusting waves -- or cresting waves, I guess. And what we
wanted was a structure that provided that level of focus and enabled us to drive
expenses down to the business levels. And have a much greater sense of what
resources we're using around each business. It provided a level of clarity internally
and, I would say, externally, as we move to segment reporting.
But the real driver was the strategic one. And once you have an organizational
structure, disclosure follows that. And that enabled us, then, to move to this segment
reporting, which, as I said, gave us more visibility internally and, hopefully, externally.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. No. I think that's right.
You're having a lot of discussion around the 70/20/10 philosophy. I think some of
those 20s and 10s are in Other Bets. Internally, now that you have kind of the new
disclosure and the real focus on gating investment, which of the 20s and 10s are
most exciting internally at this point?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well when I described the 70/20/10 on the various earnings calls, I talked about
70/20/10 applying within Google and across Alphabet. And I think one of the things
that is very exciting and Sundar and I both spoke about it on the earnings call and I
think I addressed it in your ﬁrst question is that many of our biggest bets are in
Google. And to us, that's exciting, the sheer opportunity there.
Again, whether it's cloud or what we're doing in Google for Work, the apps side, or
machine learning or virtual reality, or you can go on. So the bets that we're making in
Google we were -- we've tried to make it really clear, some of the biggest bets are in
Google. And to us, that's exciting and talks, really, to the point that Google is still in
early stages.
I would say on the Other Bets side what's so key is that we have this breadth of
opportunity and there's not a monolithic approach to growing these businesses or
assessing the appropriate level of resources within the business. And I think for me
it's this -- the discipline that's being applied to go through them, assess the
appropriate level of resources needed. In some, we want gating.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

Page 6 of 13Brian Nowak

Ruth Porat
Brian NowakIn others, for example, in Verily, the life sciences business, it's a great example of
where we've brought in strategic partners, because our view is we could accelerate
not only our time to market. But the improved -- overall outcome for stakeholders by
partnering with best-in-class players, whether it's Sanoﬁ, Novartis, J&J. And so, again,
that goes to the notion there's no monolithic approach.
Let's be disciplined in our approach. We've pushed the expenses down, assess
where we want to really rein in expenses, where we want to expand what we're
doing and to me, that's the part that is exciting.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. We're not letting anybody oﬀ the stage this week without asking them
about macro. So can you just tell us what you're seeing from a macro perspective
and kind of if anything changing with the advertiser conversations going into 2016
budgeting around macro?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So in terms of macro the biggest impact for us -- and I'd be interested in your
summary of everybody -- when you're done with the conference.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes, I'm sure.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yes, let's cut a YouTube video. So the biggest impact -- no surprise -- is the dollar
headwind. And if you just look at revenue growth year over year, in 2015 it was 20%
excluding the impact of the dollar, 14% with the impact of the dollar. And the dollar,
obviously, remains strong.
So that remains a headwind, the other element is our -- most of our R&D is done
here in the US, which means more expenses are weighted here in the US. And so,
again, there are margin implications on the stronger dollar.
But the main -- the main point beyond kind of the dollar headwind, because we do
think, looking through the impact of the dollar, gives one the best measure of the
health of the business. So beyond that, I think what's positive is we're riding secular
change. And having those kind of tailwinds is a beneﬁt.
You'd certainly rather be in a healthier environment than not. But having the beneﬁt
of some important secular trends is the main thing that we keep coming back to. So
that means I'm going to leave it to you to forecast.

Brian Nowak
Ruth Porat
Brian NowakYes. We'll exactly -- we'll do what we can.
Moving to capital allocation, something I know you're familiar with from your old
days and now your new days, the buyback has been pretty well received since
you've come to Alphabet. Can you talk about how we should think about the size
and the cadence of the buybacks, going forward?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So in the Third Quarter that we announced that we would commence a share
repurchase, I tried to walk through the framework that we used to look -- to answer
the question, which I really think is a key one, how much is too much. And how much
is too little.
And as I described then, what we did is a real bottoms-up build with the business
leaders and what CapEx, what could CapEx be over a multi-year period, what kind of
investment cadence do we think is possible. And try and layer in M&A there based
on historic patterns. And then build in something for a liquidity risk buﬀer. And from
that, our view was that announcing this square foot root of 26, share repurchase
program was something that was reasonable.
It was, as I said, a look over a multi-year period. And so, it was with that multi-year
outlook that we came up with this $5 billion-ish number. We're about a third of the
way through it. There's some detail in the K on that. And so, I'm glad to have it. But
it's in that context.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Multi-year period. You have a background in kind of capital markets and optimal
capital structure. Some might argue that there could be debt capacity at Google, at
Alphabet. How do you think about the potential of kind of increased debt capacity
or maybe pay a recurring dividend as kind of the next weapon in capital allocation?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So we've previously stated that we don't intend to initiate a dividend in the
foreseeable future. In terms of debt, as I mentioned, we're in the process of moving
debt from what was the holding company, Google, up to the holding company,
Alphabet. It's something we talked about on the Fourth Quarter call. We think that
builds in a level of eﬃciency that's helpful. This gives us ﬂexibility if and when it
makes sense to use. But overall, we've been very conservative in the way we've used
our balance sheet. And so, this gives us a level of ﬂexibility, again, to support the
business if it makes sense. But we've been conservative on balance sheet.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
On the core Google business. And you mentioned the cresting wave, which I think is
a great way to describe the business over a multi-year period. Since you've arrived,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Ruth Porat
Brian Nowak
Ruth Porat
Brian Nowakwe've seen very strong core Google websites growth. And even accelerating growth,
to an extent.
Could you talk about some of the drivers of that last year and how shall we think
about those drivers kind of going into 2016? What's driving Google websites right
now?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
There are quite a number of things. We talked about product strength, geographic
strength. But I would say the main thing is one of the other wonderful things to see
close up is the culture of innovation at Google. And really continuing to try and focus
on new ways to do things that help users and advertisers.
We talked about on the Third Quarter call, as an example, changing the ad format on
mobile handset. And the fact that that was helpful for users and advertisers and
beneﬁted the Third Quarter and called it out again on the Fourth Quarter.
Although beyond that, we've seen YouTube strength, as we talked about. Desktop
has remained healthy. We break out, obviously, on a geographic basis, as we've seen
the breadth there. So it's really a combination of things.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
You mentioned desktop. I think one of the things that continues to surprise us in a
good way is the resiliency of desktop. Kind of based on your comments, it almost
seems like it's still growing or contributing to growth in some ways. Could you talk
about what continues to drive that positive desktop paid search growth, even as we
see all the data and more and more people are transitioning to mobile, yet desktop
continues to grow really nicely and contribute.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Right. I think we start with a -- there's obviously a large base of desktop users still out
there. And if you go back to my comment that we're focused on innovation and
trying to make the user experience a better experience, there's still a number of
areas with high commercial intent and complex query, high commercial intent where
we particularly focus. A good example is travel. And what you ﬁnd is, for certain
queries, you continue to see real stickiness with users on desktop. And so, when you
take the sheer number and some of the moves that are being made, have been
made, that results in what we call healthy revenue growth there.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
So the vertical-speciﬁc initiatives like travel that are really kind of driving that, travel
and retail, I would imagine, is strong, as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

Ruth PoratA couple on YouTube. You mentioned it earlier. It seems like 2015 was a pretty big
year for YouTube. You mentioned ad spending with top clients was up double digits.
You doubled your watching time spent in living rooms.
What drove this seemingly sea change in advertiser sentiment to spend on YouTube
in 2015?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
We think that, as I said, it's still early days on YouTube. And we're just beginning to
see advertisers moving budgets from oﬄine to online. And there are a number of
factors. One is we're quite focused, as are others, on measures, on analytic tools for
advertisers, the ability to measure the eﬀectiveness of ads. That's an important
element of it. And one where I think engagement is an important measure. But
continuing to look at analytics and what does it mean for advertisers.
But I think our view is, it continues to be early days. We're seeing watch time -- the
watch time statistics underscore this is where users are going. And I think that we're
continuing to see advertisers, looking at that, responding to it.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
You called out the strength in YouTube International on the Fourth Quarter call. Are
the advertising dollars following based on regions or diﬀerent zones, kind of how
advertisers are using YouTube domestically versus internationally?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
I would say overall our main point is that it's still early days when you just look at the
sheer volume of time spent online. We called it out in one of the earlier calls, kind of
the amount of time, 18 to 49. And the number of 18 to 49-year-olds watching
YouTube video on mobile versus any cable network would suggest you would see
more of those ad dollars globally following.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. And you've made some great strides with these advertisers on YouTube. Talk
about how YouTube thinks about investing in more content and kind of improving
the quality of the content on YouTube just to drive more time spent.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
We're really proud of our YouTube stars. We talked about it last year. There was a
Variety survey that looked at top stars. Eight of the 10 top stars are YouTube stars.
And as much as traditional media has expressed interest in a number of stars, their
audiences are with us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29

around them. We launched four new programs in the last couple of weeks, which
hopefully you've been watching very closely.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
And so, again, we think that's a diﬀerentiated area and one that we're really proud of.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Got it. More originals to come.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
More originals. Exactly.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
The other piece of the core Google story is around programmatic. You did some
calling out in the past couple of quarters. Can you just talk to the big drivers of
strength in the programmatic business? What's causing the dollars to continue to
shift towards Google or other players in programmatic.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So one of the things I have said on a number of calls is that we were really early in
building this end-to-end ad tech stack. And we think that's serving us well. So DBM
and Ad Exchange are a really important part of the overall experience. It's a positive.
It's useful for publishers.
And again, we just come back to the overall ecosystem that has been built. You look
on the network side and AdMob, we think that the in-app market is one that similarly
has a lot of room to grow and is positive for the entire ecosystem.
So there are a couple of pieces to it. But it starts with very early investments.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
There have been a lot of changes in the network the past couple years, some
cleanup, the moving of some lower-quality partners. Is that a continuing process or
are we at a point where that might slow down?

Ruth Porat
Brian Nowak
Ruth PoratIt's a great question. And you'd think that it would at some point. You kind of clear it
out. But I think that what we have seen is it is a continual process. And we continue to
try and make changes and we keep talking about these policy changes. They're a
priority for us. We want the user experience to be a really positive user experience.
And keeping the bar high is important.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. A couple of the Other Bets we get a lot of questions around, around ﬁber and
driverless cars.
Let's start with ﬁber. I know you talked about it quite a bit in the Fourth Quarter call.
Just talk about kind of the go-to-market with ﬁber the next couple years. And what
are the key factors that you're watching internally assess the capital allocation there?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So with the ﬁber business one of the points I tried to stress in the Fourth Quarter call
is, that 2015 was an important year for us. We spent a lot of time really continuing to
enhance the way we work with cities, as well as our construction partners.
And so, we've announced a number of cities but have been very deliberate in our
execution. We haven't -- the reason I tried to emphasize on the Fourth Quarter call is
that with the cities that we've announced, as we start executing against them, that
would suggest CapEx will follow. And so, that's something we're looking at for 2016.
But I think, bigger picture, if you're asking how do we look at the business, we look
at the business and analyze it on a stand-alone basis. We look at it over an extended
period of time, the returns opportunity in the ﬁber business.
It is a heavy up-front CapEx. But our view is that what you're -- what we're building is,
then, a cash ﬂow annuity over the longer term.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. Driverless cars really same -- autonomous cars, same question. What are the
critical factors that you watch there, sort of assess whether or not it's going to be an
asset-heavy or asset-light model?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So the main focus within the driverless car business has been, really, building the
technology. We've got an extraordinary team. They've been there quite an extended
period of time. At this point, we've driven over 1.3 million miles, which has been
critical to getting safety data and utility data. And the view of the driverless car
business internally is we're solving two really big problems.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-29
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 12 of 13Brian Nowak
Ruth Porat
Brian Nowak
Ruth PoratOne is a safety issue. We believe that when you have driverless cars, we're going to
be saving lives.
And second, you can think about how cities can be re-imagined when we don't need
to use this kind of space for cars and we can use resources substantially more
eﬃciently.
But it starts with safety. And so, at this point, we're continuing to do the tests. We're
really pleased with the progress we've had. And I think one of the things that's also
gratifying is we're seeing regulators looking at this market and appreciating the
impact, both on safety and what it means for their cities. And seeing more
communities interested in having us come there and use their cities as the model for
implementation of whatever we're doing with driverless cars.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. You mentioned ﬁber being a stand-alone business. Which of the other
businesses within the Other Bets do you view as being stand alone. Do Nest and
robotics fall into that, as well? How is that thought about internally?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So for -- what I was trying to convey on ﬁber is when we look at it, does it beneﬁt the
experience of consumers? Of course, intuitively, it does. And one of the early
catalysts for us getting involved here is that you look at what the experience is like in
the US relative to many other markets. And it was clear there was an opportunity for
something better.
But when we analyze the ﬁnancials, we look at it on a stand-alone basis. And the view
is, let's look over an extended period of time to the returns available within ﬁber
without looking at what are the theoretical beneﬁts or the clear beneﬁts to some of
the other parts of the business, which you could argue could be done elsewhere.
So to us, there's a ﬁnancial discipline around this, which I think is really valuable. And
that's what I was trying to convey in the way we look at it. I think for each of the Other
Bets what we're trying to do is really understand the ﬁnancial proﬁle. and that goes
back to this notion that expenses are pushed down to the business and, again, my
comment there's no monolithic approach to looking at them or how we think about
resourcing them. And Verily being the poster child for where there's been a real
beneﬁt, we think, to the business in bringing in some of these best-in-class partners.
