Okay. Great. Let's continue on. I'm really honored to have Microsoft with us today.
We've got Jared Spataro, the CVP of the whole Modern Work Group at Microsoft.
Jared, thank you and thank you, Tender and April for this morning's breakfast and for
encouraging you to come.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
My pleasure to be here. Thanks for being here.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Yes. Jared, do you want to maybe to set the context describe what the Modern Work
portfolio looks like? I think everybody would understand that it leans very heavily
M365, Oﬃce Teams. But maybe you could describe that portfolio and it might
sharpen our questions a little bit later in the session.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes. You bet. Going into the pandemic, most people thought of the business that I
run now essentially is Oﬃce 365, that was the main source of value for us. During the
pandemic, that changed in a pretty signiﬁcant way. Not only did we see Teams
emerge, I think we'll talk a bit about that becoming a major force in commercial
software, but we also saw customers coming to us and asking us for more help in
diﬀerent areas.
So today when you think about this business, you should think about everything that
is used to deliver a productive work environment for employees that starts with theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06

A - Jared Spatarodevice, hence the OS for us Windows on top of the device, the management
software on top of that, it's all the apps that come as a part of Microsoft 365, so those
would be the things you think of Oﬃce, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook. And then
it's the services, the cloud services that work as well. And then over the course of the
pandemic, people have asked us to help them with their meeting rooms, help them
with their oﬃce space. We branched out even from just personal productivity into
really corporate productivity now to it.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Well, that's if I sum that up, that's a pretty big part of Microsoft right there.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
It's an exciting place to be, very exciting place to be.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
You mentioned, Jared, the pandemic. So why don't we start there actually because
I'd love to understand a little bit better how the pandemic changed that part of the
portfolio? I'm sure it had some pressure points, but I can think of several areas where
it sort of pulled it along. It obviously created a pretty incredible PC demand
acceleration that would have helped Windows OEM. Probably oﬀ-the-seat growth
has certainly breathed life in the Teams, but maybe you could frame how the COVID
crisis aﬀected your portfolio.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
You bet. You've hit, what I'd say on lot of the big themes, but let me expand on them
for just a moment.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
So let's start ﬁrst with Teams going into the pandemic, we're about 20 million
monthly active users. Our most recent public statement on Teams has been over 270
million monthly active users on Teams. We'll talk a bit about how they use Teams and
what they do with it. During the early part of the pandemic, what we really saw from
our customers was just the need to react quickly. Everybody was sent home from this
kind of what we would call information worker jobs, and so they came to us looking
for help as to how to think about how to quickly move to Teams or quickly think
about how to rewire their business is the way I'd talk about it.
There was very, very healthy PC demand, as I would say we saw the resurgence of
the big screen. And people -- up to that point, it's hard to remember now, but at that
point, all the momentum in my part of the business had been around smaller
screens, and there's been so much talk of phones and tablets and what they would
do to essentially kind of take over the world. Now I think during the pandemic, we'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06

A - Jared Spataroseen a moderation of that. We've seen kind of every device ﬁnd its place. Phones
certainly are very important. Tablets can be very helpful. But I also feel like we've
seen PCs and that PC form factor become very important, and people
understanding how important it is.
So those things happened. I'd also, Karl, mention one other thing we've seen a
change in patterns really of how people actually get their work done about six
months ago. We ﬁnally saw the number of minutes spent in chat in Teams surpass
the number of minutes that people spend in Outlook. I need you to pause there for a
moment because we've been trying to unseat Outlook in email as kind of a primary
communication medium for decades now, all of us have been. We've all predicted
the death of email. So it's a very, very signiﬁcant milestone to see people starting to
tip towards a new way of communicating.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Well, Jared, my team accuses me of being a bit of a luddite in terms of technology,
but I am now actively chatting in Teams, so I'm part of that trend ﬁnally.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
If Karl is there, that means the world is there.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
And Jared, you touched a little bit on it, but now that we're sort of 2.5 years past that
pandemic catalyst, how is -- how are things changing and potentially moderating? Is
there any, what I would loosely call, post pandemic growth normalization that your
portfolio is seeing? I think the most pronounced one that you could point to was
probably Amy's guidance for the Windows OEM business where that's clearly
coming oﬀ with a little bit of a sugar rush. But are there any other changes, even
subtle ones that are happening now that you would put in the category of incredible
sort of two-year run and now growth might be moderating slightly?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Well, I get to ask two questions by customers today. Question number one, how do I
adapt to the new patterns and practices of work? They're just simply trying to ﬁgure
out, okay, now that this has happened, now that we threw the tools into the business,
what's the future look like and they come to us for a lot of advice there. And then the
second thing that's happening is we determine how do
I do more with less? So there certainly is a consolidation phase. Now that
consolidation phase we felt coming anyway because they were such an investment,
people turned all sorts of diﬀerent, we would call them, point solutions and they
want to rationalize those, but with the changing macroeconomic context, it really
accelerated that consolidation base that we've seen.
So whereas previously probably about six months to nine months ago, I was trying to
derive consolidation. I was in there saying, hey, did you know that with Teams, youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 18Q - Karl Keirstead
A - Jared Spatarodon't need to have some of these other vendors? Today, those customers come to
me. We very frequently have customers proactively come to me and say, hey, I'm
using Zoom, I'm using Slack, but there's no reason for me to double pay, as I think
about rationalizing my IT budget, what can you do for me? And that's music to our
ears.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. Maybe unpack that a little bit because I think one of the bull cases on Microsoft
is that in an economic downturn, Microsoft will probably be a wallet share gainer due
to vendor consolidation. So Jared, maybe I'd love to ask you, it sounds like there's
tangible evidence of that, so maybe you could elaborate. And where is your share
gaining? You just gave the example of perhaps in the video conferencing side. Are
there other parts of the Microsoft portfolio where the (Technical Diﬃculty)
environment is motivating customers to knockout point solutions and consolidate
more on Microsoft. So where are you seeing that?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Well, I'll start at least with my perception, the macroeconomic context when it comes
to IT budgets. IT budgets continue to be very important, but they're under -- make
no mistake, they're under pressure for sure. So if I go up that stack that I enumerated,
we see it on almost every area. We see it as people think about how they're
managing devices' state, you've hit that already. We see it as they think about as an
example management.
So for me Intune, Microsoft Intune is a huge part of the business, very important part
of the value prop of Microsoft 365. We'll get into that a little bit more. But we see a
lot of consolidation there because remember the competitors are in a little bit of ﬂux
right now. VMware tends to be a competitor, but they are in ﬂux, maybe the
customers come to us and say, gosh, we can't tell where this is going, can you help
us with our management strategy, that's management in both devices, so mobile
devices as well as PC-oriented devices.
We certainly see it. To be very speciﬁc, with Zoom and Slack, we see people coming
to us and saying, video conferencing and in chat that they're interested in
consolidation. So up and down the portfolio, we really see a lot of people digging in
and saying how can we help? Now for us and we'll talk about Microsoft 365, that's
one of the things I really would love to talk with you about. We've got a great story,
our story -- we've gone in and done work with our customers with Forrester
Research, we say, you can save more than 60% just on licensing costs alone, let
alone streamlined IT processes if you move to Microsoft 365 when compared to
point solutions. That message at this moment is playing very, very well.
The other place that I'd say that you might not think that there's opportunity would
be in our frontline worker. We'll talk more about that and F&B, so small and medium-
sized businesses. It's not to say these businesses aren't seeing opportunities in the
market. It's just that they need to get more eﬃcient than they've ever been.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06

Jared, I know the cyber security portfolio might not formally be part of your group,
but obviously in E5's use, it's a very important driver. Are you also seeing evidence of
this vendor consolidation, not just in maybe opportunities to take out Cisco WebEx
and Zoom? Are you seeing in the cyber security side too? And do you mind
elaborating on where speciﬁcally you might be seeing that?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
For sure. Yes, so think of what we're doing right now in security is essentially taking
on a very fragmented space with a consolidation play. That's been our play in
security since the beginning. Not only do we secure our own software, so not only
do we secure things like email or Teams, but we go beyond that. And we have great
oﬀerings when it comes to identity, when it comes to apps, when it comes to devices
and securing those devices, we take a zero-trust approach to it.
So our play is to come in. It is a part just to put it in context of how we sell it. It's part
of Microsoft 365 E5 or ME5, as you'll hear us refer to it, and it is the single biggest
driver of ME5 growth is security. Security and then compliance and then after
compliance, we have phone system as well. So when you start to put together those
value props, you get something very, very compelling for our customers.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay. Let's keep going on these macro changes. That's probably the dominant
subject these days because the environment is so ﬂuid, and most software
companies' growth rates are under a little bit of pressure. So within the Modern
Work portfolio, Jared, could we pause a little bit and talk about where Microsoft
might be seeing some pressure? I think, Amy and the IR team have talked a lot about
some SMB pressure, but could you elaborate where the pressure points are in your
portfolio?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes, you bet. So speciﬁcally in earnings what we said was that we saw moderation in
new deal volume outside of E5.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
So moderation in new deal volume outside of E5 --
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
E3, let's say.

Page 6 of 18Q - Karl Keirstead
A - Jared SpataroCorrect. So let me unpack that E3 component because I think that's important. Just
to give you a sense of what that SKU lineup, maybe you know it already, but it looks
like we have (Technical Diﬃculty) from the E3 level up to E5. And the softening that
we saw in that new deal volume ends up being at that E3 layer. Now from my
perspective, you can imagine we dig into this when we start to see it. There really are
two components to it. There certainly is macro.
So when you think about people saying, gosh, all right, am I ready to make this
purchase? That certainly is impacting what we're doing and you mentioned SMB, but
it's not just SMB for us. For us, it's moderately sized companies that we typically
service not through our direct sales force, but through our partner sales force as this
would be through our cloud solution provider channel is the way that we service
these folks.
And then there's a portion that's not macro, if I'm totally honest with you. There's a
portion that's execution for us. Sometimes we get a little bit high on the E5 train and
we put everything we've got behind E5 and forget that we've got a two-stroke
engine in this business. We've got an E3 component, we've got an E5 component.
So as we went to look at what was going on, there was a macro issue that we saw.
There also was an execution issue that we're working hard to address this quarter
and going forward as well.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Jared, one of the other macro-related issues we're all monitoring is the degree of
layoﬀs across the global economy. It's been a little bit more acute I think on the tech
sector. Thankfully, you guys haven't been a big part of that, but others have. So
maybe the question I'm getting at is across Oﬃce and broadly M 365, what's the
sensitivity of this portfolio to headcount growth across the economy? Obviously, if it
picks up, it's not a good thing. But I presume that there's some measure of minimum
seats that clients commit to, so it can't come under too much pressure. So maybe a
little color on the sensitivity to layoﬀs, given that that's a hot topic for those listening?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
We watch it very closely as everybody does. We watched that jobs report that just
came out. We watch the industries that are growing and those that are shrinking
right now. Let me just back up for a second before I talk sensitivity, just to remind
you, this business, largely speaking, is a (Technical Diﬃculty) business. That's what it
is. So it is a price times quantity business. When you think about quantity in the
enterprise space, we are largely in a place where we are very well penetrated.
And what we mean by that is you either have Oﬃce 365 or you're moving to
Microsoft 365. In that enterprise space, the play for me more than anything else is
two-fold. Number one, it is the price component. So we're trying to drive up ARPU.
And it's a brand new queue in enterprise that is frontline worker. That's brand-new
for us. It really has taken oﬀ, it was accelerated during the pandemic, and that's what
you should understand that it is counterintuitive.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06

Q - Karl KeirsteadIn fact, three months in the pandemic, I paused everything related to frontline work,
thinking nobody's going to invest in that given all the tumult. That's not what
happened. And I restart that thing up in the next 60 days after I told everybody to
stop it because what we saw is digital transformation was accelerated so much for
the ﬁrst time ever across industries, people were putting devices and putting new
cloud services into the hands of frontline workers, and they needed help, and that
provided a really interesting boost for us.
So as you think about how sensitive are we, well, we are sensitive to headcount, but
as we see it in the enterprise, I don't feel like there's a big change there. The
sensitivity comes in our ability to continue to get frontline workers and SMBs. SMB is
typically where you'll see kind of that immediate impact of a macro crunch. But
interestingly enough, we have not seen what I've been waiting for in terms of an
SMB slowdown in those seat. If you look at our recent reporting for Q1, 14% year-
over-year growth in seat, you would think driven largely by FLW and SMB that you
would see an immediate slow, we are watching for that slow down. That's not what
happened. So we keep a hawk eye on it as well in the jobs report that we all just
looked at from the U.S., it looked pretty good actually.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. Maybe that's a reminder not to over index on the tech-speciﬁc headcount cuts
we're seeing, given the breadth of the Oﬃce suite.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
You really do have to think that at this point given the breadth of this business, we
are servicing the economy very, very broadly at this point.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
And that gives us the ability to have puts and takes as we think -- see things go. Now
again, we watch certain sectors like SMB, I'll watch that and you should continue to
watch that. But so far, it's just been mixed signals macro economically.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
So if those macroeconomic signals turn worse, which I think a lot of investors assume
they might and the queue deteriorates, I'm not asking you for a prognosis, but let's
say it does, then the key becomes a lot more important. So let's talk about that
actually.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
All right.

Q - Karl Keirstead
A - Jared Spataro
Q - Karl KeirsteadBecause that's a big part of the story here.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
So maybe a couple of elements of that. Obviously Microsoft announced a fairly
material Oﬃce 365 price increase, can you elaborate a little bit on how that's rolling
in?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
You bet. Price increase and I'll talk a little bit about the value of ME5 too, but I'll start
with price increase just for a second.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
So the price increase became eﬀective the 1st of March. It was the ﬁrst price increase
we had ever done, not just like in a long time. It was the ﬁrst we had ever done since
we've had Oﬃce 365. We felt like we were waiting for the right time when we had
enough value. We'd introduced 25 new apps, introduced over 1,400 new
capabilities.
We had gone through the pandemic, we had done a lot of establish, we felt like a lot
of goodwill, particularly with our enterprise customers. We issued a lot of free trials
during that, I mean there's a lot going on. And so we took the opportunity at that
point to say we think we're delivering value for what we have here and we increased
price.
As you think about this price increase rolling out, however, it's really important to
kind of essentially look at the details of the business. First, there is a temporal aspect
to this price increase. It does not become eﬀective in any particular account until
they renew post-price increase, so post 1 March, their agreement with Microsoft.
So we've got a lot of timing to play out in how these agreements are renewing.
Those agreements tend to be three years, sometimes they're up to ﬁve years long.
So there's a component of staggered pricing that's happening. There's also a
component here of which SKUs were included. If you were to look in the
announcement that we'd published under my name, we are very speciﬁc. I'll give
some examples, we didn't increase price on ME5.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Right.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06

A - Jared Spataro{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
We actually were driving people to ME5. We also didn't increase price on what we
would call kind of our standard tier in the SMB space. We didn't increase price on
our standalone. So there were some places we chose not to increase price. When we
did that, you can rest assured we try to be very, very data-driven on what would drive
people to the right places in the overall SKU line-up.
And the last thing I'll say is, as you think about kind of that component, the SKU line-
up component, is that there's a kind of a ratable revenue component here where
you're going to recognize the revenue over time as well. So when you take the SKU
component, when you take the agreement renewal component, then you take a
ratable revenue component, it's going to play out over time. It will be a big driver for
us, that's why we could. But don't think that it's something that will happen
immediately.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. Jared, with the team, we spent many days disaggregating that blog post to try
to back into what the blended Oﬃce 365 price increase was. So I spent a lot of time
on that. And let's talk about another ARPU driver and you touched on it earlier and
that's the E5 mix shift. So beyond the straight-up price increase, you've got an
amazing ARPU growth catalyst in the form of the E5 SKU, which I think Microsoft
announced was I think 12% of seats now?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
So where could that 12% go, realistically? Not -- it's not -- never going to be 100%,
but what's the trajectory of that E5 next do you think, even if you want to frame it
qualitatively?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
We think we're very early in the journey with ME5. So I'll answer the question, and
then I'll back out and give you the picture for a second. So let's pick up on that data
point, 12% of the Oﬃce 365 install base is ME5 today, 12%. Now I say it that way
because we think that it can go very high. Let me tell you about the drivers of why I
think that. The number one driver for E5 is security.
We talked about this idea of consolidation of security. Security demand continues to
increase for us, and security continues to be more and more complex for companies
to administer. So we feel like, man, we've got a real driver there that doesn't feel like
it's going to let up in the coming months.
The second driver for us ends up being compliance. Now that also is a really
interesting opportunity for us, particularly as we think about consolidation. The thirdFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 18Q - Karl Keirstead
A - Jared Spatarodriver of E5 is phone system. We haven't talked very much about that, but as people
are moving their usage of communications on the Teams, very natural thing for them
to do is then move their phone system from typically an on-prem version of the PBX
to the Teams phone system in the cloud.
So qualitatively without giving any forward-looking kind of speciﬁcs, I would just
simply say, 12% is very early in the journey here. As we think about where that ME3
base could go to ME5, I couldn't see a reason why most customers wouldn't want
that value, and we'll continue to push it. It isn't something that I feel like only a
proportion or a certain percentage of the base would be.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. So maybe we pivot a little bit to the M365 story. For you, you've been leading it,
living and breathing it. But for a lot of investors, we've been delivered Oﬃce 365
metrics and now you can not so subtly see Microsoft pivoting the conversation to
M365. So it does feel like that M365 bundling story is not only a big success, but is
bigger part of the messaging. So can you talk a little bit about that shift from O365
to M365 in terms of messaging not only to investors, but to your customers?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
It's a very interesting one. Think of this for a moment. With Oﬃce, the word Oﬃce,
the brand Oﬃce, we had what I considered to be one of the most successful brands
in history of business. And yet, as you indicate, over the course of the last few
months, during this calendar year, what we've opted to do is to shift away from one
of the most successful brands in the business towards this Microsoft 365 brand. And
it's -- I think it's very natural for people who are watching to ask why in the world
would you do that.
Here's what we found over the years and I've been working particularly in this
business for almost 17 years, so I feel like I've got some history here. We have tried
for years and years to convince people that we could put more value into Oﬃce. But
what we found is the brand was so successful that we actually couldn't open
people's minds and expand the box, the space that they had. When we asked
people about Oﬃce, you know what is Oﬃce 365? They say, Word, Excel PowerPoint.
Sometimes enlightened folks would say, Outlook. But beyond that, I couldn't get
them to say Teams, I certainly couldn't get them to say security, I couldn't get them to
say frontline worker. It was (inaudible) who needed to use Excel essentially is what
they thought.
So a big part of what we're doing here is expanding the box into which we can put
value. And what happened during the pandemic is our customers came to us and
say, we look at what you can do, we would like to partner with you to do more than
just kind of information work on productivity. We want to think about the productivity
of our entire enterprise, top to bottom from the C-suite to the shop ﬂoor. Can you
help us think about that? So that's branding wise as part of what we've done.
What that allows us to do now that we have M365 as a vehicle is to be very creative
than about how we oﬀer that value. We have an E3 SKUs as we talked about, we callFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 18Q - Karl Keirstead
A - Jared Spatarothat our core SKU. We have an E5 SKU, that's our premium SKU. But we also have
these FSKUs, these frontline worker SKUs that allow us to go down and literally
provide, for instance, the airlines and the airline crew at Delta Airlines with the ability
to use a SKU that is having them use our value in a way I couldn't have imagined six
years ago.
So it opens the playing ﬁeld for us in terms of how we interact with our customers. It
gives us a new vehicle, and it really creates a new head space. That's what we're
most excited about. And you mentioned earlier with only 12% of the Oﬃce 365 base
penetrated, we really are in the early innings of this growth.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. Jared, maybe one more on Oﬃce per se. You do have another competitor out
there, where Google is your employee productivity software rival. On their most
recent call, they talked about having 8 million paying customers. We don't know how
many users they have. But is any of the guidance for 17% Oﬃce 365 growth coming
at Google's expense? Is there any market share tailwinds that you've got relative to
Google?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
The answer to that is absolutely. Absolutely is how we think of it. Let me again break
down the 17 percentage points of growth for us. So of that 17 percentage points of
growth, we talked a lot about ARPU, but remember this is a P&Q business. 14 points
of that growth are actually new seats, are driven by the new seats. And where are
those new seats coming from, just again to remind you, from frontline workers and
from SMB.
And those are two places, SMB has been a place that we have really competed with
Google over the years, and that's a place that we're making really nice headway right
now. And frontline workers is a place that we feel like in so many ways we have them,
I would say, outﬂanked right now.
Now I have to pause here to say why in the world would you say you have them
outﬂanked. They don't have a Teams' equivalent. For all the machinations over the
course of the last couple of years that have happened, they have not been able to
get their track together when it comes to communications. And it's so important for
you to understand how strategic the communications portion of the portfolio is.
Communications creates a daily habit that people come back to whether you're on
the front line or you're at a desk.
And when we have that daily habit, we can do so much. So if you were a customer
and I were pitching Teams to you today, I'd say, Teams, our solution for meet, call,
chat, collaborate and automate. And it turns out you want to see how we drive things
like power platform growth, well, it's through Teams. You want to see how we get
really ensconced into people's business processes, well it's through Teams and the
automation that we're doing. So we just have an arsenal now that makes it the
asymmetric warfare, and this is an opportunity for us to take advantage of that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06

talk about there. We haven't hit on Rooms. We haven't -- there's more to do. But it's
really important to recognize that we've got this awesome opportunity with seats.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. So perfect segue. Let's talk about Teams. Let's talk about that communications
piece, enough on Oﬃce?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Great.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
You mentioned that Teams used to have MAUs of something like $20 million. $270
million -- over 10x. Where can we go from here? Is $270 million starting to get a little
bit maxed out, Jared, and it'll be a little bit more about adding new features to
Teams, or do you see the seat TAMs are having potential?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
I'd break it down by segment is a way to understand it. In the Enterprise segment,
man, we're starting to get to the point that we have great penetration. We talked a
little bit about consolidation wins that we will see continue to blow for us. So we are
seeing people, as an example, move oﬀ of Zoom, move oﬀ of Slack. We've got some
great examples of that. Unisys is a great example. I'll just give you quickly say, I have
a little bit of color with Unisys. They were Skype business pre-pandemic. During the
pandemic, like so many companies they moved to Zoom very quickly. They're like,
we can't ﬁgure out Teams.
But in February of this year, we won them back onto the Teams platform. They went
through a three month deployment, and now they've shifted the entire company to
Teams, and so we're excited about that. But that's the Enterprise segment. I mean,
it's largely going to be winning lost ground and driving ARPU. But the real
opportunity past that $270 million will be SMB and FLW. For us, those are the places
that are uncharted territory. As I look to the future, without giving you any details, as I
look to the future, you should think that my installed base will go from being an
information worker dominated installed base to over the coming years, we will
become FLW SMB dominated. The world -- the nature of the business will change in
really interesting exciting ways.
I get excited about that because when we do the right thing for those folks, it
actually accrues up nicely we would say to the information worker, sometimes we
can be overly complex for the information worker, but some really great work
happening in there. With Teams one more thing I'll say, in the Enterprise space, I'm
really excited about the fact that we're retaining those users. I won't comment on all
the speciﬁcs with Zoom, but you deﬁnitely see a pandemic up and a post-pandemic
down. We're really seeing retention of our users.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06

we would call it. Meetings is shifting out of being the driving workload and chat is
shifting to be number one, and that's what we predicted. We thought that real-time
collaboration would be dominant during the pandemic, post pandemic, what we
would call, something more like asynchronous collaboration would really be the
driver and we're seeing those usage pattern shift in pretty signiﬁcant ways.
And on the conference calls, Satya reiterated, 20% increase in Teams users who are
using more than four aspects of Teams, talked about over 60% growth in users who
are now using third-party or home-grown solutions that are embedded into Teams.
We're seeing over 50% growth in phone PSTN. So just some really, really good
opportunities for us as people continue to use Teams more deeply.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Jared, you'll be happy to know that in contrast to Unisys, UBS at least in my
department was Skype for the longest time.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Wow.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}

{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Wonderful. I appreciate that.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Let's talk about what you just said about Teams, how things are changing, from
meetings being a dominant use case to more chat and phone. And I'm particularly
interested on the phone side, and I think a lot of investors are too because there is a
number of other companies out there that are Zoom's pushing in a phone, we've got
to your place like RingCentral, et cetera. Could you oﬀer any color, stats whatever
would make the case most compelling about how the Teams phone side is
becoming a dominant use case?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Phone, what an interesting space. Let me just talk about the phone market as it exists
today, and I'll give you my sense of where trends are taking in the future. So phoneFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 14 of 18Q - Karl Keirsteadtoday for many companies has been based on PSTN or these old ways of calling out
through the telco companies to phone end points. And we see companies
continuing to invest there.
What's happening right now, during the pandemic, they moved a bunch of
communication, including meetings through other modalities. And as they've moved
those to other modalities, and when you talk about this idea, it would be more or
less a consolidation phase, phone is number one. It feels like in the enterprise
companies list of things to consolidate. There's cost savings there, and there's end
user beneﬁts. So essentially what we see happening is companies coming to us and
saying, hey, we're a Teams user, we now like to actually connect our phone system
up to Teams so that we have Teams essentially representing our call control, and
allowing us to have to open-up new use cases with phone, so excellent opportunity.
Most of the time, historically, what companies have done is they have assigned a
phone number to every employee, at least every information worker employee and
depending on the scenario every frontline worker employee, frontline worker
sometimes will get pooled numbers.
One of the big trends that we're seeing, though, is companies starting to say, wow,
hold on a second. Do, I really need to have a phone number for John, if all of a
sudden we moved everything to the cloud. So going forward, we think that there are
some really important trends in phone that will shift and blow in the direction of an
oﬀering like Teams. Number one, we think a lot of traﬃc is what we know, a lot of
traﬃc is shifting from that PSTN network to voice over IP network.
That is already happening en masse within a company. Very rarely if you're using
Teams or you picking up a phone and using a PSTN to call your colleague, it's not
happening. It's voice-over-IP. Increasingly that's happening between companies
because federation of Teams tenant deployments allow you to no longer have to go
through the PSTN network, but again, do voice-over-IPs, that's very exciting for us. So
there's a change happening there.
But the other really big change that we see happening is companies now that they're
starting to move into the cloud are realizing, wow, I can get pretty sophisticated
about my phone usage. Meaning, I can really rethink who I issue phone lines to. I can
really rethink how we're using phones and that is the future of phone. We think as it
melds together with these other, we would call them other communication
modalities, you open up really, really interesting things to do.
So I'll just give you one example. Imagine being able to call a call center rep, start a
call with that person, have he or she say to you, you know what, can you just like
video me real quick and show me the problem with your product and moving up
from that call that was a voice call to video, that's what Teams phone allows you to do
is to have that modality together and so lots of companies are very open interested
in that.

Q - Karl Keirstead
A - Jared SpataroJared, I asked you earlier about vendor consolidation trends. You mentioned, you're
certainly seeing on the meeting side, you called out Webex and Zoom. Are you
starting to see that vendor consolidation trend on the phone side too away from
point solutions? Is that a thing that's really kicked in of late?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
It has. It has. We - it wasn't this past quarter, I think Andrew have to help me. But just
recently, we talked about how many actual phone licenses we have out there
activated from licenses we have and I'm not going to say the number because I can't
remember oﬀ the top of my head, but we have talked about that and we can give
you a reference for that. It deﬁnitely, the consolidation of phone has started to
happen for us. We think it'll be more important. The easiest way for you to think
about this though is, we ﬁnd the prime candidates are those who are high now - high
monthly active users of Teams. They very quickly tip to phone. That's our easiest
route to move to.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. I have got a couple of more for Jared in our last six minutes, seven minutes.
But if any of you in the audience have questions, you've got a QR code in front of
you, just scan it to submit your question, I'll get it on my laptop, and I'll ask it to Jared
if we haven't covered it yet. So while we're collecting those, maybe a couple of more
for you. So we have one of our team members in Seattle at the Ignite conference,
listening for some new announcements.
And there were some cool stuﬀ on Teams, where you talked a lot about Teams
Premium, talked a lot about Microsoft Loop. So when you think about Teams on the
new product side, cool stuﬀ that's you and your team are excited about, what are the
couple that you would encourage investors to watch carefully that could be big
growth opportunities over the next ﬁve years?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Let me just ground you on the ones that are in market right now or that we've just
announced and then I'll talk about where we're headed. So as you think about
monetization of Teams, we have got these great sockets. How do you monetize those
phone? Rooms, we haven't given much airspace to Rooms, but important to
recognize if you are a Teams user, you are going to move to oftentimes to our Rooms
systems. And then ﬁnally, something we call Teams Premium. This was an ability for
us to add additional capabilities speciﬁcally related to meetings, so how you do
premium capabilities of meetings. Those are our three market growth opportunities.
I simply start the answer of the question there because, man, there is still a lot of
runway with those three. Past that, what you are going to see us doing, what we
really feel like is the big investment area is AI. I think 2023, you are going to hear so
much hype about it and what's happening with open AI and the GPT-3 model, et
cetera. But there really is value here as you think about taking that AI out of its kind
of almost like every power position that it has right now and applying it directly into
the scenarios where people get their work done. So a lot of what you will see from us
in Teams will be the application of AI to getting your work done.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06

A - Jared SpataroIn essence, Teams Premium, a lot of what you would have heard was actually AI
capabilities applied in this particular case to meetings. So we hope to establish a
new work pattern that we would call JOMO, the joy of missing out when it comes to
meetings. We are going to create ways for you to record meetings and then have AI
go in, and literally, have an assistant tell me if you should even bother with this
meeting. Did they ever mention your name, was it anything that you care about, if it
was, what portion should you go listen to? There is a lot of value there. So we see AI
augmenting human capability in that way.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Got it. Jared, one more for me. The Azure story is so central to Microsoft. There are
so many full things to talk about with you that I haven't even uttered the word Azure
yet, but maybe we could address that part of the Microsoft portfolio. And in
particular, to what extent are all the things you've just talked about with me pulling
along Azure consumption? What's the Azure angle to the modern work portfolio?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
I touched brieﬂy on management. So EMS, our management suite actually drives
Azure revenue directly, but that's a part of Microsoft 365. So we'll start there, just to
show you some of the overlap. We also touched on security and security is super
important because our security oﬀerings span the modern work portfolio and then
over into the Azure portfolio the way we think about it. So we typically don't see
people just use my portion of security.
They will also move over into things like Azure Sentinel when they move to Microsoft
Security portfolio. So that's the second one. And the third one is when we didn't get
much of a chance to talk about we're trying to revolutionize end user compute with
an oﬀering that we call Windows 365, and that also accrues up to the Azure numbers
and is a big growth area for us. So those three are the most concrete that I would
say.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
And as everybody models the seat-based or EMS portion of Azure, Jared, as we look
over the next couple of quarters, are there any variables that we should keep in mind
as we think about the EMS growth, for instance? I think it has a fairly high correlation
with the Oﬃce 365 go-to-market cadence. So should we sort of be thoughtful about
the O365 cadence and sort of make a direct correlation to how EMS might trend? Or
are there other variables that we should keep in mind?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Structurally, I'd do this. EMS is a portion of Microsoft 365 and E3. And we have two
motions as we think about getting to E3. The ﬁrst motion is what we would call dark
to cloud or dark to Oﬃce 365. We have lots of opportunities still to move people oﬀ
their on-prem installs, mostly down the market and in developing markets into the
cloud. Sometimes we move them straight to ME3, but oftentimes they will go to OE3,
so watch that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-06

Q - Karl KeirsteadAnd then the second component is we will move them from O to M, and that's
where the EMS numbers really come to pick up. So that's structurally, if you
understand that, you can be watching our ability. And again, where is that
opportunity, where is that coming from. Well, it's going to be down market, it's going
to be in developing nations.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Perfect. Really helpful. Jared, one from the audience. How does LinkedIn, which we
haven't talked about yet, ﬁt into the modern work portfolio at Microsoft, your whole
bundled sales strategy?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
It's -- I would say we're at this point where we scrambled for a couple of years with
Modern Work to get ourselves into a new place. Again, you have to think that
customers thought that I was a purveyor of productivity tools and there was not
much else. So I have been working really hard to reposition myself. We talked about
that repositioning. Now that we are here, we talked about customer consolidation,
customer opportunity. We see a lot of opportunity within Microsoft.
So LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network, but I also think of it as the
directory for professionals around the world, that's how we connect and work with
each other. There is so much opportunity as we think about that directory of people's
proﬁles, of their identities and what we can do with a communications tool like
Teams. So I don't have anything to announce, but we just think that there are great
opportunities for us and now take a step back as we look to the future as well. And
LinkedIn is a fantastic asset.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Jared, we're out of time, but that was a really interesting conversation. You are -- you
have got ownership of some of the more exciting parts of the Microsoft portfolio. So
it's been a fun year for you, I'm sure to see this growth proﬁle play out. But thanks for
