Okay. Great. Well we are very pleased to have Chris Eveden from NVIDIA come and
chat with us a bit about NVIDIA today. Thanks very much Chris.
So perhaps we can start oﬀ by GPUs. I mean NVIDIA is a GPU company. It used to be
you have nifty graphics in a desktop. But you've actually broader and quite
considerably with what you've done with GPUs. Could you run through what you sell
GPUs into these days and roughly the revenue breakouts?
Yes, sure. So we describe ourselves as a visual computing company, which reﬂects
the fact that our core activity as you say is a GPU. And then we wrap it diﬀerently to
take it into diﬀerent markets. So we take it into the gaming market with graphics
drivers. We'll wrap it in professional software drivers and that gives us our Quadro
business, which is professional graphics.
We've built a whole ecosystem around power computing, with CUDA platform. And
that gives us Tesla as a product. Then we built a hypervisor for the GPU as well. And
that's where our new grid business is going to come from.
So all four of those businesses use the exact same piece of silicon, although there
are diﬀerent price points. There are diﬀerent pieces of silicon for diﬀerent price
points. But the exact same piece of silicon. And the only diﬀerence is the value we
put into the software and the ecosystem we put around it. So that's where those
come from.
Then even with Tegra, what we have with Tegra now is we have the same GPU, again.
But now wrapped in -- again, a whole bunch of software, an ecosystem. But also
some silicon as well. And so now it's a system on chip and that's our Tegra business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03

Chris EvedenBut it's all about leveraging the IP that we've got for our core competence, if you like,
which is the GPU. And if you look at how much eﬀort we put into that, we actually
have more software engineers than hardware engineers. So although we are
categorized -- you know you are semiconductor analyst, we are categorized as a
semiconductor company, you can make a decent case for the fact that we are a
software company that makes GPUs to run the software on.
So that's how we -- that's how the business is structured. But in terms of revenue, let
me see if I can do it approximately in my head. So GeForce is around 60%, Quadro is
around 20%, Tesla is around 5%, Tegra is around 15%. Where have I got to?
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
We did get up to 100%. Do you want to get to 105%?
Probably, yes, because there's some other in there as well and then there's licensing
and stuﬀ like that as always. That's just there as a very broad rule of thumb. That's
how I look at the business.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Impressive. Within the 60% (multiple speakers) that's -- (multiple speakers)
Yes. We divide it into two markets. So GeForce is PC products for PC consumers. And
we divide that market into two segments that we call gaming and OEM. It's a really --
we used to just think of it as being desktop and notebook, which was easy to do
because we knew which chips were going into what form factor. But it wasn't actually
very informative about the end market.
Gaming and OEM are actually almost the same because gaming is almost entirely
desktop and OEM is almost entirely notebook. But they are not quite the same.
There are gaming notebooks and there are OEM desktops. But it's also a much more
informed way of looking at the market, because those segments have very diﬀerent
behavior.
So the gaming segment is very strong. It's growing at high single digits a year,
probably the whole market as a whole. ASPs are very strong. It's the market --
someone is buying a PC to play games and so they have a speciﬁc need for that PC,
whereas the OEM business is -- the OEMs are buying GPUs really to diﬀerentiate
their PC within the marketplace.
No OEM wants to sell an entry-level notebook because you don't make any money
on them. So they want to upsell you. One of the key up cells is the GPU. But thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03

Page 3 of 14David Wong

Chris Evedenwhole market is under a lot of pressure right now because typically, the average
consumer of a general-purpose PC is, for most tasks, better oﬀ with a tablet.
That is something Jen-Hsun's been saying for a couple of years. So that's seeing a lot
of cannibalization. And there's a lot of price pressure in that market as well. And then
there's competition from other features that might be used by laptop manufacturers
to diﬀerentiate their products. So things like SSD's or touchscreens. These are
expensive add-ons that might put pressure on the bottom.
But that is a market that we see as being in decline. But it's more than oﬀset actually
by the strength in gaming. The OEM market is characterized by a large number of
units but low ASP and low gross margins as well. So low gross margin percentage.
So when it comes to the proper contribution it's very much smaller than the gaming
business.
Jeﬀ Fisher talked about this at our analyst day last week. And if you actually -- so you
can see some big swings occasionally in unit numbers that aren't reﬂected hardly at
all in revenue. And not at all in proﬁt. And that's because you've got this base of very
low value high-volume notebook OEM parts that aren't generating very much proﬁt
at all.
So overall, we think that GeForce business is strong and at least ﬂat year on year. And
within that, it looks like the mix is going to get richer.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Excellent. But just pushing that a bit. So gaming and OEMs. And as you said that it's
the gaming that's primarily the proﬁt. But if we think about revenues --?
About two-thirds, one-third; gaming is earlier. Yes.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Okay great. You've begun to give us some of these numbers. But could you perhaps
step through and give us what your view is of the growth potential? So you talked a
bit about GeForce. And what about the professional graphics, Tesla, Tegra?
Right. So professional -- let me just stop and take a really high level and then I'll step
through each one. So at a very high level, I see it as GeForce and Quadro are -- they
are growing slowly, single-digit GDP. But they are generating an awful lot of cash.
And that's cash that we are returning quite a lot of the cash to shareholders at the
moment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03

Page 4 of 14Tesla is a proven growth story now. So it's oﬀ a smaller base. But it's very proﬁtable
and it's growing very strongly.
GRID is an option on growth if you like. So there's a lot of excitement around GRID.
But it's very early days. It is enterprise AT. So it's a two-year purchase cycle.
So it's really hard for us to say -- to give you -- we haven't got enough dots on the
graph to draw a line between them right now. But it's certainly very, very promising
in many ways.
Then Tegra, there are puts and takes in Tegra. So the automotive business is very
strong, growing very strongly.
We have just withdrawn from the mainstream smartphone business. We are still in
the high-end smartphone and tablets as well. So we'll see how that unfolds over the
year. But that's how I look at it at a very high level.
So taking you into those businesses in a bit more detail within GeForce, the Quadro -
- Quadro we have 82% market share according to IDC. That's units again and we
think wallet share is more than 90% north of 90% dollar share. So really, to grow that
business we had to grow the market and we have a bunch of initiatives in place to
do so.
But I suspect that the dominant term in that equation going forward, at least for the
coming year, is most likely to be the GDP. Speciﬁcally, manufacturing GDP, since 80%
of our sales are generated by CAD through sales into CAD workstations. So Quadro
for GTP-Plus.
Tesla, proven growth story. It grew 37% last year. It's really broken out. It was stable at
about $100 million a year for a while. And that was -- but now we've broken out of
that because we've added support for more codes and we've got a broader channel.
So let's give an example of that to illustrate what I mean. 1.5 years ago, to sell Tesla
into something, our team of NVIDIA -- the NVIDIA team would have to go into a
company, evangelize Tesla for a particular application. They would then have to port
the code for the guys on the application. Then they would have to sell the hardware.
Now, hypothetical example -- so there is some research with Johnson & Johnson,
who is looking at protein modeling and interactions between large molecules. He
knows that his molecular dynamics code is accelerated by Tesla. He knows that IBM
sells Tesla servers. So he phones up his IBM salesman and gets one delivered on
Friday.
It's completely diﬀerent. So now. So 1.5 years ago we knew all of our customers. And
now there are many, many customers that we just don't know. And of course that's
the way the business has to scale.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 14And IBM is -- I used IBM randomly. But they are particularly important partner
because they have about 32%, according to IDC, of the worldwide installed base of
supercomputers, which is more than twice as much as anybody else. So they build
more supercomputer systems than anybody else.
But other important partners there are Supermicro, which is huge in that space; NEC,
Cray, Dell, HP, pretty much the who's who of high-performance data centers.
Computer data centers are working with Tesla now and supplying Tesla products.
And again, we support codes right across molecular dynamics codes, seismic codes,
ﬁnancial codes by modeling the Black-Scholes equation. Modeling derivatives
pricing is actually something that ports very, very well for our hardware. So there's all
sorts of application areas in it. So that's why we are growing really fast. That was
Tesla.
Next one we did was GRID. GRID I described as an option on growth. So where we
are with GRID -- so GRID -- let me diﬀerentiate because this one always causes
confusion. Tesla is computer. So although we are using a GPU, we're not using it for
graphics. We are using it to perform calculations.
A good example is Black-Scholes. Black-Scholes has nothing to do with graphics. It's
about pricing derivatives or modeling plasmas or something like that.
But yes -- so, nothing to do with graphics. Now GRID is in the data center as well. But
GRID is about graphics. So GRID is about serving up graphics power remotely and
there's a bunch of ways we can monetize that.
The way we are looking at we're most excited about in the short term is by making
virtual desktop environments better. So if you're familiar with Citrix and VMware, we
can make the user experience better. We can make the user experience better and
we can extend its application to 3-D applications as well.
So right now, if you install a virtual desktop environment, generally speaking, you'll
be using a very old-style user interface, a Windows 95 type appearance. We can
change that. We can bring it up to Windows 8.
We support video and we support 3-D. And when I say we support 3-D, I'm not just
talking about those high-end Quadro type applications like Kﬁr. Even things like
Autodesk, which is a very, very light 3-D application. So light in fact that of the 7
million installed seats worldwide, the majority of them are Intel-integrated. They're
not even using a 3-D graphics card at all. But that's still too much 3-D for a virtual
desktop infrastructure.
But by putting our card in there, you now support all the 3-D applications you want.
So it makes more detailed nature, if you like on that. But from a high-level business
perspective we have hundreds of trials running worldwide.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03

Chris EvedenIt's a two-year product cycle; bit early to say exactly where it's growing at. But there's
a lot of excitement around that. Literally I think last time it came out to 466 trials at
enterprises worldwide. So lots and lots of potential in that business.
Tegra. Tegra is the ﬁnal one that we haven't talked about. Tegra is in a number of
markets. The one that's most predictable is automotive. That's -- that grew very
strongly last year. We expect that to grow very strongly again this year. And going on
top of that, we do expect to have some tablet wins, some set-top box wins, possibly
some high-end smartphone wins as well generating revenue this year.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Actually, if we look at current revenues, let's say the most recent quarter or what you
expected this year, when we look at Tegra, how does it roughly break out into those
segments?
We haven't broken it out in detail. I think roughly, I think the only number we said
publicly is roughly 40% of revenue was automotive last year.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
And automotive was actually becoming one of the biggest subsegments of tech
growth. It already is one of the big (multiple speakers)
It is. It's a market for which visual computing is very important and actually increasing
importance. If you look at advanced driver automation systems, we have some very
strong diﬀerentiators there.
But even if you're just looking at infotainment, which is the traditional market we've
been successful in, in automotive, the quality of those pixels is really starting to
matter. It really aﬀects your perception of the quality of the car.
You know, around of example from my own life; I was in Barcelona for Mobile World
Congress in February and all the cabs there are Priuses and they have digital
dashboard; no needles and dials, just pixels. And more recently I was luckily lucky
enough to drive a friend's Tesla car and that has a digital dashboard as well.
But those are wholly diﬀerent experiences, right? The Tesla one is clearly a
dashboard inside a $100,000 car and the Prius one isn't. And that really brought it
home to me how that -- how the quality of the pixels impinges on your -- aﬀects your
ability -- your impression of the quality of the car.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03

Page 7 of 14David Wong
Chris EvedenAnother example is I was looking at a car a couple of years ago and it was a great
car, a nice engine, beautiful leather seats, great stereo, sportive, handled really well
and everything. But I couldn't get over the fact that the nav system was clearly badly
translated from the Japanese. It tainted my whole experience with the car.
And so, I really believe that the experience you can bring graphically to the car is
going to say as much about the quality of the car as hand-stitched leather and inlaid
walnut used to say. And so that's diﬀerentiated and placed very heavily into our
strength.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Great. And I mean, thinking about all these various segments. And they are diﬀerent
applications, somewhat diﬀerent products, can you talk about your diﬀerent
competitors? So you have got the one session GPU, a diﬀerent one in Tesla.
So let's go through the list again. GeForce and Quadro, the competitor there is AMD.
And we have about 2/3 market share in GeForce and about, as I said, over 4/5 share
in Quadro.
So why is that? I think we have the best chips. But I also think in terms of the
ecosystem and the drivers and all the other features we built around the chips, that
really helps us hold onto that market and makes it stickier than it otherwise would
be, because we give a better user experience. It really comes down to the quality of
the user experience. And the ecosystem and the software we build is a huge part of
that.
Speciﬁcally, here is a couple of examples. So one for GeForce. So our drivers are
generally considered to be much better quality than AMD's drivers. And the driver is
the layer of software that sits ﬁts between our hardware and the operating system.
And that has a huge impact on performance.
During the life of a graphics card, as we continually update the drivers, both things
have huge impact. Then also, it's a question of putting features in and games that
will only work on GeForce cards. So the game will be a better gaming experience on
GeForce.
So PhysX for example is our physics simulation that runs on GPUs. So that's built into
Unreal Engine 4. It's built into many games. It's going to appear in Titanfall, which is
the biggest game of the moment right now. And you're going to see features based
on that that improves the immersiveness in the whole gaming experience.
So that's how we diﬀerentiate with software. Quadro -- it's about performance as
well. But it's also about stability and reliability. And we do an enormous amount ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 14qualiﬁcations with an enormous list of professional applications across an
improbably large list of system conﬁgurations.
And that's because of -- an IT director does not want to have to waste time
supporting products. They need that level of qualiﬁcation and we give it to them.
Actually our competitors, we have run down the list, haven't we? So that's the
competition there.
So AMD has made a lot of noise about competition in both of those markets actually.
In GeForce, you know there's a possibility that they can gain some share in the sort
of low-end transactional OEM business. And so that might have an impact on a
number of units. You might see that in market share numbers.
But how much impact it will actually have on revenue and how much it will have on
proﬁt, those are much smaller numbers, if at all. And I think if we continue growing
our share in gaming, I think we'll increase our revenue and proﬁt share, regardless of
what happens with units.
Then on the workstation business, on Quadro, that is not a market that's driven by
price. That's a market that's driven by quality and it's driven by performance,
dependability and stability. If you think about our typical CAD workstation it's a
$10,000 -- $5000 or $10,000 workstation. There is $20,000 worth of software on that.
Then you got however much you are engineer costs say $200,000 a year or
whatever $400,000 a year, whatever the number is.
So if you're selling a competitor to our $4000 graphics card at $3000, it doesn't
matter. That doesn't help you, doesn't get you anywhere. You need a better product.
I'm not really concerned with that market, either.
Go down the list -- GRID; sorry, Tesla -- the only competitor in Tesla well, there's two
competitors and they are both Intel. So when we entered that market, there was no
alternative. If you wanted to do high-performance parallel computing, currently you
were running on an enormous number of CPUs was the answer you give.
Since then, Intel has launched the Xeon 5. When they ﬁrst launched Xeon 5, they
launched it as a graphics card. And we always said 116 is a graphics card. But they
might be branded as a Tesla competitor at some point and that's exactly what
happened. Larrabee is dead. Long live the Xeon 5. It's the same technology.
So that, we expected. And that's actually helped us in a perverse way because of
who are competitor was, which was your traditional Xeon CPU. And so, the challenge
that we always had to overcome was inertia.
We would go into a potential customer and we would say hey, look at all the great
things you can do with our power processing -- much more performance per watt,
much more raw performance, better deal for you. And some of them would reject itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 14David Wongand say well if I wait until next year, Intel is going to come out with a much better
CPU and everything is just going to get better automatically right? I wouldn't have to
do anything. I won't have to do any of that code reporting you've warned me about.
Everything will just get faster automatically.
Now that Intel is in that market as well, Intel is essentially saying the same thing as us,
which is you're going to have to move to parallel at some point if you want to get
more performance per watt. We are running out of performance per watt gains in
Xeon. Moved to Xeon 5.
So then at that point, now it's a question of what do I get with Intel or do I go with
NVIDIA? NVIDIA has got far more code ported to it already. NVIDIA's got this
massive CUDA (Rico) system. It's training 20,000 people a year to program that
hardware.
Intel hasn't got any code ported to it yet. To make this claim that code runs
automatically on Xeon 5, that's only true in a loyalty sense, if you like. So code
reported to Xeon 5, ordinary CPU code ported to Xeon 5 will run on Xeon 5.
But it will run more slowly than it ran on the CPU. So it's actually worse. So yes, the
answer to the question will it run is yes. The answer to the question will anyone do it
is actually no.
The programming model for Xeon 5 is actually very, very similar to the programming
model for our Tesla products. It's basically see with extensions is essentially what it is.
And compile it directly to help it compile a ﬁgure out which bits are going to be
parallelized and which bits aren't.
So then we're the incumbent. Now Intel has a lot of money to throw at the problem
and they'll certainly win some deals. But I would still anticipate -- it's a big market
and I would anticipate Tesla continuing to grow strongly into that market.
Competitors -- so, Tegra the competitor really is Qualcomm. In automotive, the
incumbents are Freescale and TI. But they are -- I don't know how capable they are
going to be of moving up to the next generation of infotainment and certainly hate
to ask.
Qualcomm has just started in that space. So it's got a lot to do in terms of making up
lost ground in terms of software and tools and the ecosystem that we built around
our chips. But truly they have resources and they're going to compete strongly there.
But again, our visual computing expertise will be a strong diﬀerentiator, a strong
diﬀerentiator already. And as we move to the next generation of advanced driver
automation systems, ADAS, we'll have an even stronger diﬀerentiation because
we're the only people who can do anything like that sort of image processing right
now.

Questions And Answers
Went a minute, we don't have any questions. That's just us.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Anyone?
Well you're going to have to think of some more questions. I could just talk.
Chris, what are some of, I guess, your assumptions on manufacturing technology
availability in the future? And also, when do you plan to move to FinFETs?
So we have to be a bit more careful about what we say about our future
manufacturing plans, because that's competitively sensitive information. So Moore's
Law -- and Jen-Hsun talked about this last week. He said Moore's Law is slowing
down or has slowed down. So you have to ﬁnd other ways to innovate.
So innovations like NVLink, I think, was the speciﬁc one he was talking about when
he -- which is a fast interconnect between CPUs and between GPUs as well, between
CPU/GPU and GPU/GPU. That's one example of innovation.
We will move -- we will move to 20. We'll move to 16. Whether we'll go as hard and
as fast as we typically have gone into new nodes is an open question. But we'll see
how that unfolds.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Just to amplify on that. So just my favorite topic, gentlemen asked last week about
your attitude to Intel of the past. Can you run through what NVIDIA is saying about
you know --?
(Down be up). We look at them. I mean right now TSMC is the best at what they do.
They have the best technology. They have the best commercial terms and they've
been a fantastic, fantastic partner for us for many, many years.
We've used other suppliers the past and been badly burned. And that doesn't mean
to say we are completely blind to the idea that actually having only one supplierFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03

Q - David Wong
A - Chris Evedenmight seem to be a risk. You don't need an MBA to wonder aloud about that. So we
do look at other vendors.
And we would absolutely be open to looking at Intel or Samsung or Global
Foundries. And we do look at that quite closely and if one of those ever had a
technology lead and had the right commercial terms, then we would very, very
seriously consider them taking at least some of our production there.
But I think today TSMC is the best at what it does. And I can't imagine our
relationship with TSMC as anything but stronger today than it was yesterday, thanks
to announcements by AMD. But certainly that has got -- that's surely enough to
strengthen our relationship with TSMC.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Any other questions? Anyone else?
Your relative success in automotive for Tegra versus smartphones or smaller display
sizes, how -- why is that? Is it the size of display that just doesn't value what you have
as much? Or are there other things there, power management or other things?
Certainly the bigger the screen, the more pixels you are driving and the more
sophisticated the application you're driving through those screens, the more it falls
into our bailiwick, if you like. But I think also the mainstream smartphone market is
very cost-driven and having high levels of integration in that market is quite
important.
And there's a very, very strong incumbent in that market with Qualcomm. And they
have the motive. And they have the connectivity and they can integrate it all. And
that makes it a diﬃcult market for anyone else to break into. If the diﬀerentiating
factor is primarily price, then it's going to be a diﬃcult place for us to compete.
If the diﬀerentiating factor is visual experience, as you note, as it is in cars and as it is
even in high-end smartphones and in tablets, then I think we have much better
prospects in those markets. Does that answer your question? Cool.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Anyone else? I was wondering about your comments about smartphones. And
you've exited mainstream smartphones. So where does that leave your baseband
capabilities?
So we still need the baseband, if only for automotive. Connectivity is going to
become increasingly important in all those markets. So we'll keep developing aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03

baseband application processor.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Okay.
Because that's a product that's only got one target market in mind which is
mainstream smartphones.
{BIO 6109216 <GO>}
Any other takers?
Chris, what do you see as your best embedded opportunities available for Tegra
going forward?
Well automotive is the obvious one. And that's the predictable one paid. We have
said that we have about -- a pipeline, if you like, of $2 billion worth of business over
the next few years. So we've got visibility into that.
So if we just sat on our hands and didn't make any more new business calls, in ﬁve
years time' or whatever the number is, I'm not saying ﬁve years speciﬁcally, we would
have had $2 billion worth of revenue. Now clearly, we are not sitting on our hands.
We're clearly trying to go out and sell to more and more companies. But that's a
great, predictable, very signiﬁcant revenue line.
Other embedded applications we are looking at, I suppose you'd count set-top
boxes in that embedded application. So such like Apple TV, we think that a device
like that, if you could add decent gaming to it as well, run Android but put decent
games on it, then I think that would be a very compelling device, because you could
sell it at a similar price but you'd have huge diﬀerentiation.
Am I moving my head around too much for the mic? Are we ﬁnished? All right. Okay.
I'm talking. Sorry, I'll just ﬁnish that question because it's an interesting example
there.
So I've got a Shield, right, for NVIDIA and I've got a portal running on that which is a
Valve game. And it's a game I absolutely loved on the PC when it came out a few
years ago and now it's running perfectly well on Shield. And so it will be available
publicly soon.
And I was playing this last night and, if I can put that on a console I've now got a
high-end -- I've got a real gaming console experience so, what, $100 or maybe $130.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-04-03

Oh well. I think we are through the webcast time anyway. So I do appreciate you
