The stage is set, the celebs are prepping, and the associates are amped up.
It's almost time for the Annual Walmart Associate Celebration here in Northwest,

Hey friends. It's Kirby Gwen.
And we're coming to you live from Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas right
before the big associate celebration starting in about 30 minutes or so.
This place is ﬁlling up quick with thousands of associates from all over the world.
We're so excited for you to join us as we get you hyped up for the action and

Bo WoloszynOh man, how's it going? Y'all can feel the excitement. I got global tech behind me.
They're so thrilled, they're so pumped up, man. My heart beat is going like oh, oh;
can y'all feel it up there? Y'all hear that? Look at that global tech. Oh man; love it,
y'all. Hey, back to you guys. I know we got a lot of jam-packed show. So, keep it
going. Let's go.
Yes. Antonio is in the action.
He's bringing the hype.
Yes, the energy is hot here in Northwest Arkansas and we want you to get hyped up
too at home or on the go. Each one of you associates is critical to this company and
its success and we have some shoutouts to you all.
That's right. Shoutout to Willie at store 5299 in Clermont, Florida. And to Eric over at
store 177 in Paris, Tennessee. We actually met Eric last year. Keep rocking, man.
And a big shoutout to Dante Hall at store 1345 in South Boston, Virginia. And hola to
Charlie at store 2449 in Puerto Rico.
And we want to say hi to Marlon over there at store 72 in Pittsburgh, Kansas.
And Marlon wanted to shoutout his coworker, Margaret, who's here at Associates
Week and is a 50-year associate. You go ahead, Margaret, with your bad self.
Hey, we want to know where you're watching from. So, give us a shoutout, all right?
Give your store a shoutout. And be sure to comment and follow Walmart World over

Bo WoloszynNow, you all know that Bo and I are all about the associate experience, and so is our
special guest. Meet the one and only Cedric Clark is the Executive Vice President of
Operations, Store Operations for Walmart U.S.
Cedric, thank you so much for being here.
I'm excited, man.
Are you ready?
Like I see Antonio is talking about -- I'm feeling that right now. I'm feeling that right
now.
So, Cedric, your motto is of course pride, opportunity, believe, what does that mean
to you?
You know, it's crazy about it like being here this week, it's my favorite week anyways,
but pride is the little things, right? And that -- when we talk about it, we're going to
get to the belief. But the pride is you kind of get into a business that you run, you
begin to look at it and say to yourself, I can be something bigger than I am. Then
opportunities happen when leaders give you opportunities to say, hey, I see
something you maybe you don't see in yourself, or we elevate you, but what's crazy
about it, it all starts to believe. We see so many associate stories and the belief in
yourself has to start that way and then what happens in when others believe in you, it
gets replicated them.
When I get the fortune to with 21 years ago in Sporting Goods, Bo and Kirby, it is an
absolute honor that in the job that I'm in, which is serving the whole U.S., it's actually
to take care of them. So, that's where for me when I step back right opportunity and
belief that's actually who we are and who Sam Walton started this thing 61 years ago.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Now we know you're all about inclusivity and connecting associates with each other
worldwide. Can you talk a little bit more about that?
Absolutely. So, you can see my lanyard right here, man. It is Pride Month, which
actually kicked oﬀ yesterday. And so, we want you to belong. We want everyone to
belong. So, when I think about what we do person of color, Kirby, kind of get in this
business. You got -- China's here for the ﬁrst time, what, in almost three years. It's just
kind of knowing all that, but that's where I'm really excited man for us to kind of get
together belong and just be a part of this big amazing Walmart family.
Yes.
You talk with a lot of associates. What do you hear the most important is to folks
across our stores and our clubs and really around the world?
Yes. So, I was in listening sessions. You know what they talk about? Leadership. And
so, what's crazy is we got for Walmart U.S., all these areas they pick the best. So,
when the best come here, what they're saying is, "I know I'm the best and I know this
is what I do to become the best; how do we get everyone doing that?" And that's
where for me at Walmart U.S. if we can lock the 1.3 million to be focused on that
customer, the rest takes care of itself.
I know that's right. Hey, Cedric, thank you so much for being here with us today. Is
there anything else you want to add?
No. I just want to say to everybody and this is for the Walmart, Inc family: "We love
you. We are enjoying this day like the party is starting. Hearts are palpitating, but just
know you make the diﬀerence." So, I'm excited to be here and can't wait to be a part
of the festivities to ﬁnish this thing out, the ﬁnale.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

All right. And we know you are kicking it oﬀ in a major way. Cedric is going to be
taking the stage to lead us in the Walmart cheer for the big celebration. So, we will
see you again very, very soon.
So, stay tuned for that. We'll take you to the live cheer happening at about 7:52.
So much goes into putting on the Associate Celebration every year. There's a lot
happening behind the scenes. I mean there are folks working months in advance
dreaming up ways to make this a next level experience as a way to just say thank you
to our associates.
That's right, Kirby. And let's talk about Bud Walton Arena right here behind us. Crews
begin set up about a week and a half before the associates arrive and work around
the clock. Kirby, it takes 70 truckloads of equipment over several days to transform
this space.
And what a transformation it is. There are more than 10 miles of cable, nearly 600
light ﬁxtures.
Wow.
And almost 25 million pixels making up a massive three-story led screen. And you
know what, that's not just Bud Walton, that's Barnhill Arena, the Associate Expo, the
gardens, and so much more.
Basically, Walmart takes over and transforms Fayetteville, Arkansas each year, right?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Yep, stay tuned. The big event starts at 8 o'clock.
Now, the real stars of this show, of course, are you, the associates.
And you all know, Walmart President and CEO, Doug McMillon, started as a store
associate too. So, who better to get you all hyped up than the man himself? And
here's a message straight from him to all of you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I'd like to take a minute before we get started today to say thank you for all you do. I
wish we could get the entire company together in person all at once; wouldn't that
be wild?
Our ﬁrst shareholders meeting was in 1970, a grand total of six people showed up,
but like many things we do, we just kept making it better and better from year-to-
year. This has become my favorite week of the year, so many great memories of
watching Sam lead these meetings, hearing Helen and so many of our other leaders
talk about the company. It ﬁres me up thinking about all the history.
We had a challenging environment to operate in these past few years, but we've
come through it stronger. We're positioned to keep growing. We just need to keep
working together to focus on customers and members, strengthen our culture, and
embrace change. Glad you're participating in this way. I'm really excited about what
we've got planned for you this morning and I hope you love it. Thanks for all you do.
Oh thank you, Doug. I got like a little goose bumplies.
I see it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

A little of this, a little of that, a little of that. We're ﬁred up.
So, yes, we'll hear from Doug here very, very shortly. He'll speak here in moments,
but ﬁrst we need to check back down with all the hype happening on the ﬂoor in the
middle of the action.
Chris, what's happening?
Oh man, if you can't hear it in my microphone, I'm in the Sam's Club almost like a
lion's den right here. I'm like right up front. It is a magical down here. Of course I am
joined by Mercedes and Mylon. Can you guys tell me what club are you from? Where
that's at?
I'm from Fort Wayne, Indiana 6313.
Oh very nice. And you, Mercedes?
Hi. I'm Mercedes and I'm from Lansing, Michigan, Sam's Club 4781.
Oh, Lansing, Michigan. I bet Kirby Gwen is very happy to hear about that.
What's the best thing that you've gotten to do this week at Associates Week 2023?
Coming to this Sam's meeting, if you'd have told me 20 years ago, even last year,
that I was going to be here, I would have never believed you, but a blessing fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 61Kirby GwenGod, this is the greatest thing that's happened in my own personal life work wise. So,
praise God, praise everybody for being here. Let everybody just celebrate and have
a good time.
Oh my, Mylon. Mercedes, can you follow that up? What's the best thing that you've
gotten to do this week?
Let me tell you. I got to eat a lot of food this week. Lots and lots of food. Sweets, ice
cream, meat, barbecue, more ice cream. And I like that was the best thing for me for
sure.
Mercedes, I'm lactose intolerant, but I also ate all the ice cream that I possibly could.
It's fantastic. I don't -- I don't mind that my tummy hurts. It's an okay thing.
Medical staﬀ on deck.
I love it. Mylon, what is the best thing about working at Sam's Club?
For me, personally, the recognition that you get when you do a really good job,
personally. And the samples of food that they have out. Going around when you ain't
got lunch money and you see those demo ladies all day, all day.
A little nom, nom, nom from Mylon. Mercedes, same question to you: best thing
about working at Sam's Club?
I think he just stole my answer. All right. I like the food here. But if I have to pick a
second one, then we're going to pick the swag, the shareholders or the Sam's share.
Every dollar counts, okay? Every dollar counts. So, since he stole my answer, that's
what we're going to go with.
That's lovely. All right. We got one more. I got one more question: Who do you think
that the guest host is going to be this morning?
I have absolutely no idea, but you know what, this is wishful thinking. Let it be Jason
Momoa.
Little Momoa action; and you, Mercedes, who you think the host is going to be
today?
The host is going to be Matthew Staﬀord or Jay Leno.
I love it. I love it. Mercedes, Mylon, thank you so much. Sam's club, I love you. Thank
you. All right. Kirby Gwen, Bo, back to you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Oh my, party crowd. All right now, you guys, you're now fairly worked out, but I'm
going to get you even more warmed up. I'm going to get you all singing. Let me
hear you. Give me a note, Kai or Derek. Okay, here we go. All you got to do in this
next song is this.
It's slow. Let me get it a bit higher for you. Here we go. Again. Oh, you're really into
this spirit. I like this. Hold on a minute. It's kind of hard to get that low in the morning.
You do. Don't want to try someone else; this is too fun. Who else has it? Who thinks
they got it? You got it. You got it. I love it.
I want to say thank you so much to Walmart for having me and especially I want to
say hello to Walmart Canada. I love it. Oh my gosh. Well, I did that, because I don't
pick favorites, but I am Canadian, so. All right, now this song is just all about but
listen up and you get it. Here we go.
Now some of you might know this next one. It's pretty demanding on the men out
there. It's like you know, any man of mine better be proud of me. I can be late for a
date, that's ﬁne, but he better be on time. Now I sing it all with a good sense of
humor, and so I want to hear the women and the men singing along here. And again,
I want to say thank you so much all of you Walmart people. You are in such good
spirit. You guys, I don't know where this day is going. But I can tell -- I think it's going
to be complete madness. You guys are so ready to party and have fun and I can just

Damn, good morning.
By the way, let's hear it one time for Shania Twain. Does it get better than that? Does
it get better than that? Shania Twain at 8 a.m. It's 8 a.m. You've already been to a
Shania Twain concert. Goodness gracious. Oh my god, I'm all ﬁred up. This is like the
price is right. That's this is like. I'm about to pull out a Plinko board start playing the
game. I'm be honest with you guys. I thought that I was coming to like a meet, but
this is much more than a business meeting, man. You guys are here to party and
that's exactly what we're going to do. We're going to party. We're going to have a
good time.
I want to welcome you guys to the 2023 Walmart Associate Celebration. Yes. I'm
Kevin Hart. You guys probably know me from movies that I've done: Me Time, Ride
Along, Central Intelligence, Jumanji, yes, Jumanji. TV shows, Real Housewives of
Hollywood, True Story. I've also done a Sam's Club commercial. You guys should
know me from that. Yes. Oh, that's Sam's Club right there, right there. I like it. I like it.
I like it.
Guys, today none of that stuﬀ matters, because despite all the things I've done,
today none of that will be mentioned, because I'm your host; I will be your host
today, that's why I'm here. I'm your host and I'm excited. I'm excited to be here in
beautiful Fayetteville Arkansas, such a beautiful place; it really is. I don't know what
you guys plan on doing while you're out here, but you got to take advantage of the
environment. What are you guys going to do? Are you going to go mountain biking?
Yeah? Mountain biking; if you're not going to go mountain biking, you really are
wasting a beautiful moment. This is like now becoming the mountain biking capital
of the world.
As a matter of fact, where's Tom and Steuart Walton? Where they at, because Tom --
there you go. Hey Tom and Steuart, is it true that you guys like named this the
mountain bike capital? That's what I heard like it's all from you guys, right, or is it like
you guys like popularize. There was something like that, but I heard it's all started
and ending with you guys. You know I do a little mountain biking myself, Tom. We
talked about it a little bit yesterday. Yeah, I get on the bike; I can tear it up a little bit.
Yeah. You didn't know that, because I got little legs. You didn't know that, did you? I
do. I mountain bike, man.
Just this weekend that just passed, me and the family, I got the kids, hit them up to
the back of the mountain bike. We took them down a little trail, put them on a little
wagon, Tom. I don't know if you do that or not. I put the kids on a wagon and I
mountain bike. You're probably out here by yourself. I had my kids on a wagon. Like
a real man. You understand what I'm saying? Mountain biking with the kids on a
wagon. I don't know if you guys have ever done it, but if you haven't, I just want to be
honest and say I do not recommend it if you plan on walking the next day. My legs
are shot. They were shot. Little selﬁsh kids. They had a good time, because theyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 25 of 61didn't have to pedal. Have me out there pedaling. But guys, I'm dead serious. I do
recommend getting out, man. Enjoy the area. So much to do, get outside, get some
fresh air. The biking gives you a little cardio workout, it's great.
Now, as much as I love biking, I got to be honest with you, it doesn't really fuel my
energy the way that four wheels do. I am a car guy. I love you, too. I'm a car guy, man,
and I'm talking real cars. I'm talking real muscles. Ford Mustangs, Pontiac GTOs.
That's my type of stuﬀ, right?
Now, I got to be honest, here's another thing, man. I really do feel like one of the
best four-wheel adventures of all time is a shopping cart. I'm going to say it. It's the
shopping cart. I love a good shopping cart, man. And I'm talking about a good one,
a real good shopping cart. When you -- when you pull a shopping cart out randomly,
you just go and you push it and it's smooth. You get a good glide, no wonky wheel,
none of that wonky shaky wheel mess. The ones that make you feel like you sick. I'm
talking about a smooth ride. There's no better feeling in the world than a smooth
ride, having the opportunity to just cruise down the aisle of a Walmart or a Sam's
Club with no worry in the world. Yes, I love it. I love it.
I'm going to tell you why I love it. Honestly, I really do feel like the Walmarts have
everything, man. There's nothing that you guys do not have. You got everything. I
mean everything, man. I feel like a kid when I'm in a Walmart. I really do, man.
Because you look and you ﬁnd things that you had no idea that you wanted or
needed. I remember, I'm serious. I remember I left a Walmart with like, I don't know
why, I had like a dozen things of toothpaste and toilet paper. I didn't need it, but it
was a sale. This is when you guys are doing the rollback like you guys do sales that
you feel like you got to take advantage of and I just left with a bunch of shit. I was
like, I just I got to take it. I got to take it. I got to get it. I have to get it.
I remember being a kid though in Walmart, right? And when I would go -- the ﬁrst
thing I want to do is like go to the toy store, go to the toy aisle. I had to get there, ask
for everything when you got there. "Mom, oh, can I get this?" "No, boy, you're not
getting that. It's too close to Christmas." "Well, It's July. It's actually not. It's July.
That's a lie. What you're doing is lying, mom." You would ask for everything. No
matter what it was rejected, you will wait and go until you got to the aisle. Your aisle
was your last chance as a kid to get anything in a Walmart. "Mom, can I get the
gum?" "It's too close to Christmas." "No, it's still July. It's selﬁsh. It's just gum, mom. I
just want to leave with something. I wanted to leave with something," but today --
here's the thing, today Walmarts, they're a lot diﬀerent than what they were then,
right, like they're not the same.
Today let me explain to you how diﬀerent they are. Today you guys have more than
10,500 stores and clubs, right, you have more than 10,500, more than -- more than --
like that's insane how you guys have grown, insane; you're huge, huge Walmart and
that puts you in a very unique position to use your size and scale to do incredible
things around the world things that everyone regardless of where they are and what
they do while they'll shop and enjoy. It's amazing to understand the diﬀerence thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Can I tell you something? I asked for real numbers, right, because I said I want to get

wanted to know the real numbers, because we're talking about associates. I feel like
this is a big celebration, because you guys, you're on the ground. You're the real

So we're really excited that she's here, and we're really excited that you're all here.
And the primary reason that we invite you is to say thank you, to show you our
gratitude. As Kevin said a minute ago, you're the ones that make it all happen.
And the second reason that we want you to be here is because we hope you'll learn
a little bit more about your company. Our company has consistent values, we have a
constant purpose, but change is part of our business, isn't it? Sometimes we say the
only thing that's constant at Walmart, other than our purposes and values, is change.
So these days, sometimes people ask me, how do you even describe the company
today, given how much it's changed? We'll -- we can describe it as a people-led,
tech-powered, omnichannel retailer, dedicated to helping people save money and
live better. I love this description because it's got our purpose in it. That's what gets
me up every morning. I think that's what gets up a lot of people in our company, to
try and make a diﬀerence in people's lives so that they can live better. Help them
save money. Help them have a better day.
So as we go through today's meeting, you're going to hear these themes and we ask
that when you go back to your store, your club, your distribution center, your
fulﬁllment center, that you tell your fellow associates how much they're appreciated
and tell them something about their company that they might not know, okay?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Directors, Greg Penner.
{BIO 5585986 <GO>}
Wow. Good morning. That was a beautiful start to the morning. It's my honor as your
Chairman to welcome you to the 53rd Annual Walmart Associate and Shareholders
Meeting.
Since 1994, when I ﬁrst joined the company, I've held a number of roles, from a
manager trainee in our Asylum Spring store, to leadership roles in e-commerce in
our international areas, and this has always been one of my favorite days of the year.
When these shareholder meetings got started back in the 70s, the ﬁrst couple didn't
go quite as planned. Only six people showed up at a coﬀee shop in Bentonville for
the ﬁrst one in 1970. Then in 1971, Mike Smith, who worked with the investment bank,
Stephens, convinced Sam to hold a meeting down at the Coachman's Inn in Little
Rock. So they went down there, they rented a big room, and no one showed up. So,
as you might expect, Sam got a little frustrated, wasting the time and money, and
asked our attorneys, do we even need to have these shareholder meetings? Of
course, the answer was yes. So together, they decided to make it a little more fun the
next year. In addition to inviting investors and analysts to the shareholders' meeting,
they made the brilliant decision to invite associates from all over the company. This
gave our associates the opportunity to learn more about our company, and gave the
company a chance to recognize and appreciate them.
Over the years, they added picnics at Sam and Helen's house, road trips, music, and
always a lot of fun. It turned into one big week-long celebration like you've all had
this week. Sam said, the point is that we're not here to honor our shareholders as
much as we are here to let them meet the folks who are responsible for the amazing
returns on their investments year-after-year. He wanted them to see Northwest
Arkansas and understand our values and our culture. In that spirit, I want to express
my gratitude on behalf of the Board and our family for how you've navigated
another challenging year.
When I ﬂipped through some of these photos from those early meetings, I found
one from 1981 that made me pause. That was a tough year for a lot of people. ThatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Gregory B. Pennerposter in the background, it says, we're attacking inﬂation head on with everyday low
prices storewide. Inﬂation stops here.
This is the annual report from that year. And in it, Sam wrote, the past year has
presented many challenges to the retail industry and to your company. High interest
rates, the economy in general has been depressed. However, we have conﬁdence in
our approach to discount retailing for the 1980s.
It's interesting because that sounds a lot like this past year. We've been here before
and we're well-prepared for the future. We're conﬁdent in who we are, where we're
going, and we have a strategy to win.
When I visit our stores, clubs, and DCs, there's one thing that always sticks with me,
and that's how you take care of each other and your communities. It's part of our
culture and always has been. We make decisions together, we listen to each other,
and we help each other when someone needs it. I'd like you to meet three
associates who have done just that. Pam Moore, Deb Breitweiser, and Sandy
Summers have worked together for 40 years at store number 480 in Pittsﬁeld,
Illinois. Here's their story.
This is the start of our store right here.
40 years ago.
I've had customers come up and say, hey, aren't you retired yet? No. When are you?
I'm not. I have no desire to retire. I love my store and I love my associates. We are
family.
I've spent my life here. This is my home. This is my family.
I've had a lot of support from the associates in this store. In my personal life, we went
through a house ﬁre. I would not have made it had it not been for my work family.
You're a part of something, not just a worker. And I just feel like Walmart appreciates
you as a whole whenever you put in the dedication to your store.
The small stores is what this company was founded on. Our goal is to keep that
culture alive.
There's a reason that we're still here at this store after 40 years, and it's our culture.

company, we also hit a big milestone this last year with revenue crossing $600
billion for the ﬁrst time to ﬁnish at $611 billion. That was growth of over $38 billion in
one year. And because of the investments we've made in our associates, technology,
and everyday low prices, our shareholders, including many of you, are being
rewarded. We've had a strong record of returning cash to shareholders and are
proud to have 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. Thank you. You all
accomplished all of this together.
One of the most important roles for any leader is to teach values and build and
sustain a strong culture. One that's real and more than just talk. We're fortunate to
have a great CEO who has done just that since day one. Doug, I want to thank you
and the leadership team right here in front for setting a very high standard.
Now I'd like to take a moment to introduce your Board of Directors. I'll ask all of the
Board members in attendance to stand. And please hold your applause until the
end. With us -- come on Board of Directors. There we go. With us today, Chairman of
NBCUniversal News Group, Cesar Conde; former Chairman and CEO of KPMG, Tim

willingness to continue to serve.
We have amazing associates and leaders, the right strategy to grow, and I am really
excited about the future of our company. We built a strong legacy over these past 61
years, but it truly feels like we're just getting started. We have so much opportunity in
front of us, and I hope you all feel that as well.
Now we've got a great morning ahead, so let's get on with the meeting. Thank you.

they said something about a talent competition.

Please welcome CEO of Walmart International, Judith McKenna.
Oh my God. Yes. Yes.

I think that this one day Manoj is not going to forget soon. That was brilliant, Manoj.
Thank you so much. I don't think you quite knew what you were getting yourself into
when you agreed to come to shareholders this year. But we're glad that he did.
Good morning, Walmart. And good morning, Walmart International.
I love this meeting every year, because it's the chance we get to bring all of Walmart
together. And all of you've heard who we have in the house today, I wanted to
introduce the international team to you. So from around the world, we have our team
from Canada, Chile, Mexico and Central America, Massmart[ph], India, and our
support teams from the U.S. as well. And ﬁnally, please help me welcome part of the
Walmart family that we haven't been able to see here for four years, Walmart China.
Christina and team, we're glad you're here with us today. Across the international, we
are 500,000 associates strong, serving 80 million customers a week, across 19
diﬀerent countries. You saw all of the ﬂags earlier. Today, we're a $100 billion
business. Thank you. But we have an ambition to grow to $200 billion in the next ﬁve
years. I'm really proud that we have that ambition. It's actually not the numbers that
matter most. What really matters is why we do what we do and the diﬀerence that we
can make. And the why? Well, that's our purpose.
As Sam Walton said, if we work together, we'll lower the cost of living for everyone.
Not just in America, but we'll give the world an opportunity to see what it's like to
save and have a better lifestyle, a better life for all. That is such a powerful and
inspiring anchor for our company. But how do we make it real? Well, you heardFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 35 of 61Doug talk about being people-led. And I love that, that whole phrase starts with that
phrase people-led. It really resonates with me because when I see Walmart, I see a
business that uses its head but it leads with its heart. The care and passion that you
show every day is about heart.
I'd go as far as to say that heart is our superpower. I see it in the way we create
opportunities and help others belong. I see it in our support of small local
businesses and communities. And I see heart in our ﬁerce commitment to serve
customers, truly understand them and do so much to help them.
Now, Walmart Canada is a great example of creating opportunity and belonging,
and they have so many inspiring stories. Like Feeda Betty, who ﬂed civil unrest in
Liberia with her mother and arrived in Canada at just 10 years old. While she was still
in school, she joined Walmart as a temporary cashier. The same store that she and
her mum had shopped at when she was growing up, because it helped them stretch
their money just a little bit further. She progressed to become a part-time associate,
then progressed to full-time, and today, she's the store manager in Wallaceburg,
Ontario.
Like for so many, her path wasn't smooth or easy, but those around her saw her
potential, encouraged her to take risks, challenged her fears and helped her achieve
her dreams. Feeda credits her success to those who inspired her and believed in her,
and today she tells her story to encourage others to follow their dreams.
I met Feeda last year and I can tell you, she has heart. She's ﬁerce, passionate, smart,
committed and she's risen. She's lifted others at every step, paying forward a sense
of belonging. Now, Feeda can't be with us today because she's at her sister's baby
shower, but would you show your appreciation for her because I know she's
listening.
We also show heart in how we develop small businesses and support communities
all around the world. I was in India recently and I truly saw it coming to life. With
Flipkart's Samarth program -- we have our contingent from Flipkart here, which gives
Indian artisans and weavers an opportunity to access more customers through e-
commerce. And with PhonePe -- we have six folks from Flipkart and six folks from
PhonePe, so give them a cheer. PhonePe enables 36 million local merchants by
connecting them to the digital economy.
And Walmart Sourcing helps small businesses scale and digitize through the Vriddhi
supplier program. Now that is a development program which to date has graduated
more than 25,000 entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs like Preeti Rathore, who founded
Amritatva Foods. She was actually building a cake business when her son Raj was
diagnosed with gluten intolerance at just ﬁve years old. She was determined to help
other families in the same situation. So she pivoted her entire business and began to
create healthy gluten-free vegan foods for wheat intolerant people right across India.
She's also passionate about the environment, sources all of her ingredients locally,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 36 of 61Unidentiﬁed Speakerand educates farmers around her on techniques to use less land, less water and less
energy. The Vriddhi -- isn't that cool?
When she joined the Vriddhi program it was a turning point for her. She was ﬁnally
able to sell her products online, expand her business, and today she employs 10
people. When we lead with our heart, it creates a ripple eﬀect, growing businesses,
supporting families, creating employment and lifting up local communities.
And ﬁnally, leading with heart, is about the way that we truly understand customers
and we do so much to help them. We save people money so they can live better.
And I really hope that we never ever underestimate what a diﬀerence that we can
make. In fact, that only Walmart can make.
I was in Central America recently and the team showed me a video that they'd made
about Andrea, their customer. And they'd made it for their YBM, their Year Beginning
Meeting, to remind them about our why. And I wanted to share it with you today.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
Andrea is why we do what we do. It takes superheroes with superpowers to be there
for the Andreas all over the world. We do what we do because we care. You are part
of a team that is 2.1 million associates strong. 2.1 million superheroes around the
world bringing our purpose to life. Each of us leads with our hearts. So thank you for
making a diﬀerence wherever you are.

Hello. My name is Changchun Ji. I work in club number 4950 in Huntsville, North
Carolina. I serve bakery and sausage. Please help me welcome CEO of Sam's Club,
Kathryn McLay.
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Thank you. And please help me thank Changchun that was a great introduction. Yes.
Well, hello, Walmart U.S. And I have to say, hello neighborhood markets. Hello to
International. And hello Sam's Club. We do tend to be the rowdy group. We're really
proud to be part of a global team that helps people save money and live better. As a
company our values, our purpose and our DNA, unite empower all of us.
But as a membership warehouse club we're also unique. There's power in that
uniqueness. There's power in the unique ways we work with our members. There's
power in our commitment to technology and omnichannel innovation, and there's
power in being member obsessed.
So let's talk about that power. The power of Sam's Club. So we talked today about
being loud but quick, okay? So that's what we're going to go, loud quick, okay? At
our core, we are an item business. We oﬀer quality items at disruptive prices. But it's
so much more than that. We listen to our members and we use their insights to ﬁnd
and create the products that they want. I'm telling you, we will do almost anything,
go almost anywhere to get the best quality items for our members. Our merchants
aren't just sitting at their desks waiting for items to be served up to them. They're in
Amsterdam discovering the tastiest bread on the planet. They're at Mount Rainier
ﬁnding the most delectable cherries. And they're even on the side of a volcano in
Ecuador where breathtakingly beautiful roses grow in rich soil. And they eventually
make their way to our members' homes. Take a look at this.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
You know, I love that story. Our members told us they literally wanted to smell the
roses. So we're breeding more fragrance into the ﬂowers. Who does that? We do.
Now, here's the kicker. Despite inﬂation, despite ﬂoral being a discretionary item,
sale of our roses are up 60% year-to-date. And why is that? Because we're providing
the world's best roses at the world's best prices. That is the power of Sam's Club.
But there is also power in our approach to innovation. We're pushing boundaries in
tech and we want to expand what omnichannel retail can look like and what ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 38 of 61Unidentiﬁed Speakerassociates' jobs can be. Our technologists are designing new tools that take away
the tedious tasks that used to bog down our associates. So now they can spend
more time with members, learning our business, growing in their careers and having
more fun. Yes, some of our jobs aren't what they used to be and that is a good thing.
Take a look.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
Yes, that Henny Penny is quite something. So through technology, we're building
better jobs for our associates and strong digital relationships with our members.
But it's often our more human moments that create the strongest bonds. There's
lasting power in these acts of humanity, of going above and beyond just because
like this story in Club 8174 in Maryville, Indiana, just South of Chicago. In April, a
tornado hit about half mile from the club and the power went out. The club closed,
but our bakery team had birthday cakes to decorate, and members who were
expecting them. There were four bakery associates that had 85 orders and they had
no light.
When the team arrived at 4 a.m. It was pitch black. So our associates found lanterns
and ﬂashlights, and positioned them just so and they set to work. One by one they
decorated all 85 cakes. That is 85 little victories, 85 lights in the darkness, no
member went without. After all, a birthday is a birthday, regardless of the weather. I
know that may seem like a little thing, a birthday cake in a power outage, but it
delighted our members. And you know there's an old saying that the devil is in the
detail, but I think that delight is actually in the detail. Sometimes, delight is a light in
the darkness, that's power.
Associates Brittany, Abigail, Bettina and Kayla and their manager Kim, thank you for
delighting our members. So we have Brittany and Abigail here with us today. Thank
you so much for what you did.
So, in case you haven't heard, we turned 40 this year. And besides partying like it
was 1983, we also spent some time reﬂecting on what got us to this point and all the
incredible associates who have contributed over the years. We're grateful to them
and we're proud of our past, but you don't reach 40 without doing a lot of things
right. But we're even more excited about the future because we know a few things.
We know that our merchants are listening to our members and scouring the earth to
ﬁnd the best items. We know that our technologists are listening to our associates
and designing tools that make their lives easier and their days more productive. And
we know that underpinning all of this are our fabulous associates who are listening
to their hearts and sometimes even working through the darkest of nights for our
members. Our prices are incredible, our items are irresistible and our associates are
irreplaceable. That is the power of Sam's Club. And that is the power of you. I am so
proud to be part of it. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Okay look, everyone here knows that when this group gets together, we got to talk
about merchandise, right? You know that, we have to. I mean, this is Walmart, and
Walmart is the biggest retailer in the entire world, right? That's true, that's a fact.
Now they can't do that without good quality products. Now, I don't know how
appropriate this is, but I got a friend, I got a friend that asked me for a favor. They
found out that I was hosting. And when you're famous you're a big deal, people want
you to do big things and I'm like look, man, what do you want? And he said, Kev, do
you mind if I come on stage, I pitch my product. And I'm like, look, I don't know how
appropriate that is, but I'm a nice guy. My last name is Hart, right? I'm a nice guy. I'm
a nice guy, right? So I said, okay. You want to come out here and pitch? He's like,
yeah, man, just give me a chance. I feel like I can take advantage of the opportunity.
Okay. All right. If that's what you want. What I'm asking from you guys is to have a
little patience, a little understanding. This is a guy who's heard a lot of no's in his life.
He's tried acting a couple times, it didn't really work out. He's into that to the Marvel
stuﬀ, the superhero stuﬀ.
He's into that stuﬀ, but he's not that easy on the eyes, so don't, don't, like, don't react
crazy when he comes out. Just understand he's coming out here, he's pitching a
product, let's be patient, and let's hear him out, okay? Guys, give it up for my guy
Chris. Chris, come on out here, man. Come on out here. Oh, God. Just come on out
here, Chris. Yeah. Chris Hemsworth, everyone.

here. I'm here to talk about my health and wellness app Centr, and the partnership

Page 40 of 61wellness space, a platform, where people can come and receive advice, tips,
knowledge, information in the three key pillars of health and wellness. We have
movement, meditation and nutrition. And something that I've been working on for a
number of years now, something I'm very excited to share with you and I'd love to
show you a video just to give it a bit more context.
All right. Let's take a look at it.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
Okay. First of all, the video was amazing. Now, Chris, I know you man, you're an
actor, you're a ﬁlmmaker, a business founder, right? I've even seen your new show
Limitless which is in -- it's unbelievable guys, if you haven't seen it you have to check
it out. The guy is climbing skyscrapers, he's doing amazing stuﬀ. He's challenging
himself constantly. My question for you is like, what is the drive that you're ﬁnding to
do such things man? Like, what is the decision behind you starting Centr?
It's all about connection for me and it's the same reason that I make ﬁlms, and tell
stories. It's about the connection that I can have with an audience. And what I
noticed over the years of making ﬁlms and being a part of either the Marvel Universe
or action ﬁlms or comedies was the connection that people had to those characters.
And in talking about those characters in those ﬁlms, then it became personal and
they would tell me their story. And we would talk about their challenges and
obstacles in life and ask for advice of training programs and nutritional advice, how I
deal with stress, all the usual things that we deal with on every single level.
And as we're sharing this conversation, I found myself realizing that I had such
incredible access to the leading experts around the world in the space of health and
wellness. And what an opportunity I had to bring all of those people together on one
platform, one space, and share it with people across the globe, anytime, anywhere,
anyplace.
And I've got to say, out of everything I've done in my career, to have people come
up and talk about having used the platform, used the app, and achieved goals,
overcome obstacles, transformed physically, mentally, emotionally, and gotten to a
space where they feel incredibly proud of themselves has been the most rewarding
thing that I've done in my career and something I'm incredibly excited to share with
you all.
Nice, nice. Yes. One-time guys. It's exciting. It's exciting. Now, I know there's more to
the product, more to the app, more to the line in general. Is there anything else that
you can tell us about Centr?
Yes, so we have the digital platform, which I've just explained, but now the
partnership and collaboration with Walmart, which is incredibly exciting. We're
bringing a range of ﬁtness gear and ﬁtness equipment --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 41 of 61Nice.
-- to the shelves of Walmart. And what's really unique about this, I think people are
going to have huge beneﬁts from is the collaboration and the unity between the
digital platform and the physical equipment. You not only get instructional videos
and tutorials on how to use the equipment, but it's integrated within the app on
other training programs. It's integrated with the mindfulness tips and techniques and
nutritional guides to help customers achieve their full potential, live healthier,
happier lives. And I do, I have to say this genuinely, thank you very much to everyone
at Walmart for this opportunity and the collaboration.
Nice. Yes. Well, Chris, you know what man, I'm glad that I could help, right? You
asked me for a favor, I pull it oﬀ. That's what I do.
Mostly, I want to thank you.
Yes. I was going to say you left me out when you were thanking everybody.
You know, I was getting there, I was getting there.
Didn't seem like you were. Seemed like you've forgot completely how this

I wanted to read something. Now, guys, Chris came out here, he did an amazing job.
But I got to be honest with you, I think that I got the two Chris's confused because I
have another friend named Chris that actually wanted to come out here and take
advantage of this amazing opportunity.
But this Chris is a little diﬀerent from you, of course. Another guy that dabbled in
acting a little bit. He's been on screen a couple times. He likes that stuﬀ you like, that
superhero stuﬀ. But his last name is Evans. Ladies and gentlemen, please make some
noise for Chris Evans, one time.
Chris Evans, everybody. Wow. Look at this right here. Three Avengers on stage. It
doesn't get better than this. Now I told you guys that you can ﬁnd everything at

coming out man, amazing, congrats on Centr and all that you're doing. Well
deserved, dude.
Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. Have a great day. Thank you everybody.
Man. All right, Chris.
Do you know how hard it is to have to stand next to Chris Hemsworth? They've been
making me do that for 10 years. I can't escape it.
Yeah. Well, it just got harder, because now you're standing next to me. Yeah, yeah.
Now, you're in Arkansas man. As we now are ﬁnding out such a beautiful place but
what brings you here? Tell me why you're actually here?
Well, I'm here to try and share a very special relationship in my life. I actually think we

We do have a video.

What's it been like since bringing Dodger home?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 43 of 61I mean incredible. I mean it's -- I'm assuming there's a lot of dog lovers in the
audience. Look, we're a dog loving country, it's one of our deﬁning traits. I love that
about us. And dogs are so important in my life. I've always had a dog. It's the ﬁrst
thing I did when I moved to LA. They oﬀer something that -- unfortunately, no human
can is there's a purity, there's an honesty. My dog has no idea who I am, and more
importantly he has no idea that he's famous. You know what I mean. It's like there's
something so clean about it, and it just makes my life better.
I love it. First of all, let's really cut to the chase here. Are you paying a dog for these
commercial?
I'm paying him in Jinx trees.
Okay. I like it. Now when you talked about, of course, the dog Dodger, your
relationship. I love it. But how's it that you guys started working on Jinx?
Well, I'm always looking for partnerships and products that I believe in, and this one
was a no-brainer. When I sat down, I met the folks at Jinx, it was something my
business manager brought to me and our mission statements aligned. It was
something that I believed in on a personal level, so it was kind of a no-brainer.
I like it. Now, when you talk about Jinx, the line, the nutrition, I mean, the key
question here is, does Dodger love the food?
Oh my God. Well, that's the best part about the product. I think it's easy to kind of
get behind a product just because you're the spokesperson and you got to do it. It's
a job. This -- I have ﬁrsthand testimony, like, when I was switching them over to the
Jinx food, for any dog owners here, you know if you're going to switch food, you
don't want to do a cold turkey, you want to kind of pepper it in a little bit. So I started
doing -- we were giving him some sort of a wet food in the morning and then we
switched to Jinx in the afternoon. By the second day, he didn't even want to touch
the wet food. He was looking at me like, where's the Jinx? And I was like, well, there
it is. If I can't get behind this product because of that, nothing will convince me.
Where's the Jinx, by the way? Coin that. Where's the Jinx? Chris, you're here, you're
in front of Walmart, right? You're in front of some amazing people right now. What
excites you the most about the Walmart partnership?
Well, that it feels like Walmart is kind of the gold standard. It feels like you made it,
you know what I mean? If you're at Walmart, look, I'm not trying to be unctuous. It's
the truth. If a product that you believe in is in Walmart, you know that it has the best
chance to reach the most amount of people. And that's exciting, that dogs, that we
love, that our family members can get the same health and consideration that we
give our own children.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

amazing, but what I really do like is, when you're behind something that you truly do
care about, that you truly do believe in.
Yeah.
And your relationship with your dog Dodger, is obvious. You can clearly see the
attachment from the video. But to do something that you feel that you're now
bringing to the market, to provide a better world nutrition for other people, other

Hi. Good afternoon, Walmart. My name is Marcie Bird. I'm here coming from Gallup,
New Mexico. I am proud to be the ﬁrst Navajo store manager of Walmart

{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Thank you, Marcy. Good morning. This has been an amazing meeting so far, right?
And earlier, I heard someone ask a fantastic question, so I'm going to ask it again.
Hey, Walmart U.S., who's number one? All right. All right. So, those two letters you
see after Walmart, they mean so much to our team. Because we are honored to serve
this country of 330 million people, across 50 states, including La Isla del Encanto,
Puerto Rico.
And by far the best part of my job is traveling throughout this beautiful country
seeing our teams in action. And I've always wished I could take more people with me
on those trips. So today, I'm going to try to take all of you. How does that sound?
Okay. The ﬁrst stop is just a bit east of here in a place called Jonesboro, Arkansas. So
we're at a rice farm, and this farm grows rice that's sold all over America. And I'm a
native Arkansan and I spent much of my childhood on farms. Yes, that's me. So it's a
point of pride that Walmart sells Arkansas grown rice supporting jobs and
livelihoods in the state. And it's helping us meet our commitment to spend an
additional $350 billion by 2031 on items made, grown or assembled in America.
And one of our associates, Joseph, is at the farm now. So hey, Joseph, how's it
going?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

great value for a customer, we also know how important regeneration is. Two years
ago, we started a program to instill regenerative practices. Since then, we've helped
save 1.5 billion gallons of water usage, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions
by over 2,000 metric tons. Looking ahead, we've got line of sight to being able to
source 100% of our long grain rice through programs like this. Back to you, John.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, Joseph. Now let's head west to California. This has the state-of-
the-art automated grocery distribution center for fresh and frozen items. And we say
it's automated because associates use software and technology to move items and
eﬃciently-designed pallets. It's people-led and tech-powered. This facility, it can
move 2x more product than a traditional grocery distribution center. So let's hear
from one of our associates that's out there now. Hey, Rudy.
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Shafter, California, PDC 8852. We are the pilot
program for Walmart. As far as automation, it has made our lives easier. We used to
pick everything by hand. Now, as you can see behind me, everything's being
constructed. We're coming out with pallets, a lot quicker for us to load, get to the
stores. And we're having great success here, and we're hoping that this moves on
forward. Have a great meeting.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Thank you, Rudy. It's exciting to see how new technology is helping our associates. In
many cases, it makes the work less manual, as Rudy explained, and we have new
roles emerging for the future that are less physical and they're better designed to
serve our customers and they pay more.
And let me add, that Rudy served in the United States Marine Corps, he's one of half
of million veterans and military spouses we've hired in the past two years. Thank you,
Rudy.
Okay, for the next stop, let's head up to New Jersey. In Teterboro, New Jersey, you'll
ﬁnd one of our newly remodeled ﬂagship super centers. It features brand displays,
digital walls, wider aisles, and new assortments. And the shopping experience is
integrated with our app. And our customers, they love these remodels and so do our
associates like our manager, Rosarta[ph]. So let's go to her now.
Hi, John. Hi, Walmart associates. I hope you're all having a great time. My team is
excited to be part of a ﬂagship store. My associates are truly engaged and motivated
to give the best customer experience. First quarter, we come 20% up in sales. I loveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Now, I'm so proud to call Rosarta a fellow associate and a fellow American. She
moved here from Albania at the age of 10. And when she was 20, she started with us
as a cashier, and today she's a store manager. And that's what people mean when
they talk about the American dream. Rosarta's story, it is the America dream, and we
are so proud that Walmart is a part of it.
And for the last stop, let's go out to Arizona. This is a gorgeous state. And it's the
home of good people like Skyler, who we're about to hear from. And now Skyler, he
serves his community as a ﬁreﬁghter. And he's what we refer to as an omnichannel
Walmart customer. He doesn't think of us as just Walmart stores or Walmart e-
commerce or Walmart health. He thinks of us as Walmart. Right, Skyler?
That's absolutely right, John. Here at Page Fire, we go to Walmart regularly to get
groceries for our shift meals. My wife is a second-grade teacher here in town. And
she will pick up school supplies for her students from Walmart. We have two
beautiful dogs and many chickens that we will pick up pet supplies for. And we use
Walmart pharmacy for all of our pharmacy needs. We consider Walmart to be a really
important part of our community here and we appreciate everything you guys do for
us. Thank you.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Thanks, Skyler. And we're so proud to serve Page Arizona and thousands more
communities across the country. And when you get around to these communities,
you'll see amazing things. Beautiful landscapes, a diversity of people and cultures,
and so much opportunity. And as Walmart associates, we have an opportunity to
work together as an omni-channel retailer across stores, distribution centers,
fulﬁllment centers, corporate oﬃces, ﬂeet vehicles from coast to coast, and help the
people of this country save money and live better. Save money, live better, that is our
opportunity. And it's such an important one, because Walmart U.S., who's number

Page 48 of 61A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerThank you all. Are we having fun so far? Our Walton family believes deeply in the
purpose of this company, and we appreciate every associate who makes it possible.
It's now my privilege to introduce some of our family members who are here today.
I'll start -- if we get some light over here, I'll start with my wife in the front row, Carrie;
my father-in-law, Rob; Alice Walton; Jim Walton, his wife Lynne, their sons Tom and
Olivia Walton and Stuart, his wife Kelly; and Mark Robson. Thank you all for being
here today.
Now we have a special video with Rob, Jim and Alice about the origins and meaning
of the Sam Walton Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
The Sam Walton Entrepreneur of the Year Award honors an associate or associates
who've just been above and beyond in the call to serve our customers and our
members. Dad, put customers and our associates ﬁrst all the time.
Dad felt that entrepreneurship was just critical for the company to have long-term
success. He was a learner. He was an incredible learner, listener and communicator.
And he loved to experiment and he was always looking for ideas and ways to do
things better.
He loved change and he loved innovation. But what he loved most was people
working together to create innovative, new and better ways to serve the customer.
David Class famously said that, dad woke up every single day trying to do things
better, looking for ways to change, and change has been a constant with Walmart's
since day one. That's kind of what this award is about, as folks that have ﬁgured out a
way to change things, make them better for the company, better for our customers,
better for our associates.
He loved associates. He was always out visiting warehouses, stores and meeting new
associates. He would go into a store, a lot of times he would gather people around
and start asking questions and trying to learn what they were seeing, what their
customers were saying. Those were the things that were just really, really important
to him.
Recognizing associates was a part of what he did every day, and listening to
associates all across the company was something he believed in very, very strongly,
and he practiced what he preached.
The great things that happen in Walmart happen because people work together and
ﬁgure out things together.
The way new ideas are generated is from having a diverse number of people
working together on a project, trying to make it better.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

really tough to get. We have four or ﬁve outstanding nominations among all the
wonderful accomplishments that associates get in the company. Our family met a
week or so ago after getting the materials before that and selected the winner this
year.
Dad would be so happy about today to see that he's so alive and well in Walmart.
And this team that won the award this year is the perfect example of that.
{BIO 5585986 <GO>}
So today, we recognize another incredible Walmart associate with this award. Many
of you know that the journey we've been on with our Members Mark brand at Sam's
Club for the past few years. It relaunched on Earth Day last year as a purpose-driven
brand made with our member and our planet in mind. The team reformulated and
redesigned over 1,000 items to help us meet our regeneration goals. This brand is a
top reason they are renewing their membership and it's now the fastest growing
brand at Sam's Club with unit sales increasing to 2.8 billion last year.
This work is setting a high bar for our suppliers to match and it's positioning us well
for the future and it has no doubt contributed to historic double-digit growth that
we've experienced at Sam's. This year's Sam M. Walton Entrepreneur Award goes to
an outstanding associate who led this team, Prathiba Rajashekar.
Congratulations. Here, come stand here in the middle Prathiba. There we go. Come
stand for a picture here. All right, here we go. Come on now. All right, let's do a
picture with everybody. Come on in here. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Yeah, nice to
meet you. Yeah, congratulations, congratulations. All right.
Wow, wow, wow, come on guys, make some noise. Amazing job and congrats to this
year's winner. Wow, entrepreneur of the year. That's a big deal. That's a really big
deal. I'm not here to brag, that's not why I'm here, but I should let you guys know,
I've actually won a lot of awards myself. I have, I have, and I do mean a lot. I just went
through them so you guys can get a clear understanding. I've won a few Kids'
Choice Awards. Yeah, yeah. I got some of those under my belt. Some Teen Choice
Awards. I even won a couple of People's Choice Awards as well. Lots of awards that
people chose. That's what I've done. Yeah, you might say I'm the chosen one. That's
what you can say, if you wanted to just do the play on words. And notice the
progression, right? Like I started young. I started like with the younger place of
awards. Kids love me. So once I cornered that market, right, with the Kids' Choice
Awards, I then worked my way up to Teen Choice. I got to the teens, right? Then after
that, of course, the ultimate goal was the People's Choice Awards, right? To be the
choice of all people. So yeah, I am an award winner. I just want to make you guys
aware of that.
Yes, yes, yes. Just like Prathiba, yes, we are the same. I haven't really gotten this one
yet, the elusive Entrepreneur of the Year Award, which is a little bit of a surprise. It is.

Entrepreneur of the Year Award, I did. Doug, I don't know where the hell you're

really are something else. You really are, Doug.
I assume that you didn't get my word of like, entry, because I deﬁnitely sent it. And I
don't know if you had a look at it, but I put it across your desk. And if you did look at
it, no oﬀense to Prathiba, but I think that the results will be a little diﬀerent here. I
think that we'll be celebrating someone else, right? Talking about myself. You fell
asleep on me, Doug. You fell asleep. You were probably in here searching for a new
seat. You got some attitude on you, Doug. You really do. Some attitude.
Now, I could honestly bring a lot of things to the table here, because I got a lot of
ideas. A lot of ideas that I could take somewhere else and I'm not inclined to do that.
I can do it. I mean, I've got options, Doug, I've got a lot of options, okay, kind of
options that go from A to Z, you might say, options that might hit the bulls eye
somewhere else, yeah, that's right. Yeah, I said it. I said it. I said it. You don't like it
then give me my award. But I'm not going to do that. You know why I'm not going to
do that because you treated me well, I mean, yes. I didn't win an award. I did not win
an award or anything but we are friends Doug, we are friends. We call ourselves that,
we hang, we do stuﬀ, kind of, not really, but we could, all right, now.
Now -- Doug, right now, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to give you one more
chance. And because I've got a microphone and you don't, I'm going to take
advantage of this chance, okay? I'm going to go ahead and tell you some of my
ideas that are missing that you guys that I feel are missing out on, okay, all right? I'm
just going to throw it out there, Doug. Take advantage. This only happens once in the
blue moon. You're listening. I got your attention. All right.
Products outside, party inside, right? Picture this, everybody. Picture it. Close your
eyes, picture it. Okay, we got drinks, music, dancing, mingling, all this is going on in
the clubs. I mean, come on. Sam's Club, right now, guys, you're practically begging.
They're begging for this to happen. I know you are. You want this to happen.
Now, when you've danced for a few hours, well, what happens? You start to get
hungry. And what's waiting outside between you and your car? All that product.
Okay. All that product. And what, -- who's going to pass up on a, what is it, the
palette of members Mark Churro Twists on their way out to a rave, right? You know
how he likes those things. I mean, come on, come on let's be honest. It's a big idea.
So, Doug, there you go. You take it. You've got those now. Balls in your court, buddy.
Do what you will with it. Do what you will, Doug, but I suggest you act fast. Act fast
because I don't want to take it somewhere else. Look at these people. I don't even
know who I can trust. They're probably stealing my ideas as we speak. They are
pulling their phone out, making deals, making things happen. But remember, Doug,
I told you ﬁrst. I know it. And legally, you are bonded to what I just said. That's how
smart I am. I got a lawyer on deck right now, right now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

And I asked if I could share this brand new song that I hadn't even recorded. I had
just written it for my two girls. And your reaction moved me to tears. And it

It's called Girls, and if it's okay with you, I'd like to share it with you again.

see the light again after you've faced your demons. Do you guys know what I mean?
It's incredible and you don't take it for granted and I don't.
So, okay, I wrote this last song when I was at another moment of really doubting
myself. I'd been trying for 13 years to make this career happen and it didn't seem like
it was working. I was 33 at the time. My friends were all moving on, getting married,
and -- but I still believed in myself. And one moment after writing thousands of songs
and touring around the country in a van and playing living rooms, I wrote this song
and it was a reminder to myself that I don't care if anyone else believes in this dream,
I still do. And it changed my life.
So tonight, I mean this morning, I want you guys to make these words your own and
reignite that power that you also have in your hearts. That dream that did not die,
that diagnosis that is not true, only you decide. So let's sing this together. It's called

Thank you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Congratulations. Sam's Club is an amazing story. Loud, but brief. There have been a
lot of amazing stories told about our company over the years. And they start with our
founder. Sam, his wife Helen, his brother Bud, the $5,000 he saved by serving in the
Army, and a loan from his father-in-law got our company started.
For me, borrowing money from my father-in-law would have been way too risky. I'm
out. But Sam made it work. He believed in discount retailing. He believed he could
bring a broad assortment of quality merchandise at a good value to underserved
small communities and grow a successful business. And he did. It's inspiring to
remember that the company we're part of today started with one store in small-town
America.
In his book, Sam said, it would have been impossible to convince anyone back then
that the biggest retailer would be that one from down in Arkansas. Don't you wonder
what he would say today? Serving as many customers and members as we serve
today sounds impossible. Growing like we are all over the world sounds impossible. I
swear I turned that oﬀ. That's embarrassing. Hello?
Did I hear you say impossible?

As well. Let me throw you up on the big screen.
Hey, Team. I wish I could be there with you. But I'm abroad today for my new ﬁlm,
Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1. Now for me, it's invigorating to look at
something that is considered impossible and ask, what if? And I ask that same
question as I'm making every single one of my ﬁlms. And I have the privilege to take
on challenges that are considered impossible for the purpose of entertaining
audiences.
Now some people might think that making the impossible possible is all about luck.
But actually, it's about dedication, practice. It's about commitment, training, and
giving intense attention to every little aspect over and over and over again. It's about
becoming more and more competent at what I'm doing. It's about getting so good
at what you do that there's no way you miss you mark. That pressure you feel when
you're in front of what looks like an impossible challenge. I do understand that. I
understand it and I view it as a privilege.
And I have a saying on my ﬁlm sets and in life that pressure is a privilege. I know
Walmart has a history of achieving things that others thought impossible. What a
privilege that is. Walmart associates, please keep it up. Thank you for what you do. By
the way, I sent you a little something.

intense attention to every little aspect over and over again, so it becomes second

We know that without them, we don't have a business. We expect excellence of

what it means to be people-led. A few weeks ago, I got to visit our associates in our
super center in Oxnard, California. As usual, they didn't know they were going to get
a visit.
Before I even got inside, I learned something about the culture of our associates in
the store. I saw a customer approaching one of our associates who was bringing in
carts from the parking lot. His name is Willie. Our customer was sincerely thanking
him for helping her as she came to visit our store over several visits while recovering
from surgery. They both looked at me like, who is this guy eavesdropping on our
conversation? I just smiled and went inside.
As our manager, Sylvia, and I were walking the store, another customer, Patricia,
stopped us to thank several associates, including our fresh coach, Adrian. Check out
their story.

This is what we want. You know you can make a huge impact in someone's life. It's

possible. If you told us beforehand what we were going to be up against from 2020
to today, and then told us what our results would be during that time period, many
would have said it was impossible.
We had a pandemic to lead through, communities and countries wrestling with

persistent inﬂation. Through all of that, you worked to keep yourselves safe, our
customers safe, and you delivered ﬁnancial results, while progressing our strategy at
the same time. In the last three years, you've added $125 billion in revenue,
excluding divestitures, delivering a compounded annual growth rate of 8%.
To ﬁrst reach $125 billion in revenue, it took us 36 years. You all just grew by that
much in three years. You turned us into a scaled omni-channel retailer with global e-
commerce sales now over $80 billion. You made the impossible, possible. You're the
ones who make the diﬀerence, which makes investing in you a priority. We invest in

improve your daily work life.
And we invest in educational experiences through our own Walmart academies and
Live Better You. We'll keep investing in you and we'll stay people-led, even as we're
more powered by technology. We're putting it to work for the good of our
customers and members, and for you as associates. We may not use exploding
chewing gum or gloves to climb skyscrapers, but we will have some amazing tools.
We'll use generative AI to help personalize shopping by making better product
recommendations. We'll use more data sets and improved algorithms to better
predict demand, improve our inventory ﬂow, and ensure that the right items are in
stock, in the right place, at the right time.
We're investing in automation that'll put a pallet-loaded trailer at your back door that
was customized for a department and eventually an aisle in your store. At Sam's Club
today, more than one in four of our members used Scan and Go to skip the checkout
line. Computer vision is helping to improve in-stock and modular accuracy by riding
around our clubs on a ﬂoor scrubber. Who needs chewing gum? We have ﬂoor
scrubbers.
In places like India and Mexico, PhonePe and Cashier are making it possible for
people to access the beneﬁts of the digital economy, many of them for the ﬁrst time.
PhonePe built amazing technology that enables over $1 trillion worth of digital
payments per year.
We'll be more tech-powered next week, next month, and for years to come. A few
years ago, a lot of this seemed impossible, but we're making the impossible,
possible. We are people-led and tech-powered and we've become a scaled omni-
channel retailer. All that really means is that we're changing to serve people however
they want to be served. We're merchants and we always will be. And these days we
can help customers access low prices on hundreds of millions of items and we're
providing more ﬂexible experience for people that can save then time.
People can come to a store or club, they can pick up an order, they can have it
delivered to the doorstep or in some places all the way into their home. They can
use our app or site, they can text us and in India, Canada, and the U.S. they can use
their voice to shop. They can shop us through social media and we've begun to take
Walmart to the most popular virtual worlds in the metaverse. We'll be where people
want to ﬁnd us, and our digital front doors may change.
But our people and culture, our supply chain, our tech and having stores and clubs
so close to so many people around the world are all advantages and we're putting
those advantages to work. As we serve people in this more holistic way it opens up
new opportunities for us. We're building a marketplace that gives our customers
more selection, enabling us to provide fulﬁllment services and sell advertising.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

Page 57 of 61Our newer businesses like these enable us to improve our proﬁtability, which will
beneﬁt shareholders enable further investment in our business. We can grow
proﬁtability faster than sales without raising prices, which we never want to do
because we're dedicated to helping people save money and live better. When we
think of live better, we think of helping people save time, be healthier and become
more ﬁnancially secure while strengthening their communities and the planet. The
business we've been building will help people live better in those ways. That may
seem impossible, but it's not. We're making the impossible, possible.
Let me give you an example of a family that's helping us provide better quality and
doing it in a more sustainable way at the same time. I met Jonathan and Sierra Jones
and their sons, Jonathan Jr.and Jace, a few months ago. They're ranchers in New
Orleans. Check out their story.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
So we want them to thrive, we want all of our ranchers to thrive and we want
consistently great steaks for our customers. The Jones family is with us today, can we
please recognize them this morning? Hope you guys have had fun today. Thank you
for coming. We've been inspired by the work our suppliers are doing as it relates to
our collective goal of becoming regenerative, which means having a net positive
impact on people and the planet. A big thank you to all of our suppliers who may be
here today.
Due to their creativity and hard work, we're three quarters of the way toward our
goal of becoming a reducing or avoiding 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases
by 2030 from global supply chains through Project Gigaton. Accomplishing that
seemed impossible. We're making the impossible, possible.
From our founding to today, there have been so many amazing stories about
Walmart, and I know that each one of you have your own story. When we think about
Mission Impossible, we might think about undercover agents who jump out of
airplanes. I think of Jason Higgins.
Jason leads our store. Hey Jason, turn around here. There's a bunch of people here
you should see. He leads our store in Hazard, Kentucky. Last July, a ﬂash ﬂood killed
44 people and destroyed or damaged 9,000 homes. Imagine a 4-inch creek
becoming a 40-foot tidal wave at 2 o'clock in the morning. Jason, Melissa, Kathy, and
Ginger, and our associates in his store, stepped up. They scrambled and got the
store open to help customers. They got supplies to the community, and they got
supplies to the National Guard that was busy that morning helping to rescue people.
Kentucky's Governor later told me that the only two things working that morning was
a National Guard and Walmart. And that's because of these guys. Way to go. Proud
of you. Please carry that back to the rest of the team.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02

A - Doug McMillonWhen you think about Mission Impossible, we might think about Tom Cruise on a
motorcycle jumping oﬀ a cliﬀ. Why? I don't know. I think of Kevin Pritchard. Kevin's
from Toronto. Hey, Kevin. Kevin's here with his sister, Michelle. Michelle is a store
manager with us. Kevin's an overnight associate and he has perfect attendance over
his 20 year career. He's a special Olympic athlete. He's a champion golfer. I don't
think I would want to play with him. And he's taught his team, his customers, his
community that we all deserve the opportunity to show the world what we can oﬀer.
Thank you, Kevin. We're proud of you. When we think of Mission Impossible, same
guy. Hey, Tom, I know we talked. Okay. Yep. All right, your turn.
Hey, again, now I asked Doug, I asked Doug every year if I can be the one that does
this, but he always says it's his favorite part of the job. Well, this is the year. Anyway,
when you think of Mission Impossible, you might think of countdown sequences
where the stakes couldn't be higher. I think of Ormus Lopez. He came to the United
States eight years ago, taught himself English, and today he's the meat lead in his
Sam's Club in Houston.
He says his teammates give him conﬁdence to believe he can do more. Ormus, I
heard you're in the middle of your own intense countdown. You applied for
promotion to the fresh team manager at a club nearby.

He just asked.
You're still waiting for an answer.
Yes.
So today, this mission is yours, should you choose to accept it? Congratulations.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
He said yes. Thank goodness. Here's your new badge. Thanks. Congratulations. As
far as I know, you are the ﬁrst and only associate to ever be promoted by Tom Cruise.
Any of you ever been promoted by Tom?
No?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Okay. Congratulations, man. Happy for you. When I think of Mission Impossible, I
think of all of you. Everything we've achieved in our company's history is because of
you and your fellow associates working together to live out our purpose and values.

Doug McMillon, everyone. One time please for Doug. Make some noise. Great job.
Am I the only one that thought Tom Cruise was coming down? I said holy s..., Tom is
here. They really do it big. Jesus. How do they get time to ﬂy the helicopter, land,
come through the ceiling? I was blown away backstage. I was locked in. Guys, I've
had the best time hanging out with all of you this morning. I really have. I really, really
have, man. It's an amazing gig, guys. I hope I'm not the only one that's had a good
time. Have you guys had a good time as well? Yes?
Well, it has been an honor, and I want to thank Walmart for letting me join all of you
guys today and letting me be a part of this amazing celebration. I also want to thank
the Walmart associates. I can't thank you guys enough. You're the reason why we're
here. It's a celebration for you. Everything you do every day for your customers, your
communities, and for each other. Look, you guys lift each other up, man. You lift us all
up and we are all so thankful for each of you. This has been an absolute blast and I
want to thank you guys once again for letting me be your host this year. Thank you.
Thank you all.
An amazing thing. Oh look at Canada. Thank you, man. Thank you, guys. You all don't
have to stand up. Doug, this is a standing ovation. Mark this. They're doing it on their
own. Look at that. Look at that. They're doing it on their own. This is a big deal. Fine,
I'll do it again. Fine.
Okay Doug, if that's how you want to ask, I'll do it again. But here's the big thing. You
can't just close out with your host saying what an amazing time, what a dope
environment, what a dope energy. You can't, because this energy is contagious. And
you got to make sure that everybody leaves with the energy that you came in here
with and the shock factor. And that's what we're going to do. We got one more trick
up our sleeve, one more. As a matter of fact it's a trick that you guys you should say
standing for okay?
What about more music should we close with music? Yeah, maybe? I feel like we
should. I close the performer is a Grammy winning independent international
superstar, education advocate, business entrepreneur and motivational speaker. The
man has billions of audio streams and video views plus hundreds and I do mean

you for the opportunity here today. We highly appreciate it. Number two, what an
honor it is to be able to share the stage with hard workers, those that I respect highly
such as Kevin Hart, Snoop Dogg, Shania Twain, John Legend. So I just want to let you
know, how much I appreciate this moment. When I say me, I say we. It's us. I don't do
this by myself.
Now with that said, I know it's about what, 11 in the morning, some change? No
matter what time it is, it's 5 o'clock somewhere. I would invite everybody here to
happy hour be shot o'clock somewhere. I'll tell you that much. But with that said, no

came to party? I can't hear you? Who came to party? Who came to party? Who came

said, drop that thing on them.

It always feels good or should I say feels great to be in a room. Oh my bad, in arena
full of ﬁreballs. With that said, (Foreign Language). Now with that said, this is my
favorite record to perform all around the world because it gives me a chance to
show y'all how I've taken my life from a negative to a positive.
I grew up in interesting times, it built a lot of character, I don't regret one moment of
it, but I tell you this much, went to about 25 diﬀerent schools, never been a
troublemaker just somehow was always around some trouble. But I learned from it, I
didn't graduate high school, but a teacher changed my life, and her name is Hope
Martinez, ironically Hope Martinez. Now, I tell you this story where I didn't graduate
high school but I learned how to build schools.
And with that said, I was thinking they were going to throw you a picture of it but out
of all, it's in one of my old neighborhoods where I grew up at, it's called SLAM,
Sports Leadership Arts and Management, Public Charter School, 97% of the kids on
free lunch, graduated at 100% by the way.
So when they ask me, Chico, how many kids you got? I say 10,000. So now we're up
to 12 schools around the United States of America, up to 10,000 kids is only going to
continue to grow. I only share that story why? Because at the end of the day, without
you all there's no me. And you and everybody here are a part of our success. When I
say our success, not my success, our success. Because it's a whole team that makes
this thing happen.
We share the same vision, we have the same goals, but we study and we practice
what we preach now. (Foreign Language) Short steps, long vision. So to everybody
here, what an honor it is to be ﬁrst generation Cuban-American, knowing what my
family went through for me to enjoy the United States of America. And be able to
perform for one of the most powerful companies in the world out of the United
States of America. So I want to say, thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-02
