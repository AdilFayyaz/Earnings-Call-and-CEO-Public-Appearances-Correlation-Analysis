Thanks everyone, for joining us this morning.
My name is Chris O'Cull. I'm the Restaurant analyst at Stifel. And on behalf of all my
colleagues, welcome to our Cross Sector Investor Conference.
I want to oﬀer a special thanks to my guest Pat Grismer, who is the CFO of Starbucks.
Pat, we really appreciate your willingness to share your time and thoughts with us
today. I'm certainly looking forward to discussing the business with you.
Pat is going to make a few opening remarks, and then we'll have a more informal
conversation following his comments.
So with that, welcome, Pat. And thank you for participating.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone.
There are three thoughts that I'd like to share ahead of our chat with reference to
some slides that we're posting to our IR website, highlighting key points that are
further detailed in the 8-K that we ﬁled this morning to maintain transparency with all
Starbucks stakeholders regarding the journey we're on as we respond to the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic and further position the company for long-term growth.
Three points to highlight.
Number one, Starbucks sales and proﬁts are recovering nicely. The worst is clearly
behind us.
Number two, Starbucks' liquidity position remains strong, bridging us to free cash
ﬂow positive as we exit our ﬁscal third quarter.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 2 of 16And number three, Starbucks is capitalizing on an opportunity to accelerate the
strategic repositioning of our U.S. urban store base for future growth, supporting our
double-digit EPS growth model for the long term.
So I'd like to make just a couple of comments about each one of these three points.
So starting with sales and proﬁt recovery. As we've reopened our stores, we've seen
solid sequential improvement in sales, led by our two lead growth markets, China
and the U.S. Bearing in mind that China is about two months ahead of the U.S. on the
COVID-19 journey, China exited the month of May with weekly comps down 14%,
well up from the weekly low of about minus 90% in mid-February. This is much
better than we had expected.
So we've raised our outlook for China's Q3 comp accordingly compared to the
guidance provided with our Q2 earnings report in early May.
The U.S. exited the month of May with weekly comps down 32%, nicely up from the
weekly low of about minus 65% in mid-April and trending ahead of prior
expectations. And as sales are improving, so is our margin performance, as we have
better visibility to sales and are better positioned to manage store-level proﬁtability.
So the second point as to our solid liquidity position. We issued $3 billion of bonds
in May at very attractive rates, covering our ﬁscal third quarter free cash ﬂow deﬁcit,
protecting two quarters of dividend payments as we turn the corner to free cash ﬂow
positive at the end of our ﬁscal third quarter and prefunding bond maturities that
come due next ﬁscal year. And importantly we have a clear path to meet our
leverage target of 3x rent-adjusted EBITDA in the latter part of ﬁscal 2021.
And the third point, accelerated strategic repositioning of our U.S. urban store base.
The second pillar of our 3-point "Bridge to the Future" is an accelerated
transformation of the third place, adapting the Starbucks Experience to cater to
consumers' increasing demand for convenience. Planning for this initiative has been
underway over the past two years, and we had contemplated an implementation
time frame of three to ﬁve years.
But now we're accelerating that to two to three years. This includes accelerating
some store closures to pave the way for repositioned assets.
So again, three points -- sales and proﬁt recovery; solid liquidity position; and
accelerated strategic positioning for growth.
With that, Chris, I'm happy to take your questions.

Thanks, Pat. I wanted to start by just discussing the path to recovery in China. The
company, as you mentioned, improved its comparable sales guidance for China in
the third quarter. I'd like to see if you could just elaborate on what drove the better
sales outlook. And what's needed to get the comparable sales to ﬂattish by ﬁscal
year-end?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We could not be more pleased with how the business in China has been recovering.
Of course the ﬁrst step of that was rapidly reopening stores as market conditions
and government guidelines would allow and pivoting quickly to accommodate
customers' new expectations around physical distancing.
So the team moved quickly to accommodate customers how they wanted to be met,
and that included dialing up our focus on Mobile Order & Pay and the mobile order
for delivery.
So as we mentioned in our 8-K, we saw nice improvement compared to pre-COVID-
19 levels that appear to be fairly sticky in terms of the extent to which consumers are
pivoting to more of a Mobile Order & Pay or mobile order for delivery experience.
So we're pleased with how the team has pivoted in that regard.
They also moved quickly to bring new product news, new innovation around both
food and beverages, highlighting our commitment to plant-based milk alternatives
as well as plant-based proteins. And these messages have resonated well with
Chinese consumers. And as the markets increasingly open up, we're seeing good
progression.
As you would expect, there is some variability across the portfolio. In those trade
areas that are more tourist and transportation related, particularly in the Tier 1 cities,
we're seeing softer recovery, but we're seeing very strong recovery in commercial
areas across all cities. And overall, the lower-tier cities are performing better, but
we're very pleased with the progression.
Now you asked about how we're going to achieve what our current outlook is by
way of getting back to about ﬂat by the end of the fourth quarter. And it's more of
the same.
It's continuing to evolve and innovate our mobile oﬀerings, including our Starbucks
Rewards program, where we've recently introduced multi-tier redemption, very
similar to what we rolled out here in the U.S. last year; as well as continuing to bring
new news to our products, both beverages and food.

Page 4 of 16A - Patrick Grismer
A - Christopher O’Cull
A - Patrick GrismerThat's helpful. In light of your expectation for China comps to trend ﬂat by the end of
the fourth quarter, your guidance for the International segment seems to suggest a
weaker recovery in Japan, even though there's -- 98% of the stores are open there
today. Can you speak to what is happening in Japan and how the company thinks
about its recovery in comparison to what you're seeing in China?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Absolutely. The impacts to Japan lagged the impacts in China.
It was more towards the middle to end of March into April that we began to see
signiﬁcant pressure in Japan. And the Prime Minister declared a state of emergency,
which eﬀectively put the country in near-complete lockdown. And so we had nearly
all of our stores closed in Japan for an extended period of time.
And to provide a bit of insight into the impact that, that has, we don't have a very
high percentage of drive-through stores in Japan, and we're not as well penetrated
with mobile ordering and payment or delivery. And so that limited our ability to
capture sales during that period of near lockdown, and that explains why Japan
performed less well than either China or the U.S. at the depth of the crisis.
It was around the middle of May that the state of emergency was lifted. And the
team did a remarkable job of rapidly reopening stores in Japan, and we could not
be more pleased with how the business is recovering following that broad
reopening.
But because Japan is a company-owned market for us or a company-operated
market, the deleverage on that near-complete shutdown for a period of about six
weeks has weighed heavily on our Q3 results in terms of both revenue and proﬁt.
And that does roll up, and that's what is perhaps weighing down the international
comp compared to what some might have expected, given the very strong recovery
that we're seeing in China.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
I assume you're expecting Japan to follow some kind of a similar recovery pace
maybe as China, just delayed a couple of months.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
I don't think that it would be the same as China. We've even signaled that the U.S.
will take a bit more time to fully recover compared to China for diﬀerent reasons. I
think it's too early to say whether Japan will recover along the same curve as China.
We do expect these markets broadly to demonstrate what might be characterized as
a checkmark recovery or an asymmetrical V, where there's a sharp downturn
followed by a prolonged recovery, but recovery nonetheless.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 16A - Christopher O’Cull
A - Patrick GrismerBut I think it's early to call Japan is recovering as quickly as China, maybe more in
line with the U.S.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
Perfect. And now I want to turn to the U.S. recovery path.
First, can you help us understand the underlying dynamics of the comp sales results
in the opened U.S. stores?
I know on April 28, open stores were comping down, I think, 25% with half of the
locations opened. In your release this morning, open stores were comping down
28% with 91% of the stores opened.
So are you seeing underlying improvements in the stores that have been in the pool
of open stores longer, maybe just oﬀset by more recent opening stores entering that
base at a weaker level? Or are you seeing a more uniform run rate across all open
stores around that negative 25% to 30% level?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Very good question, Chris.
I think it's important to bear in mind that for a period of about six weeks, we had
anywhere from 45% to 50% of our stores open in the U.S., those that had drive-
throughs or that could accommodate delivery, a very small number of cafés that
were open to support ﬁrst-line responders.
And so as we very signiﬁcantly and very swiftly reopened stores in the second week
of May, that drove some measure of sales transfer from stores that have been
opened and operating during the period of widespread closure. And that sales
transfer was absorbed by the entire system as we reached now more than 95% of
stores open in the U.S.
So as we look at the performance overall of the market, we're actually very pleased.
And compared to what we were anticipating at the time that we reported our Q2
earnings and gave some qualitative guidance in relation to a U.S. recovery, we're
running ahead of expectations.
As you would expect, again, much like China, there's signiﬁcant variability across the
country. We have some regions that are actually comping in the single digits
negative as well as several that are in the mid-teens negative. I would highlight the
New York metro area is the most challenged, in part because half of the stores that
remain closed currently are in the New York metro area.
So that weighs on comp performance, given that for comp reporting purposes, we
do fully include closed stores, which are basically at minus 100%.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 16A - Christopher O’Cull
A - Patrick GrismerSo a lot of variability, but overall, moving in the right direction and ahead of our prior
expectations.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
The company is targeting comp sales down 10% to 20% in the fourth quarter in the
U.S., while open locations, I think, are running down 28% in the recent week. What
internal or external variables are really critical for you to be able to achieve that
target?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Three things. I would highlight, ﬁrst of all, the high level of engagement of our
partners -- of our store partners and what they deliver by way of an extraordinary
experience for our customers. That is the number one driver of our business.
So in addition to the improving sales, what gives us a lot of conﬁdence is that we're
seeing record-high customer connection scores. Customers are thrilled to reengage
with the brand. They're having a wonderful experience engaging with our partners.
I suppose another indication would be that tips are at an all-time high.
So we're seeing strong engagement that remains on an upward trajectory. That gives
us a lot of conﬁdence for the future.
The second would be how we're quickly innovating to establish new channels of
distribution in our stores.
So while some regions remain under some restrictions around physical distancing,
we have been able to innovate entryway pickup or window handoﬀ, in addition to
where we have drive-throughs, also driving delivery with special oﬀers through our
partnership with Uber Eats.
So the new channel innovation, if you will, would be the second factor.
The third would be our marketing support. We went dark in the U.S. for a period of
about six weeks. And then a couple of weeks after we had very signiﬁcantly very
dramatically ramped up store openings, more than 3,000 stores inside of two weeks
we opened up for business, we then came behind that with very strong marketing
support, advertising, promotions through Starbucks Rewards to reward customers
for increasing their frequency, for increasing their spend.
Alongside that, new marketing message, highlighting what we call our Summer 1
promotion. We had eﬀectively delayed what was part of sort of a Spring two
promotion. That evolved into a Summer 1 promotion with new product news around
both beverages and food, and consumers have responded well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 16A - Christopher O’Cull
A - Patrick Grismer
A - Christopher O’Cull
A - Patrick GrismerSo it would be all three of those levers: continued strong customer experience,
given the extent to which that drives our sales; continued innovation, including
things like curbside delivery in order to increasingly meet customers where they're at
in the current environment; and then number three, continued strong marketing and
product innovation support.
We anticipate that continuing through to the end of the ﬁscal year. And that
underpins our belief in the guidance we gave regarding Q4 and full year comps for
the U.S. business.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
Does the company believe that restaurants can fully recover their pre-crisis sales
volumes without fully utilizing the dining room capacity?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
It's early to say. I think it's going to depend quite a lot based on trade area and what
are the primary drivers of traﬃc in that trade area. For example, in dense urban
metro markets that are more dependent on customer commuting traﬃc, where
those customer patterns or behaviors have been disrupted because more people
are working from home, I think it will be more challenging to recover that traﬃc. In
the U.S., our urban stores account for about 15% of our total portfolio, and we are
seeing varying levels of recovery.
But it is that morning peak in those particular markets that will be more challenging
to recover for Starbucks.
We are seeing some of that traﬃc move to suburban markets. If people are working
from home, they're taking time out of their workday to visit their local Starbucks for
the habit or the visit that they were previously accustomed to satisfying near their
workplace. And then, of course we're moving quickly to drive delivery and to open
up other channels of distribution to meet customers where they are and where they
want to receive their Starbucks.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
That's great. Now Pat, I'd like to spend some time digging into the company's
transformational plan to address growing demand for these on-the-go occasions. I
know you described how this eﬀort will result in a new store format.
But can you describe how the customer experience will be diﬀerent in one of these
new Starbucks pickup locations?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yes. And ﬁrst to clarify, we are going to be picking up the pace of development
compared to our previous plans for these new units. They will, however not
dominate the Starbucks landscape in these markets. These will supplement ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 16A - Christopher O’Cull
A - Patrick Grismer
A - Christopher O’Culltraditional cafés to provide a range of retail formats that will best cater to the needs
of customers in those trade areas.
So we do anticipate there will be a bit of a network eﬀect here where customers can
have a diﬀerent type of experience, depending on what their need state is in a
particular market at a particular time of day. Because we know that the same
Starbucks customer has diﬀerent experiences depending on where they're at in their
daily lives.
So the same customer who might enjoy a sit-and-stay occasion at one of our cafés at
a -- on a diﬀerent day or at a diﬀerent time of day, in the same or an adjacent trade
area, may be looking for a more convenient option that can be satisﬁed by doing a
walk-through basically order ahead and pay through the Starbucks mobile app, sail
through the Starbucks pickup location, pick up their beverage and go on their way.
No diﬀerent from what they're currently experiencing in one of our cafés.
But with the retail format, it will be less crowded and that will cater speciﬁcally to this
type of occasion, and that will be set up for enhanced operating eﬃciency.
We will also be able to satisfy mobile orders for delivery from these locations or
other locations, traditional cafés included, in these trade areas.
So we anticipate in these densely populated urban metro trade areas that there will
be a transformation of the estate in the next couple of years that will include the
introduction of the Starbucks pickup stores mixing in with existing locations,
replacing some of those existing locations, which is why we also signaled an
accelerated store closure program over these next two years as part of this overall
transformation eﬀort.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
Just to clarify, will the pickup locations only accept digital orders?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Currently they accept both in-store and digital. The longer-term vision would be that
it would be digital-only. That's how it's set up in China with a similar concept called
Starbucks Now.
But it will depend on how customer behavior continues to evolve. We certainly don't
want to turn away customer traﬃc. And we think that it may take some time for
customers in these trade areas to migrate completely to Mobile Order & Pay.
So we are set up currently and we anticipate the ﬁrst set of units would still receive
orders in the store.

Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 16A - Patrick Grismer
A - Christopher O’Cull
A - Patrick Grismer
A - Christopher O’CullGreat. Could you outline what operational eﬃciencies you may be able to capture
with this new strategy of introducing Starbucks pickups to markets, maybe in terms
of how it reduces congestion? And do you ultimately expect the ability to increase
oﬀ-premise throughput in these markets where you introduce these new formats?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We do. The reality is that when you set up a coﬀee bar that is in plain view of the
customer, it's not set up for maximum operating eﬃciency. And so one of the
beneﬁts of the pickup location where the beverage preparation still handled order
by order, customized to what the customers' preferences are, still prepared by hand,
handcrafted every single beverage, that happens behind the wall, if you will, out of
view of the customer and the -- it could be set up more like an assembly line, thereby
supporting more rapid preparation. And that brings inherent operating eﬃciency.
And then, of course with what would be a smaller asset overall without seating area,
that enhances the ﬁxed cost proﬁle of the store, which further contributes to an
improved margin proﬁle.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
Will the results at the pickup store alone be used to evaluate whether it's an
investment success? Or will you -- will there be more of a holistic approach to the
total sales across, say, the pickup store and the one or two traditional locations that
it's situated between?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
It will be a holistic approach for sure. And that speaks to the complexity of the
analysis and a bit to the pacing of our rollout as well. Because we fully expect to
learn as we go and to further reﬁne our plans in relation to the speciﬁc locations, the
setup, the interplay between these diﬀerent formats based on how customers are
continuing to evolve their behavior.
But we are looking trade area by trade area, taking into account sales transfer
dynamics as we close stores and then reopen. And in many cases, what we're
looking to do is not close stores until we have opened the new store that we expect
to receive sales from that closed location, recognizing that not only the new location
but other existing locations in the trade area will be the beneﬁciaries of that sales
transfer.
So I feel very good about the extraordinary data analytics capability that our team
has developed and the ability to rapidly learn and adjust as we go as we accelerate
these plans over the next couple of years.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
Are there insights that have led you -- or led the company to conclude that the
overall sales potential for the trade area, once you introduce one of these newFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 16A - Patrick Grismer
A - Christopher O’Cull
A - Patrick Grismerlocations, could increase as a result of adding the distribution point? Or is this more
of a tactic of trying to maintain the sales that you have in those markets?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We expect to see sales go up for two reasons. Number one is that as we introduce a
more eﬃcient format that has a higher level of productivity that can serve customers
faster, we will reduce the bulking that can, at times, occur in these urban locations
because of the natural speed, if you will, of the current traditional format.
So we do expect to be able to unlock sales through improved eﬃciency.
The other would be is that with a more nimble asset format, we can gain retail
presence in certain trade areas or sub-trade areas that we couldn't previously with
our more traditional format. We do expect that in the near term, as we accelerate
these eﬀorts, that we will see pressure on sales, and that would be in ﬁscal 2021, but
that we would then reaccelerate in ﬁscal 2022.
So as a consequence of the closures and the timing of the closures in relation to the
openings, we would see near-term revenue decline in those trade areas, however
enhanced proﬁtability because we're eﬀectively trading out less proﬁtable stores
and, in some cases, unproﬁtable stores with much more proﬁtable stores.
So we're solving for the bottom line as we're solving for the top line in terms of
maintaining our share and growing our share over time while enhancing the
proﬁtability of the business.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
Okay. We did get a question come across from listeners. The question relates to the
planned closings for -- the 400 planned closings. I think the question essentially is
trying to get to what do you expect the net additional or net opening rate to be
when you incorporate the number of openings versus closures over the next 12
months. And then I know longer term, the company guided to 3% to 4% unit growth
in the U.S. Is that the net addition rate? Or is that the opening rate?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So I'll speak to the net new store growth rate because it's on that basis that we
guide. And you're right, our long-term growth model calls for 3% to 4% net new
store growth in the U.S. and for the Americas business segment. We expect to be on
that pace in ﬁscal 2022. We will not be on that pace in ﬁscal 2021, but we expect to
be positive.
But it will not be 3% to 4% because of the volume of closures that we're pulling
forward in both the U.S. and Canada.
So we will provide more explicit guidance for ﬁscal '21 when we provide our full
range of guidance for next ﬁscal year in conjunction with our Q4 earnings call.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10

Perfect. Many people believe working from home will become the new normal for at
least a portion of the U.S. workforce. Does the repositioning of stores help reduce
reliance on the commuter business?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
It does. It does to some degree -- in part because we're rightsizing our assets to
meet the type of demand that we expect in the metro markets. And as I mentioned
earlier, we're seeing some pickup in residential drive-throughs, catering to people
who are working from home out of the cities.
But we also know for a lot of professionals who work in the cities, they live in the
cities, too. And their Starbucks location -- because we're well penetrated in those
markets, that it was closer to where they live in the city -- is beneﬁting from some
business that they didn't have before, while the locations closer to maybe the
commercial centers are experiencing some pressure. And that is all ﬁguring into
what we call our trade area transformation strategy for U.S. urban markets in the next
couple of years.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
So I know Starbucks take -- their approach is always holistic and very comprehensive
and thoughtful when they implement new strategies like this.
I mean in this environment with less commuting, what other changes does the brand
potentially need to make beside just the store format or the location to make -- to
remain relevant in an environment with less commuting?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, less commuting means that consumers may be consuming in a diﬀerent trade
area because they're not commuting to their oﬃce, but they're closer to home.
So whether continuing to build drive-throughs in suburban markets, and that
remains a signiﬁcant element of our longer-term growth strategy in the U.S., given
penetration levels, relative penetration levels in suburban markets or the advent of
curbside delivery or at-home delivery. Because with our partnership through Uber
Eats, we've seen some growth, not to the extent that we've seen in China, but
nonetheless encouraging growth in our delivery business. And we do believe that,
that is something that will grow over time.
So it's by continuing to innovate the retail format to oﬀer convenience to consumers
who are, as you mentioned -- or maybe increasingly working from home or also
meeting them at their home without occasion through delivery.

A - Christopher O’CullWhat would it take for the company to accelerate growth in the delivery channel,
particularly in dense urban settings? Is it packaging, delivery kitchens, maybe
commission rates that are diﬀerent?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
I think it's going to be customer behavior. We're just not seeing customer -- broad
customer acceptance of or migration to a delivered beverage occasion. Again, very
diﬀerent from what we're seeing in China.
But we have seen improvements as we've gone to national coverage and certainly
helped by some of the more recent promotion we've been doing in partnership with
Uber Eats.
So I just think that the delivered beverage occasion compared to the delivered meal
occasion, it doesn't seem to be as relevant to customers in the current environment.
But we know that customers are dynamic. We know that over time, they're looking
for more convenience.
So we anticipate that this is something that will grow over time.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
What do you believe are the biggest obstacles for consumers desiring coﬀee
delivered or beverages delivered?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
It could be, as you mentioned, the commission in relation to the ticket size.
So commission having a ﬁxed and variable component in relation to the ticket size
for a full meal, it's a more attractive economic proposition from a consumer
perspective, less so for a single beverage. Now we are seeing in our delivery
business an increased order size, oftentimes with higher rates of food attached,
which speaks to the fact that people are looking for a delivered meal or they're
doing group ordering.
In either case, I think that demonstrates that they may be focused on how they can
maximize the return on their investment in the delivery fee and/or commission.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
As you mentioned and Kevin mentioned in the "Bridge to the Future" letter, he
called out more drive-throughs as a possible result of the repositioning. I think about
60% of your U.S. company stores currently have a drive-through.
So how much could that increase by -- that mix increase in the U.S.?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 13 of 16A - Patrick Grismer
A - Christopher O’Cull
A - Patrick Grismer
A - Christopher O’Cull{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well I think the best way to respond to that question is to highlight the mix of our
new store development that is drive-through, which is around 80%. And that may
increase over time.
So as you're mixing in new stores at a much higher rate, that should give some
indication as to how we would expect that overall percentage from 60% to continue
to increase over time.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
Great. And then we did have a couple of questions come through, one regarding
portfolio optimization outside of the U.S. How do you foresee the portfolio
optimization unfolding outside of the U.S. for licensed locations? And overall, what is
the CapEx you're allocating to this optimization eﬀort?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So outside the U.S., in our company-owned markets, we are already evolving in
China with the Starbucks Now concept, about 10 units opened today. Another 40 to
50 will be added between now and the end of the year, I believe.
So some nice progress there. I don't know if that's so much trade area optimization
as it is mixing in a new format in a high-growth market in a way that continues to
cater to the growing customer need state of convenience.
In our other markets -- company-operated markets like Japan and the U.K., I think it's
-- it doesn't seem to be as much of an opportunity currently compared to what is so
compelling in the U.S., given the current proﬁle of our retail presence in dense urban
markets.
So I don't know that there's as much of an opportunity there. Plus, those are much
smaller markets.
What I would highlight, and it was mentioned in our 8-K, not so much portfolio
optimization from the standpoint of how we mix in new retail formats.
But we did highlight for Canada, which is another company-operated market, that
we will be pursuing a restructuring of that business in the next two years. And that
would involve the acceleration of up to 200 store closures, and that is more about
addressing underperforming locations and consolidating our operations there in a
fashion that will improve the overall proﬁtability of that business.

And just to stay on licensed -- or to talk about licensed locations brieﬂy how has the
crisis changed the returns on new licensed units? And have licensees indicated they
maybe are planning to alter their growth plans, either in the U.S. or Europe? AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10

Page 14 of 16A - Patrick Grismeralso, can you talk a little bit about what kind of relief you've been able to provide
them and how long that may persist?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
No change to long-term growth plans or expectations because our licensees
believe, as we do, that the current circumstances are temporary. There will be
recovery in time.
It may take longer in some markets versus others, but the early indications are that
consumers have deep love for Starbucks. They're intensely loyal. They can't wait to
reengage. And over time as markets open up and people adjust to the new normal
and as we provide the safe experience that our partners and customers expect, we
and our licensees expect that the new unit returns will remain very attractive. And
therefore, no change to long-term growth expectations.
But the near-term impacts are signiﬁcant. As we've disclosed for our third quarter, at
the depth of the crisis, the month of April in particular, but then continuing but
abating in May. And now, of course we're anticipating June to be closer to
breakeven and then free cash ﬂow-positive by the end of our ﬁscal third quarter, end
of June.
So things are moving in a very positive direction.
But because of those temporary circumstances, we saw the need for some of our
license partners for additional support. We deferred payments on outstanding
receivables to provide cash ﬂow relief. We granted ﬂexibility around inventory
ordering. We granted ﬂexibility around development commitments and renovation
commitments. Not erasing those comments, but giving some ﬂexibility around
timing and meeting those commitments.
And then the other thing we did in Q3 alone was we typically applied extraordinary
step of granting a royalty holiday to our international licensees.
So not just the deferral of royalties owed, but in view of the impacts to markets
around the world, we granted a complete holiday. That means no royalty income on
licensees' sales in Q3. That's fully reﬂected in our -- in the guidance we provided this
morning for Q3 EPS.
We feel very good about steps we've taken to take care of our licensees as important
business partners as well as so many other stakeholders. We've taken care of our
partners, making signiﬁcant investments, industry-leading investments around
partner care during a time of crisis, and that is reﬂected in our Q3 operating results.
But we feel good about those investments, consistent with our mission and values as
a company. And we remain very conﬁdent that there will be a strong return on that
investment in the form of partner engagement and customer goodwill.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-10

saw the need and our ability to make meaningful investments to further deepen the
partnership. We also took steps to protect key strategic suppliers by accelerating
payments to them during the time of crisis. My treasurer has reminded me that it put
us in an interesting squeeze position where we deferred receivables but accelerated
payables, but that was something we did knowingly and intentionally in order to take
care of license partners, supplier partners as well as our store partners and then, of
course the communities we serve through very signiﬁcant grants around community
service.
{BIO 15071112 <GO>}
Great. And then just one last question. And we've heard the company describe the
Global Coﬀee Alliance as one of the more underappreciated aspects of the
company. Prior to the crisis, I think guidance called for the Channel Development
segment to contribute more signiﬁcantly to total revenue growth after ﬁscal '22 than
the 4% to 6% intermediate-term rate. Has the crisis altered the outlook for this
business in any way?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Not materially. There have been a couple of things moving in opposite directions.
We announced earlier this year a modiﬁed relationship with KDP in relation to the
pod manufacturing in conjunction with our Global Coﬀee Alliance with Nestlé,
delivering favorable economics this year ﬂowing through the Channel Development
business. That has been oﬀset by relative softness in the foodservice channel of the
Global Coﬀee Alliance. Think hotels and universities where foodservice is provided,
those channels have been under pressure. And then, of course that has been
somewhat oﬀset by the tailwind in grocery stores, who saw extraordinary sales in the
third quarter.
So things moving in diﬀerent directions, pretty much netting to ﬂat versus our prior
expectations. We're really pleased with the progress we're making through our
Global Coﬀee Alliance with Nestlé to expand the presence of the Starbucks brand in
so many markets around the world; and in partnership with Nestlé and their world-
class innovation, bringing forward new products that are helping to grow the overall
business.
So no change versus prior expectations.

Great. And Pat, I want to thank you again for your time today. This has been a very
helpful discussion, and we look forward to hearing about the business -- how the
business is progressing when we have the opportunity to speak again.
But again, appreciate your time.
