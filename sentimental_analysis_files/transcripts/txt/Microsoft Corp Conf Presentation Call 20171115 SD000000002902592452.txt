Presentation
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Okay. We'll go ahead and get everyone seated so we can keep going. I know it's
starting to get late in the afternoon. So I -- okay, I feel like I'm in my house. This is like
talking to my kids.
Okay. So we're going to go ahead and get started if everyone wants to get seated.
And welcome, Takeshi Numoto, up to the stage. Very happy to have Takeshi with us
from Microsoft. He is in charge of one of the -- well, he's the Corporate Vice
President for Cloud & Enterprise, which has obviously really transformed the entire
story at Microsoft.
I picked up coverage of Microsoft, I think it was in 2002 when I was at Hambrecht &
Quist/JPMorgan right at the beginning of covering the software group. And it was
just such a completely diﬀerent story. We were still talking about NT. And we were
prepping for the Oﬃce 2003 cycle and all of these diﬀerent things. And that still, to
some extent, informs bits and pieces of the story. But what Takeshi and his team have
done on the Cloud & Enterprise side is transform the entire technology industry. And
so we're very lucky to have him today to go through the story.
I'm going to read some safe harbor comments which is, before we begin, Microsoft
may make some forward-looking statements during this presentation. And you
should refer to their SEC ﬁlings to the risk factors relating to their business. That's
true whether you're here in person or listening on the Web. And those of you that
are on the Web, thank you as well for joining us.
So with that, I'll welcome Takeshi up. And thanks so much for coming.

So I guess, where I'd like to start. And we've got some detailed questions. But -- is to
maybe talk about where you're spending your time. And very speciﬁcally, you've got
a wide purview, you've got one of the most exciting businesses at Microsoft, cuts
across a lot of diﬀerent product areas. What are you focused on right now? What are
your top priorities? And how does that inform how you're thinking about the strategy
of the business in general?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well ﬁrst of all, it's great to be here. Thanks for having me. And from a focus priority
standpoint, we're very, very committed to growing our server and cloud revenue by
double digits. We saw 17% growth in Q1 and led by a lot of cloud growth through
Azure. But it's something we want to continue to go drive. You mentioned NT back in
the days. I've been at the company 20 years now. And it's been an amazing privilege
to be part of this amazing journey. Started as an engineer on Windows NT, I've been
in my current role as a Corporate Vice President of Cloud & Enterprise Marketing
that basically is responsible for sort of Azure, Windows Servers, SQL Servers and all
the products that go into your server and cloud bucket, for those of you that are
here, as well as the Dynamics business application that gets reported as part of the
productivity space from an external reporting segment standpoint. But -- and I've
been in this role for about six years now. And prior to that, I worked on Oﬃce and
Oﬃce 365. And so for at least the last 10 years or so, I feel like I've been working on
cloud, cloud, cloud and driving cloud growth on a long journey. It's amazing.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
So I want to -- I'll start with Azure. And then I'll move to Servers and then to
Dynamics. But as you're thinking about your day to day right now, you're spending
most of your time with -- excuse me, I'm sorry, I've been sneezing a little bit. But
you've been spending most of your time with customers, at this point trying to still
proselytize the Azure story, or are you more inward-facing in terms of what you've
been spending your time on recently?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think it's -- I feel like I sort of do a lot of running back and forth. What I mean by that
is running to the front lines of our customer and partner engagements. Last week, I
spent a week on the road, probably met with 30, 40 partners and customers in a
series of weeks. So still continuing to really get a sense of what's really happening on
the front lines of our customer and partner engagements. And at the same time, I
come back to the corporate and spending a lot of time with the development team,
thinking about road map and our business strategy. So my role really does sort of
cause me to go back and forth a lot.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Right. We were just -- just thinking about sort of how the partner ecosystem evolved
before I get speciﬁcally in the Azure questions. But it's a very diﬀerent partner model.
I mean I remember back in the day when you should think about your 600,000FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

A - Takeshi Numotoreseller channels, one of Microsoft's core strengths. But now with the Azure story and
the cloud story, what partners are doing are very -- it's a very diﬀerent story. And Red
Hat was just here talking about embedding cloud services into OpenShift. And you
have a whole diﬀerent set of possibilities with respect to your partner ecosystem.
What are some of the stories or use cases that are evolving that are really getting the
most traction, the most mind share in the ecosystem?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well I think every customer's journey to the cloud is very unique. And so we have a
lot of eﬀort spanning a broad range of areas to sort of meet them where they're at.
Sometimes, customers want to basically sort of think of it as appending cloud
capabilities to what they already have on-prem. So it might just be around adding
monitoring and management or backup or doing disaster recovery using Azure as a
secondary site. That might be the most sort of basic ﬁrst step. So there may be
customers who -- there are customers who are really thinking about much more
cloud-centric and rearchitecting their applications and deploying them to Azure or
Azure Stack if they want more deployment ﬂexibility. And so we're seeing that on the
other extreme. Then there's a large portion in the middle where customers are really
thinking about migrating their workload to Azure. And there, we try to meet them by
essentially making that kind of a migration of workload (maybe) by both in
technology. So we have Azure Migrate, which is a service that helps customers
migrate their virtual machines and also working with partner solutions as well as
database migration service that again that enables customers to migrate their
database to Azure. So those are all technology investments we're making. Then
we're also making sort of what I think of as a business model investment to help
customers in that transition, for example, Azure Hybrid Beneﬁt is a beneﬁt we oﬀer to
customers who have Software Assurance on their software license estate. So that if
you have Software Assurance on your -- and if you're an annuity customer on your
Windows Server, for example, we give you a substantial discount, actually savings of
up to 40%, to basically run your Windows Server virtual machines in Azure. And so
combined with the migration beneﬁts in terms of technology we deliver but also the
business beneﬁt. And so whether it's sort of appending Azure to your sort of on-
prem estate to full-on rearchitecting your application to sort of migration of your
existing workloads, we want to have a solution that we work really hard to and to
meet customers where they're at.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
How do you think about the mix of those use cases? And the reason I ask is that I do
think that people still perceive what's happening with Azure as a lot of new workload
development. Maybe there is some lift and shift but maybe not that much at this
point. But is that true? And are you starting to see more of that migration work?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes. Like of the 3 patterns I mentioned, all 3 are growing. When you think about the
overall customer's journey to the cloud, like the overall journey of the market, I think
we're still in early innings. And so all of the 3 types of use cases are all growing in its
own right. And we want to continue to address that. And we're also seeing even in
sort of the -- what you would refer to as sort of a migration kind of workload, biggerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

Q - Adam Hathaway Holtworkloads to come to Azure, it might be that if you ask me, let's say, two years ago,
you may have had many customer engagements around, let's say, dev test of their
ERP estate, as an example. Today, we're seeing some of our largest customers move
their production and safety workloads to Azure. And so what's getting migrated is
becoming bigger and more substantial and more mission-critical. And that's also
driving growth as well.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
You say you're seeing production workloads of SAP move to Azure?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes, really.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
So there really is a...
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
It's not just SAP, like it's just an example of more mission-critical big workloads that
have a lot of consumption associated with it.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
As you said, I can't really think about it. And maybe there's some trading applications
but there aren't that many examples of applications that would be more complex,
more processing-intensive or data-intensive than an SAP ERP application. That's
interesting. And why do you think that is? Is that just -- is that about customer
references? Is it about scalability? Is it about location and proximity? What's really
driving that?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well I do think it's sort of hard to attribute to one factor, it's a conﬂuence of many
things. I do think there is an increasing openness and conﬁdence that customers
have in their use of the cloud. They've been on their cloud journey for a while. And
they are becoming more familiarized and comfortable with the vectors. Both there
the -- maturity side, both on the customer side and on the vendor side. There's also,
like I think, increasing recognition in the cloud as a place where you can really realize
very high agility and sort of dynamic changes that you need. And so as people think
about some technologies that this cloud becomes much more of a mainstream
conversation in the dialogue.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
So in your view then, I mean, if you have SAP, large SAP workloads on Azure, there
really is no limitation on what you can migrate from on-premise into the Azure
environment?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

We certainly would have the conversation with the customer, "Hi. we really can take
on your big workloads and things like ERP or SAP," is a good example of that.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
I know you just used SAP as the example. But are you seeing -- are there any
technical limitations of doing the same thing with Oracle or the same thing with
some of the big industry applications?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Whether it be ISV applications, we work with ISVs like Temenos to have their banking
applications run on Azure. Like I said, we have increasing repertoire of examples of
highly big mission-critical workloads coming to Azure.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Okay. And in those environments, maybe walk me through a typical example, are
they going to be using typically infrastructure services? Are they going to be typically
migrating a database? Are they going to be typically using some of your adjunct
platform services to be building connectivity to other on-premise applications or
data services? How would you -- walk us through maybe an example of what that
would look like in practice from a usage perspective.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Again, like I said, the cloud journey is unique for every customer. But when you move
a major workload, you deﬁnitely have lots of adjacencies that gets pulled through
with it. You don't move just your core workload, well, because your core workload
now has a lot of data now that sits in the cloud. So it's natural as a next step for most
customers to think about essentially applying a lot of the data technologies to do
analytics against the data that now resides in the cloud. So data is an adjacency that
we often see. Also these kind of core applications bring a lot of adjacent systems. So
you should have -- whether it's expense report or other systems that surround the
core application, then you actually have often new applications that get built,
whether it's mobile applications that hands oﬀ of it and stuﬀ like that. So it's not just
about the core workload. The adjacencies and the pull-through eﬀect is something
that we're seeing.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
If I were to take a step back and look at the Azure growth trajectory in general, again,
it's sort of a -- it's a tough question because there's so many diﬀerent inputs to it. But
you're on pace to outgrow AWS in a similar scale. Some of the biggest diﬀerences
appear to be, one, your positioning around hybrid; and two, your positioning around
premium services just as we were discussing the ability to move an SAP or an Oracle
workload ongoing workload into the cloud. Are those principal factors in your view
that are driving that higher growth?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

Well I certainly think that they are -- leadership in the enterprise space, it's certainly a
key factor in helping us. And we developed our products really with enterprises in
mind all the way to the way we deploy regions in Azure. So we have 42 regions
announced for Azure, which is more than any other cloud vendor, in part because we
want to address the enterprise customer need as being able to deploy their
applications and data close to the place of consumption that they need and also to
deal with the regulatory environment and the data residencies requirements that
they often have. So certainly, the enterprise focus that we have and the leadership
position we have with enterprises is a key factor. And you mentioned hybrid, which is
obviously another big factor. There are other vendors that are starting to talk about it
that we've been at this very consistently from the start because we don't initially think
of hybrid as an end state. You don't go through hybrid, end all up in the cloud. We
don't think of this as a transitionary state. We actually think of hybrid as the state that
will be the state for the long haul because, as you may have heard about Satya talk
about intelligent cloud and Intelligent Edge, we believe that as computing becomes
ever more ubiquitous, computing becomes powerful both in the cloud but also on
the edge, too. And because of our assets both as a cloud provider -- but we're not
only a cloud-only player, we also can deliver software that can essentially work
harmoniously with the services we provide in the cloud to enable new scenarios.
And so that's been a key diﬀerentiator. And also if you should think about products
like Azure Stack, it's been getting a lot of customer interest. And we're feeling really
sort of bullish about the approach that we're taking. And for us, hybrid isn't just
about connectivity or colo, it's really providing a consistent platform for the
customer, whether it be around the identity platform or the management plane or
the data technologies. Really having an end-to-end consistent platform is, I think, a
key requirement for customers as they move forward.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Okay. If you were to -- this may be an unfair question but if you were to look at your
cloud customers, what percentage would you say are leveraging some Microsoft on-
premise technology?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well certainly in the enterprise space, I think you'll be hard-pressed to ﬁnd
enterprise customers that have no Microsoft technology. And so they will have some.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Maybe let me (scope) that diﬀerently, that are using the Microsoft data center
technologies. So I'm not talking about somebody that might be using Oﬃce or
Windows on the desktop side, I'm talking about somebody that is using Microsoft
Server or Microsoft SQL or Microsoft BizTalk, something in the traditional data center
stack that is now leveraging Azure services. Is that most of the customers?

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 17Q - Adam Hathaway Holt
A - Takeshi NumotoWell if you think about enterprise. So again, I think it will be hard-pressed to ﬁnd
enterprise customers that don't have any Windows Server. They have -- they may use
-- as the mix of their estate, it might be high or low. But there are lots of customers
with high mix and -- but I think (I often pretty feel) that gives us a good engagement
point to talk to customers even if they use -- it's a small portion of their estate.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Okay. And just thinking about the way that the Azure business changes your position
for the application business, I mean, one question I get all the time or I see in some
of the press is that most of the new applications that are being built aren't being
built on C#. But they are being built on .NET. I don't know if that's true or not, I just --
you see that in the press a lot. But it seems like with Azure, there's the ability to kind
of reintermediate Microsoft with some of the newer applications that are being
developed because it's easier to run maybe nonnative applications in the Azure
footprint than it is to run an application that isn't built speciﬁcally for a Windows
Server. Is that true?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well we certainly are looking to meet developers where they are. So like we do that
on many fronts. So from an Azure perspective, we're at a point where about 40% of
virtual machines running in Azure data centers today are basically Linux virtual
machines. And we -- I would certainly personally expect that number to go up as we
move forward. And that -- it's not just about the operating system, we work really
hard and have made a lot of progress in supporting not just a variety of open source
operating systems but language framework, whether it be Node or Python or R or
database services like we have a managed database service for PostGraph or
MySQL. Today, we're announcing that we've joined Maria DB Foundation. And we
will oﬀer a Maria DB managed service as well. And so it's not just about the
operating system but also language and frameworks and data technologies that
we're supporting to essentially onboard as many developers as possible where --
and meet them where they are. Bring your skill. And you can use them as you -- that
your favorite tech is available to use in Azure. Then we're also extending capabilities
like .NET across platforms. So I hope you know that .NET is already available across
platforms. We've open sourced it. And we have tremendous amount of community
energy poured onto it. We've also extended the reach of our developer tools. So
when you think about our developer tools, Visual Studio code is something that
people are very -- giving us great feedback on as a development environment on
top of Linux or Mac for developers. And that's actually helping us reach more and
more developers. In fact, the number of active developers using Visual Studio have
expanded signiﬁcantly. So across all fronts, we're basically being much more
embracing a broader set of developers with the goal of onboarding them more to
Azure. And we're doing it at the service level, we're doing it at the language level like
open sourcing .NET and then also extending our tools because our -- as far as
(ground one) cloud is concerned, driving consumption is really our top (inaudible).
And that does lead to -- from people in this room and maybe on the call standpoint,
you might sort of characterize that as a patent expansion in the sense that we're now
then saying, "Hi. if you had been a Linux customer or an OSS database or a
MongoDB customer, or a Cassandra customer, we wouldn't have had anything to sell
you on-prem. Now we support MongoDB or Cassandra APIs on Cosmos DB or allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

Q - Adam Hathaway Holtsorts of language frameworks that we can now all harness on Azure. And you could
characterize that as a TAM expansion.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, that was kind of my point is that it seems like the positioning of the
business has completely changed as you -- so in addition to it being a functional
change in terms of what products you deliver and a delivery model change, it also
puts you in diﬀerent places in the technology development process. One of the
deals I worked at when I was at Qatalyst was we sold you Xamarin. So we are quite
into the sort of idea of reaching out to a broader base of mobile application
developers. But just going back to something you said. So 40% of virtual machines
are running in -- that are running in Azure are on Linux. And that number will go up.
Why do you think that is? Does that just have to do with the development -- sorry,
the adoption of open source? Or is there something that -- is there something
speciﬁc that is driving that number -- that's actually a higher number than I thought.
And it's actually -- it sounds like you think it will go even higher.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I would expect it to inch up over time, yes.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
And just why do you think that? Why do you think it's such a big use case for virtual
machines?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well a lot of the OSS workloads are often also fundamentally scaleout-based in
terms of the architecture. So it then tends to spawn more virtual machines as the
consumption grows as opposed to scale-up and have -- use bigger and more
proﬁtable virtual machines.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
So if a customer is running on a -- I'm just trying to think about your revenue
opportunity -- like I would much rather have you make $10 than no dollars. So being
able to monetize, like you said, Cassandra, MongoDB, that may not be the ﬁrst
choice, the ﬁrst choice would be Cosmos.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well Cosmos supports those APIs...
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
But -- so I think that's a terriﬁc strategy. But how does the economics change? So if
you have somebody that's running Linux in a virtual environment, what does that
mean in terms of your revenue opportunity set versus somebody that might be
running Windows in a Hyper-V environment and running a Windows stack instead of
a Linux stack? How does that change?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

Well in terms of the -- I just think of it as being additive. We didn't have an economic
opportunity with the people that are OSS-based before. And now we can oﬀer them
a service. And service consumption is how that gets monetized in the cloud.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Right. I guess, I'm trying to quantify it. So if you were to spend -- if you're taking a
customer that's spending $10 on a Microsoft stack, could you get $2 on somebody
that's running a Linux stack in Azure?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Oh, I don't know that, that like -- I don't necessarily think of this as a conversion from
right to left.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
No. I'm just saying it's additive. I'm just trying to quantify how additive it could be.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I don't think we can quote those numbers. I know you'll be interested in them.
(Chris)?
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Okay. I got to try. So well, you got to agree that it's additive.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
It is really...
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Yes. No. That's why I said I would much rather see you get $10 than where you were
getting no dollars. I think it's a much better play. And it's just -- it's a totally diﬀerent
positioning story within Azure than just about cloud workloads or moving Microsoft
from point A to point B. It's about moving Microsoft from point A to point B but also
putting Microsoft in front of point C to be able to move to point D. I mean, you're
getting into Linux and all these other diﬀerent things that you couldn't touch
otherwise. Platform lock-in is no longer an issue for you to your point. And so it
doesn't really matter what language you build in. And that's just a totally diﬀerent --
so the whole argument that, hey, new applications are being built on C# is garbage.

Q - Adam Hathaway Holt
A - Takeshi NumotoYes. Okay, got it. And so that's terriﬁc. Well then -- how important do you think it is to
be getting these big referenceable application customers onto Azure? Speciﬁcally,
the work you've done with Adobe has been very well publicized. Is it -- Google and
Salesforce just did a deal. Google, as far as we understand, that's really the ﬁrst
referenceable big application, cloud application vendor to run on GCP. How
important is it for you to get those kinds of companies onto Azure?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think getting applications, particularly business -- large business applications onto
Azure, is incredibly important because, again, there is a ﬂywheel eﬀect of business
estate being deposited in the cloud that then essentially creates gravity for more
data or more applications. And so that's certainly more important. And that's why
some of the examples, like the SAP one I mentioned or Adobe is a great example.
But we're continuing to work on enlisting more ISV partnerships to bring their
applications to Azure.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
When you migrate either an ISV to run on Azure -- so you can use Adobe as an
example, I know there are many others -- or when you have somebody move an SAP
or -- I don't know if you have a lot of work or workloads on Azure or not. But would
those fall into the category of premium services?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well it depends on what resources. Basically, our deﬁnition of premium services is
things that are beyond just basically raw compute and storage. So it could be
management services or security services, or it could be database services that are
managed in nature. So we have a managed database service for SQL or PostGraph
or in a managed NoSQL service like Cosmos DB. And all of those -- or IoT or -- those
are all -- fall into the premium bucket.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Right. So there's not really a classiﬁcation then around premium that is deﬁned by
either the scale of the app and the required...
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
It's more the type -- resource type, I would say.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Got it. If you look at your portfolio of premium use cases, I think Satya gets asked this
question if you look on every conference call and he tends to talk about AI, he tends
to talk about Cosmos. But I guess, there are 2 questions. How should we think about
this scale of the premium services relative to the whole? Is that 5% of the business? Is
it 10% of the business? And secondarily...

to speak.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Sorry, phone's going oﬀ. That's reminding me to ask you questions you can't answer.
But the -- okay, well, I'm just trying to get some -- a sense for the -- I mean, another
way to ask the question, which you probably won't be able to give either. But just in
terms of the magnitude of the growth, is there a way to talk about -- that wouldn't
really help us with the size. But is it possible to sort of characterize, well, 20% of our
growth is coming from premium services, something along those lines?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think the only thing really I remember us externally talking about in the premium
service is basically 13 consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth. So well, the Azure
itself has been near triple-digit growth. So both have been growing at a rapid rate.
But certainly, premium service has been outgrowing sort of overall Azure for a bit

And with respect to services that are popular, AI, IoT, Cosmos are some of the ones,
as I said, Satya talks about, is there a second generation that you think is going to
become, over the next two years, as popular?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think the ones you listed will continue to be a big driver of our premium growth.
The only other one I might mention would be management and security services
that are growing when you think about things like Enterprise Mobility Suite,
Enterprise Mobility and Security. Those are all based on (ADFS)capabilities we oﬀer
in Active Directory and delivering premium capabilities or device management
capabilities or application management capabilities. And this is where I think we also
see a lot of synergies with companies and customers picking the vendor that they
view as a strategic partner for their cloud journey. So it's not just an Azure discussion
but it's really a Microsoft Cloud discussion. As they think about their journey, I think I
see increasingly more and more customers are thinking about think holistically. And
that's boding well for us because when you think about Fortune 500 companies, we
talk about 90% of those customers using Microsoft Cloud. But perhaps the one that I
really get excited about even more so than the 90% number is the fact that 60% of
those companies are using more than 3 of our services. And so the notion of really
picking a vendor that can support you in your journey to the cloud across SaaS,
across PaaS, across IaaS, I think, is what customers want. And I think that puts us in a
really nice place.

you have everything you need on that identity front?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

I mean, I have never worked on a product that don't have additional requests from
customers. And so we'll always need to do more. But that's with any other product.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Okay. And it's -- okay. So I'm going to shift. We've got a few minutes left here before
I'll turn over to the audience. But I'm going to shift and talk a little bit about the on-
premise business and then maybe ﬁnish up with a couple of questions on Dynamics
if we have any time. The on-premise business continues to be very strong. And I love
this idea, this symbiotic relationship between on-premise and cloud where, to some
extent, by oﬀering the cloud credits and the cloud discounts, you're helping
perpetuate the strength of on-premise. Is that the sole factor that you think is driving
that kind of steady single-digit growth there? Or do you think you're still gaining
share? We've done some math that would suggest you're actually increasing
average selling prices still. Maybe walk us through the elements of that growth story
because I -- people tend to think it's just about cloud tie. I think it may be more than
that.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I see. There's a variety of dynamics going on. Certainly, like the value proposition we
have around hybrid is deﬁnitely helping us, whether it be on the technical side in
terms of how the products work together or some of the business synergies that
we're bringing to bear for our customers like the Azure Hybrid Beneﬁt I mentioned.
But also, I do think there are places where we feel like we're taking share on key
workloads, whether we feel like SQL has a great value proposition for customers.
When you think about all the value prop we bring in, we give you In-memory OLTP,
In-memory BI, in-memory advanced analytics, machine learning. And they are all
built in a single product. And so we feel like that has a tremendous market
momentum. And now it's also available on Linux. And so if I just think about the
amount of customers basically starting to try out the product based on number of
like Docker hub pools that you can measure, we're just seeing tremendous amount
of interest. And that bodes well for our aspiration to go grow that business on-prem
even more. Then there's another aspect where the -- there is essentially sort of
strength I think in -- what I think of as pinion mix. So as customers really think about
their journey to the cloud, they want to basically have an environment in their own
premises that's more compatible with their cloud. That leads to more virtualization,
higher density use of their workloads even on-prem. So then that translates into
more sales of -- and strength in things like Window Server data center addition, or
SQL server enterprise addition, which is what we would call premium. So there's an
aspect of a premium mix as a lever that's helping sustain the health of the on-
premise business. Does that help?
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
It does. It certainly does. And just on that premium story, you all have been -- we had
a chart in our initiation that looked at sort of the value you get from server has
steadily increased. What is enabling you -- I mean, what are some of the things that
people seem willing to pay more for? There's this debate about what should beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

Q - Adam Hathaway Holtbundled versus what should actually increase the value. What do you see is the sort
of the 1 or 2 pieces of functionality that are actually causing people to upgrade to
those premium services?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Like I said, it's basically more use of technologies that sort of make their environment
more compatible in the cloud, like higher density of virtualization or bigger
hardware that has more cores, that necessitates you to basically cover more cores.
That then leads to more premium sales. So those factors.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Okay, got it. Azure Stack, you mentioned earlier, you said there's some good early
demand for it. It's been in the market for just a few months now, right?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes. It's early days for sure.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Is that something that's going to show -- I mean, how should we be thinking about
what that does to the business? Does that bolster the -- I mean, is that going to show
up on the server side, on the on-premise side? Or does that show up on the cloud
side?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I see. And I think this is a great question that sort of also illuminates how, for me,
we're focused on really driving server and cloud all up double digits like, technically
speaking, Azure Stack, I think of it as a feature of Azure. So when you buy an Azure
Stack and deploy it, the way we charge for it is consumptive. So what I mean by that
is customers spool up virtual machines or resources. There's PaaS services available
on that, too. So you could use app service, you could use container services on your
Azure Stack. And we will build a customer on your Azure build even though the
hardware sits on-premise. And it's pay as you go essentially. For customers that really
want -- and that basically gets reported as cloud revenue. There are some customers
that really want to be able to use that technology but in a disconnected state. And so
we have business models to address that. And when we sell in that kind of a
disconnected state way, it will show up as a server revenue externally. But the
product is the same product in terms of what we deliver but it's sort of -- depending
on how the customers consume it.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
I mean, it's a new product. So we want to get overly enthusiastic about it. But it does
seem to get a lot of airtime, particularly from (Ray), on my team, who absolutely loves
it. But the -- should we be thinking about the ramp of that kind of a product being a
ﬁscal '19 story? Really, it's going to take a couple of quarters to get into the channel?
Are we getting to selling motion? Or is there something diﬀerent about this release
that could be faster with respect to the impact?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

I kind of feel like it's a little too early to tell between customer buzz and the reaction
both from customers and also our partners. If you were to ask our hardware partners,
I think they are really pleased with the sort of the action they're seeing. So we're
bullish. But I think it's a little too early days.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Awesome. Let me -- I'm just trying to think. I'll stop and take some questions from the
ﬂoor. And then I'll hit my Dynamics question, if there aren't any questions. I think
we're going to have a couple that we've got. Here's one here in the pink.
I have a question, why does Azure win versus an AWS? And do you see GCP in the
mix right now? And when you think about how Google's trying to diﬀerentiate with
AI and TensorFlow, how competitive are they? And what's the competitive response
from Microsoft?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Okay. So in terms of why we win, I guess the one that we're seeing the sort of the
biggest diﬀerentiation that resonates is resonating with customers is basically our
enterprise focus and our leadership there, whether it be sort of the engagement we
have with customers or sort of the trust that they can have in Microsoft as the cloud
vendor that can help them deal with all the regulatory compliance and security
requirements that enterprise customers have. And I think that's sort of one big one.
Hybrid, we talked about, is another one. They are looking for ways sort of to
synergistically use what they have on-prem and essentially use cloud in a synergistic
way as opposed to -- that's sort of the second one. Then I would also say the notion
of productivity is a big one. As customers are increasingly looking more and more to
use the cloud like they'd really need not just a leading edge set of developers but a
broader set of developers they have in their organization to be productive in using
the cloud. So whether it be DevOps capabilities and services we oﬀer with things like
Visual Studio Team Services or all the things in Visual Studio to extend its reach. So
that every developer, whatever their skill sets are, whatever their preferences for
technologies are, can all apply their technology in a very, very productive way for
Azure. I think that's really resonating. Those are the ones I'd call out. Then when you -
- you asked about, do we see Google a lot? And I'll be lying if I say we don't see any.
But if I were to, say, compare to a year ago, do we see them a lot more? We see --
run into them from time to time. But I'm not sure that has changed a whole lot. And
in terms of AI and other sort of their technology, we have a lot of investments that
we're bringing to bear from years of investments we made in Microsoft Azure that
are showing up in places like cognitive services we oﬀer in Azure. And we also
support things like TensorFlow in Azure. And it runs really well. And so that's an area
that we continue to compete furiously in. But also seeing some really interesting use
cases in Azure that makes us pretty bullish.

Q - Adam Hathaway HoltA question over here on my left.
At their conference this morning, UBS talked about being excited about Azure Stack.
But they were talking about it in terms of the future, perhaps suggesting they were
still waiting for a couple of features or some part of the development in order to
accelerate spending. What kind of things are there that are roadblocks -- current
roadblocks or things to be developed that will accelerate Azure Stack?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
In terms of exploration of Azure Stack, I mean, ﬁrst of all, there is an aspect of not all
of our hardware partners' products are available yet. And so we have a few that are
already available in market. That means that I think we already have Azure Stack
basically purchasable in 47 countries. That really enables great coverage of hybrid.
But we got to get all the other partners' products available. And we're working with
them. Then there's the other aspect what are the Azure services that run in Azure
Stack. And the portfolio can get richer over time. So we already have some PaaS
services like container services or app services that are available so that you can
write application in a common way in the public cloud Azure and in your Azure
Stack. But we want to continue to add to that portfolio over time.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Any other questions? I've got a couple of questions about Dynamics, if that's okay.
So one of the things that I think is sort of a dual-pronged set of drivers to the
Dynamics business is, one, the fact that the applications business globally seems
better. I mean, it's better at Oracle, it's better at SAP. It's good at Salesforce. That
seems to be a bit of a tailwind, plus you've now got a 365 story to tell. Can you talk
about, one, if you believe -- if you agree with the ﬁrst premise that the application
market feels a little bit better; and then two, how 365 has then been an accelerant
for you and where that's actually showing up in the market.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I'm not sure like what you mean by like application market, it seems (to mean) like
Azure is growing great. And instead of -- I don't want to say one or the other. But I do
think our customers think about their journeys to the cloud. One of the increased
appetite I'm seeing is customer's willingness to sort of say, "Hi. if there is an app that
I can deploy rather than doing my own custom one, I will like that app, basically
ready-made solutions." And that bodes well for sort of PaaS business applications.
And we're certainly seeing that in Dynamics 365 that's growing -- that grew 68%,
69%, I forgot the exact number but basically around 70% in Q1. And that is certainly
aided by customers' appetite that essentially have business applications served from
the cloud.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Is most of the on-premise Dynamics business at this point just upgrading older
versions? Or is there any real new business that's being done on-premise?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-11-15

There is some new. There is some new. But it is true that, again, we are seeing a lot of
appetite for the cloud. When you think about new Dynamics customers in Q1, I
believe 3 out of 4 customers chose cloud.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
And if you -- I mean, there are lots of -- there are lots and lots of LinkedIn touchpoints
with Dynamics. But a year in, where do you think you actually are in practice? And
has that -- have the LinkedIn integrations, do you think, either impacted your win
rates or the revenue trajectory of that business?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yes, on the -- from a Dynamics standpoint, we've seen really good synergy with our
essentially what we call relationship -- Microsoft Relationship sales solution oﬀer that
combines Dynamics 365 for sales and LinkedIn. And we've seen customers like
Infosys realize really great beneﬁt by essentially really adopting relationships selling
into their selling process. Of course, if you integrate something like Sales Navigator
from LinkedIn with Dynamics 365, you can do things like make sure you ﬁnd people
within the organization that can give you a warm intro to our lead as opposed to just
trying to do a cold test. And they have customers who are seeing substantial
reduction essentially in sales cycle or improvement in win rate. And the oﬀering is
quite new. But the customer interest is quite high. And we're feeling pretty bullish
about that. And we're also increasing LinkedIn integration on essentially the HR front.
So Dynamics 365 for Talent essentially integrates with LinkedIn Recruiter. And again,
that's another area where we feel like we can deliver additional value to the
customer.
