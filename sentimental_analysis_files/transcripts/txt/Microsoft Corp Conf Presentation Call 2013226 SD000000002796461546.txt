We will go ahead and get started. For those of you I don't know, my name is Adam
Holt. And I run the enterprise software research practice at Morgan Stanley. I'm very
excited to have Kurt DelBene, the President of the Oﬃce Division, to give our next
conversation.
Oﬃce, as many of you all know from reading our research over the last number of
years, has a special place in my heart. And I think the value proposition of Microsoft
has really evolved toward the application business over the last few years. So this is a
terriﬁc time. And I really appreciate you coming to speak with us about what's
happening.
Before we get started, I'm going to read some disclaimers. This presentation
contains forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other
statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations
and assumptions that are subject to risks and perhaps some uncertainties. Actual
results could materially diﬀer because the factors discussed in our earnings press
releases and the comments made during the presentation and the Risk Factors
section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and ﬁlings with the SEC. We
do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And with that, thank you, again.
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Thank you. You said that very well.

Kurt DelBeneWell I've done it before. Why don't I start oﬀ with a broad brush question? You're
standing or sitting, if you will, at the precipice of what I think is the biggest product
release that you all have ever had. There are a lot of changes in terms of not just the
features and functionality. But also bundling and go to market delivery.
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Could you maybe give us the context and talk through what you're doing diﬀerently
and what maybe you are most excited about in the current product solution?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Sure. I think it is probably the most exciting version of Oﬃce, certainly from my
division in the time that I have been in Oﬃce, which is over 15 years.
There's really a few things that I think are diﬀerent this time around. The ﬁrst is it's the
very ﬁrst time that we have shipped our desktop applications, our servers. And our
services all at the same time. It is a monumental task just to roll that out. We actually
shipped our on-premises products, both our desktop applications and our servers at
the last part of last year. So that means their enterprise customers can actually ramp
up and start deploying those products as of December of last year. But then we
followed that on with the consumer launch on the 29th of January. That was a very
strong product both in terms of things like it's social connectivity, the ability to be
married to the cloud naturally, the default being saving content to the cloud roaming
across devices. And also for the very ﬁrst time, have a subscription service that is part
of Oﬃce. So customers, consumers can buy Oﬃce 365 Home Premium. And they
can get Oﬃce on up to ﬁve of their PCs or their Macs. So it's a pretty natural oﬀering,
particularly for consumer families.
Then the third thing really is it's a very strong release for our Oﬃce 365 service for
businesses. It's both the next generation of all of our server products deployed
worldwide at massive scale, Exchange, SharePoint and Lync, our uniﬁed
communications product. But also it ﬁlls out some of the oﬀerings.
So for the ﬁrst time, we have a very speciﬁc oﬀering for small business; we have a
very speciﬁc oﬀer for medium-sized businesses as well. We put the client in there as
an opportunity to people to subscribe to the Oﬃce Client for the very ﬁrst time into
our services. And it's really just broadening out that oﬀering. It comes on some very
strong momentum for the Oﬃce 365 service overall. We now estimate that one in
ﬁve enterprises are using Oﬃce 365. And the rate at which customers are adopting it
has really gone -- really accelerated over the last year. We've had 158% increase in
the number of small and medium business customers that are taking it on. And the
rate at which new customers are on-ramping has tripled over the last year. So strongFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

Kurt DelBenerelease, strong release for traditional customers and very strong release on the
services side, too.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
That's very helpful. And one of the things you talked about is the move toward
subscriptions and the subscription oﬀering on both the consumer and the SMB side.
Can you drill down on that a little bit, how you are driving it. And what would you
expect subscription adoption to look like?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Sure. So as I said, for the very ﬁrst time, you now have a choice. You can buy the
perpetual version of Oﬃce, Oﬃce 2013, or you can buy it as a subscription either
targeted toward the consumer oﬀering with Oﬃce 365 Home Premium or Oﬃce Pro
Plus, which is the same Oﬃce 365 Pro Plus, which is the oﬀering to business
customers, as well.
The beneﬁts there are, one, the ability to just stream it down to the desktop. You can
literally go to Oﬃce.com. We will download it for you. If you're not on your own
device, you can, in fact, download it if you are visiting relatives, you can essentially
have Oﬃce go with you.
It also provides us the opportunity to update Oﬃce in real time. If we add new
features to it, we can just change the images on our servers. We will actually just
stream to you the diﬀerences between the two, between the image you have today
and the image that we have on our servers or in the cloud in the service, that allows
us to deploy new capabilities really as quickly as we choose to. And it's an ongoing
relationship with the customer. And some new versions come down to them. And it
is really changing the nature of our relationship with our customers.
As far as the rate at which we think that customers will adopt the subscription, we're
really waiting to see how it is. We think we have a very strong value proposition. The
number of PCs that you get, the fact that it works across PCs and Macs, I think is a
big value proposition, the fact that you get additional cloud services. So we give you
7 times the amount of storage in the cloud. We give you Skype minutes as part of
your subscription. So we really see it as a vessel to add ongoing value there.
But we are going to wait and see and see how it does.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Another element that's diﬀerent about this release is to Windows 8, you talked a lot
about betting on touch and how important touch is to the Windows family. You talk
about how you think through touch. And how that's changed this product release?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Adam Holt
Kurt DelBeneSure. Well we are excited about Windows 8 being the ﬁrst operating system that
really takes touch and makes it an integral part of the experience. And we have been
working with the Windows team from the inception of both of our releases to say we
need a version of Oﬃce that is really well-tuned to touch. And I think Microsoft
overall is making a very big bet on touch. If you go to our stores, the vast majority of
the devices there are touch devices. And we are saying that that is the best
experience for Oﬃce and for Windows.
We didn't just touch-enable the device, though. We took this as an opportunity to
look at the Oﬃce experience and say it's been a while since we've given it an
update. And there is a design aesthetic from Microsoft, sometimes called Metro, the
new aesthetic that is part of a Windows Phone that has been in Windows 8 as well.
And the idea is to have it be fresh, ﬂuid, the frame around the applications gets
minimized. And your content comes forward. So it's really focused on content.
We've introduced motion where motion makes sense. So for instance, if you are in
Excel, if your data changes, your charts change, we will actually animate the change
in your chart so that you see what those changes are and what kind of impact those
had. So for us, it's about really having Windows plus Oﬃce be a great experience.
But it's also about a broader investment that I think it's going to be really key in
natural user experiences with your PCs. I think more and more you're going to see
the touch is going to be the standard way that we interact with PCs. If you go to Best
Buy, for instance, go look and see the PCs and how many touch marks there are on
them -- PCs that aren't even touch-enabled devices. The expectation from customers
is going to be that they are going to watch those touch devices. I know that I just
naturally go and touch the device regardless. And I think that is going to be the
norm.
But I think you will see natural user experiences in terms of voice interaction with PCs
for navigation, for input, et cetera. It's just the beginning -- the tip of the iceberg. But
touch is the place where we, as a Company, are very, very invested in.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Why don't we -- I was going to get into the enterprise business and then the SMB
and then the consumer. But since we are talking about the products, maybe that's
drill into a little bit how you are thinking about the evolution of this product family.
Speciﬁcally, you talked about natural user experience. But it also seems like the
applications are becoming more about expression and doing diﬀerent things above
and beyond just making an Excel spreadsheet. Can you talk about how you think
about that and what that means over the next two to three years as the product
portfolio evolves?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Sure. There's a number of things that I think are really key input areas for us. The ﬁrst
is just the notion that the workplace overall is dynamic and is changing very quickly.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 16Adam Holt
Kurt DelBeneThat's why you see us make investments in things like Skype and things like Yammer
to allow people to come together and collaborate eﬀortlessly to create ad hoc
groups. Those are groups that are beyond the boundaries of your organization. They
are about stitching organizations together. They are about organizations talking to
individuals. And so a big part of what we're doing is integrating those social
capabilities directly into our desktop applications. So for instance, the ability to
launch into a Skype session from within Outlook was something that we added in
this last release. But also create an infrastructure for organizations via our service to
allow really dynamic collaboration. I think that is one key.
I think the second thing is we do continue to think about how we expand the Oﬃce
business. One of the investment areas we been very intently focused on is note
taking. And OneNote has been an application that has been growing in importance
for us as part of the Oﬃce suite. And it's something where we believe the note
taking experience is not just on your PC, it's great on tablets. It's also a place where it
needs to be on mobile devices. So if I pull out your phone, I want to take a quick
note. I want to have a to do list. You want that to come back to your PC to be able to
be used there. But in a lot of cases, that is going to be the capture experience.
Meetings are a place that we really continue to invest in. You saw us purchase a
company called PTI, which builds the world's largest capacitive touch displays. And
we are really thinking about how do we create great, large meeting experiences
there. How do we further adapt our software to work well with touch? How do you
use that kind of device to have great meetings both onpremises but at a distance as
well?
Then a ﬁnal thing I think you alluded to is just we are always thinking about, what
does self-expression look like in the future? The notion of what a document is,
whether it's a spreadsheet or a Word document or a PowerPoint presentation is not
going to be the same in the future as it is today. And as we look past this release, we
think about what does a document look like in the future. And how can it be more
dynamic? How can it bring in content in real time?
We've started doing a bunch of that in terms of bringing content from the web into
the release or into the products. But there is a lot more that we can do there.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
You started oﬀ the answer talking about Skype and Yammer. Can you touch on how
those acquisitions and integrations are going?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
So far, they are going very well. It's always an artform to ﬁgure out how do you get
the value out of an acquisition and not destroy that jewel that you've purchased. And
I think in both cases, we're doing that. Tony Bates for Skype has come on and is
leading the Uniﬁed Communications Group at Microsoft, a combination of the Lync
team and the Skype teams coming together to really drive that uniﬁcation acrossFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

Kurt DelBenethose two products. So the goal there, of course, is to have a great enterprise
product that also connects well to the consumer world via Skype and take advantage
of the technologies going back and forth.
Similarly, I think in Yammer things are going very, very well. We have really worked
on what is the right price point. We announced a decrease in the pricing just so we
can get that broadly deployed across all of our business customers. We really are in
love with Yammer in that sense. I think David and Adam have come on board and
become real leaders in the team. And they are teaching the Oﬃce team new things.
The way that they develop software is real-time. They think a quarter ahead and what
is that next release going to be. As we move toward subscription, that is how we are
more and more thinking about what's the next deployment we can do in service and
keep it up to date on an ongoing basis. So so far. So good.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
And what has the customer reaction been? Maybe it's a little bit too early on the
Yammer side? How are you evolving your go to market to really get social to
permeate what everyone does on a daily basis?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
It has actually been really good. If you think about it, one of the -- we have been
evolving the social capabilities of SharePoint for some time and gotten into a pretty
rich set of capabilities, particularly in this release. But what was missing was the one,
to really have the leadership position in terms of that kind of social collaboration and
teaming environment. And two, to have a viral adoption model.
So the whole notion that all you do to get hooked into Yammer is to give them your
email address. And that starts a network with your business. It's a great on-ramp. And
we've followed that on with there is a business oﬀering. We've ﬁgured out how do
we bring that into the enterprise relationship, enterprise agreements that our
customers have with us. How do we get our broad sales force worldwide to sell
Yammer, talk about the social capabilities. And talk about that as an on-ramp to
Oﬃce 365? But I think you'll see more and more announcements out of all this how
Yammer becomes an integral part of the Oﬃce 365 service.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Just one more product question before we get to the enterprise. I want to talk about
OneNote because I know it is near and dear to your heart.
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
It is.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

Page 7 of 16Adam Holt

Kurt DelBene{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
How do you think about or what can you share with us about how that product has
really evolved and grown. And how do you position OneNote versus some of the
other stuﬀ on the market like Evernote?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Well OneNote has really evolved into being the oﬀering app that you really used day
to day. So if I think about, for instance, how do I use OneNote? For every meeting
that I have, I have a OneNote page. That OneNote notebook is actually up in the
cloud. So I can synchronize it from all of my devices. And actually have it on my PTI
board in my Oﬃce, as well. And what happens there is everybody comes in and
knows they have a whiteboard they can work on. The PTI board has great ink
support. And it's just very natural. People go to the whiteboard; they draw on it; and
they say, hey, here's what we are thinking about? And through its integration with the
rest of Oﬃce, once you're done there, you click a button. And it sends that, the
results of that to everybody who is in the meeting. We have already autopopulated
who are the meeting recipients because we created that document from OneNote.
So that natural complement of, if I'm in a meeting, I use OneNote. If I'm taking notes
with my Surface Pro, that's got a great stylus with it. I can just write in my own
handwriting. It does things like recognition of that enough to be able to ﬁnd those
notes later on. It doesn't have to be perfect. But it's good enough to actually ﬁnd
what I was referring to at a particular point in time.
So we focused a lot on making sure it is integrated into the key places where you
want to take notes. We've done a lot in being able to capture content in various
places. And as I've said, it means deploying OneNote or having versions of it that
worked in various places, like on mobile devices.
It also means having a great web app. And so like the other Oﬃce applications, there
is a web version of OneNote so that I can access those notes from everywhere.
But if you think about the kinds of content that people could put in OneNote for
later capture, that whole captures scenario of bringing it all together, sharing it with
others is ripe for continued innovation.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Terriﬁc. Let's shift to the enterprise business. So the 2010 release was a good release
in terms of penetration and adoption from an enterprise perspective. Is that a gating
factor at all with the current release will be adopted in the enterprise or not really?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 16Adam Holt
Kurt DelBeneI don't think so. You are right. The 2010 was a very, very strong release for us. First, on
the consumer side, I think that will be replaced by the 2013 release and by Home
Premium -- or Oﬃce 365 Home Premium. And that will just transition over pretty
quickly.
On the enterprise side, it's really a matter of, even as much demand as we've gotten
from 2010, there will be people who will make the decision now to say, well, do I
want to go beyond 2010. And do I want to just go to the next release now that that's
available? So I think people will reassess that decision point right now.
The second thing we did for the very ﬁrst time is we allowed people to run 2010 and
2013 or the current release side by side. It's the ﬁrst time we have enabled that. And
so whether you are on 2007 or 2010, you can actually download the new clients. And
you can deploy that across your enterprises. And what we think we'll see and from
talking to CIOs, there's a lot of interest in this, we will just deploy the new ones and
then people will make the choice. If I ﬁnd there is a particular feature in the new
version of Excel, I'll use that. And what we think we will see is people will just stop
using the old version of the product because they will like the new one better. And
that actually gets us around this issue of if you've got issues around document
ﬁdelity and jeez, are you sure it will work, or macros that you are running, well just
deploy it and see how people like it. That's the very ﬁrst time we've been able to do
that.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
You had really strong bookings on the enterprise side in the most recent quarter in
advance of the release. Does that represent a certain amount of pentup demand for
the release that you think will continue for a while?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
I think so. I mean the 2010 release and the current release, 2013, have been very
strong from an enterprise perspective. We have seen a lot of demand in some very
speciﬁc spaces. And there's a bunch of features that are just the must-have upgrade
features. And I think that demand will continue.
A few that I would highlight -- certainly Business Intelligence, the partnership that we
have had with the SQL team, married with SharePoint as that dashboard in the cloud
or dashboard on your intranet, married with Excel, which is already the most popular
BI client in the world has been a very strong momentum driver of releases. And I
think we're going to see that this time, too.
I think the investments we have made in Uniﬁed Communications around Lync have
driven very strong adoption as well. Those multi-party HD meetings that exist in this
current version, there has been a ton of interest there, the connectivity of Skype, as I
mentioned. I think that's has been a driver.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 16Adam Holt
Kurt DelBene
Adam HoltThen the third one that I'd really call out is we may not think of it as the sexiest
feature. But the investments we've made around e-discovery and compliance are not
matched by anybody else in the industry. And they are incredibly sexy if you are a
CIO. They are very exciting, to be able to look across your enterprise and tell me,
give me all correspondences about this particular topic, wherever it is, let me see it
in a single dashboard; let me archive it in a consistent way; and that is across
information and SharePoint or the Exchange, et cetera. That has been a huge piece.
And we married that up with another cool feature around data loss protection.
So if I am in Exchange and somebody inadvertently puts a Social Security number in
their email or in an attachment to email, we'll warn you that you appear to be
sending personal identiﬁable information outside the organization. And we will allow
IT to set a rule that says, hey, you can't send it under that auspices, or just one user
and let them send it.
So I think it's going to -- the momentum will continue. But not by luck. But because
we are really focused on some key investment areas.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
And with the breadth of the release right now and some of the changes that you
have made to the client access pricing, do you think you have opportunities to be
more successful and drive bigger bundles, drive increased deal sizes, et cetera?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
I do. I think one of the things we're learning is that with the success of the Oﬃce 365
service with customers. And we have had some very strong success, whether it be
Tesco or JCPenney being very large customers. We just announced The Red Cross
coming onboard, international Red Cross -- very large customers. But also all the way
down to some smaller ones, like Helly Hansen, which is a big apparel manufacturer
that's particularly popular in the northwest, I'm sure around here as well. But we are
seeing very broad appeal for the service at the right price points.
But getting back to your question, I think the nature of our relationship changes with
those customers. They bring us in as more strategic partners. They want to talk to us
earlier about what the next release holds for them. And it's an opportunity for us to
add additional workloads on top. They may start with Exchange; they will move to
SharePoint for collaboration. So there's an extension in terms of the workﬂows that
happened. But there's also an extension in terms of the enterprise depth.
I think one of the things that diﬀerentiates our service is we have the broadest
service in the industry today in terms of the functionality. And we surely have the
deepest in terms of it's all of Exchange, it's all of SharePoint and all those features
that people love. So I think the relationship becomes a much more collaborative one.
And there's a ton of upsell opportunity.

Page 10 of 16Kurt DelBene
Adam Holt
Kurt DelBeneSo that's probably a good point to pivot to 365. The release has now been in the
market for a few years. One of the original premises was you would expand the total
addressable market. You'd get into parts of the small business you hadn't been in,
kiosk workers, temporary workers. Can you talk about where you think you are in that
evolution? Has that materialized to the extent you thought it would?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
I think it has. A couple of angles there. The ﬁrst thing I'd say is it doesn't come for
free. You have to really invest in making the ease of use, particularly for small
customers, to be just phenomenal. And that's has been a journey for us, a journey
with our customers. But I think we've gotten to the point where the onboarding
experience is super easy for a small customer. I think we are seeing the results, as I
mentioned before, 150% increase in the number of small and medium business
customers. And I think you'll see an acceleration of that because for the ﬁrst time
we've got very speciﬁc oﬀerings in the small business oﬀering in the midsized
business oﬀering for Oﬃce 365 this time around.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
In terms of you mentioned the kiosk user, it has always been the case that the
customers want to cover their entire user base and particularly in retail and in
manufacturing, you get a set of users that are not wanting to use the entire set of
functionality. They don't want to use the full Oﬃce, for instance. And so you've got to
have an oﬀering that is at the right price point for those users so that they can buy in
for their entire user base.
I think the fact that we get folks on board like JCPenney, like Tesco, American Red
Cross show that these are people that are going to be able to use the service for
their entire user base. So so far, it's going pretty well.
And there's always going to be some folks that want to use onprem, some folks that
want to use cloud-based delivery. But over time, is there any reason to believe that
we shouldn't ultimately see Oﬃce move to essentially a very close to 100%
subscription model that covers both of those deliveries?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Well I think it is the one thing that we talk about a bunch and try to ﬁgure out exactly
where it's going. I think we have aspirations that ultimately it might get there. I think
one of the things we are strong at right now is that hybrid environment, which is
where we see people using the product most today, keeping some folks onpremises
and some folks in the cloud. We make our enterprise agreements really good at
supporting that kind of situation. But ultimately we'd love to have everybody in the
cloud.
I will say that we love our onpremises business for now. And we can -- every bit of
functionality that we put in the cloud version we are running those same bits onFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 16Adam Holt
Kurt DelBene

Kurt DelBenepremises. And so we can oﬀer those capabilities to customers, as well.
So I guess I would say ultimately we think everybody will be cloud connected. But it's
a journey, too. There has been an incredible amount of development over the last
year to two years on international standards for whiteboard, data sovereignty issues.
And issues around discovery of content that's in the cloud. And it's a journey with
our customers to get them comfortable with moving to the cloud.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
And ultimately that would, I would think, also change the way you think about
release cycles. So maybe you move from a three-year cadence to almost an iterative
cadence of release cycles. Is that the right way to think about it?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Yes. It is. We have already gone with Oﬃce 365 to the point where we are at a
quarterly release cadence. So we already have the mechanisms in place to update
the service on a quarterly basis. With the client subscription, as I mentioned, we will
have the ability to do that with client bits as well, the desktop version of Oﬃce.
I think it will get us to a point where we have a major-minor cadence. Because there
are some investments that have to happen that require a great deal of forward
investment. When you are structurally changing the underpinning of Exchange or
SharePoint or the Oﬃce applications, those take a while to develop. And so I think
we will get into the short cycle where we can add more features. But then we will
have a longer cycle where we really have to intensively change underpinnings of the
services.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Okay. Then the follow-on question to that is, do you think you have to be at 100% or
close to 100% subscribers to start to see the subscription evolution impact piracy, or
do you think you can start to see impacts there at a lower level?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Well I think we continue to work on piracy. It is obviously a big issue for us. I don't
think it requires us to be at 100%. I think we will see how it does. If we can add
additional functionality via the service, that service connected, we have an
opportunity to have people who were pirating the software use the service instead.
But we look closely. We can look geographic-wise as to where the subscription
oﬀering is going, where it is becoming popular, where it is not. And we can tweak
things over time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

Kurt DelBeneI do think it oﬀers a lever for us. But I think it's really early to tell how much success
we are going to have there. It's a constant battle with it.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
If I shift to more of a consumer discussion, the new oﬀering that enables you to have
ﬁve diﬀerent devices, how do you think that evolved the customer value proposition
over time? Does that increase the average customer value, or how do you think
about that?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
I think it does. I think it is not the only thing that will be the success of the service. I
think you always have the data aspect of the service is a key beneﬁt there, as well.
The fact that it goes across devices. But we already know that, as John was
mentioning from AT&T as well, how many people here have multiple devices that
they use. Certainly in a family, there are more than one or two PCs in a typical family.
And that's an opportunity for that service to be really the preeminent oﬀering there.
And so I think we'll wait and see. But I think we also have created a construct that any
place that we think we can deliver a service or any place that we think we can deliver
a diﬀerentiation in the client experience, we can do that more easily through the
subscription. And so you'll see us evolve what the subscription oﬀering is over time
as a result.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
Okay. And another point that you brought up is that those devices can be or
Window devices and also Mac devices. Can you talk about how you think about
Oﬃce relative to the iOS, in addition to the Mac OS?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
You showed amazing restraint waiting until now to ask that question.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
I'm very patient.
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
We have actually done a bunch of work this time around on working grade and iOS
devices. And I actually would point that out. I use all of these devices myself because
we have core applications that run on the PC and on Mac that we are very proud of.
We've actually done a lot of work on iOS devices this time around. And so we have a
brand-new version of Outlook web access that works as an application as well that
you can download that works oﬀ-line that has all the richness of Exchange and
calendaring and is a super-rich feature set there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

A - Kurt DelBeneWe have enhanced the web applications pretty substantially, particularly in
partnership with Apple. I mean if you look at where they were with the Safari browser
in 5.0 versus 6.0, the iOS, there's been a lot of changes there to make those apps
work super well on a touch device.
We've also deployed and have built versions of OneNote that are getting better and
better on those devices as well. So we don't take it from the point of view of, do we
need to have the PC software that is running on a PC running on every single
device? We look very much at what is the experience that we're looking to have on
those devices and is it a great experience. And so I think we've done a great job on
both the consumer side, particularly with web apps that we are building and on the
enterprise side as well.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
All right. With that, we've got time to take a couple of questions in the audience.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
One over here on the left. I don't know if there is a microphone close. There is one.
(technical diﬃculty)
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
That's a great question. So the way we do it is we do analysis. And we actually do a
bunch of surveys. And you do conjoint analysis and ﬁgure out what oﬀering will
people want at a particular price point.
And so we played with what are the feature sets of the subscription, for instance,
how many PCs does it work against, what are the additional services? Then you just
ask consumers, which you would prefer to have. And then they ﬁnd that price that
actually works for people. And so we actually feel pretty good about the price of the
365. I assume you mean the client service versus our business service oﬀerings. We
feel good about it. And I think the initial uptake has actually supported the price
point that we've set. So we don't have any plans in adjusting that. Obviously, like
every business, we look at things over a period of time.
I think it's also when you look at the lifecycle you have to look at it from the
perspective of how long people have a PC, when they choose to upgrade that PC.
And when they would choose to buy a version of Oﬃce with that new PC, as well.
And so what you are talking about replacing, actually, is the purchase of a new PC
and along with that, Oﬃce. And you are trading that in, essentially, for a subscription
version. So when you buy the new PC, you know you already have the new Oﬃce. AllFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

A - Kurt DelBeneyou do is download that new Oﬃce, deactivate your old PC, activate the new PC.
And you're oﬀ to the races.
And so I really think -- I think customers are getting that. And they're thinking the
value proposition in that way. So we feel pretty good about it.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
A question on my right. Right there. Just an overall question on service and margins.
How important is pricing do you think as a stimulant for touch-enabled devices
ﬁrstly?
Then secondarily, just on margins, overall, as service becomes a bigger part of the
mix overall and marketing is a bigger part of the overall spend, if you educate
people on the device, how do you think that evolves over time -- how do you think
about margins?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Yes, okay. So two diﬀerent questions. One, how do I think about the cost of a touch
device as driving demand? I don't think you're going to ﬁnd I am the expert. I think
the Windows guys would probably be able to tell you that more succinctly. But I
think it's pretty natural behavior that says you need to have product at all price
points. And competitive products actually drive that demand.
I think the demand among consumers so far has actually been fairly healthy. And we
see a bunch of PCs coming in at various levels that will actually round out the mix.
And I think we'll have a good set of oﬀerings, including oﬀerings that are must-haves
at the right price point.
So I would say it obviously is a price issue or at some point it is a price issue. People
have to have them at the right price. And I think we are going to have the oﬀerings
that are at those right price points.
In terms of how I see margins evolving, I think we see that with the new ability to
address new markets, the total margin dollars, the total dollars that we will receive
and will go to the bottom line, should be greater. Whether that mix is in terms of our
margin percentages, I think that is a point where we will see how that goes. But we
do feel conﬁdent about the total margin dollars actually being greater.
In terms of how that evolves, I think we're also going to see the mix is going to shift
over a period of time as people move toward the service, whether that is the service
on the business side or whether that is the consumer service. And I think if you were
to model that with growth of the overall pie, I think it's all going to work out ﬁne.
I certainly tell my development team, they say, well, how is this going to work with all
the diﬀerent price points changing and the subscription sets? I said don't worry
about it -- build the products that people want. And I think it's all going to work out.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-26

We've got time for one more very quick one, up here.
I'd like to get my Microsoft Excel models on my tablet. When do you think that's
going to happen. And can you walk through the pros and cons for your Company
about whether you'd like to enable that or how important that is to keep that
separate if you want to push the surface sales?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Well I think we have a great tablet experience of Oﬃce. It is called Surface RT. And
it's called Surface Pro. And all the tablet devices our OEMs are creating.
As far as when -- I think what you're asking then is, when would you see it on your
iPad? I see that is the device that you have got there. I would go back to the
comments that I made earlier around we think we have a pretty good cost device
experience today. And I don't have anything else that I would comment at this time.
I have to get it over the web onto this? Is that --?
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
We actually use the web apps or make the web apps available to both consumer
users via SkyDrive and to Oﬃce 365 users, as well. So if you have a SkyDrive account,
any place that you put an Oﬃce document, you will actually have access to the web
applications there, as well.
That gets to a point of, if you look at some of these assets that Microsoft has overall,
SkyDrive is one where we see a lot of potential moving forward. You think about the
connectivity between Windows 8 and SkyDrive, thinking that as your cloud storage,
we've certainly made it a part of a subscription oﬀering for Oﬃce. So I think in the
future you should expect to see us bet on SkyDrive storage as a key element of our
strategy of getting everybody to be cloud connected. And you can move anywhere
and all your content along with you.
{BIO 1814951 <GO>}
All right. We're about out of time. Thank you, all very much and thank you.
{BIO 6195791 <GO>}
Well thank you.
