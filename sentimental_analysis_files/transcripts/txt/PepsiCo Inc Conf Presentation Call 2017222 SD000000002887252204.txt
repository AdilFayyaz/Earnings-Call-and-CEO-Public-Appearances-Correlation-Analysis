Presentation
{BIO 2147799 <GO>}
All right. We can make our way to our seats. We're ready for the afternoon to begin.
And to kick-oﬀ this afternoon, we are joined by PepsiCo. Before we get started
please join me in thanking Pepsi for their generous support this week by supplying
us with beverages and snacks all week.
So the format of PepsiCo's presentation today, they're going to make a few brief
remarks, CEO of North America, Al Carey, will make a few brief remarks. Then we're
going to turn it over to really extended portion of Q&A. Then beyond that, we'll go
back into the breakout room as well for continued Q&A. So with that aside Al, I'll turn
it over to you.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Thank you, Bryan. Good afternoon, everybody. It's a pleasure to be here. And Bryan,
thanks for the invite and the opportunity to speak today. And we'd like to do to little
bit diﬀerently than we've done in the past. Instead of a long presentation and a short
Q&A, I thought we'd just have a very brief three slides that kind of give you an idea
on what's important in North America for PepsiCo and then we'll open it up to Q&A
for an extended period of time where we could talk about what you'd like to talk
about. So ﬁrst, I'd like to introduce my teammates here on stage. First, we have Vivek
Sankaran, who is an eight-year veteran of PepsiCo now, formally with McKinsey then
ended up working in ran strategic planning for PepsiCo. Then came down to Frito
and ran several operating jobs, ran the sales department and then ran sales for
PepsiCo and now he's the President and Chief Operating Oﬃcer. So he runs Frito-
Lay North America. Then we have Kirk Tanner, right to his right and Kirk started with
the company 25 years ago in the sales organization. He has come up through theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22

Page 2 of 19ranks at Frito, he ended up working in Europe for a while in our snack business. And
to beverages and now he's running the North America beverage business.
So let me get started. I thought I'd give you three slides only and just tell you a little
bit about -- here's -- I'll read this to you. So let me talk to you a little bit, in each of our
operating divisions there are important priorities. But we have the three of us have
three very important priorities that go across all of PepsiCo for North America.
The ﬁrst one is the transforming of our portfolio. And what that means is high priority
on innovative products and packages and making R&D investments in new products
into the marketplace. Innovation, now you'll notice that 85% of it looks healthier and
healthy. And to give you a couple of ideas on the left side of the chart, couple of the
products that have been rolled out this year already are LIFEWTR, zero calorie,
Tropicana probiotic, low-calorie carbonated soft drinks like IZZE and LEMON
LEMON, new varieties of tea under the Lipton Tea house variety and then we actually
made an acquisition of KeVita, which is a non-dairy probiotic and Kombucha, which
is another healthy product and it ﬁts in this portfolio of healthier products.
On the Frito side, we now have veggie, harvest chips, we have Smartfood delights,
which is a low-calorie exceptional popcorn product that is doing extremely well in
the marketplace. Then the Simply line of snack-food products, which are non-GMO,
organic and clean-label products on the snack-foods, which is growing rapidly.
Then ﬁnally, there is one up there, you can see Overnight Oats for Quaker oat meal,
which will come out in the summer time. That's not the whole list, there is more to
come. But that's really about introducing more products into the marketplace that
are healthier and putting a focus on innovation.
I thought I'd show you just one slide up here about how do you market some of
those healthier products. I'm using the example of the Super Bowl this year. So in the
past we've mostly advertised our full sugar products on the Super Bowl with a big
audience of 117 million. This year in the middle you can see our Mountain Dew
Kickstart was the product that we ran on television through the playoﬀ games. And
Mountain Dew Kickstart has now achieved $500 million revenue at retail and it also
is 60% less sugar. So the theme was healthier products.
Then when we've got to the Super Bowl, on the bottom, you can see our ad that we
ran on the Super Bowl and we ran it on the Grammys for LIFEWTR. And we thought it
was a great ad. The sales of this product very early on are terriﬁc. And again zero-
calorie. Then ﬁnally, we had the Halftime Show with Lady Gaga and it was sponsored
by that Pepsi Zero Sugar. So here's a normally very big marketing platform that was
done all with healthier products, lower sugar or zero sugar.
Then ﬁnally on merchandising. We're now looking not just merchandising in-store
but merchandising on vending machines and in coolers using this Hello Goodness
theme. And where we've placed these Hello Goodness vending machines or
coolers, the only products that are in there are the healthier better-for-your productsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 19and the takeaway on these products is terriﬁc and we're good progress. So that's
one of our important priorities. And the second one is about serving the customer.
Now we take this very seriously in our organization in North America. We are
approaching our largest customers as one PepsiCo and I believe it's starting to make
some progress. Then we've just extended to our next 10 largest customers. So that
we extend the PepsiCo approach that way as well. I believe it's starting to pay oﬀ.
This Kantar score that you see on the top is something that's been done for about 16
or 18 years. We have never been Number 1. This is something that's voted on by the
customer. And this last go-around, we were Number 1 rank against all the other
suppliers, which we felt pretty good about. Also this last year and the year before, we
contributed the most growth to our retail partners of any vendor that supplies them.
And in the last several months, we have been awarded Vendor of the Year with three
of our very largest customers. So I think we're starting to pay oﬀ. But I can tell you
that the theme we live by is being hungry and humble with our customers and serve
them extremely well and we're starting to get our PepsiCo approach down pretty
pat.
Also it's not just in the retail side, it's in foodservice. And we have one organization
that is right now under Kirk Tanner. And we have one organization that runs all of
PepsiCo products sold through the foodservice business. And you can see some of
the coolers and the ways that we merchandise our products in those foodservice
accounts.
Finally, the third in the Top 3 priorities is making our DSD system more eﬃcient and
eﬀective. We think that we now have a very scaled business, Frito-Lay has done an
exceptional job at working on this GES model which is taking inventory out of the
system, it's moving complexity upstream, it's saving us a lot of money. But the route
salesman that work in the ﬁeld would say that this is an exceptional way to improve
their job and allow them to sell more. Kirk will tell you a little bit later on about, he's
doing a similar thing for GES on the beverage side.
And ﬁnally I'll just tell you very quickly about one, maybe the next time we're back
together we'll talk more about it. But that is we have a couple of experimental
markets where we put our chilled DSD products, in other words, juices, Kevita,
Tropicana, Naked Juice, hummus and we put it on a bay of one of our Pepsi trucks.
We've refrigerated one bay, we ﬁgured out how to do this and really have success in
our Florida and in our Texas markets. And it's something we're likely to do more of.
And it allows us to get deeper penetration into the small format, which we normally
don't do with those chilled products.
So the top priority, transforming the portfolio. Second is serving our customer
exceptionally well. And the third one is doubling down on our DSD business and
making it more eﬀective for the future.
So that's it on the presentation side. And Bryan, I thought I'd just go right into the
Q&A, if that's okay. And we'll take questions from the audience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22

Dara.
{BIO 3017577 <GO>}
Thanks. So Al, you highlighted the eﬀectiveness of the DSD system and the GES is
better enabled you to extract value from the system. At the same time, one of your
competitors has announced they're moving away from DSD. So I was hoping you
could just take a step back and from a top-down perspective, as you look at the
North American business, what are the advantages of the DSD system, how you're
better kind of enabling it to drive value going forward?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Yes. I've been around the DSD business for a very long time. We do have a
business's warehouse delivered in Quaker, Tropicana and Gatorade. But my belief on
DSD is there is nothing like it. We are able to get very speciﬁc. If you ever spend a
day in the ﬁeld with a good route salesman for Frito-Lay or for Pepsi, you'll see the
relationships that have built at the store level that are unmatched. And when there is
a problem with servicing a customer and let's say it's in a Wal-Mart Store and it's a
Friday afternoon and they're running short on product, we will put a person out there
in one second. They make a phone call and we are there for them. And as a result,
we get a lot of jump balls at store level, we build a relationship with the store
manager that's unequaled and it allows us to get better execution at the store level
as well. Now on the refranchising side, I think that's part of what you're asking to,
Coke is moving in that direction. They still have a DSD system. But I like the idea of
owning our system, because as we ﬁnd diﬀerent ways of getting productivity like in
this GES model, we can take those savings and put them back against brands and
R&D and developing new products. We also -- it's easier to manage pricing with the
large customers. I can't imagine -- we own 80% of our bottling system, it's already
tricky enough, I can't imagine having more independent bottling partners and trying
to agree on what a price will be with one big customer when they demand the price.
And the other thing I'd say is I really like the potential of doubling down on these
Pepsi trucks that we've got. The possibility of using the excess capacity on those
trucks to sell chilled product is really a good idea for us. I think it's going to pay
dividends down the road.
Two questions, ﬁrst one for you, Al. And you touched on it a little bit in your remarks.
There's a lot of notable consumer trends that are really accelerating I think in your
space and so, if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of how your
portfolio is evolving to address those. Then back in, I guess as a follow-up to Dara's
question about DSD, Frito-Lay North America has the highest margins ﬁrstly for a
DSD operator. But really even among the highest in the food industry. So is there a
concern that margins are too high? And I remember this -- I'm old enough toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 19A - Al Carey
A - Kirk Tannerremember this discussion when it was 20% margin. But are margins too high? Is
there runway for margins to expand? Just how should we think about maybe margin
expansion in that business going forward?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
So on the -- Kirk, I'm going to pass it to you in one second. I just wanted to say that
as you look at these young consumers coming up the ranks, millennials and
generations, the interest in healthy products is clear. And I don't think this obesity
epidemic goes away anytime in the near future. And I think therefore we have to
deliver products in the marketplace that ﬁt those needs. So over the last several
years, we've invested quite heavily in developing new products, most of them
healthy. And I look at water, sport drinks, teas, coﬀee, low-calorie versions of
Mountain Dew and it really does work.
And I think that's where we're going to have to go even more aggressively than
we're going to today. I think we almost need to double down and move even faster.
Kirk, maybe you could talk a little bit about the beverage portfolio, because we are
working hard on that.
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. I think if you think with the consumer trends that Al talked about in
health and wellness, there's also this immediate consumption consumers on the go.
And you see food service or food away from home growing faster than food and
retail. So that's another trend, that's why you see us invest in foodservice from
innovation standpoint, equipment standpoint and creating a better experience for
consumers when they're on-the-go and away from home. But separately we are
working really hard on the portfolio to meet those consumers where they are going.
And we're building in three diﬀerent ways. One, we're taking the broad portfolio that
we have today, the powerful brands that we have. And Al talked a little bit about it.
But things like taking Starbucks and your innovation is whole brew a premium
experience for consumers. You take Pure Leaf and the success that we've had with
Pure Leaf and innovate Tea House, this premium brewed tea in a glass bottle. That's
a great experience for consumers.
With Naked Juice, we have cold-pressed. With Tropicana, we innovated on
probiotics. On Gatorade, we innovated on G Organics and we have a sub-line
coming out this year called Flow [ph]. In addition, we leverage brands like IZZE and
we feel like we can extract more value out of IZZE by introducing kind of a next-
generation CSD that has 60 calories per 12-ounce and is a great consumer
experience.
In our brands like Mountain Dew and Pepsi, we continue to innovate oﬀ those
platforms drive relevance. Al talked about it earlier. But Mountain Dew Kickstart is
about $500 million business and continues to grow and it delivers on like what the
consumer expects, at the same time, it delivers 60 calories per 12 ounces. We
continue to innovate oﬀ of Mountain Dew with the label series of premium, crafted
Mountain Dew and this year we'll launch Mountain Dew Spiked lemonade. Not theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 19A - Al Carey
A - Vivek Sankaranspike that you had at the bar last night. But spiked with prickly pear juice. It's a terriﬁc
product.
And Pepsi 1893 a craft cola, to really get to the essence of cola. It's a premium
experience for consumers. So we take our brands and we innovate oﬀ those brands.
Also say we introduce new brands. LIFEWTR has been a huge success this year. It
exceeded our expectations almost 70% ACV after three weeks. The velocities are
terriﬁc. I think you've experienced LIFEWTR, you've seen the display outside. And we
are thrilled to death with the launch of LIFEWTR and the success we've seen so far.
In addition, Al mentioned LEMON LEMON, another product that we'll introduce this
year that hits the sweet spot of consumer experience with the right amount of
calories, 70 calories per 12 ounces. And last, I would say we look for opportunities
like Kevita. Kevita is a sparkling probiotic that allows us to build our chilled premium
portfolio. And it is a great partner to Naked and IZZE. And we look forward to
building and growing that brand. So that's how we're thinking about meeting
consumers where they're going.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
One other point, Brian, before Vivek talks about DSD is, with the theme that goes to
all those products you just mentioned is single-serve products, small packages. I
think it's a really important part. It's not only where the consumers are going on-the-
go with smaller packages, the margins are terriﬁc on single serve, they're good for
the retailer and they are good for us and it makes us less dependent on these deep
discounted take-home packages that sometimes drag down the proﬁtability of the
category.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
So Brian, I think you would agree with me, margins can never be too high, I think.
Unless we either start losing the topline or start losing shares, neither of which is
happening. And we don't start the year saying, hey, we are -- what we do to expand
margins. What we do is we are always thinking about ways to get a better price per
pound and are always thinking about ways to get better cost per pound, lower cost
per pound. And on the price per pound, we have three things going for us. One is
we spent a lot of money building up our brands. And that in itself allows us to take
some pricing, certainly keep up with CPI.
Then our innovation, in most of our innovation, we get a higher revenue per pound.
And that's why we keep bringing a lot of innovation to the marketplace. And the
third one is the mix is working in our favor. And by that I mean our single-serve mix
and our multi-pack business is growing faster than anything else in our portfolio.
And by deﬁnition that gets us a higher revenue per pound. So all those things are
driving for higher net revenue per pound.
On the cost side, Derek, your question on GES, we don't think of GES as the person
in the truck, it is a really integrated system -- DSD rather as a person in the truck. It
begins with GES and we've talked about it before. We think there is runway past
2020 in GES and what we are realizing is that where we've implemented it, we areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 19A - Kirk Tanner
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Kirk Tannerbeating our old assumptions. So we thought that the radius would be x, now the
radius is bigger than x of what GES can serve. We thought that cost per case would
be x and cost per case is turning out to be low. So we keep funding and I think part
of it is Frito's incredible ability to keep learning and improving on everything we do.
The second big bucket for us is the automation and this is not automation that you
just pick up oﬀ the shelf from somewhere. Our engineering teams work hard at
automating everything. So the multi-pack, which is pretty complex thing, if you think
about it in a bag your 20 diﬀerent items, we worked on that for years and now our
multi-pack packaging lines are automated and it's home-grown automation. And so
we continue to do that to get more productivity there.
We are enabling our front-line with technology makes them more eﬃcient in the
store, makes them more eﬃcient getting to a store and we are improving our
ordering capabilities with technology, get more out of every hour that we have there.
Then we continue on our journey on what we call the Smart Spend. We don't stay in
hotels like this. Both those dimensions help us tremendously in terms of keeping that
margin growth.
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
We're usually at Marriott Courtyard.
So question on topline and one on margins. From a topline perspective, in fact
assuming Frito-Lay continues on its path right now, I want to focus more on
beverages for a moment. We talked about a lot of innovation, you listed a bunch of
innovations both up there in the screen. But from a share perspective, shares are at
best slightly up or really ﬂat, right. So a lot of work that you're doing not really
amounting to on share growth. So lot of cannibalization. Dispel me if that's wrong, if
you can tell me about that. Then the way you're funding that partially is the margin
question, $1 billion of cost savings every year that we hear was tough to track from
our perspective. But we hear that's 10% of your EBIT, every single year coming
through ﬂexibility. At some point, I guess there was more room. But at some point
that has to slow. You can't cut equivalent to 10% of EBIT every year on a consistent
basis going forward.
So how do you get the algorithm to work beyond just the next few years if the
innovation, it's on the beverages is working, assuming Frito-Lay's was the same and
your $1 billion have to kind of slow down?
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
So clearly the innovation pipeline is robust and it's tied to the transformation of the
portfolio strategy that we're very committed to. And I would say there is a large
incrementality to the innovation. But it continues to be a very competitive
environment. So those that innovate usually grow. And we've been the beneﬁciary of
growth through innovation. So we'll continue to do that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 19A - Al Carey
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Vivek SankaranBut the long-term plan is just that it's really pretty simple. Innovation, supported by
productivity and really we think about our business in building brands, driving
innovation, focus on execution fueled by productivity. And that talked a lot about the
GES system and driving productivity and eﬃcient with DSD.
On beverage side, we have the same commitment and we've learned a great deal as
partners with Frito-Lay to drive and extract some of that that value so that we can put
that value back into, again that cycle of building our brands, adding innovation and
enhancing our execution. We still think there is room to grow across all three of
those measures across the brands that we have, the innovation that we drive and
then obviously we feel like our execution can still get better as we drive greater
granularity down at the store level with our DSD system. But we see that as a long-
term play.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Ellie, in the share, I think it's, right now we're about even to slightly up. But just
remember three or four years ago, we weren't gaining -- we were losing share, we
were losing sales and the proﬁt performance, it wasn't where we wanted it to. So we
ﬁnally got this into balance. I think the long-term bet is if we keep investing in tea,
coﬀee, sport drinks, water and some of these faster moving products over a long
period of time, we will gain share.
Right now, it's a bit of a balance between staying in the CSD game, you have to be
there because the volumes are high and also gaining on the new, what's called the
new-age beverages, which in ﬁve years from now, I look at college campuses and I
just give you one example, one story. Out on a college campus, asked the people on
our marketplace which is the fastest selling product in the campus. Number 1, water.
What's Number 2, Gatorade. What's Number 3, Lipton Tea. Number 4 is Starbucks.
Number 5 is Mountain Dew. Number 6 is Pepsi.
So if you just fast forward, when these kids become 28, 29, 30, have their own
families, that's what they're going to be buying. And I think when that time comes,
we'll be in a much better share position if we keep investing in these kind products.
And just a billion-dollar track record going forward from savings perspective, it has
to be diminishing over time. So just a little bit more on that.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Ellie, I'll tell you. In theory, you are right. At some point, we should hit the limits of
physics on productivity. But I think technology keeps opening constraints that we
believe we have today. I'll give you an example. I drive to work. On the other side, I
see a Frito-Lay truck stuck in traﬃc, it just, it makes me mad. But the reality is in
today's technology, that truck could have ﬁgured out that there was going to be
traﬃc, then route it into a diﬀerent store, brought them along. So we keep ﬁnding
breakthroughs like that with each year that we felt there was a constraint and thenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 19Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Al Carey
A - Vivek Sankaran
A - Kirk Tannersomething comes along that breaks that constraint. While I believe in the theory that
there is a limit, I haven't seen it yet.
Maybe just to put some numbers around those themes, on GES, can you just update
us? I think on the Frito-Lay side, about 30% of the footprint has been converted over,
just an update there. And the pacing of conversion as you talk about the runway to
2020? Then a similar some update on where we are analogous on the beverage
side, Kirk?
Then second question, as we think about these premium occasions that you're going
after. And I know it's hard to kind of make this line of demarcation in the portfolio.
But can you give us some sense of how you would classify your portfolio in terms of
the percentage that's premium healthy snacking, premium healthy beverage
consumption, the rate of growth in that segment of the portfolio versus the core and
then also the relative proﬁtability of that growth, just so we can frame the future?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Why don't you start with the portfolio?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
On the GES question, you're right. We're about 30%. We continue to expand it. What
we're ﬁnding is that where we -- there's two ways to think about it. One is investing
capital in all our diﬀerent sites where we converted to GES. And second is coverage
of the marketplace. So we are ﬁnding ways to cover more of the marketplace with
any initial investment in GES. So we're rethinking how best to spend that capital
going forward. So that we can cover the marketplace in the most capital-eﬃcient
manner. So it's a slight re-think of what we might have said maybe ﬁve, six years ago,
just that it's more eﬃcient.
On the portfolio, we are aﬀording share of the premium segment, in Frito, about
20% of the segment, 18% or so is what we'd call the premium better-for-you. So we
under index on that. So we look at that and say that's a signiﬁcant opportunity. It's
also more the growing segment. So we feel good about the momentum there. Our
premium business is growing, I'd say about 3x the rest of it. And so we've -- it's
becoming a bigger part of our growth.
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
Let me answer the GES question for the beverage side. We have a ﬁve-year roadmap
to get there. The GES model in beverages is a little less cumbersome from an
automation standpoint. And we have a clear path to do that over the next ﬁve years.
We are about 15% into it right now. And continue to invest behind it and reap the
rewards that we both enjoy.
Similar numbers on the beverage side from a premium standpoint, we continue to
have a smaller portion in premium. But it is deﬁnitely high growth and products likeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantPure Leaf and Naked have deﬁnitely allowed us to see substantial growth and give
us the runway to continue to drive that growth. At the same time innovating on our
core business is still very important to us and preimmunizing some of our products
like Tea House and like some of the other products I mentioned before, deﬁnitely
allow us to keep a solid ground on our core business and still allow us to enjoy
growth on the premium side.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
About 48% of our business in beverages is CSDs and about 25% of my total
business is CSD, to give you an idea of the mix.
Just a broad question. And I apologize it maybe too broad. But if you just look at the
productivity savings that Ellie mentioned 10% growth rate in operating proﬁt. But you
only guided the 8% local currency EPS growth every year and there you grow the
topline 3% to 4% organically. I know there's some currency (inaudible) book. Why is
the evergreen target 8% when every year you're 10% productivity?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Yes. So Bill, the $1 billion, if you look at as a % of EBIT. But then you've got oﬀsets to
that, which is the natural rate of operating cost inﬂation as well as investments we're
making in the business.
Okay. But like if you don't have add the productivities, there'd be negative growth in
the business? Do you know what I'm saying, like --?
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Yes, for sure. If you look at the margins. And we don't talk about productivity x %
goes to the bottom line. But to the positive, you've got positive price mix, you've got
productivity and then the oﬀsets are going to be commodity inﬂation, operating cost
inﬂation, investments and then you've got some negative margin mix depending on
how quickly the developing and emerging markets are growing and some of that's
also -- there is an investment element to the D&E markets.
But the net of all of that gets us to the 8% constant currency EPS growth. And if you
look at what we've done since 2012, this model is working well, we are generating
topline growth, we're getting a fair amount of margin expansion that's driving good
earnings growth and good cash ﬂow. So we think we've got a model that works.
Then do you think we are on the other side of bell curve in terms of soda taxes and
why you haven't seen similar taxes in some of the I guess like healthy snacks,
because it seems like a lot of chatter has died down. But it still seems like people are
still keen to kind of exact the pound of ﬂesh.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22

How about on beverage side? It seems like the chatter has died down. But I'm just
curious where you kind of think we are?
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
The soda taxes are a problem. There are several markets that have implemented
them. And it seems like they come into two categories, one is where you have real
health concerns and we're working hard on our performance with purpose goals
and making good progress on them and launching lots of new products in taking
down sugar on the health side.
Then there is a group of cities and jurisdictions that are trying to close their budget
gaps and it has nothing to do with health. We're working with the American
Beverage Association. I'm on the board of that with the Coke and Dr. Pepper people
and the other beverage people ﬁghting these taxes because they are discriminatory
and they don't seem to make sense. But that's -- we're doing that as an industry.
It looks like there is a rule of credible challenger in sports drinks, this is the ﬁrst time,
right? Another brand out there with good velocity and growing distributions. Can
you talk a little bit about BODYARMOR? Could you talk a little bit about how you are
thinking about that and for Gatorade beyond Flow and how you're defending?
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
Absolutely. We treat all competitive activity very seriously. And Gatorade has been
and continues to be a driving force with sports nutrition across an entire platform.
We're reaching the athlete better than ever, being backed by science. We continue
to innovate oﬀ the Gatorade platform and that's -- you saw us introduce G Organics
end of last year. We'll continue to support that this year and we continue to build
brands -- sub-line brands for Gatorade that allow a greater reach to consumers. And
this year, we're launching Flow, which is a terriﬁc sub-line. Last year we extended
Frost, which reached over $1 billion in revenue. So we are completely committed toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22

A - Vivek Sankarandriving the growth on Gatorade with the athlete through formidable experiences
with the athlete. We reach over 7 million students each year and that's growing. And
the competitive intensity certainly if that continues, we feel really good about where
we're at with Gatorade, where we continue to drive the growth through the
innovation and our support with A&M, we continue to lean into the growth in sports
drinks. So we remain conﬁdent.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
We're approaching 80% share on Gatorade sport drinks. So we're going to attract
competitors. Maybe you could talk about the custom products.
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
Yes. In addition, again we do a lot of research with the athlete and part of that in the
next generation is called GX and that is getting the formula right for the athlete. And
working with each individual athlete and getting the formula that matches their
sweat and really the output that they need in the form of electrolytes and
carbohydrates. And that's a customized formula that athletes can get today and
we're working with teams in the NFL and the NCAA to continue to build that science.
But again, Gatorade is so passionate about the athlete that I'm conﬁdent we'll
continue to innovate, ahead of the curve.
So two questions for Vivek. So I guess, if you just kind of look at the macro snacking
category, obviously, it's been a bright spot in the kind of the food category broadly.
It seems like the growth rate has slowed a little bit. So just wondering if you can kind
of share your perspective on what's happening to the broader category, what's the
realistic growth rate for the category generally over the next couple of years.
Then as it relates the eCommerce, it seems like snacking is kind of pretty good
category for eCommerce penetration to grow. So can you talk about what
percentage of your snacking business go through eCommerce and what you're
doing in terms of capability?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
First of all on the macro-snacks, you're right, Judy. The last -- I'd say, it seems like
maybe eight to 10 weeks, it has been a bit of a slowdown. I will tell you that 13, just a
week before Christmas was a monster week for food and beverage. And a monster
week for snacks overall, bigger than anything in the past that week leading up to
Christmas. So we think there was some shift in purchasing before the New Year that
happened then. We've also seen -- there's been a lot less money in the marketplace,
tax refunds with the delay to the 15th [ph]. I think as of Feb 2, there was $45 billion of
less money in the marketplace. So we think some of that is aﬀecting consumption. So
if we go back to, if you look at it steadily over the last two/three years, macro snacks
has been around 2%, salty snacks has been around 3.5%. And there's no
fundamental reason I've seen that it won't come back to that once we get past what I
think are some both dynamics here and some laps that we're going through.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22

A - Al CareySo I'm not worried about that. What I will tell you is that we are seeing, I'd say mid-to-
high single-digit growth on consumption occasions, we track the panel on snacking
and we continue to see that level of growth there. So I feel good about the category
itself. eCommerce, we love it, actually we think of eCommerce both with the pure
plays, think of the Amazons of the world. Then with the grocery click and collect. And
in both those cases, we do very well, in fact it's equal to a higher share index in the
basket that we see over there. Some parts of our portfolio play better than others in
eCommerce. It's not a material share of the business yet. But it is an extremely fast
growing part of our business and we feel very grounded in how we are doing well in
it.
My questions for you speciﬁcally on the challenges of leveraging the scale of having
the beverage and snack business together, because it was noteworthy when you
spoke to the second priority of serving the customers One PepsiCo, you made the
comment it's starting to make some progress and starting to pay oﬀ. But I think it was
ﬁve years ago if I'm not mistaken, there is a lot of scrutiny around the strategy, the
company announced the ﬁndings of a strategic review and found that shareholders
are better served by keeping the two businesses together. So maybe a little bit of
historical context with the beneﬁt of hindsight now and even today as you manage
the two businesses together, some of the challenges in terms of leveraging the scale
of both businesses. Thank you.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Yes, sure. At one point. And I had been on both sides of the business so I can say
this. When I was at Frito-Lay, the beverages were struggling a bit. And the ability for
us to work together to drive the business was limited. I think since we've gotten the
beverage business back on track, when you go see a customer at the senior levels,
ﬁrst of all when you are the largest supplier, it gives you a chance to have a seat at
the table. And we've been very serious about making sure we have one leader on
our top accounts. So when we go into see any of these big accounts, we cover Wal-
Mart, Albertsons, we have one leader for PepsiCo and they drive the agenda and the
divisions work with that person to make sure that we ﬁt the needs of that customer.
And Vivek ran the group before he had this job and I think he made a lot of
progress.
The other thing that happened, which I think made a big diﬀerence was we
consolidated digital marketing customer insights into one group and once we did
that, I think that's the reason why our score went up on the Kantar rankings because
we were bringing one set of insights to customers that was meaningful and we
staﬀed that group appropriately, we put topnotch talent in there and I think the
group is doing a very good job right now. That was one other thing that helped.
Also on the power of one side or the synergies one eCommerce group instead of
trying to have each individual division do their own thing, we put that under one
eCommerce. Foodservice is the same thing. Then as we start getting it outside of the
customer side of things, we're looking at technology. So for example Frito-Lay
invented a technology for their frontline route salesman that allows them to have aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 14 of 19Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Al Careymini iPad that is so much better for ordering, forecasting and presenting to
customers at store level.
We took that -- typically in the past, the beverage guys have to invent their own
version of this. We just took the Frito-Lay version and we've rolled that out now to all
of the front line salespeople, within the beverage business. And I think there is a
couple of other ideas where synergies might work. We are beginning to work on
them, the three of us right now. One is Frito-Lay does the best job of ﬂeet
management of anybody I've seen. They've moved forward on electric trucks, they
have moved forward on lightweight sprinter vehicles that get high-gas mileage, not
so on the beverage side. We're going to put those two together.
The other one is on I'd call it one transportation company. Could we do a better job
on our over-the-road ﬂeet and some of the transportation parts of our business
doing it as one, I think there are some possibilities there that we've just started
working on.
Al, also for you two questions pertaining to the scale you now have integrated so to
speak, both from a beverage and snack perspective. One is, as you think about bolt-
ons and the opportunity that is presented to you perhaps incrementally now that you
are managing these businesses as you are. And the beverage business has the more
stable trends, is your appetite for bolt-ons higher? How do you think about bolt-ons
diﬀerently?
That's one question. Then the second question is if you think about the diﬀerent
channels you're selling in C stores versus large format, can you give us a little bit of a
sense of where you think you're really making some progress, that signiﬁcant
leveraging these two businesses together and where the opportunity is really more
of a white space opportunity, you really haven't made much progress and therefore,
large format, you can go much further than you gone, say for example in C stores. So
just trying to get some channel comparison.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
Okay. So on bolt-ons, we deﬁnitely have an appetite for bolt-ons. And I give you one
example where it worked well. So with the Kevita business, we watched that business
for a while. It was very interesting. Looks like it had rapid growth, it was a new healthy
category and we took a stake in that business and watched it over a couple years.
And then we eventually got the business. And I think it ended being a win-win for
the company and for us. But we're going to be very careful about what we pay for
these deals. Some of the attractive smaller companies out there have multiple
expectations that are quite high and we want to make this a proﬁtable business
down the road. But if you take a look at Kevita, there are many other very interesting
smaller businesses out there that I think could be attractive for PepsiCo.
On the channel, maybe you guys could help me out on this, if I were to say one
channel for leveraging our scale, there's opportunities in every single channel. I think
one place we've done a great job at is the dollar channel. And I would say that oneFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantarea for big opportunity is foodservice. And I think sometimes we still to look at --
when I was at Frito-Lay, I looked at the foodservice business like some ancillary little
business, it's 10% or 11% of their mix. And on the beverages, now that we have this
broader portfolio, it's more interesting than just selling cola. We have a real chance
of changing the business in colleges, healthcare, business dining, those kinds of
feeders that right, I think we're really small compared to where we could be.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
I'd just add that I think, if you set aside the channels we'd become really good at
working together on holidays. And it's a material part of our business. So six holidays
times three weeks each, synchronizing things, developing programs that are truly
integrated executing it at the same time in the stores. So we're really terriﬁc at that. I
think we have opportunity on an everyday basis if we do the same kind of thing in
large format. So if you look at it, we still think there's upside.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
So one thing that helps is -- I have been on the Pepsi, started for Pepsi back and
forth. Vivek has done both sides, Kirk has done both sides. So I looked at the Top 10
positions in North America for our management team among all of our businesses.
Eight of the 10 has been on both sides of the business. And the three of us, we have
one people plan, new succession plan for North America and we are really
convinced that you have to have both sides of the business. What I found is that
Frito-Lay is a precision, a machine at execution. And there's nobody like Frito-Lay
and then when you move over to the Pepsi business, I remember when I came over I
thought this is going to easy, it's a little diﬀerent when you have a big competitor
bigger than you are and it teaches you the art of competition and also to be very
diligent about looking at the marketplace and what's going on. And the combination
of two is a great combination. But if you come with just one, it makes it tough. I was
brought to my knees the ﬁrst six months, I was in the beverage business, it is a tough
go.
{BIO 19640168 <GO>}
Let me just comment too on the foodservice business. I had the chance to run that
for PepsiCo for three years. Again when you pull together your total portfolio, your
oﬀering, your customer base, access to, really a full access path to PepsiCo and I can
tell you that makes a diﬀerence. And they lean in on the growth and when you show
up with growth and you talk about growth with your customers, you are a stand out.
In our commitments to outgrow our competition using the total portfolio of PepsiCo
and resources of PepsiCo and foodservice is a great example of that, small format
and then these customer teams that we have today, really drive the growth. And that
is the mission. And it continues to work. And I would just echo the comments on
talent, on building talent across our teams is essential something that we work on
each day. We talked about it on a weekly basis about moving talent from our
businesses one to the other.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantJudy's question earlier on eCommerce. What are you doing about it, winning that
(inaudible) last week said, PepsiCo was representing about 18% of the growth in
retail while representing just 10% of sales. So is it the same numbers do you see in
eCommerce and what you're doing to run that if not to win in this channel. And the
second question is more about, I know I've got in front of me the US crew here. But
since like the US is rating in wholesale lenders, how this is replicable outside of the
US, internationally, that great model?
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Let me talk to you about eCommerce. First, it's hard to get all the same numbers in
eCommerce as we do from the retail side of the business. So it's hard for me to tell
you what % of the total growth we represent, et cetera on eCommerce. What we've
done, we have created a group in, ﬁrst, it's a global group responsible for
eCommerce and there's a group within North America responsible for eCommerce.
And we went and brought a lot of people from outside PepsiCo, we realized we
didn't understand the space. And it's not so much the physical side of it, it's really
about how do you win the screen and that's the skill set that we didn't have. And so
we have a bunch of people that's all they think about at this point.
Then we have others within the businesses that are changing two, three things that
are essential for eCommerce. One is speed of how we get things done. We can get a
product out literally in ﬁve days for the eCommerce business. We try to do things like
that, packaging, various et cetera.
And the second is the supply chain, making sure that what we're ﬁnding interestingly
is that our existing distribution capability, because in the DSD and our products
going to travel with, warehouses all over the country and manufacturing all over the
country. So by deﬁnition we are quite distributed already. And so that's actually
turning out really interesting advantage in eCommerce, because we just ship it to
goods over DC want to from our closest location. So we feel good about all of the
trajectory. Unfortunately I was not able to tell you the level of growth we represent
on the total basis.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
My guess is we're not anywhere, we're not at 18% of the growth of ecommerce, that's
not at all. But we need to do some work on packaging to be in more of ecommerce
friendly packaging, which we're doing right now. We'll get there. But we're little
behind on that.

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantNo, more broadly with GEs.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
I see what you are saying. Okay, we have global groups, one for nutrition, one for
beverages and one for snacks. They are scouring the world for good ideas and
they're also working with R&D on developing the future products so this is one
example that came out of the GE group. The global groups identiﬁed premium
water, something that we should do. And they actually came up with the idea, I'm
quite sure that it was a very good idea taken the art of young developing artists and
give them a chance to succeed by getting their art on the front package of these
products and then every quarter this art is going to change. We have three into
quarter one, we'll have three more. These were young artists that are budding artists.
Now they're doing --. We met them at the Super Bowl. Their business has blossomed
now. The next round is three young women artists are kind of go on here. And then
we'll change this out every quarter.
It's a cool idea that came from a group of global people that work in our company
and also a design group, which is our Global Design Group. It's in New York City and
they will part. So I think the sharing of ideas around the world is a possibility for us.
There are things going on in diﬀerent parts of world I don't know anything about
and if it wasn't for these, GEs, I would not get the opportunity to sell some of these
products.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
Our model is boringly simple. We spend money on brands, we come out of the lot
of innovation, we are maniacal about execution. And we're funded with productivity.
And the role of these global groups is to take that the ﬁrst two on brands and on
innovation and make sure we get leverage on it globally.
Now, when it comes to the third bucket, on execution and productivity, we have
other groups that also cut across horizontally. So when we are talking about a lot of
the go-to-market ideas from we have to ﬁnd a way to get or prevent a traﬃc routing
as an example of any capability we develop, we've got those groups trying to make
sure that it's applied all the DSD organization or operations across the company. So
we're trying to get that same degree of leverage and excellence in every part of the
company.
{BIO 2147799 <GO>}
Can you take one more question?
We spent the past day and half talking about the lack of sales growth, especially in
the center store. You guys provide growth. So are you getting your fair share of
space, if you see an opportunity for incremental space? Then as a part of that, is
there an opportunity to expand a bit more on the snack side to get to consumption
occasions, which you are not, if you can answer that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-22

You're asking three sales guys if they think they should get more space?
Yes.
{BIO 1985709 <GO>}
When I think a couple of example, let's just take beverages for a second. If you go in
there and just try to battle it out, give me a few more spacings, it's very boring for the
retailer to have to deal with this. But if you can come in with new ideas for example, if
you look at the non-card businesses and you look at the healthier drinks, the world is
changing fast. This water business is on ﬁre. It's probably going to grow double-
digits this year. And the customers open to looking at insights that leads them to
new merchandising strategies. I think there is a great opportunity to really recreate
the beverage gondolas set and the way you merchandise beverages in the stores.
For example, we're going to go after, I'd call it the next generation CSDs, single-
serve, lower calorie, smaller packages. So you're not held captive to these low-
priced 12-packs. Customers are very interested in this. And they're interested in
letting us experiment with new sets and rolling them out, because they realize the
world is changing fast. One example, one very large customer believes in the single-
serve business and they've now put in 60 to 84 foot single serve open-air coolers.
And you can't believe the increase in their single-serve business and their overall
beverage business from doing this and it pairs up with some of the meal solutions
that they've got. But they're making 35% to 40% margin on all of these products
instead of a 5% margin that you might sometimes see on these multi-packs.
It really makes a diﬀerence for the customer. Those kinds of ideas are working. That's
how we'll get more space rather than the usual battle of we deserve to spacings
versus our competitor. And it gets pretty old. Now on the snack side.
{BIO 16613348 <GO>}
We will get more space, because we continue to be the highest cash per square foot
to just go with that raw metric, there is nothing better than our portfolio. The
innovation we bring continues to help us get more space. For your second question,
we went into the frozen section with Doritos loaded, some of you may have tried it,
we launched that product last year. We've expanded that now into most almost all of
retail. It's been an interesting learning for us, it actually works very well and so we're
going to continue with that pipeline. So we try to get out of our space, if you think of
our space as savory snacks, we try to get out of that carefully and slowly and
deliberately where our brands can make a diﬀerence and we're having some good
early wins in some of those areas.

how well you're performing on your current space and also your innovation pipeline.
How are you going to bring new shoppers down the aisle. And the experience that
the shopper has at the shelf at that moment of choice and with our DSD system, we
have the ability to help customers own that moment of choice with great execution
at the shelf. And those are the three things that we focus on. When Al talked about
