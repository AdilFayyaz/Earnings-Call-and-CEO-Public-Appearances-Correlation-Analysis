Great. Good morning, and welcome to the ﬁrst day of J.P. Morgan's 42nd Healthcare
Conference here in San Francisco. My name is Harlan Sur, I'm the Semiconductor,
Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst for the ﬁrm. For the ﬁfth time in six years,
we have the team from NVIDIA presenting. For those of you that don't know NVIDIA,
they are a leader in accelerated computing, semiconductors, systems, and software
platforms and areas like artiﬁcial intelligence, deep learning, powering some of the
world's most powerful supercomputers, driving compute innovations for cloud and
hyperscalers, as well as large vertical markets like healthcare and life sciences.
They are the foundational compute platform, powering most of the generative AI
initiatives worldwide. Here with us today from NVIDIA is Kimberly Powell, Vice
President of Healthcare. She is responsible for the company's platforms for
accelerating compute, AI, and visualization that power the ecosystems of imaging,
genomics, life sciences, drug discovery, and healthcare analytics.
Kimberly, thank you for joining us today. And we go ahead and turn it over to you.
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you. Standing room only. If you guys want to come in, I'd love to
have you come in. There is a little bit room upfront. Take those other seats. I know I
won't be able to see you. But, Harlan, thank you so much for inviting us to come back
for a ﬁfth year at the conference. It's an extreme honor to be presenting along with
the world leaders who are dedicated their lives to save others. And it's an amazing
opportunity for us to be the only technology company here.
And if you were here during the Recursion talk, I think this is a remarkable year for
technology and healthcare and I want to be able to talk about that. So again, thank
you to Harlan, and the J.P. Morgan event for this opportunity to present.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08

Page 2 of 13So let's just walk through. Before I get started, a moment to read our Safe Harbor
Statement, which you are all quite familiar with. This presentation does contain
forward-looking statements, and investors are advised to read our reports ﬁled by
the SEC for information related to risks and uncertainties facing our business.
Okay, fantastic. Let's get started. NVIDIA is driving two simultaneous computing
transitions; Accelerated Computing, and AI. Accelerated Computing enabled
generative AI, driving platform shifts in software and enabling never before
applications to be built like ChatGPT.
AI is much more than a GPU problem though. Okay? It's a full-stack data center
problem. We start out with three-chip systems that need to be interconnected in
ways that they can both scale up and scale out. Together, accelerated computing
and generative AI are really the path forward for us to meet the performance, the
scale, that we need and the eﬃciency for the generative AI era. Okay?
Accelerated computing and generative AI make possible this digital biology era that
I'm going to talk a lot about, whether it be the $100 genome or new omics ﬁelds
entirely being created like some of the companies I'm going to talk about who are
creating new ﬁelds of omics altogether. Let's start with one of them that's super
exciting called Deepcell. Deepcell's REM-I is a new platform for cell imaging. It does
cell sorting, imaging and high dimensional analysis all in one instrument. And they
are creating a new ﬁeld called Morpholomics.
This is a video simulating a melanoma cell physically transforming to a functional
state that gives us the ability to transmit to other tissues, otherwise known as
metastasis. This is highly signiﬁcant insights and information for both the research
community and the clinical community. It's the next generation of ﬂow cytometry in
digital pathology put into one instrument, and by using their generative AI
algorithms, they have one called the human foundation model. They can do that
real-time analysis of characterization of those cells right on the instrument using
NVIDIA GPUs in our AI stack. This platform is inventing a new omics ﬁeld called
Morpholomics.
Another incredible exciting platform that is digitizing biology is called spatial
genomics and it's the study of single cell genomics that is represented in 2D and 3D
for that spatial understanding in the organization across tissue samples. It's giving
new understanding of how cells interact and the genes they each express. They have
broad application in basic biology, clinical diagnostics and drug discovery.
The Nanostring's new cosmic system is capable of taking a tissue of over a million
cells and visualizing 600 diﬀerent gene and protein targets per cell. You're listening
to these numbers, 6,000 diﬀerent genes and protein target per one all -- for all one
million cells. And this is producing something like six terabytes of data per sample,
per sample. The cosmics platform, it allows you to analyze more cell types, more cell
states, and biological pathways than any other system on the market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 13There is another phenomenon that is happening not only the digitization of biology,
but also with generative AI, the ability to represent the two things that describe
drugs; biology and chemistry in a computer. We have the opportunity to use
generative AI to represent it and there are like -- there are papers coming out almost
momentarily that are new applications in this space and naming a few that just
happened at the end of last year and they are -- a lot of these were presented at the
Nordic's conference, which is known for being the AI conference of the world, now
has a drug discovery workshop that is being presented there.
When you see these new ﬁelds up here at the Nordic conference, you know that
something big is happening. So for example, docking algorithms, a new docking
algorithm buy tech bio called Receptor.AI, it has amazing capabilities to meet the
capabilities of the new AlphaFold latest but at a 600 times reduction in compute
cost.
When you're doing docking, you want to explore the universe of chemical
compounds. We want to go beyond screening a billion compounds into trillions of
compounds. This is the way that we're going to get there.
How about alpha may sense from DeepMind? This team, generative model, it can
predict pathogenesisity or benign mutations of immunoassay sequence across the
Protium. I mean, that is going to be incredibly powerful tool that is just being
developed. And then the team at MIT used deep learning to discover, not a single
compound, but an entire class of antibiotic compounds by using deep learning. And
this is super helpful in the age of antibiotic resistance. These are just to name a few
ways that we are representing either chemistry or biology in a computer to do things
like generate new ideas to make predictions, to even be able to model very complex
interactions and we are move -- even moving into the age of design with generative
AI.
So this is a very big moment for the drug discovery industry. The last several decades
instruments computation and mathematics have paved the way to create the
computer-aided drug discovery industry, CADD. Okay? Steady progress has been
made in simulating the behavior of atoms and molecules, starting back in the 80s
with DFT enforce ﬁelds and releasing our ﬁrst computational molecular modeling
applications like Charm.
And then, all the while we're starting to be able to digitize biology with things like X-
ray, crystallography, being able to solve protein structures, starting kicking oﬀ the
structural biology drug discovery era, and we continue to make steady progress
larger and larger, systems of simulation, more and more biology. Now we had high
content screening hit the market, moving in to be able to do things in virtual -- virtual
screening with Schrodinger's glide program in the early 2000s. At the same time,
solving the human genome, and then moving into very much multi skill systems of
simulation where you can now move it to the GPUs and use accelerated computing
to do things multi-system, and really understand the dynamic nature of ligands and
proteins interacting, and of course, the Nobel prize of Cryo-electron microscopy,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 13being able to see these proteins at atomic resolution but something magical has
happened since 2020.
In the age of generative AI, AlphaFold and even our own work with AstraZeneca
started to show -- with MegaMolBART, started to show that you can represent this
data in a computer. At the same time. I just talked about, you're able to digitize
biology at incredibly new scales and at multi scales with those platforms I just
described.
So now for the ﬁrst time, we can represent the world of drugs, chemistry and biology
in a computer. This is igniting an exponential expansion to the CADD industry,
computer-aided drug discovery industry.
Now we're seeing history repeat itself a little bit. What computer-aided design and
electronic design automation did for the chip industry, was to allow it to represent
every stage of the process in a computer. First, they were small programs and then
they evolved into applications and ultimately into platforms that codiﬁed the
method, the method to design chips.
Some platforms specialized in the front-end and other platforms specialized in the
back-end and this is a 40-year journey that now allows us to build, essentially, a
perfect 100 billion transistors chip completely in silico. Because of the CADD and
EDA software industry, a trillion-dollar electronics industry has emerged. And the
world's ﬁrst trillion-dollar chip company.
What CADD and EDA did for chip design, the CADD industry, computer-aided drug
discovery industry will do for drug design. Two necessary conditions have arrived for
drugs; digitizing biology and being able to represent it in a computer. We have the
perfect -- we have the perfect conditions to see a massive expansion of this
computer-aided drug discovery industry to serve this $250 billion spend every year
in R&D.
Generative AI presents a new class of tools that will get codiﬁed into applications
and new methods of discovery. In fact, go beyond discovery and evolve into design,
helping create the conditions to no longer be a hit or miss industry. This new class of
CADD will synthesize and systematically endeavor the process. And it will help it be
more consistent and more eﬃcient in ﬁnding drugs for speciﬁc diseases and speciﬁc
people someday. And this -- this will be -- helps build the worse -- the world's ﬁrst
trillion-dollar drug company.
NVIDIA has been preparing for this moment for over a decade, building deep
domain expertise and NVIDIA Clara, our domain speciﬁc computing platform for
healthcare. We're building the essential components to accelerate the next
generation of CADD. Parabricks for genomics, Isaac and Holoscan for next
generation medical instruments and robotic labs, BioNeMo for generative digital
biology and chemistry, MONAI for a preclinical and clinical medical imaging AI and
NeMo to build scientiﬁc copilots and the ability to talk to your data.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 13We build domain speciﬁc tools and application frameworks and now cloud services
that can accelerate the CADD industry's ability to adopt the most important
computing platform shifts of our time, which is accelerated computing and
generative AI.
So today we're going to focus in -- on BioNeMo. NVIDIA BioNeMo is a generative AI
platform that provides services to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation
models for drug discovery. BioNeMo provides large scale optimized and easy to use
training on your own proprietary data. We oﬀer a growing collection of pre trained
models with applications across the drug discovery process.
Models in the platform come from three sources; models invented by NVIDIA, open-
source models we curate and optimize, and proprietary models developed by
NVIDIA partners. BioNeMo is an AI factory for drug discovery. Think about turning
raw data into capable models that get deployed for discovery and design tasks, and
they're validated in the lab. And the data generated from the lab work goes back
into the training process once again, completing what's called the lab in the loop.
Biology and chemistry generative AI models are still quite small. We're still in the
very, very early innings compared to other ﬁelds like natural language processing
and what you're seeing with GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-5. But we're growing in size and
complexity. And so we still have a lot of progress to be had building larger and more
capable models from digital biology data that already exists today, and the
continuously enhancing these models with the data that's continuously being
generated in the labs.
So BioNeMo provides the biopharma ecosystem with large scale model training to
eﬀortlessly train and scale -- AI training to thousands of GPUs. And you can train
billion parameter models in days rather than the months it was taking.
So for our very ﬁrst announcement, we're excited to announce that Amgen, an early
adopter, NVIDIA DGX cloud and BioNeMo. They're setting out to build generative AI
models in search for novel human data insights and for drug discovery. Amgen is
building a supercomputer called Freyja at their deCODE headquarters in Iceland for
the use on one of the largest human data sets to build foundation models. Since its
founding -- ince deCODE's founding in 1996, it's curated more than 200 petabytes
of deidentiﬁed human data from nearly 3 million individuals. This population scale
data has a very, very unique human diversity, and you want these models to see that
diversity.
DeCODE has also helped sequence 500 million human genomes from volunteers in
the UK Biobank. So working with such big data sets requires large -- powerful AI
systems like Freyja and NVIDIA, it's an NVIDIA DGX superpod with 248 H100s
running NVIDIA BioNeMo that help them train these million parameter models in
just a couple of days.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 13We're also super excited today to be announcing that BioNeMo service is now
advancing into beta and being adopted by leading CADD makers in the industry.
With our growing collection of models, the BioNeMo service, CADD makers have
access to optimized scalable and stable APIs that are enterprise grade and they can
voice services that they can rely on to build out their platforms and their methods
that enable drug discovery and design. The NVIDIA BioNeMo team carefully
optimizes these models, delivering throughput and cost savings up to seven times
faster, which essentially means seven times cheaper.
Let's have a look at some of the amazing CADD platforms being built on the
BioNeMo platform with generative AI.
(Video Presentation)
It's amazing. And if you were here this morning at the 7:30 talk with Chris, the CEO
of Recursion, you would have seen the incredible platform they just announced
called Lowe. You use your language to operate it, to kick oﬀ, so you use a generative
AI inference to talk to it and then you inference another generative AI to generate
molecules.
So we're super excited to work with all of these amazing companies. We have
another incredible announcement. Today we are announcing the ﬁrst partner
Recursion to oﬀer their foundation model called Phenom-Beta in BioNeMo. Not only
is the ﬁrst partner model, it's also the ﬁrst vision transformer model targeting cellular
data with applications in target and hit discovery. So Phenom-Beta provides
representations of human cell images to systematically relate genetic and chemical
perturbations to one another in very high dimensional space, helping identify
potential new targets in drugs.
So let's take a look at Phenom-Beta in action.
(Video Presentation)
Awesome. So, Recursion has made great contributions to advance the science of
phenomics and machine learning by providing the community with public data sets
and their recent launch of Valence Labs. And so we're excited to now have BioNeMo
make their model easily accessible to the community for non-commercial use, and
you can also contact Recursion if you're looking for a commercial license. So we're
super excited about this extension of the BioNeMo platform to include our very ﬁrst
partner proprietary model.
We're also excited to be announcing that NVIDIA's ﬁrst -- NVIDIA's own invented ﬁrst
foundation model, MolMIM to be deployed in BioNeMo. MolMIM uses a large
language model to learn chemical space using self supervised learning objectives
and MolMIM achieves state-of-the-art for constrained generation with -- what they
call multiple simultaneous objectives. This is demonstrating superior generative
performance in terms of the validity, the uniqueness, and the novelty.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 13So let's look at it. What MolMIM does is what's called controlled molecular
generation of small molecules, ﬁnding novel molecules with desired properties while
constraining it to the original starting molecule. But MolMIM gives users the ability to
specify their own objective functions like synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness or
solubility binding aﬃnity to steer this generative process. Control generation
increases the likelihood of success by generating molecules that satisfy multiple
objectives simultaneously.
And then MolMIM can signiﬁcantly reduce that expensive downstream time-
consuming screens that [ph]generally would have to go on because it's arriving at a
much higher speciﬁed score that the user has deﬁned. So we're really excited to take
our work that we did in molecular generation and bring what -- not only user-deﬁned
characteristics to it, but this active learning loop to do what essentially is an
intelligent search of molecular space.
So the next generation of drug discovery, the ecosystem, is really, really starting to
emerge. BioNeMo is accelerating computer-aided drug discovery platforms, being
built by software platform companies, being built by tech bio companies, even
being built inside of large pharmaceutical companies. The ﬁeld is diverse, and it
specializes to diﬀerent disease focuses. It specializes to therapeutic classes, and
specializes in diﬀerent discovery and design methods.
And so building out a large ecosystem of next-generation computer drug discovery
platforms is what we're all about and accelerating that process. So we're honored to
be working with this world-class ecosystem to accelerate their mission, to shorten
the time and increase the success rates of ﬁnding new medicines.
So let me just talk a little bit about, we believe that the CADD industry will do for
drug discovery what the CADD industry did for chip design. We believe the next
trillion-dollar drug company is out there somewhere, and it will be created. We want
to help accelerate them by investing throughout the industry. We like to invest in
companies who use our platform, enhance our platform, and expand our platform.
Companies who are heavy in data and AI, it really means that they are pushing the
boundaries of scale. They are going to push the boundaries of what NVIDIA has built
at AI supercomputing scale, and we love working with companies that are very data
ﬁrst, AI heavy tech ﬁrst. Companies who are developing methods to combine
machine learning with physics simulation, this will really, really enhance our platform.
This is going to be -- this is a new phenomenon. We need to get to new levels of
scale in terms of simulation.
And then AI companies who are pioneering AI design. Right. This is a way for us to
completely expand our platform. So these are incredible companies. It's a joy
working with all of them, and we look forward to continue to accelerate them.
2023 was a remarkable year for NVIDIA Healthcare. We announced the work that
we're doing with three world leading companies. Amgen is pioneering generative AIFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08

Page 8 of 13design and has adopted BioNeMo and DGX cloud, now extending their investment
in the NVIDIA platform with a new supercomputer in Iceland to put their huge and
unique human data sets to work in this ability to represent biology in a computer.
Medtronic announced they're building AI platforms with NVIDIA Holoscan. The ﬁrst
one being Gi Genius, which is the ﬁrst FDA-cleared AI-assisted colonoscopy tool to
help physicians detect polyps that can lead to colorectal cancer. And then a couple
months ago, we announced a multi-year strategic AI research collaboration with
Genentech, building large scale AI models and then helping them accelerate the
buildout of their platform, which they dub as the lab in a loop. So it's been an
amazing year and we're just getting started.
I think J.P. Morgan always makes us feel like we actually entered the new year after all
the vacation and the Champagne. Here we are. AI has opened healthcare to become
a technology industry. We opened in this room with a very, very tech-ﬁrst company
Recursion. And we're delighted to be here on the ﬁrst day as a tech company, really,
really expanding your thought process on the role technology plays in this industry.
Healthcare customers and partners already consume well over a billion dollars in
NVIDIA GPU computing each year, directly and indirectly through our cloud
partners. The future market opportunity is incredible. The $250 billion drug
discovery ﬁeld is being reinvented with digital biology and the ability to use
generative AI to represent biology in a computer.
Billions of wearable devices connected to AI supercomputers in the cloud,
comparing and predicting our health risks. And billions of surgeries and imaging
studies are going to use medical AI assistance. Generative AI is going to make
healthcare a very large technology industry where NVIDIA can make a signiﬁcant
contribution.
NVIDIA has been preparing for this moment for over a decade, building deep
domain expertise, domain-speciﬁc computing platforms, and a rich ecosystem of
partners to accelerate this next generation of healthcare.
So with that, I will conclude that without a doubt, generative AI is the largest and
most important technology shift of all of our lifetimes collectively. It has an absolute
ability to open up the entire healthcare market and very importantly to apply it to the
world of drugs where biology and chemistry can be represented in computer. This is
an inﬂection point, an absolute inﬂection point in our capabilities.
Next generation CADD is emerging. It's emerging in software companies. It's
emerging in tech companies. It's emerging in large pharma companies. And our
investments in healthcare are paying oﬀ.
And so with that, I really appreciate all of you standing in the back and joining us
today for what is going to be, I think, an inﬂection point for J.P. Morgan where
technology and AI is going to be the topic of every conversation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08

Questions And Answers
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Thank you. Sorry about that. We're going to jump into the Q&A. So if you have a
question, feel free to raise your hand, wait for them. We would appreciate if you just
wait for the microphone. We have one up here in the front.
Hi. Thank you so much for a wonderful talk. Very, very exciting work. I wonder, how
does NVIDIA plan on transitioning from the less regulated side of early stage lead
generation drug discovery to the much more regulated aspects of software and
hardware that you showed there? Because that seems like a huge jump for a
company.
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yeah. What NVIDIA does as a company is, we build the essential building blocks and
components. We build those for the companies who really understand the method,
the method of abiding by the regulatory process, the validation process, going
through all the trials. That -- it's really -- in order for us to really accelerate that, I think,
is to take away some of the challenging aspects of using generative AI.
The challenging aspects of using generative AI is, one, standing up the
infrastructure, two, getting the AI algorithm to work, three, getting it to scale. And so
we're taking care of a lot of those aspects of accelerating computing and AI so that
they can be a tool to be implemented in the methods that this industry is expert at.
We're not the experts in this ﬁeld or in the methods. We have the deep domain
expertise so we can translate them and see are there computing platform features
that we should be building to facilitate that. But it is not in our future that we are
going to get involved in the actual drug discovery business ourself.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
We have a question over here.
Thank you. This is very exciting. Can you share some of the current and potential
challenges to -- capacity to meeting this exponential growth in demand and interest?
Thank you.
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I think it -- we're at a really interesting time because as you -- if you
even just again watched Chris's interaction with his application this morning, he didFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 13Q - Harlan Sur
A - Kimberly Powell
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participanta less than 10-minute demo and he probably made more than 20 generative AI
inference calls. Okay? So just one human sitting on a computer for eight hours a day
is going to be doing something like 10,000 inferences in their given workday on
applications like that.
And so we're at a really tricky time right now, where what happened overnight was
the entire world could use the capabilities of AI. And so that did create a condition
where there was just a huge vacuum into some of the large applications that even
my daughter uses or my mother-in-law can use in the area of ChatGPT. That's going
to go away.
But the other thing that we do every single day when NVIDIA wakes up in the
morning is how do we make that computing more eﬃcient? Because we know that
the scale is just going to continue to expand and expand and expand.
And if you look at, we publish, it's called MLPerf Benchmarks, for example. These are
by a consortium of academics and industry, to be an unbiased measure of how well
we're performing on both training and inferencing. NVIDIA is at the top breaking all
the records. And when you're more eﬃcient, when you're faster, you're reducing the
cost, or you're reducing the amount of computational footprint that any one
application requires.
So, yes, from a physical capacity demand, we had to get over this hump of this, what
nobody could have predicted demand. But we're now in full understanding that
each and every one of us is going to have 20 copilots a day working on our behalf.
And so we ramp up the physical capacity, but the next thing is addressing the
software aspects of it, the computing eﬃciency of this, because we're going to run
out of power in the world. We're going to run out of space in the world.
And so that is what NVIDIA does. When we talk about full-stack computing platform,
it's not just the silicon, it's the system software, it's the acceleration libraries, and it's
the application optimization that sits on top. All of it has to be addressed from end to
end.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
We have a question up here in the front.
(Inaudible - Audience question)
Okay. Go ahead.
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
I could repeat the question.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2024-01-08
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 13A - Kimberly Powell
Q - Harlan Sur
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThank you very much for this. As you know, the drug discovery and development
ecosystem is really populated by various strata or levels of diﬀerent companies that
do diﬀerent things, right, to ultimately deliver a drug to the clinic and ultimately to
the patient. The barrier to entry for what you're providing here seems to be mainly
focused on very large players who may enable them to essentially do a lot more
themselves rather than in source or acquire.
Do you foresee going forward? My question is a little bit forward-thinking. This
basically collapsing the ecosystem, in other words, making entire parts of our
industry irrelevant, because they're no longer needed.
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
I -- what -- if you let what we experienced in computer-aided design for chips be any
indicator, what happened was, at ﬁrst, there was a lot of hodgepodge applications
out there, everybody going after, and it did somewhat settle down and consolidate
and codify. That's why I use the words codify into methods.
I think this codo -- and Chris said it again this morning, the methods -- the individual
tools themselves are important and impressive, but the methods are what really,
really matter at the end of the day. And the methods have to do with data as well as
codifying the process into a software platform.
So I can't -- it's hard for me to predict, because, as I said, companies, it's even --
healthcare is obviously much more challenging than designing a chip in a lot of
ways, right, because we're tackling very -- the disease focus, and they're constantly
evolving, and people are completely unique.
So to me, even if we solved some of it for the diseases we know of today and the
way we solve them today, it's still so far away from personalized medicine. And what I
would hope is that we're moving into methods that will ultimately personalize a
medicine for me. Right. And so we're going to go beyond what is today's status quo
of developing drugs for a population of patients.
And you're going to want to constantly turn this crank of entering my personal data
into these systems that provide the right insights, to ﬁnd the biological pathways to
my phenotype, et cetera, et cetera, into this wheel that would be, this is a drug made
for me.
So I think that is going to continue to expand actually -- expand it rather than
collapse it because we want to go personal.

Q - Harlan Sur
A - Kimberly PowellYeah. May I ask you a quick question? Can you speak to how any of the approaches,
BioNeMo or what have you might apply to complex biologics? I see most of the data
were on small molecules, anything around very complex biologics.
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yeah, that's the ﬁeld that everybody wants to get in. And I think that's why proteins
are being so highly studied and trying to essentially be again represented in
computers, proteins, enzymes, because of their attractable traits for drugs. And so
that's where the market is right now, even the AI market, so heavily focused in on
protein, and then being able to now see biology at very diﬀerent resolutions and
scales, I think is going to continue to facilitate that.
So I don't think that it's actually -- in my experience, I feel that it's swaying very heavy
in terms of complex biologics and the work that the companies are doing.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
We have our last question back there.
Does NVIDIA have any plans to develop a data marketplace or collaborative
ecosystem within the BioNeMo platform for sharing data between pharmaceutical
companies when there -- for these training sets, for companies that might not have
such expansive data sets?
{BIO 22145194 <GO>}
Yeah. At this moment, we haven't. We're all about -- thinking about what is going to
need -- what's necessary to push the industry to the next level. If it's open data sets
and the generation of synthetic data, that is it, we're open to having that discussion
about collaboration.
At this point, we're trying to put the AI capabilities in the hands of everybody. But
happy to have that conversation if you have ideas.
