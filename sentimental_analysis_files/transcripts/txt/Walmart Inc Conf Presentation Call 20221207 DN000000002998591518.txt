Hello, okay, thank you. I think that was Doug's favorite song and that's why we
played it on. Hi, everyone, welcome to our Keynote day two of our global retail and
consumer conference. I'm Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley's hardline, broadline,
and food retail analyst. It is our distinct pleasure to welcome Walmart's President and
CEO, Doug McMillon to our stage. Thank you for your participation of this event. You
want to clap. Walmart has been a regular participant and Doug helped Keynote one
of our virtual sessions a couple of years ago, we're thrilled to have him in person. I'm
going to read a quick disclosure and going to turn it over to Doug for a few opening
remarks and then we'll get into a discussion.
For important disclosures, please see the Morgan Stanley research disclosure
website at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. If you have any questions,
please reach-out to your Morgan Stanley sales representative, and with that..

Can you guys hear me? Thanks for your attention. Appreciate you being here. I'll be
brief to kick things oﬀ. I'm excited about where we are. I'm excited about our future
working with a great team. I think they've navigated this year well considering
everything that happened and we're setting ourselves up for a stronger future. When
I think about winning with the customer and member, I think the improvements that
we're making in-store with pickup, with delivery, whether that's from a store or e-
commerce around the world and the 24 markets that we operate in, it's making
progress, so I've got some conﬁdence in the top line growth of the company looking
forward in our long-term algorithm. Same is true for the bottom line, why do I feel
that way about the bottom line, and I think it's kind of three things.
First one is just opportunities to manage the business better and all the kinds of
ways that we do in retail. Maybe more strategically there's a productivity opportunity
with automation, particularly in our supply chain, and how that will aﬀect store
operations in particular. And then thirdly, the business model is changing and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

then a marketplace and then fulﬁllment services and then add income and then
other forms of data monetization creates an opportunity to have higher margins and
change the margin mix of the business, so that we are more resilient and more
proﬁtable at the same time and that works underway, we're making some progress
as it relates to that, hopefully, you've noticed that in our results as we've shared
them.
So I look ahead at next year and beyond and I acknowledge the amount of
uncertainty there is from an environmental point-of-view, but when I think about what
we can control and where we're at, I'm excited and optimistic.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Thanks. So it was about nine or so years ago, I was at the ﬁrst meeting, where you
took over as CEO and the strategy takes a long-time to evolve and you can't really
pivot as quick as you'd like with some structural things. Walmart seems like it's made
all the right steps, not all the right but many correct, fortiﬁed grocery, you're
investing in membership, you're getting new customers from diﬀerent income
brackets, marketplace fulﬁllment, I want to talk about the evolution of this
omnichannel strategy. It feels like the business is winning. The last 10 years was
about adapting to this omnichannel, it feels like the investments are in place and you
could argue we're getting towards the payback period and that big have gotten
bigger and some of the winners have been -- the winners have been set out, so,
curious how you think about the evolution of that strategy and if we're at a diﬀerent
phase now within the strategy and retail?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, I think we are, if you go back to that kind of 2014, 2015 period, we were really
focused on U.S. Supercenters. We were operating in more markets and if you get to
the center of the center and what's most important, if the U.S. Supercenters are not
performing well, Walmart doesn't have a good business, and you know all the
investments we made there in terms of remodels, inventory improvement, wages,
and the Supercenters were in a better place than they were, then very quickly on the
heels of that need to build a much bigger e-commerce business. The customer
wants e-commerce. We were behind. We did the things we did to accelerate that
and last year, as we've shared, we had a $73 billion e-commerce business globally in
terms of revenue, but that all kind of felt like silos or channels. And what happened
along the way is, we realized that the magic is in the way that you put them together
and truly creating omnichannel to save people time not just money.
Yeah, it's a broader assortment, yeah, it's a variety of experiences that include pickup
and delivery, but also things like the digital experience related to tier should enable
the in-store or in-club experience with tiers to be better or the deli counter or the
way we interact with pharmacy as a customer or a member and so it does feel like
that for some period of time now the channels went away, it's been more seamless
and that required us to change how we work inside the company. We ﬁnished upFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 19Simeon Gutman

Simeon Gutmanorganizational structure changes to make that easier for our teams to execute and
now I think we are truly an omnichannel retailer.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yeah, it feels like the next phase could be so -- maybe the big, maybe keep getting
bigger, the pandemic validated this omnichannel platform and it feels like you have
a proper oﬀense and defense to battle the e-Commerce threat that once was. I want
to talk about the consumer, diagnose the consumer, not a short-term euphemism
question, but diagnosing more about trade-down, what we've seen throughout the
year, there's been some ﬁts and starts, maybe around gas prices, but what do you
see from the consumer, what's happened in the last year?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, I didn't forecast inﬂation to be in the U.S., what it has been, and if you would
ask me 16, 18 months ago, we were looking at mid-single-digit inﬂation, certainly
didn't see what has ended up happening in dry grocery and consumables
happened. As it accelerated through January-February, it moved quickly, and it was
steeper in terms of trajectory than we expected and that had an impact on what
people buy, so if you were kind of, let's say, typical U.S. household and you've been
through two years of a pandemic, some of you have worked from home more and
some people have more discretionary income because of government stimulus, you
spend more money on home goods, you spend more money on the backyard, et
cetera, you didn't get to this period of January-February of this year, and I'm talking
about the U.S. consumer. And you've got gas prices headed up and you've got food
and consumables taking more of your spend, and so we started seeing in around
March this behavioral change, particularly with people with household incomes
below 50,000, where they started really prioritizing.
So their dollars went to food and consumables, went to gasoline, the discretionary
purchases, they kind of been making those, they didn't have to invest in home decor
for example. They didn't have to buy a new sweater and so general merchandise
sales started really dropping oﬀ and that pressure played through to higher income
levels as the months went by. So you can see behavioral change now at basically all
income levels in the country as people are more price-sensitive, and so they're more
selective on discretionary purchases. They'll buy the things that they need. The kids
will be taken care of, pets get taken care of, their partner gets taken care of, and then
they put themselves last, and you can kind of see that in the ranking of how they
make choices. And so I think that means that this Christmas, if you look at a topline
point-of-view, we'll look better because of inﬂated dollars than it actually is. If you
look at units and kind of the quality of the breadth of what sells at retail, as a retailer
we won't feel great about the quality of this Christmas and it will come later
Christmas is a day later and sales after Christmas will be strong and we'll be working
all the way through the quarter, the end of January 31, to get inventories where we
want and manage as we go through that. We've done this many times before. We've
seen this before and we'll work through it, but it's not ideal.

Doug McMillonWe use government data to try to assess reversion, especially of these durable
goods, where there was some overconsumption to try to understand units. You
probably have the better, the best dataset of everyone, curious throughout 2022,
does it appear that the rate of deceleration in durable goods, is it stabilizing, is it
getting worse or is it actually getting better?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Stable to a little worse is the way I would characterize that and very ﬂuid and it -- you
can look at the data and you can see ﬂat panel televisions in Walmart still selling
really well. So you can ﬁnd some conﬂicting data points. People will have Christmas,
they will buy items, but some of those ﬂat panel televisions are under $500 now. I
think we had one at $238 that was a huge television for Black Friday-related events,
so they are price-sensitive and selective.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And is the price elasticity there like it would be normally if you took the price of a
durable good down, does the consumer respond or because we've overconsumed
or over-purchased that over the last couple of years a home item, we're hesitant to
buy it?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
The latter is more true than it normally is. Things are less elastic than they would
typically be.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Makes sense, okay. Last quarter, we talked about higher income consumers, I think
we talked about it for a few, but I think there was an exclamation point on it.
Walmart+ feels or seems to be the gateway to this higher income consumer, maybe
it's just the marketplace, maybe it's broadly, so ﬁrst, can we just talk about Walmart+
as this gateway to getting new customers, is that a fair assumption?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I don't think it is. I think if you want to look at how income level shop at Walmart, the
way to think about it ﬁrst would be, everybody buys food and consumables -- almost
everybody buys food and consumables from Walmart, but they might not buy their
apparel from Walmart or their home categories from Walmart typically. The market
share growth that we've seen with higher income levels that have driven our growth
the last two quarters have been people making over 100 buying food and
consumables and so our challenge is to have market shares that look more
consistent across the whole assortment. We sell a lot of units of bicycles, we sell a lot
of units of televisions, but we don't sell as much in-home and apparel and some
hardlines categories as we could. So the way for us to retain -- attract and retain
higher income customers and members is ﬁrst to have a great assortment and greatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

Simeon Gutmanprices in those discretionary categories, so they don't need to go somewhere else
and have more brands and grow the marketplace assortment as we've done.
Then secondarily, having a digital relationship, which starts to head towards
Walmart+ is really important. And we've shared before, if people buy in-store and
online with walmart.com, they generally spend twice as much and they shop in-store
more often. That data has held over time and so that digital relationship, which could
be for a pickup order, it could be for a delivery order, whether that's from a store or
an e-commerce fulﬁllment center that's really important to us and then you get to
Walmart+ and we do like the behavior we see when someone becomes a Walmart+
member. So, Walmart+ is important, but it's not a simplistic shortcut for the
investment community to think about valuing Walmart. Walmart can grow sales and
proﬁt regardless of how many Walmart+ members we have.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
So a couple of follow-ups in that, so what would you attribute then this higher
income consumer who is coming to Walmart with more velocity or frequency?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
They're just looking for value and they're looking across categories more than they
were before. And to your point about kind of past cycles and the degree to which we
held on to customers, what's diﬀerent now is we've got this bigger e-commerce
business 370 million items in the U.S. marketplace. We've got an app, we've got
pickup, we've got delivery, we've got Walmart+, we added Paramount+ to it, so there
are other things in place that were not in place in the last cycle that we hope will
help us retain more customers.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And you said, you like the behavior of the Walmart+ customer as -- are they entering
the ﬂywheel as you'd expect, they're purchasing either consumable or discretionary,
the frequency and then I'll get to retention in a second?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
The primary reason why someone would want to become a Walmart+ member is for
free delivery. And our food and consumables customer value proposition is
attractive. It's high quality at a Walmart price and now you can get it delivered for
free in an unlimited fashion. Our challenge is to take that frequently purchased set of
items in that relationship and have it extend into more discretionary items and build
the basket out over time.

What year is it, could you start with that?
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
2022, I think...
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, I think we launched it in September of 2021 if I remember correctly when we
were out-of-stock related to the pandemic, it was perfect timing.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Right. So we've seen a chance to for retention, I'll make it a bigger question. We
don't talk -- you don't disclose the membership numbers, but you progressively
added features to the program, based on what you've added and the uptick you
would have expected, is the membership number trending at or better or worse
than what you would have thought?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We're not going to share that information at this time, I appreciate your persistence.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
How about one more at this, does the oﬀering still get better from here?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Yeah, I think the way to think about this is, we want to engineer and oﬀer to
customers that cause them to want to be members that is going to appeal broadly,
and so it was helpful to add a fuel discount, it's helpful to have Scan and Go, it will
be -- Paramount+ has proven to be helpful and we'll add more things over time, but
in a strategic and choiceful way not just growing spaghetti at along.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Okay. So 2022, thus far from an earnings perspective, it's somewhat been deﬁned by
the inventories now ﬁlled, if you look at the core business and I'm not sure there's a
whole commentary, but it's probably not playing out that diﬀerent other than the
inventories now, so, ﬁrst, how are you approaching purchasing, are you looking at it
any diﬀerent either to avoid the potholes, we talked about the ditch earlier or do you
just go back to being more aggressive to take market share?

Page 7 of 19Simeon Gutman
Doug McMillon
Simeon Gutman
Doug McMillonWe are doing our best to think an item and category at a time and not overreact to a
situation such as to go from one ditch to the other, which means that you've got to
have calculated bets related to what you think Christmas next year for imported
goods is going to look like. If you are a merchant for our company and your
response for categories that are vas [ph] turn and consumable, you don't have as
much of a challenge. You've got a shorter lead time, you can adjust, a lot of that is
replenishable, that's not as complicated. The more complicated stuﬀ is long lead
time merchandise and more discretionary merchandise. For the U.S. business two-
thirds of what we sell is either grown or made here. The other third comes from
China, India, Mexico, Canada, so those things have longest lead time. We are
generally taking a more conservative view. But asking our merchants to make item
and category decisions not some general decision to be -- to be less aggressive,
because we do have opportunities to grow sales and we have had out-of-stocks.
I mean, if you look at our Sam's Club business, our inventory in Sam's is up higher
than our inventory in Walmart US, because Sam's has a lot more members, they're
driving double-digit comps for almost three years in a row, and they need to keep
playing oﬀense. So everything needs to be a little more targeted, little more speciﬁc,
don't paint with a broad brush, that's the way our merchant leaders are approaching
it.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And this inventory issue, it feels like it hit Walmart relatively early relative to retail and
you made the decision how to deal with it, some of it marked down, some of that
moved out, it seems like the problems compounded to some degree with the rest of
the industry, and now there's a lot of merchandise entering into the oﬀ-price
channels, do you feel, do you see that being an impediment, not trying to be a
loaded question with sales outlook, but the environment could get a little muddy
because there's so much excess inventory that's still sitting out there, do you see that
it or not see that?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
That's plausible, I think in our case, we ﬁnished last quarter up 13% inventory. A lot of
that 13% is just driven by inﬂation, so inventory is in a pretty good place and what we
want to do is be positioned for ﬂexibility, and I think we're in pretty good shape as it
relates to that, whether it's hard lines or apparel.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And connected to that, the promotional backdrop pre-holiday, did that potential
excess or over-inventory position aﬀect it or has it been relatively stable throughout
the year?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I can't really talk about the fourth-quarter, yet.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Third quarter?
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
So rephrase that again.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
So during the course of the year did the backdrop become more promotional up
until the fourth quarter, reﬂecting more inventories in the channel?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
The way I would describe it is, there was more clearance in the market and so for us
showing was now value, handling our clearance as well, managing our apparel racks
well from a presentation point-of-view, those were the keys, and yeah, the market
had more clearance in it than what it would normally have.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Fair enough. Price, inﬂation, deﬂation, disinﬂation, I don't know if I can ask a lot of
diﬀerent questions about it, but -- I don't know if we can talk about expectation, but
based on what you're seeing from suppliers now the business is progressing, I guess
what can we talk about regarding price?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, let's break it into categories. If you start with fresh food, the pricing on
proteins, dairy, et cetera, is very volatile, it's moving around quite a bit. Chicken right
now is up, beef is down, fruit and veg is in pretty good shape from a price
perspective with disinﬂation or moderate inﬂation. So we'll manage that like we
always do. Dry grocery and consumables has double-digit -- mid double-digit
inﬂation that feels stubborn to us. And then, general merchandise is coming down.
Our cost of goods inﬂation for general merchandise across hardlines and apparel is
still there. We still have an inﬂated price but it's single-digit and the trendline is
coming down. GM is reacting to demand. But dry grocery and consumables, where
farmer input cost, supplier wages, their own input costs have driven prices up, thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

Doug McMillonfeels to us like it's going to be here for a while and we're trying to ﬁgure out with our
suppliers what could we do that's diﬀerent that would help mitigate some of those
costs, is there any waste in the system. Transportation point-of-view, can we get
better at forecasting, what are we doing the packaging, how do we help the
American family as much as possible on dry grocery and consumables, so that we
can bend this curve back.
And unfortunately, some of those suppliers are still pointing us towards more
inﬂation next year on top of the mid double-digits this year and we don't like that for
any reason. We don't like it for families, we don't like it as it relates to mix and what
that can mean for us. So we're pretty incentive to try and make that --make that turn
happen faster than it might normally. And we've got good insight into commodity
costs through private brands and other things. We know we can kind of penny out a
P&L on an item and have a productive discussion with the supplier about what
they're doing and try to encourage them to focus on market share and growth and
the longer term with us. In the meanwhile, we'll allocate space to private brands and
tertiary brands to degree that we need to help make this work for families.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Some of the price pressures because of the input cost of labor, which is more
structural, is that still a valid case to be made and wouldn't that argue that more of
what we've seen in terms of price will likely get kept?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think that's likely to a degree in these categories that I just mentioned.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Okay. Is it fair that Walmart lagged the marketplace in terms of raising price through
this pandemic cycle?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We are always trying to keep prices down and so, yeah, we held, we managed mix
pretty well. We got a lot of variables to play with. We've got the product mix
variables that we've always had and now we have some advertising income and
some membership income and some other data monetization income and we're
building a fulﬁllment services business. So if you think of retailers, the big mix game
we had a broad set of variables to manage and we're now broadening that even
more, which is helpful, and that's happening around the world in the various markets
where we operate. And we did do some things like for the Thanksgiving meal in the
U.S., hold our prices at last year's prices for a broad set of items that people could
shop to avoid inﬂation for their Thanksgiving meal. And I think the team is still
looking for more places to be able to do that to help those that need to help the
most.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

At this point, does it seem like the business has now been repriced for the inﬂation
we've seen or are there still some catch-up or could have been over?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Mostly repriced, managing price gaps as we go, but it's ﬂuid environment.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Price gaps, one last one on price. I think the message has been, your price gaps have
largely held, which a lot of retailers have actually made that assertion, which now
something has to give, the checks look like your prices, your price gaps have largely
held, so your posture on price? And I have a second question on it later on when
we'll talk about grocery, but just your current posture on price.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Again, on the Walmart US business speciﬁcally, but this would be true more broadly
as well. We have a sense for where our price gaps need to be to drive the growth
that we're trying to drive and we've managed that pre-pandemic through the
pandemic and now and it's moved around a little bit, things have normalized more
to pre-pandemic levels and more comfortable with that.

thought on price.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We have had and will have a strong set of competition, but we're not worried about
that, we can count on it.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Fair enough, okay. We'll move over to marketplace -- did you want to add anything
else?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
No, sir.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
The marketplace combined with Walmart+, combined with physical oﬀering, it
seems like you're better equipped than ever to deal with digital thread, we kind of
talked about this, do you feel like you've reached a critical scale now across your
network in terms of investments?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
There's more in front of us to do with the supply chain in particular and we're very
excited about automation and I think it's going to really help us -- our store
associates and help us with productivity, and speciﬁcally, what we're seeing is after a
number of years of work, there are opportunities to use automated storage and
retrieval systems in ambient distribution centers, food distribution centers, e-
commerce fulﬁllment centers, and eventually market fulﬁllment centers next to
stores. And they're all for basically the same thing, we're working with four diﬀerent
parties to do it, but it's all basically carts with wheels, putting away items or cases in
dense deal almost like data in the cloud that does not have a human in the middle of
it, a forklift in the middle of it or an empty aile [ph] like you see in an old-fashion
distribution center. The items go in and they come out the other side either as a
customized e-commerce order for a customer or as a pallet that has been mixed that
is speciﬁc for a department and a store.
So if you and I were in a Walmart store today in the U.S., we would receive the
grocery product on pallets and it's easier to work that freight, but if we were working
the general merchandise receiving area and we opened a trailer, there would be
brown boxes ﬂoor to ceiling on the ﬂoor and we would touch every one of those
boxes, put it on the roller, push it into the backroom, put it away in somewhere in the
backroom and then eventually somebody comes and picks that order, puts it on the
sales ﬂoor. In the future, those orders will come in palletized arranged by layer for
that department in that store. So we'll take the pallet jack, put it under the pallet, pullFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

Doug McMillonit to the sales ﬂoor, stock from the pallet and if anything is left that doesn't ﬁt it will
go to the back room.
It's a diﬀerent process, eliminating a lot of the hours that we invest in today in the
back room of our stores. That capital will take multiple years to put in place. In
addition to the robotics aspect of what I've just described, there's work under
underway related to the data that we've got for our supply chain and the algorithms
that we used to optimize it. You can imagine that in the past, we went from an
ambient network for discount stores to an ambient network plus food distribution
capability, then we layered on e-commerce fulﬁllment centers, each one of those
had diﬀerent operating systems and operating to a degree in a silo. What we've
been changing and have made progress towards changing is thinking all those
together in a way that you can inventory optimize like you couldn't before. So if you
can understand demand, get even better at forecasting with today's forecasting
tools, and then have a supply chain that's got data algorithms and robotics in it, you
can take costs out of the system that we have not ever been able to take out before.
So that's a multiyear investment journey.
I mean, we'll share more information about that in the future, but it's something that
we're really excited about. That has to happen in conjunction with the business
model changing. So the thread that you mentioned that runs from let's build an e-
commerce business, part of that is marketplace, we can get paid to operator
marketplace and people want to buy fulﬁllment services, in fact, a lot of people want
to buy fulﬁllment services and they want to have sales so they're willing to buy and
add the thread that runs from omnichannel to all of those things I just mentioned is a
very strong thread that is being pulled through as we speak. And so that business
model remixing happens in parallel with the automation of the supply chain and
ends up with a diﬀerent business model, which we're excited about.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
I wanted to ask two follow-ups. To that ﬁrst about the general infrastructure and
second about grocery. You built these mega DCs, this is about seven or so years ago,
I think it was the six mega DCs at the time maybe ﬁve, you picked up three more
from Jet, it now feels like maybe these -- remixing these new you're building another
set of DCs to -- that are bigger that can accommodate longer tail that can do
everything from dry good to grocery, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that right and is
the core infrastructure around becoming endless aile [ph] marketplace with all of the
goods within the network, is that what's becoming a reality now?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, think about it this way, think about our existing buildings, not new buildings,
being outﬁtted with automated storage and retrieval systems, step one. As we do
that, we get more throughput through those buildings and we avoid the necessity of
building more buildings in the future. And as we do that their space freed up,
because they are more dense, you now have in some of these million-square-foot
boxes excess space that you can do variety of things including sortation for e-
commerce, non-conveyables, other things you can do with that space, againFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

Simeon Gutmanavoiding the need for future buildings. That's true for the ambient DC network. The
grocery DC network is also existing buildings with automation. Then there is e-
commerce fulﬁllment centers, and you're right, we had a set of buildings, we added
Jet buildings to it, those buildings in most cases, if not all cases, will also be
receiving automated storage and retrieval systems in the existing buildings, which
helps with throughput.
And we're building a few new ones where we need them. I was in a new one in
Chicago the week before Thanksgiving and it's remarkable. There's not a lot of
human engagement with that product. There's still some, which eventually will work
through to an even greater degree, but it is really slick and also more accurate and
so you get more productivity through those investments. Each one of these, I should
say, individually has its own IRR or own set of metrics, each one of those investments
is embedded individually and then you get the beneﬁt of a collective system that I've
been trying to describe as a big additional beneﬁt.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And what have you learned around these capabilities coupled with grocery
automation distribution, it feels like you're on the ﬂoor of the technology, the debate
between macro and micro fulﬁllment, you're pioneering I think it's store 100, the self-
driving trucks moving out to the spokes, so do we have a model yet and a proﬁt
model that's tied to all these technologies that you feel good, but you understand
what it looks like.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, we can see all the pieces. I think the challenge that we've got is getting them
together in one place fast enough so that we can measure all of the others
unintended or things that weren't in the model, because you got to prove them all
out. There are still 100 market fulﬁllment centers that you're referring to is one of
several there're some other places where we're opening those and we believe that
having onsite market fulﬁllment centers with these big parking lots we've got, and in
some cases, some of the buildings we're trimming back a little bit, the 200,000
square-foot boxes and 220,000 square-foot boxes can be 185,000 still be as
productive from a sales point-of-view, that gives us space to use costs that we've
invested in the past to put MFCs in place and use the last mile advantage that we
have a being so close to people.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
I know we don't talk individually about e-commerce proﬁt and this is a sideways
question to it. We uses to discuss the lever of higher mix of general merchandise
being one of the biggest levers to that margin, is the cost of fulﬁllment as powerful,
is that now -- it wasn't going anywhere, but it is now because we're using the stores
more and then we're building this network, just happens the interplay between
those factors in driving costs?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, good question. The way I would describe it is, ﬁrst, the mix of sales by product
category is a key driver. You want a contribution proﬁt that includes apparel and
home and those kinds of things. Another way to think about mix of sales is ﬁrst-party,
third-party, you want a big enough marketplace business to make that mix work. And
then as you work down the income statement and you get to wages, one of the
biggest cost that we have in our e-commerce business is for store-level wage
investments to pick orders. We assign store picking for e-commerce to the e-
commerce P&L. So as we raise store wages or we use more hours to pick orders
because sales are going up that penalizes the e-commerce P&L and we manage it
that way as a habit.
So if and as the market fulﬁllment centers take labor hours out of that system
because we've automated using MFCs, and the other automation coming in the
backdoor is better, you end up not needing as many hours at store level to pick
quarters which further believes the P&L. And then if you keep working down the way
I think about it is, the other income associated with fulﬁllment services and
advertising and membership start to kick in and that's when you have a more
attractive income statement then even our original income statement that we had as
a company, which was buying and selling merchandise, having associates and
managing their margin, all of that core P&L is still in place, but we've kind of --
sometimes I visualize it as three P&Ls, there's the original retail P&L, there're the new
things we're building, there're GMV marketplace advertising membership, all the
things I mentioned. And in the beginning that P&L loses money because you're
building it out, and then eventually, it's better than the ﬁrst P&L, and you put them
together, you get a third one and that's our new business model and that's what
we're trying to build.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
We're gonna go next to alternative proﬁt, but. I want to I think it's worth repeating
what you just said is that you had an EBIT margin of this business or an EBITDA that
reﬂected a brick-and-mortar business, you've mixing it with an e-commerce one
which naturally has had some dilution and both the improvement in that e-
commerce side or omnichannel coupled with the alternative proﬁt pools, you're
saying gets you to a better place than when we started this whole journey eventually.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
That's well said. I think in the midst of all that we had Sam's Club business that was
growing and performing well and then the international portfolio got changed.
Some of the -- sometimes I get questions from this community asking don't you
need to do less though you need to focus and I'm like, yeah, we exited Brazil, UK,
Japan, Argentina that's happening and so if you look at our business, our portfolio,
we're actually in a diﬀerent set of businesses than we were a few years ago and we
kind of subtract it and then we add it back a tremendous growth opportunity in India
with ﬁnancial services and e-commerce marketplace business, which as we said
when we bought it would put pressure on earnings for a while. And it has, but everyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

Doug McMillontime we raised money for those businesses the valuation has gone up and it looks
like a really good business, not only from an investment point-of-view, but just from
an operational point of view.
We see synergies in ﬁnancial services, to some degree in healthcare, as well as in all
this omnichannel core retail discussion that are causing us to work more like a global
company and someway it's more like a tech company, building tech products that
can be leveraged across markets more so than we've done in the past, and I think
that will be more true in the future.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Moving to alternative proﬁt, you mentioned a few, we've had to write notes because
there are so many of them, maybe I'll let you choose, but I was going to throw it out
advertising, healthcare, fulﬁllment services, spark, but maybe to talk I was going to
ask you to prioritize, but you've kind of have done that, but can we talk about it and
maybe the trajectories within each of those businesses and how they're progressing?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I think the marketplace ﬁrst, and that's because it will matter a lot to customers
and members to have that breadth of assortment and there is a -- there are fees
associated with that for marketplace sellers did matter and it's very connected to
fulﬁllment services obviously and in advertising. Our advertising growth globally is
not just with the product suppliers we have that are ﬁrst-party in nature, but also
marketplace sellers. So when you can sell and add to other group, that's a bigger
business, so that's important. So I think that's the sequence that would go into the
marketplace, advertising, fulﬁllment services, other forms of data monetization. I
wouldn't have healthcare and ﬁnancial services in that same continuum, I think those
are part of our ﬂywheel and they connect up together, but I think of them in a
diﬀerent way.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And when you run the business now, you have these other proﬁt contributors that
you didn't have before, do they fall into the P&L, meaning there -- it's house money
now and we can reinvest in other parts or they ﬂow in their own lines and you run the
business as distinct?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
A degree of both. So, we obviously have budgets and plans for each component,
but we're thoughtful about where we set those objectives and that came up in
several of the small group meetings this morning and if -- what's your prioritization is
your prioritization to maximize, add income or is your prioritization to serve
customers well from a retail point-of-view and those are actually two diﬀerent things
and our prioritization is to be where American shops. We will prioritize retail and add
income will grow, but we don't want it to somehow damage or pollute the
experience of shopping with us on our app or in-store.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-12-07

Doug McMillon{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Great. Eight minutes, we're going to quickly pivot to Sam's, a little international, and
mix in some Flipkart. On Sam's, there's is an investment conference, so I'll cut to the
chase, which is -- it's a very valuable asset that may not be getting the proper value
externally.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Can you ﬁx that?
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
I need -- we need some of your help, but does that -- is that something that it could
be -- is there any monetization of this asset over time or it isn't?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
If we didn't own it we would want to buy it and it's an awesome business and we
love it, and it's multinational like it's a great business in Mexico. Sam's Club is a
terriﬁc business in China. It's our strongest brand in China, stronger than -- stronger
than Walmart, and the Sam's Clubs that we've opened there have all done really well
and we'd like to have a bunch more. So you could look at Sam's as kind of a global
brand, not just a U.S. brand. It's a great place for people to learn. We've -- in some
cases recruited talent out of there. I used to work at Sam's, John Furner used to work
at Sam's, we trying not to turn over Sam's merchants too fast, but it's a great place
for people to grow and develop and it's just a really awesome business.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Fair enough. We'll go to international, a lot of the portfolio has been called or
pruned under your leadership, are there key markets in place, and then I want to talk
about a couple of the key markets.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. The key markets would include Mexico, Canada, India, China. Walmex [ph] is a
fantastic business, multi-country, high-growth rates, proﬁtable, they are further down
the line in some instances with customer centricity and members centricity, just really
a big fan of our Walmex [ph] business. Canada has always been a terriﬁc business
and I think we've got a good opportunity there. We're still down the list of the top
retailers in Canada. And then India is amazing. I was there in July, I think it was in the
momentum that we've got in both PhonePe and Flipkart is tremendous, strong
teams. I think a bright future there and their synergy ﬂowing back into some other
markets in terms of what they can bring to the company. It's not like we run these in
silos entirely. And then China, as I mentioned, the Sam's Club business is terriﬁc.

proud of them.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And what's your patients or tolerance on these highly populated markets, India for
one, you have some high-growth, great business in PhonePe and then Flipkart seems
to be continuing to perform well and there is tremendous opportunity. I guess what's
the trade-oﬀ between waiting to do something external like monetization versus
sticking in that business for several more years absorbing for losses or whatever the
P&L looks like that we don't know oﬃcially, how do you think about it?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Timing matters. The teams that are leading those businesses are really capable.
They've been with the business for a long time and they want a path towards long
term large cap sustainable business, so they think about things like proﬁtability, and
what we've said is, we want to get the timing right, and that's one of the reasons why
people like me go to the market to listen and to hear them as they think about
timing for diﬀerent structures. And as we've said, we're thinking about diﬀerent
structures and at the right time we'll make that happen.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And geopolitics, really both India and China, how does that having changed, how
much time you spend thinking about these things, does it take a lot of time thinking
through the next several years, are you so long-term focused on these markets, you
kind of put it aside?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We deﬁnitely think about it, and yes, we are long-term oriented, but in both
instances, job one is to -- in any country that you're operating and including this one,
demonstrate to all the stakeholders including government that you're a good actor
that you're doing good work. So when I'm meeting with leaders in government and
foreign market, we talk about what we're doing to serve customers and members
and help them save money and live better, we're talking about the work we're doing
on sustainability, we talk about our compliance programs. We talk about how we
treat suppliers and people want us to be there because of those things and
therefore they support us appropriately to have a level-playing ﬁeld and that's all we
asked for.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}

{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yeah, does the business continue to make progress, I know Sam's is extremely
successful there, Walmart concept, maybe not, is successful, but not as successful at
Sam's, can you talk about that market?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I can, 420 ish units I think, 100,000 associates that work there. The Sam's Clubs have
an incredible track record, like just everyone we open, it's been high volume and
highly sought-after, our biggest challenge opening more is just sighting them from a
real estate point of view, which can be a challenge because they get unique needs in
terms of how you build them out. The supercenters have been performing better
and they become hybrid. So we do a lot of business -- I don't know if we've shared it,
so I won't say the number, but we have a very high percent to total in China, both in
Walmart and Sam's in terms of the digital portion of the business. There's a lot of
delivery happening out of those units and we're proﬁtable and optimistic about what
that could mean over a longer time horizon.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Final question, I think this quote to you a few times, we can do both, that was your
quote referring to both investing for the future and delivering operating leverage at
the same time, little bit of a slip, I don't -- there's some fair excuse for what happened
in this current year, can you talk about that algorithm, that philosophy, I think we
might be overdue with -- as an investment community to hear some updated
thoughts, so here's your forum.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, I think we kind of owe some more transparency next year, in particular as it
relates to how we think about the longer term, but I'm still very excited about that
algorithm. I think four and more than four is achievable in our plan and the way that
we are changing the mix of the business helps give me more conﬁdence on the
bottom line, so nothing's really changed there. This year, it's disappointing that we
ended up with inventory in the wrong categories. I think our team did a nice job
identifying and moving quickly to ﬁx it and now we're on trying to get back to long
range plan that we've had our eyes on the last few years.
