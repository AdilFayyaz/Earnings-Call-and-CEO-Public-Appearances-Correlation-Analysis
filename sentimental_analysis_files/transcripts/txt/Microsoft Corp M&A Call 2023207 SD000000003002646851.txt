Thank you, Brett, and good afternoon, everyone.
As you heard in our earnings commentary two weeks ago, and as you saw from Satya
and Yusuf in the presentation earlier today, Microsoft is at the forefront of the AI
platform shift.
We have built the world's most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the
cloud, having invested for years for this wave. We've already released products like
GitHub Copilot, putting that investment and its beneﬁts in the hands of our
customers.
Going forward, as customers select their cloud providers and invest in new
workloads, we are well positioned as an AI leader and as the world's largest
commercial cloud provider.
Today we introduced our new AI-powered copilot for the web on Bing and Edge. We
are reimagining the search and browser experience with AI. As Satya mentioned,
during today's announcement, we're going to have fun innovating at a fast pace in
search. And of course, I'm even more excited for people to get started using it.
Sam discussed it earlier today, but our partnership with OpenAI began when we
made our initial investment in 2019. Just a few weeks ago, we announced our latest
investment and our expanded partnership that includes joint research and
development, as well as commercial agreements across the company.
As an example, through our joint R&D, we are combining a new next generation
OpenAI model that is more powerful than ChatGPT with Bing's real-time information
to create a proprietary collection of capabilities that will power the new Bing and the
new Edge. Through our new commercial agreement, we will beneﬁt from each
other's successes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-07

Page 3 of 11Philippe OckendenBefore I move on to the business opportunity, I want to address our ongoing
commitment to responsible AI. In addition to our comments this morning during the
webcast last week, Brad Smith published a blog on responsible AI that I urge each of
you to read. We are committed to the advancement of AI driven by ethical principles
that put people ﬁrst.
With that, let's turn to why we're investing in a new AI-powered search and browser
experience.
At Microsoft, we position ourselves in markets with large and growing total
addressable markets where we can proﬁtably take share with high-value
diﬀerentiated experiences, and digital advertising is one of those markets.
As people continue to spend more time online, advertising dollars follow. The
overall digital advertising market, which includes spend from search, social, display
and video, was over $0.5 trillion in 2022, growing in the high teens and highly
proﬁtable. Approximately 40% of that market was in search advertising, and we
expect this opportunity to continue to grow.
I'm going to turn it over to Phil to talk a bit more about our advertising business.
Thanks, Amy.
At Microsoft, our 2 largest digital advertising businesses are search and news
advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. Over the last 12 months, our total
advertising revenue was nearly $18 billion, and the businesses continue to be
proﬁtable.
Today, I'm going to share an update on our search business, the growth we've seen
to date and how we expect the new AI-powered search and browser experience will
expand growth opportunities going forward.
For a long time, we've invested in our search and news businesses, organically
improving quality, creating the new Edge browser and increasing the pace of
releases, adding user value in places like shopping and weather.
And more recently, we have completed acquisitions such as PromoteIQ and Xandr to
ensure we could better meet the needs of advertisers. Those investments mean we
have a breadth of advertising solutions across our ﬁrst and third-party portfolios, and
we have a world-class browser with Edge, which is taking share for 7 consecutive
quarters.
Our search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC has grown double digits over the
past 8 quarters faster than the market, and we have done that proﬁtably and with
growing margins. With that strong foundation, we are well positioned to transformFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-07

Page 4 of 11the search and browser experience with AI technology, and Windows is the best
place to use it.
We have more than 1.4 billion monthly active Windows devices and are seeing
increased engagement that is up 10% versus pre-pandemic. We innovate the users in
the activities they do the most, which includes working in the Microsoft 365
productivity suite, communicating and collaborating in Teams and gaming in the
Xbox ecosystem.
Most of the time spent on the PC, however, is browsing, searching, shopping and
consuming the news. The new Bing and the new Edge will help customers do this
better and more eﬃciently in 4 ways.
First, better search. Users will get a better search experience, including improved
ranking and more relevant results.
Second, complete answers instead of just a list of relevant links, Bing reviews results
from across the web to ﬁnd and summarize the answer you're actually looking for.
For example, you can ask for a comparison of top-rated car seats or what to use as a
substitute for eggs in any recipe.
Next, chat. The integrated chat experience lets you naturally interact and reﬁne
complicated research queries to better tailor your answers for areas like travel,
planning and shopping. For example, it would not only give you links for how to plan
a trip, but rather plan one for you. Instead of giving you results for hotels in Paris, it
will recommend the best hotels ﬁtted for your preferences.
And ﬁnally, spark creativity. You are no longer limited by searching for what already
exists. Bing will help you create new content with just a description such as writing a
poem, drafting in e-mail or translating either of those into a diﬀerent language.
These new AI-powered search capabilities will also be in the sidebar within Edge,
creating a better browsing experience.
Simply put, the new Bing and the new Edge will drive revenue growth through
increased volume and increased rates. Because our search and browser will deliver a
better customer experience, will increase our volumes by attracting new users and
driving higher engagement across our existing user base. A higher volume of users
will attract more advertisers to our platforms.
Additionally, the new Bing will have the context into what the user is trying to
accomplish. Ads will become more personalized, and while the user may see fewer
ads, they will be of higher value to advertisers.
While this new experience will be delivered at a higher cost-to-serve, gross margin
dollars will grow as usage grows. Importantly, we'll bring more experiences to moreFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Amy Hood
Brett Iversenentry points over time, including mobile, where getting an answer is more helpful
and eﬃcient, given the smaller screen. Therefore, the volume and rate growth
opportunities will materialize gradually as the full experiences, rollout and
advertisers see the beneﬁts of this innovation.
New users, higher engagement and increased advertising rates will fuel revenue
growth. As Amy mentioned earlier, the digital advertising TAM is over $0.5 trillion.
And within that, approximately 40% is in search advertising. For every 1 point of
share gain in the search advertising market, it's a $2 billion revenue opportunity for
our advertising business.
Today, our share of the search advertising market is mostly on Windows PCs, which is
where we expect to see the initial beneﬁts from the volume and rate growth. We
particularly have an opportunity to grow in international markets, given the large
language models enable better transformation and a better understanding of local
market content.
And now, I'll hand it back to Amy for some closing thoughts.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Phil.
I'm excited for the position we are in after years of investment into the AI platform.
We've been delivering AI innovations through our OpenAI partnership to customers
since 2021, and the pace of releases is clearly accelerating with Teams Premium, Viva
Sales and your copilot for the web on Bing and Edge in the last 7 days. And we are
pleased to be OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider.
As a company, we will continue to invest in additional capacity to support the near-
term and long-term demand we see for all AI workloads.
And as we said at earnings, AI is the next big platform shift. For us, this will impact
every part of our tech stack, creating new solutions and new opportunities. We
believe value is created when companies lead and platform shifts, and we're going
to lead in this AI era.
With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Thanks, Amy.
We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request the
participants please only ask one question.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-07

Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with
Morgan Stanley.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. Thank you guys for hosting the conference call and really fascinating
announcements and great demos. I was just watching the video.
I think what a lot of investors are wondering about right now from you, Amy, is the
cost side of the equation. We've seen OpenAI and Sam Altman talked about a
couple of cents per query, and you guys are talking about there's 10 billion queries
done every day. And that could add up pretty quickly.
How should we think about the underlying expense that that Microsoft is going to be
taking on? Does this materially change gross proﬁt forecast in the near term, or
CapEx forecast in the near term? Or is this already incorporated into what you guys
were thinking about for the year?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Keith. And that's a great question because I think there's lot of a nuance to it,
and it gives me a time to talk about ﬁrst a couple of things.
While we'll focus on the cost side in the second, it always starts with the size of the
opportunity. This is probably, and I think Satya said it today in the intro comments on
the webcast. This is the largest software category that exists. And it's incredibly
proﬁtable, incredibly large and still growing. And we're a very small share player
today. Even though we gained share over the past 7 quarters, grown in excess of the
market for 2 years, there is a lot of upside in this category for us.
And so what's important is that the platform, which we are using to deliver the AI is
the same platform that we're using, whether it's the Azure APIs that are being utilized
across ﬁrst party and third party, whether it's some of the new experiences you've
seen us launch in the applications that will be Viva Sales or Teams Premium. This is --
the scale for us will be applied at every layer of the stack.
And so when you think about to the search experience speciﬁcally, you heard us say
the ﬁrst and most important thing is we're going to see usage growth. We're going
to continue to roll this out. We said to millions over the coming weeks. As we see
usage grow, you'll see revenue growth. And for each of those new users or increased
usage that's incremental gross margin dollars for us even at the cost-to-serve that
we're discussing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-07

OperatorAnd so I tend to put this in the category of its net new and net new proﬁtably at both
the GM line and the operating income line, which is encouraging. And it's a leverage
platform that starts at the supercomputer layer, which means we can use the
utilization and the cost that will, by the way, continue to come down over time. We've
seen platform shifts before. And so, cost per tends to come down with scale, of
course. And I think we're starting with a pretty robust platform to be able to do that.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Thanks, Keith.
Joe [ph], next question, please.
The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jeﬀeries.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Amy, can you talk about the ramp time of how quick you can inﬂuence advertisers to
come on? What does this duration look like to bring them into the fold?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Brent. What's great about this is we already have a substantial advertising
business. I've talked about it's an $18 billion business that's been growing in
excessive market rates for quite a while. And because of that, we've made
investments over the past 2 years to really build a robust advertising platform. And
it's why I still happen to mention the acquisitions we've done, PromoteIQ and Xandr.
This has really been a vision that we've invested in. As we've seen the AI platform
shift coming for a number of years, we've strengthened the platform that we have for
advertisers to be able to take advantage of it. And we've seen wins from third
parties, some of which are big names that you're all familiar of, who've chosen our
advertising platform to fuel their growth, too. So we're actually relatively mature in
that process.
So what we're looking for really here is to make sure advertisers can see with this
new experience, the higher quality of the ads and the rates that they'll be able to
see. This is actually good for customers in terms of the experience you're getting to
use and you saw on the webcast, but also good for advertisers. But I don't think it
requires ramp time for our advertisers. It's more about rolling it out to users and
seeing them get engaged.

Q - Kasthuri RanganThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.
{BIO 1542399 <GO>}
So Phil, the experience of using ChatGPT is truly remarkable. And now we're seeing
how you're bringing that power to Bing and Edge products.
If you think forward and we're preparing to see some of the competitive responses
to ChatGPT in the coming days and weeks, could you speak to the competitive
diﬀerentiation that you're going to have? In other words, is OpenAI's underlying
model more powerful? And just how do you think about sustaining the competitive
diﬀerentiation in this area as you collaborate with OpenAI, but also leverage that
infrastructure that you've been building for several years?
Yes. Amy talked about earlier how we're taking the new Edge models from OpenAI,
we're combining it with the real-time information from Bing. And we think that's
going to create a product that's really special. It's going to be running on our AI
infrastructure. So we've built across all of our products, and we think that gives us a
lot of leverage as well.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And maybe one perspective I would add, Mark, is that when you're a newer, a
smaller share player in a category, it does allow us to continue to innovate at a great
pace, continuing to experiment, learn with our users, innovate with the model, learn
with OpenAI and continue to ship new features.
And I think the pace you've seen from us in the past few weeks in terms of
announcements at every layer of the tech stack, this has been work, we've been
obviously at for quite a long time. But what I think you're going to see going forward
is innovation that comes quickly. And I think that's always a good position to be in.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Thanks, Mark.
Joe [ph], next question please.
The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Very much impressed with all the sudden burst of innovation that's coming out of
Microsoft in this arena for a long time. So really happy to see that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-07

OperatorAmy and team, curious, as you look at generative AI, I think there are at least half a
dozen projects that are really, really well funded. And sooner or later, some of the
big tech companies are going to have their own semi-proprietary frameworks that
we'll be able to use natural language search capabilities to generate the kind of
interesting content that ChatGPT has been able to generate.
Do you see this as a platform shift? Or is it a thing that is available equally to
anybody that can use these frameworks and so it's not really -- it's going to spur
more innovation, but nobody really incrementally beneﬁts? If that's wrong, why
should Microsoft disproportionately beneﬁt from this initiative in a way that others
cannot beneﬁt?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Kash. That's a great question. I'll start,. Phil, you should add anything.
One of the most important things -- and I think Kash, you've seen this a bit. This starts
-- and I think even Sam mentioned it today on the call -- they're doing a lot of
innovation work. But there's also a lot of proprietary work that's been done here.
To build the platform, we referenced it as the AI supercomputer. But that work has
taken years and has taken a lot of investment to build the type of scale, the type of
speed, the type of cost that we can bring at every layer of the stack. I think that
actually is quite diﬀerentiated at the scale at which we operate.
We're the largest commercial cloud. We'll bring it in our application layers. We'll
bring it, as we talked about, I think Satya mentioned, whether that's Microsoft 365,
whether it's our Oﬃce features, whether it's information inside the ﬁrewall,
information that sits in the index plus the OpenAI technology. I think there is, in fact,
a diﬀerentiation. We built a business that's about participation at every layer of the
deck so that customers, developers, end users can experience it at each of those
interactions.
And so, while there are lots of models being built and there will be lots of
competition in the space, there aren't that many people who've invested at the scale
we have and at every layer. And I look forward to being able to continue to show that
innovation at all layers of the stack. And I do think users will see a diﬀerence.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Thanks, Kash.
Joe [ph], we have time for one last question.
The next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-07

Congratulations on all the innovation and success. Clearly Microsoft has several
signiﬁcant advantages in these large and proﬁtable markets we're talking about
today. But when we look back Amy, in 5 or 10 years, how much of your AI capabilities
will be monetized in diﬀerent applications like search, which is clearly itself a huge
opportunity versus horizontally through the Azure platform? And how are you
thinking about allocating capital against opportunities, both platforms and
applications?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
That's a great question, Brad.
Many of you have, I think, been covering the stock long enough and the company
long enough to remember when we've gone through some of these transitions
before, particularly from server to cloud. And when we made that transition at ﬁrst,
we had lots of diﬀerent infrastructure sitting under a lot of our large-scale products.
And really, the leverage we found, the gross margin improvement, the operating
proﬁt improvement, the cash ﬂow improvement came as we brought those vacuums
together to build one set of infrastructure.
The AI platform is diﬀerent, and very diﬀerent from the transition that we saw and
went through, gosh, over a decade ago. We're starting from a common
infrastructure. And so in many ways, I think right now, we're focused on where we
can add high-value usage. It's about product making and product design.
Satya mentioned it a bit in passing, I thought today in the intro to the session. It's
about the value of making the experience work and making AI light up in ways that
users see greater productivity improvement from, see better answers from in the
search or Bing experiences and the browser experience.
And so, I'm less focused at this point and where particularly business model, why the
growth is going to come from because I'm actually quite conﬁdent it's going to
come from an ad model. It's going to come in subscriptions. It's going to come in
the consumption businesses, just looking across our stack.
But it's the fact that we don't really have to plan for precisely where it has to come
from on the demand side because from a capital perspective, we're investing in a
common platform. So predicting that model and monetization isn't nearly as
important as frankly, it was a decade ago and we didn't have a common backend.
And so, it's a great question, and I think this is one where we'll continue to talk about
new releases. We'll talk about adoption, which is the most important thing,
particularly here. And we'll continue to talk about where we're innovating to make
sure we can have high utilization of the infrastructure we're putting in place. And I
think this is something we've been at a while now and certainly over the past few
years, making investments into this platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-02-07
