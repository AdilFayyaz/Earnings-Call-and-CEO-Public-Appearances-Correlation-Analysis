(Starts abruptly) 18% e-commerce penetration last year. That compares to 12% at
Walmart US and around less than 10% at Sam's Club and they did about $4 billion of
segment EBIT, so that's about 15% of Walmart -- Walmart total. So no shortage of
things to talk about. Whenever we have Judith with us I think. However, I think we're
going to kick it we're going to focus on international today but given events of the
morning. I would probably get run out of the room, if I didn't address the elephant in
the room here, so we're going to talk a little bit about US inventory out of the gate
given the news this morning from Target, we spent some time with you guys just last
week, down in Bentonville, you seem comfortable with kind of the progress you're
making on clearing excess inventory. Just maybe take a minute and help our
understand what the view is right now given Target's kind of comments here to the
calculus change from Walmart.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah, so good morning everybody. Thank you for coming to spend some time with
us. Looking forward to having the conversation today about international, but I'm
happy Peter has gotten stuﬀ out of the room. And just to mention where we are from
an inventory perspective. Some of you may have heard our Q&A on Friday with
analysts and we reiterated what we said at the earnings and Q&A which is Walmart
US was 32% on inventory at the end of the quarter.
John made it really clear that of that increase, about a third of that is actually
inﬂation. There is another part of that which is some stocking up that we wanted to
do, but if you look at that total increase about 20% of that increase, I think the way he
described it is if you could snap his ﬁngers, he would wish that we didn't have it and
we're going to work through in a thoughtful way. That is pretty broad and across
multiple categories.
Some in apparel, some in electronics but it's multiple categories that it covers
including some seasonal, which of course, the weather will help, but that's not theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-07

A - Judith McKennaonly thing and John gave the guidance Friday is that it will take us a couple of
quarters to work through that and to do that in the right way. Nothing has changed
for us since the update we gave you on Friday and that guidance.
Comment on where other people are, but that's where we are. And just incidentally,
from an international perspective, we're about 20% in inventory in total and again
we've got the same inﬂationary impacts and we've got a little bit that we're working
through but we took some of our biggest hits in China in Q1 and then the other thing
that we have is we have markets that last year like for Chile for example literally had
nothing to sell in GN because of the stimulus that was there. So we're seeing some
artiﬁcial lift. It is a year-on-year comparison. So I hope that gives everybody the
clariﬁcation of what we said.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah. No. Perfect, thanks. I appreciate that. So we will now pivot to the international
discussion. If we have you a few comments, I want to just maybe set the stage and
then I've got a series of questions I would like you to answer.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Sure. You doing a nice job of setting out the scale $100 billion business, and 23
countries around the world, four really large markets now but six primary markets,
the additional markets are all made up across Africa and Central America. They, one
of them reports into all Walmart Mexican business and then Massmart South African
business has a sub-Saharan African countries
And those of you that know us will know over the last four years, we've undergone a
pretty logical portfolio rationalization very deliberate and very thoughtful including
our largest market, which is where I grew up which is Asda in the UK. We did that to
be able to better resource the markets where we believe the most opportunity is and
to set those markets we divested from up for long-term success and we still have
relationship one way or the other with all of those markets, which is actually really
healthy, and we also invested in that period. Clearly, the main investment that you
will know about is in India in the Flipkart business in the PhonePe business, we've
also made a number of smaller investments along the way as well. For example, a
food delivery company in Massmart in South Africa. People often ask me Peter what's
the role of international in Walmart and it's really simple it's long-term and
sustainable growth. To be sustainable you have to be generating returns in the long
term as well. as that is what we're here to do.
So growth is really important. The second thing is that we also help diversify risks in
terms of around the world in the markets that we're in and then the third role that we
have is a wind along the world. So I wouldn't ever underestimate how much we learn
from operating the markets we do which is an advantage to the whole group, China
is a great example of that. And then ﬁnally, our role is talent. So we both develop
talent in the markets then travel around the world as an example of that, but also
give people opportunities to run businesses end to end that they may not get if they
were just into the US business. So that's a really important role that we play as well.
So all of those things are true. I can talk through when we can talk about some of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-07

Page 3 of 10Q - Peter Benedict
A - Judith McKennamarkets. Each market has a strategy because our overall strategy is strong local
businesses powered by Walmart. Another way to think about that is multi-local with
the advantages of global scale, and that's really been the secret to our success I
think particularly through this COVID era as well because the markets are
empowered.
But there are certain key themes. In the powered by Walmart that run through
everybody. And so individual markets depending on size, demographic, market
development, scale, formats that we run but these themes that run across Peter are
things like omnichannel e-comm capabilities that we're building out, its new revenue
streams such as ad Tech and some of our ﬁntech services and those areas, it's new
customer segments that we're going to like health we've got travel in India. And then
ﬁnally the common theme that runs through everybody is how we globally leverage
our best practice enough scale to the best eﬀect as well. So we've got individual
strategies is really important but then we have these global themes that we try to
apply as well and that's really where we seeing for the last couple of quarters, we've
had some really strong growth and I was really pleased to say International called
out in the earnings script as having under the strong quarter. We were at 10% growth
through that and that was really encouraging and I think the portfolio rationalization
has really helped us focus and deliver some of those results.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
No, that's great. I mean, it's clear that you are the ﬁfth largest retailer in the world, A
lot there. On the portfolio rationalization or optimization, help us understand maybe
what you see going forward. Is there more optimization that has to occur. How do
you think about ownership structure? What's the right ownership structure for the
diﬀerent markets?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
I'm happy with the markets that we're in. Each market plays a diﬀerent role and just
so everybody knows it's Canada, Chile, China, India, Africa, Mexico, which is
Walmart's business including Central America. That's the six markets that we operate
against. I think that is a good portfolio with everybody playing a diﬀerent role within
that. The powerhouses in there are the larger markets. It's like Walmex, I'm sure we'll
talk about Walmex. It is a great business and that is 40% of our total revenue comes
out of Walmart approximately and will you seem more happy with what we have, I
think they play a role. Will you continue to see us do is what we've got out there
announced at the moment is where it makes sense within the market to do a little bit
of rationalization, we'll keep doing that. So there is, we've made an announcement
recently that Walmex is going to dispose of its Cambridge food business and also do
some tie up with some upstores in East and West Africa. So end market
rationalization.
You will have seen in Central America that we are thinking about what is the right
structure for the long term for El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. So I think that is
the right way to think about is continue to be vigilant about what there is and we will
continue to make investments where we need to within the market. What is the right
structure and we've got public companies and we're majority holders along withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-07

Page 4 of 10Q - Peter Benedict
A - Judith McKennaminorities in private companies like Flipkart where we've got 100% subsidiary and
then we got a lot of partnership that sits alongside those.
The thing to remember about international. And I think, why we are being successful
is one size doesn't ﬁt all for us and you've got to be comfortable in a world where
you can have a ﬂexible approach to what the ownership looks like to get the very
best for the market. Again, I'll come back to Walmex, public company, a highly
regarded in Mexico on the Mexican Stock Exchange. We are the majority
shareholder on that one, and I think we get the best of both worlds for us. We have
both a public ownership and they were public when we bought into them and they
have the advantages of the scale that we can bring to them to help them be
successful. So one size doesn't ﬁt all, thoughtful about it. If you'd asked me ﬁve or six
years ago. As I said, this ﬂexibility wasn't a forced upon us and I think that's
something that we've developed, particularly over about the last four years in terms
of being much more comfortable about when we need to be in control and when we
don't see and that this multi-local approach is part of that.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Absolutely. And you're in a unique position to be able to see kind of consumer
behavior across diﬀerent markets, right maybe any call-outs, you'd like to share with
folks in terms of what you're seeing consumer behavior wise across the international
spectrum.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah. Again, each market is in a slightly diﬀerent position we see inﬂation, of course,
in every market Chile being probably the highest statistically, and China is our
lowest, but, yeah, I'm not sure whether that is yet or not to be able to understand the
China inﬂation position. I think and how we are thinking about the consumer. As you
heard, again, we talked about for the US, it's the same around the world, we're
clearly concerned about inﬂation in some inﬂationary pressures for them and for Q1,
we saw consumer conﬁdence pretty held up pretty reasonably remittance ﬂowing
into -- remittance is ﬂowing into Mexico, we held up pretty strongly there was no
really concerning side, but we can see some of the trends that are coming and we
can see the cost pressures in that.
What the real question is what we do about it and how well prepared are we for
whatever lies ahead. It's not like when the pandemic hit, we were suddenly overnight
and we had to react to it, but getting some forward visibility on that. We have a
unique advantage in that we have CEOs and C-suite leaders around the world that
have worked in some of the most inﬂationary environments in the world.
So, our Head of Walmart is Brazilian, our head of Canada is Argentinian and I have
multiple people who have worked in other particularly Latin American markets. They
have seen inﬂation and they have seen deﬂation, and what they've been doing Peter
is, they have been running seminars for the rest of Walmart on how to think about
this, what should you look at, how should you think about rollbacks, how should you
think about supply relationships, how should you think about long-term contracts
that you've got, how should you think about going into controlling what you canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-07

A - Judith McKennacontrol and going into every detail. The last call that we had there was a 168 people
on that call and what was interesting about it was it wasn't just merchants and it
wasn't just supply chain that was broad-based across every function in the
organization because that's what it's going to take as we go into this era. We're also
lucky to have a really good format mix and particularly, again for Walmex, remember,
that's our biggest market by quite a long way because they actually operate all
spectrums across the demographic there. So they've got hypermarkets, as you know
Walmart's you see them here. They've got Sam's clubs, which is a slightly higher
demographic and then they also have Bodega, Bodega I think is probably one of our
most powerful formats in the world for Walmart, which is a discount and
hypermarket from 40,000 square feet we are down to 4,000 square feet so a
signiﬁcant dagger in that. So that range that is already for the value-seeking
customer and that gives us some real opportunity that plays into diﬀerent formats
and be able to respond to that.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean Walmart, Mexico strikes as kind of that most fully developed maybe
ecosystem that ﬁrewall that's really working kind of get a focus for the rest, and it's
great to hear that Walmart is being able to leverage that inﬂation playbook across
the organization because obviously something that US companies are dealing with
that they haven't had to for some time. Let's dig in a little bit to some of your other
markets, India it's obviously was a big investment for you guys a few years ago, just
tell us kind of how things are going in India, what your thought process are, I feel to
deal with the government there. There is a lot of changes going on there, but just
kind of key trends positioning how you kind of think about going to pushing in India.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah, it's interesting, I think I was minus four weeks on the job, when Doug said to
me if you heard of a business called Flipkart and dispatched me oﬀ to India and the
rest is a little bit of history. Clearly invested in a $20 billion valuation they raised a 38
last year. So clear proof of the value that's being created over that period of time
and the investment case for why India and why Flipkart hasn't changed. I mean India
has 1.3 billion people. It has an average age of 20 -- median age of 29 years old, very
young population, digitally savvy, and increasingly and coming into an e-commerce
and digital world. So the investment case is that.
What we liked about Flipkart was it was a homegrown Indian business completely
focused on the Indian customer and then the PhonePe business, we believe there
was a runway for a payments business in the market as well as UPI had just opened
up the United Payments Interface, which is the government kind of guardrails for
how payments ARE made through India that's not changed, and we've been really
clear and that we've been happy at every step of the way over the four years that
we've made the investment.
So they've achieved our expectations and they've delivered what they need to
deliver. The way the business is, think about how that building out both of them is
slightly diﬀerent, maybe if I just start with Flipkart you know that. How do you
strengthen core commerce, how do you create new revenue pools, and then how doFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Q - Peter Benedict
A - Judith McKennayou build out the ecosystem and the core commerce and they have real strength in
apparel, they have a business there called Myntra which is a standalone platform
again slightly higher-end premium oﬀering very strong, and then the core apparel
business as well. They're expanding in areas like home, so that's core growth. It is
really encouraging as they are building that out. The new proﬁt pool is really
interesting. They are our biggest market by a long way for advertising revenues but
there are also thinking about ways that can oﬀer software as a service, and in fact,
what are the markets that we are using them for is Chile market so that building our
ad tech platform for Chile, which is a really interesting development for them and
that's building out the ecosystem.
They are really thoughtful about what adjacent verticals they can go into. So they've
just bought a business called Cleartrip, which is travel, a good time to get back into
travel primarily a domestic business, and then they've also invested in a digital
pharmacy platform called SastaSundar and they launched Flipkart Health+ and that's
a couple of months ago, well actually from the acquisition to the launch it was just
four months which is incredible and a testament to the speed and agility with which
they work. So great business, great opportunities still ahead of the been constantly
hitting our expectations, and I can see in the way that they are being thoughtful
about how they build that strategy out now. These are really clear steps to future
value creation.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
And just following up on that, is the path to proﬁtability, is it these alternative proﬁt
pools that are really going to drive that it the core Com business actually get the
proﬁtability and how important are those in this next step to monetization,
speculation around IPO that those.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
It wouldn't have been a good question if you didn't ask me about the IPO and look
the path forward is seeing improving proﬁtability in the call, but clearly, like many e-
commerce businesses around the world those, so the revenue streams that come in
really help with that as well in the ad tech, one is the bedroom and you can't really
separate them because you cannot top one without that. So I don't see this is there is
a revenue stream, here is the call. They are actually fully integrated, and I think that's
the way the business thinks about it.
By the way, the advertising stream is particularly important in Flipkart because of its
sellers and one of the things that are running is seller academies to help sellers get
better at doing advertising on the platforms in the self-service an easy way. So this
mutually enforced ecosystem that they are building out to be able to do that.
On IPO, it was actually in the original press release when we did the acquisition
which we are supportive of the business doing an IPO when the time is right for it
and the time is right will depend on a number of factors, not least the markets, but
also the business performance. They hit our deadlines walking through that, we
wouldn't have invested if we didn't believe they could become proﬁtable in the
longer term and we continue on track for that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-07

Q - Peter Benedict{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Perfect. That's great. Let's pivot over to China because I really want to get a chance
to touch on this. Obviously, how are the lockdowns impacting your operations, how
has Walmart China kind of evolved to these conditions and just as part of this talk
about how your approach to China is diﬀerent than your approach to India because
you're coming out from a diﬀerent way?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Diﬀerent demographic proﬁle and 100% owner of the business, but we've been that
25 years. We have two formats there. We have the Sam's Club format, which we have
about 36 clubs and then we have the hypermarkets format as well with 350 clubs at
stores in that. So very diﬀerent business proﬁle. Still huge opportunity in the market
there and I think that's really important to remember
The current situation there, I can't stress to you enough how challenging that is,
you've all read about some of the lockdowns that are happening Shanghai and
clearly, and I was just sharing last week, Peter, that to give you an idea of the scale of
this we have ﬁve stores and three clubs in Shanghai, they would normally operate
with about 2,400, 2,500 associates to run those units and if the worst we've been
operating them with 170 people not per unit, I mean, in total, and the business is
entirely pivoted to delivering fresh food into homes, apartment buildings, fulﬁlling
government contracts in Shanghai. This is an amazing statistic which is they've sold
more fresh fruit and vegetables in Shanghai in the last few months than they have
done in multiple previous years, I mean that wasn't the focus and the entire business.
So I tell you that, to give you an idea of how that business is having to think and
having to scale.
Two big opportunities there. First, Sam's Club is still a huge opportunity for us, and
the second is Christina Zhu, who is our CEO there is really thinking about what is the
role of hypermarkets for the long term in China. They rolled to be able to play an
omnichannel world is becoming increasingly clear to us. We got some reinvention to
do like general merchandise oﬀers in some of those areas, but there is still a lot of
runway for them as well, particularly if you think about the integration with our
partners like JD and Dada, both of whom were investors, and both of whom are a
really good example of where we invest in a business if we think actually it provides
strength to the call and that. So it's still a lot to do the number one priority though is
to get through the next few months for that business and just a huge thank you and
credit to what the team is doing there.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
And you mentioned earlier about kind of best practice sharing around inﬂation
which is pretty straightforward and clear. Maybe touch on other ways that Walmart
International is kind of helping, Walmart US be a better business, whether it be
digital commerce, supply chain automation and the US under a big role here with
supply chain automation, so I mean, what are some of the learnings that the
international market can provide.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-07

Q - Peter Benedict
A - Judith McKenna{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
So maybe think about this in three buckets. We share talent, we share best practice,
innovation and processes, and we share technology. So you'll be familiar with the
glass platform that the US developed. We are deploying that in Canada, and Mexico
as we speak. On the automation, we are actually parallel testing with the US diﬀerent
technologies. So in order to speed up the enterprise total on how fast we learn and
automation, Canada is testing some things that the US can start testing and they will
take the best of both of them to see what the right answer is maybe have multiple
suppliers to some of our automation
You've then got and this best practice sharing which is multi-provides around the
world. Mexico is our leading market actually from an ecosystem build out and we've
been using them as an example of how to think about payments for example and
helping the business that the US has setup to the talent, I mentioned earlier, I
wouldn't underestimate the power of talent in moving around. I came from the UK,
which was very strong in grocery, online, pickup delivery and we use and imported
all of that learning into the US when we did that.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
I think we may have time for one more here. So let me hit here on some of the
ﬁnancial stuﬀ. Maybe talk about how Walmart International competes for capital
inside of Walmart in general and then maybe talk about from a P&L perspective the
trajectory of the top line. Do you think you can grow proﬁts faster than revenue in the
national business as you look out over the next few years?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah, so you know, I'm not going to be forward-looking in what we do, but that's no
surprise. You asked me this last time as well, and then how do we think about
allocation to the markets. This is an are under science and we're looking for this
balance between each market about where we're going to get the best returns and
where we can see the biggest opportunity to be successful.
So again coming back to our Walmart business a reminder. That's a $63 billion
market capital business in its own right. Is that we know we need to go as fast as we
can building out the ecosystem. So that is one of the areas where we'll invest heavily.
Across all the markets, we're investing in the supply chain and we know what we
need to do, but we will always take a balanced approach to it, and that's one of the
beauties of this risk diversiﬁcation that I talk about which is the markets push forward
at certain times and others over time. So we have some calls that we protect like our
remodel program, building on our e-commerce program and then thinking about
our supply chain and then we ﬂex around that depending on a lot of diﬀerent
circumstances, it's been a challenging few years for CapEx because like we haven't
been able to remodel as many as we want to. So we got a bit of catch-up to do that,
but the company overall. One of the beauties of having run international is very
thoughtful about you can't underinvest in it, and honestly, that's why we've made
some of the divestments that we make because we knew we would get ourselves
into a position where that would be a challenge. So what is it set us up for? It doesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-07

A - Judith McKennaset us up for this long-term sustainable growth, which is both on the top line and on
the bottom line.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Fair enough. Well, I didn't get my go forward view on the P&L. So maybe I'll sneak
one in on ESG. I know that's a topic that's just of interest a lot of people in the room,
so maybe we'll close out with a minute here on ESG and then wrap it up.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
So we, and by the way to do this, particularly in some of the markets we operate ESG
is critical, not just because it's the right thing to do, but our reputation in the market
is critical to us being able to do business in that market. We have to have support is
there and this is one of the vehicles. We can use to earn trust. Three elements to it,
and you've got the planet sustainability that we focus on, you've got opportunity
providing jobs and employment, not just in our business but broader into the
economy and then you've got community as well and how do we support local
communities local farmers in doing that.
The Project Gigaton commitments that we made are applicable in every market.
They are all broken down. Canada is doing some amazing things. It is a carbon-
neutral last mile delivery. It is locally sourced beef in Quebec from the Quebec area.
Mexico's also eliminating plastic box, you've got them doing some amazing work
from plastics and recycling and the recyclable economy as well. So every market is
playing a diﬀerent role in this but adding up to the total for Walmart Inc. What I really
like is back to this theme of sharing best practices. This is moving really fast between
markets and we're able to share that. So incredibly important priority. It's a thing
everybody loves to talk about when we're together as a business and I think you're
going to see some real innovation coming out of the international markets that we
can share as well. India is actually is another great one for this and if you think about
any e-commerce business, how do you reduce plastic packaging and how do you
reduce packaging generally they are one of the market leaders for us in doing that.
