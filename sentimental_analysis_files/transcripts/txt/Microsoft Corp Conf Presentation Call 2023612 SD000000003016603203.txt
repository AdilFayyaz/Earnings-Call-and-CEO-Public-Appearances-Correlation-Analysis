Welcome everyone. I'm Amy Hood, the Chief Financial Oﬃcer here at Microsoft, and
I'm here with Kevin Scott, our Executive Vice President of AI, and our Chief
Technology Oﬃcer. And I just wanted to welcome Kevin to talk directly with investors
because, given the signiﬁcance of the next-generation AI, and our leadership
position in this AI era, we wanted to spend some time talking more about this after
the myriad of questions that we've gotten both in meetings and from investors on
conference calls. And I think this can help frame the growth opportunity ahead, really
speaking with what I consider to be the person in charge of running the show here.
So, with that, let's jump right in. So, the ﬁrst question, and it gets asked this way to
me, Kevin, so I'll ask it the same way to you, which is listen, we've seen multiple hype
cycles in tech: Crypto, Metaverse. So how transformative will next-generation AI
really be?
Questions And Answers
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
There have been multiple hype cycles in AI. When I was in Grad school, we were in
what is called an AI winter, because there've been so many boom and bust cycles,
like there is a Wikipedia page describing what the busts look like. I will say, like I've
been doing machine learning and AI work since I stopped being a computer science
professor in 2003. And we've been on this really interesting exponential trajectory
over the 20 years. And I think we've kind of been in the ﬂat part of the curve for most
of the 20 years. And like we really started to see an inﬂection like starting ﬁrst in 2012
with this realization that we ﬁnally had all of the compute, and all of the data that we
needed to really extract performance out of deep neural networks. And what we've
seen, just in a remarkable way, and it's one of the reasons why we've done our
investment with OpenAI, and why we've built all of this supercomputing
infrastructure, and why we have been able to build this new category of applications
that we're calling Co-pilots, is the models over the past handful of years have
become to behave really like a platform.
So, they are things where you're not training them and conditioning them for a
single use, but they're big pieces of infrastructure that you build, and you can use
across like many, many, many, many things. And, if I look at how technology cyclesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-12

A - Kevin Scotthave gone just in my lifetime, so there's been personal computing, there's been the
Internet, and there's been the mobile revolution. And I think, this is sort of the next
thing on that progression of the evolution of technology, where it really changes the
way that we build software.
The way that I've been talking about it to folks is just to try to describe how profound
it actually is, is we've been writing computer programs and using computing
technology the same way for 180 years. Ada Lovelace wrote the ﬁrst program 180
years ago, and we've been doing things more or less the same way since then with
more powerful computing devices and more powerful software abstractions. But
basically, if a human being wants to get a computing device to do something for
them, you either have to be a skilled programmer, or you have to get a skilled
programmer to anticipate your needs so that you can run the program that they've
written. And now, we have AI tools that anyone can use to express a thing that you
want to accomplish. And in a very ﬂexible way, you can get the computer to do the
thing for you. And like we're not done on this progression yet just in terms of how
much more capable the technology is going to get.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
This is an interesting one, Kevin, too, because, I would say from my perspective in
talking to customers, it's showing up in every conversation and they aren't asking
about the hype. It's very diﬀerent. They're asking, hey, listen, how quickly based on
really what you just said is that it makes it so much more approachable for problem-
solving, real problems that people in every seat in an organization feel and see
opportunity in. And so, I think they're more asking when they can deploy it, far more
than, gosh, is this a real thing or not? So, it certainly resonates. And given this broad
sort of excitement, what should investors know about our AI strategy, and what
diﬀerentiates that really? I think the amount of news, sheer news that's come out in
the past, it feels like a very long time, but it's really only been three or four months.
Maybe you can help distill that diﬀerence of what our plan is and what makes that
diﬀerent.
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, I think we've had a strong point of view about where we thought that
this AI platform was trending for the past ﬁve solid years now. Like we started a
transformation inside of Microsoft about a year before we even did the partnership
with OpenAI. And part of that is we really believe that these models are becoming
platforms. We believe that we're going to have a small handful of them and that
we're going to use them as the foundation for all of the software that we are
creating. We have rethought how we build all of our low-level infrastructure from the
way that we design and deploy data centers to what compute and networking looks
like, all the way up to what the software development environment looks like. And
we talked about a little bit of that this year at Build, like this notion of a Co-pilot stack,
which is just as distinctive, I think, as the LAMP stack was at the beginning of the
internet revolution.
And so -- it is -- the thing that I will say about us is we just have this one through line
that we've been investing on the past ﬁve years. And the reason that you see all ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-12

Page 3 of 9A - Amy Hood

A - Amy Hood
A - Kevin Scottthis news is because we've been focused in the way that we built the platforms on
top of which the applications are getting built and delivered. There's just no way we
would've been able to produce as many of these Copilot applications. So, Microsoft
365 Copilot, Bing Chat, ChatGPT. I'm probably going to say a whole bunch of
Copilots even that haven't launched if I let myself get carried away, but there's just
no way that we would've been able to deliver all of that if there wasn't a real platform
underlying what it was we were doing. Because it would've been too expensive, too
painful, too time-consuming to do each one of those as an independent thing.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think what's interesting about how you talked about it, Kevin, is that because this
platform is really, it's who we are, it's how we approach every problem as a company,
people should think about our approach to AI being incredibly similar to that.
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And that, I thought, and I would encourage investors to go back and look at the
Build keynotes, because this key aspect is that there's every layer of the platform.
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Will be built with this in mind. And I think in particular, certain things really
resonated. Microsoft Fabric is an example, right? That really resonated and broke
through about what's really diﬀerent. I think for me it's also that it's hard sometimes
to capture what these large technological transformations happen. I think you and I
would say, this is sort of a generational moment in terms of watching the innovation
that's showing up across the world, across companies of all sizes. I think that's
probably what makes it most exciting and in particular for, I think, developers last
week. I mean, that's certainly a changing perspective. And I always tell people you
think, oh, about a platform. Well, then this audience always asks me, "Well, where
does revenue show up?" It really comes from two places, right? There's the tools and
services that customers will use, right, to build AI apps and services. They'll run the
Azure OpenAI APIs, they'll run on our Azure infrastructure. And then to your point,
it's going to be built into every Microsoft Cloud solution. Everyone. So, whether it's
announced or not announced, whether it's named Co-pilot or not, it'll be that same
aspect. There'll be something that shows up that's AI-enabled. And I think, that's the
reason this'll be our sort of the next generation AI business will be the fastest
growing $10 billion business in our history. I think I have that conﬁdence because of
the energy we're seeing.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 9A - Amy Hood
A - Kevin Scott
A - Amy Hood
A - Kevin ScottYeah, 100%, and the other thing too, I will say, is that because it really is a very
general platform, like we have lots of diﬀerent ways that $10 billion of ARR is going to
ﬁrst show up. So, there is like all of the people who want to come use our
infrastructure, whether they're training their own models, whether they are running
an open source model they've got, or whether they are making API calls into one of
the big frontier models that we've built with OpenAI. It's like all of these products,
like each of which has a slightly diﬀerent potential for business model. So, like the
way that we are going to be able to just sort of monetize all of this I think is really
interesting. And like I'm excited for the developers even on top of this, because
we're probably going to get some business models that haven't existed before in
history like, we're going to have business model innovation happening as well.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And that's really been a hallmark of almost any big technology shift is you both have
technical transformation, platform transformation, and business model innovation.
And I think, it is always exciting. Having lived through maybe the ﬁrst transition to the
cloud that you and I were around for, the second one, I think in some ways, people --
investors ask me, "Gosh, I'm so worried about all the money it takes to invest in
these. And I try to remind people, as a company, we're in a very diﬀerent spot. We're
leading this cycle. We understand how to run at-scale cloud businesses. And you
said something really important earlier, which is we've built a single platform from
the ground up eﬀectively, that's used consistently under every service. That's not
where frankly we were a decade ago, in terms of reusability and fungibility. So, I do
think, of course, we'll see scaled CapEx and there'll be COGS growth associated with
that, but we'll also be in a far better spot than we started from, and the ability to
leverage that and the conﬁdence we're feeling from customers on demand, I feel
quite optimistic about that.
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean the other thing too that I will say on CapEx is like, it's CapEx that we're
deploying not because we feel like we've got to go spend it to catch up, but like it's
CapEx we're deploying because we feel like there's such a gigantic opportunity
ahead of us, and that there's going to be such a big return on that investment
capital.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah. And I think that for you and I puts our head in a diﬀerent spot in terms of
talking to customers and what we see from developers too. Another question I get a
lot from both investors and customers is our view on I think really a topic that we
read a lot ethics, regulation, the overall safety when it comes to what AI is really
capable of and what can you share on these topics and the work we've already done
with our responsible AI principles? Because I know this is one of the key components
that you think about every day in the scene.
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
Yeah, it's one of those things where I think it actually is another strategic advantage
in how it is that we are building the platform. So, I think you have to think aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 9A - Amy Hood
A - Kevin Scottsafety and responsibility and security of these systems as one of the necessary bits of
the platform itself. You just can't have a platform without it for just a whole number of
reasons, like maybe starting with customer trust. You have to have trustworthy
platform, trustworthy infrastructure, trustworthy applications that you're building.
And we've been looking at this whole discipline of responsible AI for many years
now. So, I think before I even joined Microsoft, Satya -- Satyacharged a bunch of
people in Microsoft Research and then our legal team with building a real AI ethics
and responsible AI practice. And we have been investing over the years on
everything. So what do we need to put in the legal team? What do we need to do
research on? What infrastructure do we need to build to help our product teams
make sure that they can test and assess their systems for safety and responsibility?
One of the anecdotes I will share is we had all of this press around Bing Chat, the
infamous Kevin Roose article. And the interesting thing there is like just even by
deploying, we are learning so much about how not just to build things with safety
and responsibility, because like we believe that everything that we've launched has
adhered very strictly to our publicly available Responsible AI Standard that's in its
second version right now. But we are even sort of learning how to use those safety
systems to tune things to meet the preferences and expectations of users. And the
Kevin Roose thing was basically, I won't even call it ﬁxed, we adjusted the product
within a couple of hours of that story breaking. And the only reason that we were
able to make the changes quickly as we did is we had all of the safety infrastructure
that we had built that allowed us to make sure that the change that we were making
on that particular product to conform it to the preferences of users and to make sure
that people weren't using the product in ways that we hadn't intended. Was because
we had all of this stuﬀ that we had built to let us do that assessment to make sure
that the ﬁx didn't cause more problems than it was addressing.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And I think important in what you said is that, listen, we're not waiting for regulation
to take this proactive approach to responsibility, and, I think, going through the
process of that. But I've heard you also mention that the regulation is needed, and
we've said that as a company. And how do you talk about that in your conversations?
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
Well, I think if you look at any sort of technology that has ubiquitous impact on
society, there's always regulation. So, my favorite metaphor is electricity. So, you can
sort of think of these AI systems, I think, and like I hope in time they will have similar
sorts of impact where 10 years, 15 years from now, you will just have a diﬃcult time
imagining how the world could function without them. And if we get to that point,
you must expect that there's going to be regulations. So you'll have regulation on
the generation bits. The same way that we have regulation on the power generators
and the turbines and the generation facilities, We will have that for AI. There will
probably be regulation on distribution as there is with electricity, and there'll be
regulation on the sort of endpoint of the technology, where it actually gets delivered
into a product that a user is touching. And so I don't know exactly what that
regulation will look like.
Brad did a really brilliant job, I think, a couple weeks ago articulating like what our
initial point of view is. And we also believe that there's going to be a lot of debateFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 9A - Amy Hood
A - Kevin Scott
A - Amy Hood
A - Kevin Scottand public conversation about what it is that regulation really needs to be. But, so,
like I and I -- I like we it would be really suspicious to me, honestly, and it would be a
sign that the technology maybe isn't as impactful as we think it is if you believe that it
doesn't need regulating.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yeah, I think that's an interesting way of thinking about it. The other thing I get asked
a lot of from customers is the focus on privacy. I think this is not a surprise, right, as
people learn about the technology, and obviously, just so people are clear, they are
not -- the data belong -- the customer data belongs to the customer just like it does
today, that applies in the world of AI as well. I can use the Azure OpenAI example,
customer data remains within the tenant boundaries. The LLM is ﬁne-tuned on their
data, remains with their data, and is not applied to the master LLM. And so, I think
that's just important, and we keep reiterating that with customers. Are you hearing
the same sort of questions as you talk to people?
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. And I think what you just said is like the thing that we have to make
sure everyone really understands. Like, we're not using people's data to improve the
foundation models themselves. All of the covenants that we have with everyone
around their data, with respect to their tenant, are absolutely respected with this
technology, whether it's an OpenAI model or something that we built, and like it's a -
- like we are super diligent, and again, it's one of those things where we're lucky to
have spent the past 15 plus years building all of that infrastructure, because we've
been able to rely on it as we've been deploying this new AI technology.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Absolutely, and now I want to move on to, I would say, the second most popular
question I get in investor calls at least, is regarding the OpenAI partnership. And why
did OpenAI choose us? How did that partnership get started? And people are
worried that we don't own the IP that's really required in this area to be considered a
leader, and is that a valid concern? So those are the two big questions for you, Kevin,
in this one.
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
Yeah, so let me start with the ﬁrst one. So, I think, ﬁrst and foremost, we've been able
to do a bunch of really amazing work with OpenAI, and the work that we've done is a
testament to how well-aligned we've been from the start. The initial intention when
we did the ﬁrst deal in 2019, was we wanted a third-party like, someone that was
outside of Microsoft, in addition to our own research and engineering teams, to be
able to come in with an incredibly high level of ambition for what they were trying to
do with AI. They would put pressure on all of our infrastructure and system software,
so that we could make sure that we were building the best possible platform for
training and serving these new large-scale frontier models as we're calling them
now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 9A - Amy HoodAnd so, like I think if anything like that has worked incredibly well. Like we've been
able to design this infrastructure along with Open AI like we very quickly after the
partnership, built our ﬁrst AI supercomputer that was the thing that GPT-3 was
trained on. And in addition to them using our infrastructure like we've also been able
to partner on using their models in incredibly creative ways to power our products
and like yeah, so the ﬁrst of which was GitHub Copilot. Like we had deployed GPT-3
and like a whole bunch of diﬀerent ways, like relatively silently and a bunch of
products. But GitHub Copilot was the ﬁrst generative AI-ﬁrst product that I think
anyone had really built, where the generative AI was just front and center and
allowed us to do a thing that people thought, ﬁve seconds before, we launched it
was actually impossible, which is a little bit of the ﬂavor of like a bunch of these
applications. Like you deliver them and like you go from in people's mind like that
was impossible to like, wow, I can't believe it. And yeah, so that has been the nature
of our partnership.
So, we have the way to understand their IP rights is, we have a very broad license to
all of the Open AI IP for the term of the deal and we work incredibly closely together
on all parts of the stack. So like they have pushed us in incredibly helpful ways to
make sure that our infrastructure and system software are world-class, I think you see
that right now and just the number of people who choose our cloud to do their own
high-ambition things. And it has deﬁnitely helped us out in incredible ways, it is just
sort of the scale and pace of delivery that we have. And yeah, we obviously beneﬁt
tremendously as well from Open AI, who like I think is one of the smartest group of
AI researchers on the planet. But we also complement the things that they're doing
as well. Like we have like a really, really ﬂuid partnership, where we're very aligned
on this platform vision and we're very aligned on safety and responsibility, and this
real mission and incredible obligation that we have to doing it right for society. And
we just are pretty ﬂexible about how we help one another.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And I think for a lot of people, this has been a little bit what's hard to capture, is that
you can be in this relationship with a company and a partnership, also have your own
internal research capabilities, and we can partner with others. It's just a unique
partnership, fundamentally, I think built on trust and mission alignment, which is
always an important thing.
But just to reiterate, I think that the two key points you made is, when Kevin talked
about having a broad perpetual license to all the OpenAI IP developed through the
term of this partnership, that means even if the partnership were to end, we would
still have those license rights to all the IP, up until AGI. And the other thing that's
critical is that, I think, and Kevin leads a lot of these conversations, as does our legal
team and our OpenAI ethics team, I'm sorry, our AI ethics team here, we share the
same values for responsibility and the safe deployment of this IP. And I can't tell you
how foundational that is to being able to make progress. And both of us can
independently make this technology available to our respective users and
developers. You're seeing that happen. I think that's good for everyone. And really
keeps the innovative spirit. And this AI capability is built into the Azure foundation.
And so, I think it's sort of a long way of Kevin and I -- of saying that we feel very goodFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 9A - Kevin Scottabout the position we're in both with the partnership and with access to the IP over
the long-term.
Now, let's go back to I think what a lot of people always asking me is about, it's like,
"Hey, listen, you're really hearing from customers that they're going to deploy this?"
And, "What are the use cases we're seeing today?" And, "If I was to open my mind
up, what are the use cases we'd see tomorrow?" And I would say, maybe I'll say
some of the things I'm hearing, Kevin, and I think you probably hear even more,
especially longer-term what's possible, but we hosted CEOs on campus not so long
ago, Kevin, and you hosted a conversation and I met one-on-one, but it was
fascinating. I mean, it was every industry, whether it's healthcare, where we talk about
Epic with medical records; whether it was manufacturing and talking about how to
detect and describe problems between the plants and headquarters; whether it's
education and having personalized tutors or retail, or developers to your point, I
think it's coming almost, I would describe it, it's a global conversation, and it's a by-
industry conversation. So, what are you thinking in terms of use cases that are
possible, and I think you're closer to some of those industry cases than I am for sure.
{BIO 17617313 <GO>}
Yeah, I think very broadly speaking, this particular wave of technology transformation
is going to be all about really driving productivity in places where people are doing
cognitive work. And so this is just sort of a, it is totally wordy way of saying white
collar work. So like your job, my job, like anyone who is really using their mind like to
do something.
What I think is going to be enormously obvious in the coming months is like there's a
huge amount of stuﬀ that we all do in our cognitive work that is sort of routine,
repetitive, like we're probably not super excited about it ourselves. It's the annoying,
stressful parts of our job. I think, almost every one of those things like gets impacted
in the short-term by these tools. And the way that we are thinking about them is this
choice of the term Co-pilot to describe this new type of software is like a really
deliberate choice, because we believe that there are going to be lots of these Co-
pilots, and that they're going to be, some of them, very general like Bing Chat or
ChatGPT, but some of them like GitHub Co-pilot, relatively focused on a particular
type of cognitive work.
And so, I think, whether it's software development, or it's marketing, or it's customer
support, like -- or doing prior auth for insurance. You just sort of pick your thing
where I know that I encounter these things every day multiple times, where you're
like, "I can't believe we're still doing things this way." Now is the moment where you
sort of ﬁnally, I think, get to get past the "I can't believe we're still doing things this
way," And you get to go do them a diﬀerent way. And I think, in the longer term, the
real prize here are these more generally capable AI systems that can really go solve
big problems. Like the thing that I talk about with folks, and I don't know when this
will happen, but it's sort of the aspirational thing.
If you had an AI that was -- that had the scientiﬁc expertise and the ability to go think
about a problem for a really long time. And you said, hey, $100 million worth ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-12

would be the easiest $100 million that human beings had ever gone to spend. The
amount of pain and suﬀering and economic losses and just general misery that
some of these diseases cause. And that's so the aspiration for the future. Like can
you have systems that can help us go solve problems that we can't solve right now,
even using the best tools that we have? So, what is that better tool that helps us go
solve those really nasty problems?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And I think that's why in so many ways this time period where you can both be and
have real concerns about the power of the technology, but far more than that so
much optimism about the possibility. And I think, that those two things can coexist
and I think frankly always have in large transitions in history. And so just a few things
ﬁrst, Kevin, thank you so much for joining us today. In some ways, I think this is
there's no better person to have tell investors what we're what our vision is, why it's
diﬀerent than the person responsible for making sure our vision and strategy gets
executed to the very best of our capability.
And so thank you both for taking on that large mantle for us and for joining us today.
Thanks to everybody for watching and getting a bit more educated in terms of
what's diﬀerent about our approach. I will say, we've waited a long time for me to get
more productive here at the company, Kevin. So maybe this is the ﬁnal secret that
gets me there and increases this CFO's productivity at least. And so thanks everyone
and I look forward to delivering really Kevin, both for our customers, for developers
frankly, and for a society that I think is right for the adoption of this technology and
our leadership position in it. So thank you and we certainly remain committed to
leading this wave.
