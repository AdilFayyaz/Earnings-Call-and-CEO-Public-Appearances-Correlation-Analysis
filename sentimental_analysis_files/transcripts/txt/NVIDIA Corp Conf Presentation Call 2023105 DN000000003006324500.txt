All right. Why don't we go ahead and get started? Good morning, Happy New Year,
and welcome to J.P. Morgan's 21st Annual Technology and Automotive Investor
Forum here at the Consumer Electronic Show. My name is Harlan Sur, I'm the
semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment analyst for the ﬁrm. Very
pleased to introduce Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Oﬃcer at NVIDIA. It's been a tradition, nine years to have the NVIDIA team,
speciﬁcally, Colette, be the ﬁrst to present at our investor conference, because the
team is driving many of the trends that you're going to hear about today, right,
artiﬁcial intelligence, compute acceleration, next-generation compute platforms in
automotive and gaming and IoT. And in addition to that, the NVIDIA team is driving
an emerging software and services revenue stream. So I've asked Colette to start us
oﬀ with an overview of what the team announced on Tuesday at CES special address.
And then we'll go-ahead and kick-oﬀ the Q&A. So Colette, thank you for the nine
years of support and I will turn it over to you.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you. Really pleased to be here. We wouldn't miss it, even with a great weather
that we're experiencing, we wouldn't miss it and come here. I don't need to make an
opening reminder statement that the presentation discussions that we will have
contains forward-looking statements, and investors are advised to read our reports
that are ﬁled with the SEC for information relates to our risks and uncertainties facing
our business. Okay, now that I have that out of the way.
I want to ﬁrst start with some of the key things that we have been working on,
probably since we've last discussed after Q3 earnings. Ada, Ada which is our
architecture for our gaming platforms is oﬀ to a great start. We began earlier
launching our 4090, launching our 4080, which is also becoming one of the most
popular GPUs in retail, and we're here today to announce our RTX 4070 Ti version as
well. So we're fairly pleased in terms of what we're seeing. But of course, our AdaFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-05

Page 2 of 10architecture is leading and we are still working in terms of our inventory correction,
which is going as expected right now.
Secondly, we are focused on bringing to market a large lineup of new products,
particularly in our datacenter, we have our Hopper architecture, working on for many
years and a really important improvement for many of the new types of workloads
that are hitting the market. I think we'll talk a little bit more about that today.
We are continuing to watch China and it's opening. China has certainly been
through quite a bit in terms of with their zero COVID policy, it's still early for us, but
we are watching them carefully. As you know in the last year in calendar '22, really
challenges in terms of both our gaming and our data center based on the economy
in China and the COVID lockdowns.
But we are here at CES. We're here for the consumer, folks, both here for gaming, as
well as for auto. So let me kind of discuss some of the things that we discussed.
Talked about the 4070 Ti coming to market and we are also bringing our 40-series to
notebooks. We have more than a 170 diﬀerent notebooks probably able to see
throughout the ﬂoor at the convention center, but it is also fueled with our DLSS,
which really helps bring AI and ray tracing to so many of the gamers.
So our DLSS is in its third-generation, very similar to our ray tracing architecture
being in its third-generation. We also have more than 50 new games using DLSS 3,
both here and available, but also coming in the next couple of quarters. So we're
really excited to see what we can do with our 40 series. But it's not just focused on
on-premise gaming. Our GFN will now be available with our 4080. So GFN is our
cloud opportunity for gaming and bringing a high end 4080 is a really great
experience for those cloud gamers. I love the fun fact also what we're bringing is
GFN to the automotive. We decided to bring those two things together. So we have
several of our automotive makers that are looking to provide GFN inside of the car,
so gaming everywhere and always. So we're really pleased.
Moving to our automotive, probably one of the key highlights of our automotive
announcements out here is Foxconn has decided to join and has adopted our Orin
architecture for compute in the many NEVs [ph], not just the NEVs that we are
already a part of, but any type of NEV, new energy types of cars across the world. So
we're very excited about that partnership and their endorsement of the Orin
architecture.
There is more that we are seeing in terms of Omniverse. Omniverse has of course
now been adopted by Mercedes in their next-generation factories, similar to some of
the other automotive companies that are really seeing the need of the digital twin of
the factories to ﬁnd the perfect combination of how to run those factories very
eﬃciently and using the AI. So those are some of the key highlights I wanted to start
with. There's a couple other ones, but a really great show, and we're really pleased to
be here in person.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-05

Colette Kress{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
And I appreciate that, Colette. Thank you for that. So I'll start-oﬀ with the ﬁrst few
questions and I'll certainly turn it over to the audience to see if you guys have any
questions. If you hit your guidance this quarter, revenue for calendar '22 is expected
to remain ﬂattish. It's actually much better than prior downcycles and inventory
collection cycles for the company. And I think it's a strong reﬂection of the product
cycles, the diversiﬁcation. As we look into this year, ﬁscal '24 consensus has your
revenues growing. What's the team's conﬁdence on driving growth this year in an
environment where global demand trends will be soft, help us understand the trends
and product cycles that will drive the business this year? And then maybe longer-
term, how do we think about the overall growth proﬁle for the diﬀerent businesses,
right, gaming, data center, ProViz and automotive?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. The great way to start out in talking about, it's a new year, what do we want to
see and focus on in the new year. One of the things that, of course, we can't control
is the macro-environment around the world. And the macro-environment around the
world is just not the same in every single country, each one of them facing a quite
uniqueness. But we can spend our time focusing on our opportunities in front of us.
As you are correct, we have a large portfolio of new products coming to market. And
those even start with our data center business, one of our more important
architectures, our Hopper architecture supporting the massive growth that we've
seen in AI over the last several, several years.
So not only is it about the Hopper architecture, but remember we're also bringing
our Grace CPU to market. We are bringing in our networking business, our latest
DPU to market with BlueField. And we will also be looking at a large part of our
portfolio in networking at the higher speeds that are necessary to support the
environment of data center computing architecture as a whole.
We're not just focused on a singular GPU type of platform, we're really focused on
the data center computing as a whole. And the environment couldn't be more set up
right now, as folks have really understood that the ending of Moore's Law is now
really here. And when you're in a situation of having to make choices, the movement
to accelerated computing and the use of AI couldn't be more important for them.
But that's only one part of it, as you know, in gaming with our 40 series, with the
kickoﬀ of the 4090, we really believe this is a great architecture, the excitement of
gaming and what a third-generation of ray tracing and DLSS can provide, not only to
just gamers, but the creators out there. There's so many diﬀerent use-case
opportunities of that ray tracing that really takes us into the workstations on ProViz
[ph], when we talk about what they could also do with that. The creators thinking
about the use of ray tracing and all of the work that they are doing.
But then lastly, we're continuing a growth trajectory on our automotive business.
Orin has been a home-run, both working in terms of that compute platform of many
of the NEVs, but we also have an $11 billion pipeline moving forward and we're just atFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-05

Harlan Surthat turning point that we could be getting to grow to a $1 billion business in our
automotive realizing that potential of that $11 billion pipeline. But keep in mind, there
is still work to do when you will see the work coming with our key agreements that
we have with JLR what we have with Mercedes-Benz and Daimler. All of those are still
in the future. So the growth is still here to go forward. So those are the things that
we're focused on as we go forward, even in the current macro-environment.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Near-term, I think, as you mentioned, the team has been working through excess
channel inventories in gaming as well as your ProVis business, on gaming in
particular Q2 -- Q2 and Q3 combined your shipping about 30% below end demand
consumption of around $5 billion. When we went back and look historically after two
quarters of under shipping demand, but typically -- the team typically does see an
inﬂection in the business, you had anticipated channel inventories back to more
normalized levels exiting this quarter, is the team still tracking to this milestone is --
and is end consumption still trending at roughly that sort of $2.5 billion-ish run rate
per quarter plus or minus, even in -- even in this sort of tough macro-environment?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So the macro-environment and what we're seeing in terms of demand for
gaming. In North-America and in Europe, as we've discussed, we're seeing solid
demand. China has gone through a lot in calendar '22, the end of zero COVID may
improve, but it's still too early for us to say. So it has been a little bit choppy in terms
of China, and we had discussed that in our Q3. However, still gaming as a whole, is a
very important area for us to focus on and the demand is deﬁnitely there and solid.
Now moving to our series of the 40 series, bringing that to market, that's one piece
of it in terms of the demand, but also again getting the correction of the channel.
Yes, we are on track. As we leave this Q4, our Q4 at the end of January to be near
normal channel levels and that can [ph] in the market. We believe that this is just
through a combination of the holiday seasons, they really, really direct focus on
making sure working with our AIC partners and our OEMs to move that channel
inventory. And you're correct that that sometimes takes a couple of quarters to do
that. And we moved quickly and we think it's working quite well.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Perfect. Before I move on to some of the product segments, let me see if anybody
has any questions before I move forward. So let's start-oﬀ with your data center
business, it's more than 60% of your overall revenues in the business is tracking
towards 40% year-over-year growth in ﬁscal '23, which is more than 1.5x the cloud
CapEx growth last year and the team has driven roughly about a 70% CAGR over the
past three years, which is about 2x, the annualized growth rate relative to the cloud
CapEx spending growth. Our hardware team is forecasting cloud CapEx spending
still up high single-digits this year, but more of the spending is focused on strategic
compute initiatives like accelerated compute, right?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-05
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 10Colette Kress
Harlan Sur
Colette KressAnd so you combine this with the next-generation Hopper ramp, H100 ramp
continued strong enterprise adoption, strong networking demand pool. History
would suggest that the team should grow the data center segment by double-digit
percentage growth rate this year. Help us understand the puts and takes around data
center business in this challenging macro-environment this year, and conﬁdence on
driving growth for ﬁscal '24?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, there's a focus within the company to really get these great products to market
that we have. The Hopper architecture that we're bringing to market in feeds so
many great things. The AI market has expanded exceptionally since our last
architecture. And not only just the advancement of the market as a whole, just the
complexity, the size of the models have continued to grow. We're seeing three very
important areas in AI that were probably in their infancy, or did not exist in the last
three years or more. And those areas are these large language models fueled by the
natural language processing, the recommended systems are yet another one that is
still very, very important to monetization, monetization and marketing are very key
area. And this last one that I think you've probably all seen during the holidays is the
focus on generative AI. Really a great opportunity of both now creating these
models, creating these trained models and seen what is now possible to be
produced out of generative AI. We're very excited for those.
But you also focused on key areas of the end of Moore's Law and what accelerated
computing needs to do. We're in the right position with our architecture to both
improve performance of nearly 5X or more from the last generation, but also the
energy eﬃciency, because the concept at the end of Moore's Law, really built into
the sustainability. What are we going to do with our data centers going forward, if
we're not focusing on the eﬃciency on there. We're all set-up for all of these right
things as the market continues to grow, it's not just Hopper, it is a full lineup across-
the-board. We expect our Grace CPU to help inﬂuence the connectivity of working
with our GPU, really working in terms of the speeds of all the work in terms of the
datacenter. And so again, not being able to control the macroenvironment, we have
a great lineup of products to help fuel growth to good start [ph].
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
And the team started shipping Hopper, production and initial shipments in Q -- your
ﬁscal Q3, server OEM availability was this quarter by Q4. Cloud instances available
next quarter. The team noted I think in the last earnings call that Hopper is expected
to ship in large volumes in the April quarter. Is that still the case? And can you just
talk about the overall sort of cloud hyperscale customer traction, design-win pipeline
so far with the H100 and how that compares to the A100 cycle?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, each generation now of bringing our data center architecture to market has
had more advancements and more connectivity with our customers. When we think
about the work that we've done to bring this to market, it's not alone, it's with ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-05
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Harlan Sur
Colette Kress
Harlan Surpartners, it is with our customers, and so much of the work and the anticipation of
Hopper may have not been an excitement of here it is, because we've been working
on it and working with our customers for quite some time. So those relationships are
very important. They have been helping us both qualify it, working with it and being
ready to bring this to market. We will bring production level H100 to market. This
quarter we started some initial ones in Q3, but that is starting here in Q4. And yes,
we expect a ramp into ﬁscal year '24, the ﬁrst quarter as well as we continue to ramp
H100. So this is a big undertaking. It is a fabulous product. But the relationships in
our work will really come through.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
You know, as we talk with a lot of the users, the power users of accelerated compute,
right. One of the things that they are anxiously awaiting is a CPU, GPU architect, do
you see CPU, GPU architecture, which is called cache coherency. But basically the
thought processes memory sharing like eﬃcient memory sharing between the CPU
and GPU that's not currently available, I think Intel, AMD, I think are two years away
with the CXL initiative, but you're Grace CPU which is expected to sample. I believe,
in the ﬁrst-half of the year that you guys have already pre-integrated cache
coherency in your Grace CPU. Give us a sense of, like I said, your team expected to
sample in the ﬁrst-half of the year ramp into the market in the second-half of the
year. First is the team tracking to its timelines on Grace, and how do we think about
the revenue proﬁle and the opportunity for Grace?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So let's talk about why Grace and what our overall goal was there. When you
think about the work that has been done for AI, or the work that's been in the data
center, you can't ever accomplish that with just one GPU. We have been spending
years focusing on linking together multiple GPUs, essentially coming up with
supercomputers. Supercomputers to help both the size of the models, as well as the
eﬃciencies and speeds of the work that they are accomplishing. We've done that
both with our own interconnects and then came together with Mellanox as well
working on that. But, now here is another important piece of why we brought Grace
here.
Grace gives us the opportunity to focus on the speeds between that CPU and the
GPUs, but also focusing, as you mentioned in terms of the memory, and how can we
make sure that it's the most eﬃcient processes that we can do. Our Grace CPU is
focused on very large models, a large models focusing on AI, focusing on the
supercomputing, focusing on high-performance computing workloads and many of
our new things that we see in the future, such as digital twins and the amount of
work that will take into account. So, Grace and Hopper go together. Yes, we're on-
track for sampling in the ﬁrst-half and we'll bring this to market in the second-half of
the year. This is an area where the design-wins of working with many of our
customers, as they see this connectivity of putting the two products together to be
great for their opportunities and we'll continue to work on that.

Page 7 of 10Colette Kress
Harlan SurLet's shift the focus over to gaming. Despite the challenging consumer market
demand for the new Ada 40 series gaming products. The initial ones, the 4090,
4080 seems quite good where we check some of the online retail sites, 4090 is tight
availability in most places. 4080 GPU card pricing is marked up about 10%, 15%
relative to MSRP. So, this all suggests really good demand pull-through. You
mentioned at the special address or Jeﬀ mentioned at the special address, 40% of
your installed-base has adopted RTX GPUs and we're now in your third-generation
of the RTX architecture. So with the new product launch, how should we think about
the additional penetration rate into your installed-base and typically like how long
are these GPU replacement cycles?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So great set of questions and agree wholeheartedly in terms of our 4090,
4080 and what we're seeing out in the market. 4090 sold out quite quickly. We've
already started the restocking about working with our AICs to do so. And the 4080 is
doing very well in terms of in retail as well in terms of selling. We have RTX now in
our installed-base of nearly 40%. So interesting, because we were probably on stage
here several years ago, talking about what is ray tracing and are there going to be
games of that. And now we have in our installed-base more than 40% focused on ray
tracing.
Ampere architecture probably it was about a third of that. And so now here we come
with a third-generation and there's again great opportunity, because it's not just
about that platform, it has been about our work with the ecosystem in creating the
games that can now use ray tracing and use DLSS. So we're on a great trajectory
there to see that take-oﬀ more.
As we go-forward, in the new year, I think you're going to see more of our 40 series
come to market. Now how do we think about how much of that will be sold to those
that are refreshing versus those that are coming in as new gamers. Always tough to
look out, but what we have seen is, we bring a new generation of the product to
market, two-plus years, every two-plus years we'll bring a new generation. But what
we see is probably refreshes some of the most important gamers out there to be a
little bit over three years. So this is a great opportunity for not only upgrading to
Ampere, but thinking about those that are in prior generations that have not
upgraded yet, that is a material performance increase and a no-brainer for them in
terms of purchasing. So, I think we'll see both new gamers and that refreshed.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Let's switch over and talk about software. On your software solutions, you're
enabling customers to come to market rapidly by developing full stack. We've
always talked about the NVIDIA strategy as focused on ecosystem enablement,
right? And a part of that is full stack development, turnkey solutions, managed
services, you're monetizing your software platforms and you've got monetization
opportunities across all of your end markets, right? The business is running.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-05
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 10Colette Kress
Harlan SurI believe the software, services and ratable type of revenue streams, I think, is
running in sort of low sort of $100 million sort of annualized run rate today, and
you're now selling software separately, right? You've got NVIDIA AI enterprise,
Omniverse, AV. Like how do we think about the size of these opportunities? And
what's the monetization time line of these software and services-based
opportunities?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. Software is a very important piece in terms of our success almost in each one
of our businesses. For many years, we have put software in both the ecosystem as
well as in our products that enables customers to take out of a box and begin their
work that they need, because we've enabled a lot about software. But there now is
that opportunity to sell it separately. Why? It creates more of that relationship and
the help that is needed for many of our enterprises. Our enterprises need that
support as they are beginning their work on AI projects or otherwise.
So we took this opportunity to break out software and sell it separately with our
enterprises. You're going to see it in three major areas and probably more going
forward. But the ﬁrst is NVIDIA AI enterprise. This is a core you should think about as
the operating system of AI available for our enterprises and not only being sold with
us and our partners, but also being sold with several of our CSPs, putting it in their
marketplace. They really believe that it's not just about setting up cloud instances.
They need to support that software that they are all using with NVIDIA to do that as
well. So we're really pleased with that piece of work that's coming together. So
NVIDIA AI is an important piece.
The second one we've talked about is Omniverse. Omniverse really fuels, what we
will see as the future of 3D Internet and folks really working not only on those three
dimensions, but what you may see in terms of digital twins and work in that piece. So
we'll sell that, whether that be with groups inside the enterprise or even to an
individual that may be a creative working as well.
The third one is our focus on software for automotive. Our focus is not just on NEVs
and creating a computing platform in the hardware infrastructure, we have a
signiﬁcant amount of work and eﬀort and design wins as we focus on AV. And so we
are now able to do both of selling them that hardware, but also being a part of the
software revenue stream that will enable within the OEMs. We'll be able to share that
with them, with Daimler and both with JLR. So that is the more of the medium and
long term with what we're seeing in terms of NVIDIA AI and Omniverse is here right
now.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
In automotive, as you mentioned, team has an $11 billion design win pipeline that is
expected to unfold over the next few years, but that business started to inﬂect pretty
meaningfully in Q2 of last year. In fact, it's driving like 100% year-over-year growth. I
think, this quarter driven by your Orin-based platforms, which are starting to ramp.

Colette KressJaguar Land Rover in front of you. How should we model -- think about the ramp into
this $11 billion automotive pipeline over the next three to four years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, you're going to see diﬀerent stages, but we've already probably passed an
inﬂection point that we're seeing the growth of Orin with our NEVs. Why are the
NEVs focused on Orin? One, both the performance level and when you're thinking
about building an electric car, you're really starting from the ground-up and
redesigning and having that central computing platform has been very important to
them. Both our work now with Foxconn as well as many of the top NEVs around the
world focused on this. It is a great opportunity to continue to ramp.
Additionally, the next phase will be coming with our design wins, both on robotaxis
and bringing some of the early AV to market. In this case, this can be both in
infrastructure and may have some of our software incorporated in them well. But
further more in the long term, probably when we get to calendar '25 is when you are
going to see production vehicles for AV start to ramp and be a more meaningful
position in our automotive. At this point, we're going to be now seeing that software
really take oﬀ. Right now, we're still in the hardware infrastructure that's driving our
revenue. But again, growing into that pipeline that we have going forward.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
On the ﬁnancials, how do we think about the OpEx proﬁle relative to the revenue
growth, given you talked about a very aggressive cadence, right? So across your
GPU, CPU and your networking product, the team is driving a two-year cadence.
That's an extremely aggressive cadence. And then on top of that, you've got
ecosystem enablement, you've got software development and so on. And so how
should we think about the R&D or the OpEx intensity and that relative to revenue
growth going forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
When the ﬁrst challenges of the economy had, it was a focus of ours to really slow
down the hiring and so that we can focus on our teams that we have, that we could
focus on our employees that we had. And that was the very ﬁrst thing that we did is
slowing down that hiring. And we are continuing to work to try and keep on a
sequential basis about as ﬂat as we can in this environment. You're right. We've got a
very large portfolio of bringing new products to market, and they're quite complex
in that work.
But our business model and our structure as a company allows quite a bit of
eﬃciency. What I mean that is, remember, we're essentially one architecture across
everything that we do. All of our software is both forward compatibility and
backwards compatibility. So having that consistent uniﬁed architecture has really
allowed the eﬃciencies and how we structure the organization as a whole. And in
this environment, that is helping us fuel bring this stuﬀ together. So we'll continue toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-01-05
