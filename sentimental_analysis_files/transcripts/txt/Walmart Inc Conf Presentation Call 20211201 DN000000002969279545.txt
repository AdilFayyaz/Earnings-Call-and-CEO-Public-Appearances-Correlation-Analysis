Presentation
(inaudible) over the food and grocery sector here at Stephens, I'm thrilled to
introduce our keynote speaker, Brett Biggs, CFO Walmart, who is going to join us
today to take your questions and talk about the company. Brett thanks for being
here. Always appreciate your time. This will be a Q&A session that I'll lead but while
the audience chime in, I'll check them periodically to see if there are questions but I
think maybe to get things started, Brett, there is this question I thought about a lot
this last year which is a lot of ways, what you guys are delivering today is what you
promised in 2015 when Doug and the team announced a pretty dramatic change of
course for the company signiﬁcant shift in investment to e-Commerce.

That was my ﬁrst week is being announced as CFO.
Yes, that's right.

That was a signiﬁcant time (inaudible). You've got the comps you've become now a
major player in the e-commerce arena. In a lot of ways, the market really believed in
you back then. It didn't feel like that ﬁrst week (inaudible) you were rewarded with a
higher valuation, you've now grown into that valuation. I think about kind of the nextFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

investors excited about Walmart and can be similarly transformational.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. First of all, thanks for everybody being here. I think this is (inaudible) this may be
the last live conference I was at two years ago was here in Nashville at Stephens, so
it's nice to have people back in the room and being able to see faces and
expressions, so thanks for being here. Yes, it's has been quite a journey. I've been
with the company almost 22 years now and even going back and thinking about in
2000. When I came to the company, we were about $160 billion in revenue and you
know you had a long runway of Supercenters to grow and now we've grown our
company over $500 billion, obviously, we've gone further than the Supercenter. But
ﬁve years ago, the investments we're making are the investments we needed to go
make, we needed to invest more in e-commerce, we needed to invest in wages, we
needed to invest in our stores, and at the time, it was investments have felt like it was
a way to get us to catch up a bit and we had -- we hadn't grown as quickly as we do
in e-commerce and we needed to catch up a bit in that space.
The investments we're making today feel very diﬀerent. They feel very oﬀensive --
they are very oﬀensive and when I look forward to the next ﬁve years of what we can
do in retail and there's a lot we can do in retail, but all the things that we can do with
our ﬂywheel in our ecosystem and building out other parts of our business, whether
it's healthcare, ﬁnancial services, or advertising marketplace.
When I look forward ﬁve years from now, I see a diﬀerent company again ﬁve years
from now, but a company that still an incredible retailer, but an omni retailer and a
retailer that's playing a diﬀerent role in customers' lives and being more involved in
those customers lives, whether it's again health care, ﬁnancial services, or retail. I'm
more excited now than I was when I looked at a 5 years ago, I see more growth
available and you're starting to see data points as you see things like Connect
growing, we've doubled our e-commerce business in the last two years. Obviously,
comps have been great. Proﬁts have been great. So, I think we're showing to
shareholders and investors what the company can look like and what it's going to
look like and we just need to keep doing that. And I think over time the stock price
takes care of yourself.
Yes. When you guys reported earnings, one of the things that I think stood out to
many is your inventory position as you head into the fourth quarter. That was --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
But it was really good, yes.
You talked about all the aggressive actions we put in place to achieve that sort of
positioning. I'm curious kind of one short-term, one long-term question. What
assumptions that you all put into your calculus to think about getting in that sort of
inventory position for the fourth quarter. I mean as you look out maybe a year from
now what sort of actions are you taking you're considering as you think about
positioning yourself to be competitive as we move through this kind of supply chain
cycle?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We really early -- earlier in the year, there are some things you have to buy very
really far ahead from a seasonal perspective and we were seeing customer demand
was strong, felt like it would -- it would stay that way even with what was going on
with COVID and still continues with COVID but that we were going to be strong,
particularly around events back to school, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, we
were going to be strong and clearly the right call to do that and we're great shape --
we're in great shape for the holidays and said inventory is up almost 12% in the US.
So if you're customer and you -- you want to feel good about where you can go ﬁnd
which you want it's going to be at Walmart, whether that's online or in the stores, so
clearly the right decision to make.
I think as we look out the next year, you'll continue to see us be aggressive on in-
stock, can't sell if you don't have it and there are times you're going over by
something, we'll take that risk versus not being in stock. Supply chain in -- pieces of
supply chain ﬁll a little better than they did a few weeks ago, few less anchored ships
out in California. I think what -- what the administration is done, what we've done,
what other industry participants have done to get operations up 24/7, it's starting to
unclog the supply chain a bit, so we feel -- feel more optimistic probably than we did
a couple of months ago. This is going to take time. We've never probably in any of
our lifetimes have seen a period of increased demand and constrained supply at the
same time like we're seeing right now, but I do think a lot of it's going to work itself
out.
The other I think kind of highlight we're very topical dynamic from the quarter was
related to inﬂation and in particular, some of the comments that you all made, Doug
in particularly kind of characterize yourself inﬂation buyers, which and would you
have been for a long time. Where do you think the customer -- what are you seeing
among your customer in terms of what their acceptance level is of higher prices or
we at a point at which it's not the right decision to continue to pass along some of
the inﬂation you're seeing, it sounds like we may be that kind of at that point now.
But I don't want to really read into the comments that were made because that was a
big takeaway from the quarter for a lot of folks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Employment is good. Wages are very good if you think about our customers, so that
puts more dollars in their pocket. Doug is right, we've been inﬂation ﬁghter for all
the back Sam Walton and I think there are times like this when you can show the
diﬀerentiation that you can make for customers. Customers are very aware of prices
right now, whether it's at the pump or in-store, and we know they're aware of that
we're seeing -- we talked about we are seeing, low to mid single digit inﬂation in
some categories, as we came through the third quarter. It's higher in some, not as
high in others. We'll be thoughtful about it. Our price gaps today are wider than they
were when we came into the pandemic. So we have the ability to do what we need
to do and still be really competitive, so I think we can manage this from a -- from a
position where it's good for customers, also good for shareholders and we'll just be
very thoughtful about it. But we -- it is a time we can diﬀerentiate with versus our
competitors.
Yes, yes. A couple of categories got called out on the earnings call. Beef in particular
in the grocery basket. Are there areas where you're seeing more pushback versus
others or you're particularly focused on within the consumer graph scale?.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think you -- you saw from a customer perspective?
From a customer perspective.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You'll see some customers will trade down in some areas may buy a diﬀerent type of
meat or a diﬀerent type of protein even than they were before and you'll see -- you'll
see that work itself out over time, but nothing dramatic in the third quarter that was --
that was worth calling out as far as straight down.
Okay. You've got great comps across really all of the business right now. I think for
years, the Walmart store has been deﬁned by the US and store comps. For the last
several years, e-commerce growth has been a big piece of that. We're facing diﬃcult
comparisons in the e-commerce business and you guys are increasingly thinking and
talking about the business from an omnichannel perspective. So I'd be curious to
hear as we look forward and we start to kind of normalize from the compares you
further lean into this omnichannel idea. What's the right rate of growth for the e-
commerce business? How do you think about balancing between the medium of
purchase for your consumers?

A - M. Brett Biggs
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantYes. It's -- when you think about the 3rd quarter, we had over 50% to your comp in
the US on over $300 billion business with over 30% comp to US comp at Sam's
Club, which is over $65 billion business, it's unbelievable levels of growth and it
shows it really shows what our associates taking our stores and clubs associates what
they did and have done during the pandemic is quite remarkable. How we think
about the business though is just more and more omni and even couple of years
ago, I remember talking to investors and saying, I know you want to know the comps
of all the pieces of the business and I understand why, but it's really diﬃcult, more
and more diﬃcult to talk about it in that way because customers today and even
those of you sitting in the room here, you probably don't think about as much where
you're going to get it -- need something, I can get online, I will get in the store, I can
go pick it up, I can get it in my car and get it delivered, just need something and
that's what we want to be. We want to be when you need something and you think
about the search your head. We want to be ﬁrst in that search in your head that you
know our Walmart Store and get it there and we're within ﬁve miles of 90% of the
US, so that's really easy actually. The Supercenter is a uniquely convenient format. I
have it delivered or I can get it and pick it up on the way home, never have to get out
of my car, but I know Walmart has got it and I know they have it at the best price.
Yes.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
That's the calculus we want the customer going through more and more we're
seeing them do that as we take share, particularly in food and groceries. I just want
simplicity and with what we're doing around omni and the way we are changing the
way we fulﬁll for delivery and even in the stores, we've always been the low price
leader, but now we're really becoming very convenient for that customer and that's
the mix of those two and if you can do it in a way that's friendly for shareholders,
which I think we have and we will, it's tough to be.
Yes. I'm going to ask two more and I'll survey the audience. One is about CapEx
spending. How hard is it to implement the CapEx spending that we want in this type
of environment and how does the supply chain dynamics that you're grappling with
chains kind of your rank order critical path of what you would prioritize spending
more?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It's not -- it's not dramatic. We're not building a lot of facilities now like we used to.
We are one of the Supercenters and stores, we are building fulﬁllment capacity but
it's not dramatic. You saw that in the third quarter we went from forecasting $14
million of CapEx this year to $13 million, not a dramatic diﬀerence will some of that
will ﬂow into next year, but we're -- most of the projects we're doing are, we're on
time when it will get them through and feel good about it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - M. Brett BiggsMy second question is ROIC, I tend to be kind of in ROIC. John (inaudible) about the
world you hear me ask a lot of questions about it. I asked on the earnings call about
it.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I'm kind of that way too, so, go ahead.
So I want to ask a big part, I think of thesis for one over the next several years is
delivering some operating leverage as you continue to take share. if I look back to
pre-2014, you had an ROIC level that was substantially higher than where we are
today, obviously, you've made a lot of investment to get the share gains that you've
enjoyed over the last several years can you get back maybe not all the way to where
you were and continue to be aggressive and taking share. Can you play oﬀense and
defense in that regard and kind of help us think about how you think about what's
the optimal level of ROIC?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
YeS, I mean, the simple answer is yes, and you saw ROI go up in the last year, you
saw in the third quarter, pretty signiﬁcantly from last year. But the investments we're
making and that's going to be in fulﬁllment, it's going to be an automation, it's going
to be and technology. I feel really good about the returns on those and we wouldn't
be investing if we didn't think our returns could go up you should continue to see
we've talked about in our longer term algorithm, we should be able to grow
operating income faster the sales of our mid to long-term and do in a way that's --
we're going to -- we're going to spend money on CapEx, but I really like the return
proﬁle of what we're doing. I feel conﬁdent about it.
Good.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We are standardizing. There are diﬀerent types of technology that have diﬀerent
applications. So you think about distribution center where you're trying to ready
stack a pallet and a pallet that can be unstacked at the store in a way that ﬂows with
the store. That's a diﬀerent technology than what you need necessarily to fulﬁll
online grocery in the back of the store. But within -- what we're doing a distribution
center that's pretty standardized. What you do in the back end of a store that's pretty
standardized but there -- but there are diﬀerent technologies. There is not one
technology that ﬁts all things. I feel really good about our partners. We're leading
edge on what's going on in supply chain from whether it's pelletizing or it's moving
goods in the back making it easier to deliver all of those things. In some ways,
there'll be a second-mover advantage in what we're doing there but I think the
technology, I've seen it, there is a time when we will make that more available for
investors to see and I think you would be equally impressed.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

A - M. Brett BiggsYou talked in the outset the ﬁrst question the way we kicked oﬀ the discussion.
You're doing a lot of diﬀerent things beyond just retail. As you move into some of
these diﬀerent verticals, healthcare being a big investment that you guys have made,
how do you do that with the same level of excellence that you've demonstrated in
retail versus just kind of being all things to all people in an average capacity?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. You got to be really good at all of them and you've seen us bring in experts in a
lot of these deals. Dr. Pegus who leads our health care function, we just -- few
months ago announced the joint venture with Ribbit Capital brought in CEO who
was one of the lead folks of Goldman Sachs for bringing in people that know these
spaces, they know how to grow big businesses, and they've got to do it in a way,
we've got to bring in people in a way that they know how to work within the culture
of how we get things done which is important, I mean we want to be the same, but
there is a culture about Walmart and how we do things that's important, but I think
the mix of what we have today of people like me that have been here almost 22
years and new people come into the company with new ideas from new industries.
It's great. I think we're all learning from each other. I think our culture lends itself to
new people coming in and helping us and us helping them understand the
company.
I'm on the Board of our Financial Services joint venture with Ribbit. I'm really excited
about what we can do in that space. That's a space where customers and not just
ﬁnancial services but they need help managing their lives and organizing their lives
and how they deal ﬁnancially and whether it's with subscriptions are things that
they're doing, then you help with that and we already have 265 million people a
week to shop in our stores are customers of ours. We have the eyeballs to be able to
leverage those kinds of services and that's what makes me excited about it.
So I think we tend to like to think about kind of silver bullet ideas for companies just
to simplify things. Walmart Plus was -- kind of characterized that when it was ﬁrst
announced?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I'm not sure. We characterized it (Multiple Speakers)

A - M. Brett BiggsHow does that ﬁt -- so how successful as the program? How do you team the success
obviously engagement is a -- is a big factor, explain kind of how that ﬁts into the
ecosystem and all the things that you try to do to drive customer engagement?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Walmart Plus is a big idea and it's interesting that we've had a membership at Sam's
Club. We have a big membership club already but Walmart Plus is a big idea
because there are so many things that can get put around it, services that can be
included with it, it's a way to interact with customers diﬀerently, it's a way to look at
data diﬀerently and -- but we want to make sure we do it really well, so we're going
to be thoughtful about how quickly roll it out, how quickly rollout services into it
because we want it to be excellent at things we have to do around. Technology
sometimes is taking all technologies and adding capabilities all technology
sometimes putting in new technologies, so it's going to be great as we roll it out and
it's one piece of the puzzle for us and so we're going to be very -- we're going to
accelerate it, we're going to be methodical about it, but we're not -- we're not going
to rush it out because of our whole strategy doesn't completely depend on that.
There's a lot of other things that we're doing whether it's connector Walmart
Fulﬁllment services but it's a big idea and it's something that I think will past my time
at the company is going to be really important for Walmart.
Along those lines and kind of thinking about investments, you've made a number of
M&A investments, signiﬁcant organic growth investments, you've also made a
number of divestitures over the years to kind of redirect your portfolio, where are
you today in that or you always kind of pruning, how do you feel that where the asset
portfolio stands for?.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Company has grown up a lot and how we think about that. When I -- when I ﬁrst
came to the Company, we really -- whatever we acquired we want to acquire 100%.
We really didn't like divesting things. I think we've grown up and matured as a
Company to realize you can make decisions that are great in a point in time and then
there's just things change and you need to go make a diﬀerent decision and you've
seen that with what we did in Brazil, what we did in Japan, what we did in the UK,
and those all made sense at the time and divesting of them when we did are taking a
minority interest in when we did that makes sense now, I'd like the markets we're in
internationally. We have big growth markets in China and India. Mexico is a
phenomenal market. Walmex may be one of the best -- may be the best retailer in
the world. Canada is a good market for us and Chile, South Africa, we have some
good markets. You continue to see us make acquisitions. We made the acquisition of
Jet. We made the acquisition of Flipkart and PhonePe and there is other acquisitions
that don't get quite as much attention a little smaller that are more capability type
acquisitions talent acquisitions, you'll continue to see us be really active in that space
as we bring people and bring ideas into the Company that can -- that can help us
develop the ﬂywheel to where it needs to go.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, I think you're your questions will put. It's deﬁnitely more challenging than some
areas that you can just go into a new product, what you do necessarily in -- put
something into the store. The good thing for us is we know we've got permission
from the customer to be in healthcare. We've had big pharmacy business for a long
time -- big over-the-counter business, so we have permission to go do that.
There is going to be medicine changing, healthcare is changing dramatically, so
there is already an impetus for change. And I think we'll be able to be a part of that
we. We know how to deal with regulation. We're big company we know how to deal
with that probably better than most would. It's not the thing it's simple, but we know
how to do things like that and the healthcare continues to evolve as well online,
telehealth, and you saw some things we did in telehealth, but we also have the
stores and we've done things with clinics, we've done things with diagnostic labs, so
everything about it -- it's more -- it's more challenging, but everything about it really
ﬁts into what we want to do and we've done things in our company's history that
have been challenging but being more engaged in people's lives, we think but all of
us U.S health care, right. This is one place where you were deﬁnitely be involved in
people's lives and so while more challenging in ways we just think it's worth it to
continue to look at diﬀerent ways to ﬂat to manifest inside the company.
(inaudible).
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, I don't think there's anything I'd necessarily rule out with health care but we
want -- we want to be -- it needs to be something that can be executed at scale and
to where -- once you start getting down the curve of simplicity versus complexity, the
payoﬀ needs to be even -- be even better from a customer and a shareholder
standpoint, we go down the continuum, so we're always going to try to stay in a
place that's balanced from that perspective.

they're scalable?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We don't -- we don't really have time to go and measure if it is scalable, so yes,
that is scalable.
How far away do you think we are from seeing them be really meaningful impactful
because they're much higher margin. There has been qualitative commentary of
their contribution to margin across these segments. How material can they be?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You've already seen Connect our advertising business grow dramatically, it's still a
fairly small business, but it's -- it's a meaningful amount of revenue and proﬁt to the
Company now. The -- the capacity we're putting them for fulﬁllment centers will help
us both ﬁrst party and third party. Third-party marketplace is a great business one
from a proﬁtability standpoint, but it just continues to build that brand and gets
people -- customers more loyal to into your ecosystem. That's the most important
part of the marketplace. Financial services and we talked about that health care,
health care is something that takes a little bit longer to develop there but it's -- but
it's a big get when you can get there.
So there are some things that are working right now that you'll start seeing earlier
the data points that I think shareholders need to see the company put out there and
you're going to see some of those around these other businesses that we're
developing though become more and more meaningful. And it's not, it's not long-
term.
Okay. Last Mile how -- when you think about what you guys want to achieve there
over the next several years? What do you think it looks like for you guys how
important is the Spark Network and going after that? How important are partners
that you have today on some of your traditional transportation as a function of that?

like this massive conundrum and we've sent people to the moon we've done other
things, right. So you can solve Last Mile, it's -- it's solvable, but it's -- it is challenging,
but that's a great thing for us is things that are challenging give us an advantage
over competitors because we have the scale and the capabilities and the cash ﬂow
to go make these things happen. Really excited that we are in a last-mile Spark
Network now and over 900 cities. What we're doing with Walmart GoLocal is such
things we do with Home Depot. There's a lot of things that we can do in that Last

if I would do that or not and I promise you would do that because the service is so
great that you never really have to worry about it someone comes into your home
and they put it in your refrigerator you can watch in the whole time that's where this
is heading. It is in that Last Mile and so we've been using partners, third parties,
we've got our Spark, we're getting with what we're doing with market fulﬁllment
centers, and with FCs, we're getting product closer and closer to the customer.
Those stores become a bigger and bigger advantage over time. There were years --
years ago where I talked to analysts about how big advantageous these stores are
going to be and there was not a lot of belief in that at the time. I think now
everybody gets why those stores are so important to what we do, but I think we will
be a major, major player in Last Mile.
(inaudible).
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. The question if you couldn't hear, it was around how the structure really of
supply chain changes as more items are brought online maybe less food traﬃc in the
stores and the great thing about having the stores and the e-commerce business
and being able to do the fulﬁllment network the way we're doing it is it really almost
doesn't matter where the customer goes. If -- if e-commerce is more penetrated than
we think ﬁve years from now or less penetrated than we think ﬁve years from now,
we're okay either way. If you've been in our stores recently, they're crowded.
Our store traﬃc is really good. People like to shop in stores. Everybody says I want to
buy everything online, they really don't. They like to touch, like to feel, like to be with
other people. We want to make ourselves somewhat ambivalent basically how you
shop and do it in a way that's friendly to shareholders, that's our management.
Customers are going to shop how they want to shop. We'd love them to come in the
stores because the stores have a purpose, which is -- that is the most eﬃcient way to
get goods to you and for you to get them. That is the most eﬃcient way, but it is
management's job to ﬁgure that out and to make sure that we deliver sales and
proﬁt growth -- growth like our investors expect but the customers could do the
customer wants to do, I don't think there's a Company in retail that can -- that has the
assets to do we're going to do. I don't think there is.
I'm not sure to dovetail that comment about the customer wanting to do what they
want to do in this next question, which is all out there, but I'm curious, I really want to
hear the perspective from you?

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantWe had this real press release -- press release a couple of months ago about like
coin cryptocurrency. I'm curious to hear your thoughts around can you envision the
future or Walmart allows their customers to transact in cryptocurrency? How
important do you think that even if your customers today and maybe just your
reaction to that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, I was explaining to someone yesterday that when I ﬁrst went to work in 1990 that
we were just starting to use PCs and the internet and you see what's happened in 30
years. I don't think you can sit here and rule out almost anything of what happens
ﬁve years from now, ten years from now, 20 years from now because technology is
moving so quickly. Having said that, we're always going to be concerned about
customer safety and that customers are protected in whatever we do. And I think
regulation will develop on cryptocurrency, we're big proponents of blockchain and
there're things that we do on blockchain with food safety and other things like that,
so big proponent what's going on a blockchain. I think cryptocurrency will work itself
out whether that's something that customers really want to use long-term. Again, if
customers move in a direction where -- that's what they want to do, I don't think
that's an overwhelming urge today to do that, then it's something is a retailer you
would have to go take a look at, but the world likes changing fast. Isn't it?
Yes. (inaudible) now.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We're ﬂying drones in North Arkansas to deliver packages, so it's yes the world
changes and I think as a management team, you've just really got to be open to
where the customers going and ﬁnd ways to -- within bounds obviously ﬁnd ways to
to make it work for the customer.
We're going to touch on Sam's Club and international in passing -- the passing
comment on Sam's Club is that (Multiple Speakers)
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Those are two really big businesses by the way. Yes.
I mean Sam's Club is doing just an unbelievable job.

A - M. Brett BiggsThat is showing up clearly in the results. Are they running the same playbook that
Walmart US is? If they are, how -- why is it yielding so much bigger growth results
and kind of where do you think they are in the runway of what they're doing because
it's impressive?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I spent three years at Sam's Club, business a little diﬀerent. Really is about
membership and getting -- getting members in and then getting great items at great
prices that's what you do as a warehouse club and warehouse business has been
phenomenal for a number of years COSCO has done obviously very well as well.
But Sam's really, really kind of on ﬁre, but it starts with membership, membership
counts are records, renewals are records and members are seeing the value of
coming there and whether it's our food business or what we have in general
merchandise or the way we interact with them scan and go to make it easier for them
to get in and out at the Club. And things are just really clicking. It's a great format. It's
-- it's a great business model. It's fairly easy to show customers or members, the
value proposition and our team there is just been -- just been hitting another part.
On international, can you talk about as you cut through some of the noise of
divestitures FX has turned a little bit more positively?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Next year, our numbers will be a little easier (Multiple Speakers).
How do you feel about the trajectory of that segment? What are the things you guys
are focused on in International?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
International has had a great year, really two great years in a row and as you just kind
of go around the globe as I said earlier Walmax if you've never been to Mexico and
seen our business there, it's amazing business. As we talked about the ecosystem in
the US, that's probably the business that's the closest and even some case leading
what we're doing in the US is Walmax what they're doing around their ecosystem
and their ﬂywheel phenomenal business, multi format caters to customers at all
diﬀerent economic levels, great culture. I can go on on about Walmax.
Canada has been a great business for us. It feels a little more like the US. It's more of
a Supercenter business than whereas Walmax is more multiformat, but always been a
great business for us. China continues to be a good business for us. Sam's Club is
doing incredibly well in China. The same thing you're seeing in the US with the club
business you're seeing in China, as we get more middle-income, people that want
the status of that membership you're seeing that play out in China.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantAnd Flipkart's been great. It's -- you've seen the valuation increases we had our last
round in Flipkart. PhonePe I think is going to be a crown jewel of that business that
we bought, so I'm excited not only about what they can do in India but the learnings
that we take from what they're doing. I remember my ﬁrst trip over to India. And I
said now the Flipkart and PhonePe team and there were a lot of things we were
thinking about around ﬁnancial services and apps and other things and I came back
on home and Doug has like, hey, lot of things that we think we might want to do,
those guys are already doing in India and they're just a smart, smart really well --
really well regarded management team.

Sorry didn't shut oﬀ my Apple watch.
(inaudible).
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I don't know Is that speciﬁcally, but it's again when you look at where customers
are going, and they're doing things like that and there is just more and more
discussion of the Metaverse and what's -- what's going to be the Metaverse and
there is deﬁnitely something there. You've got to ﬁgure how to how to play in that
and how to be involved in that and how to be part of the customer's lives and
whatever they're doing and that's why you've got to build out these diﬀerent
capabilities and I think one quick -- one core capability to build as a company is the
ability to be ﬂexible. And the ability to keep inventing new things because the
customers not stay static. They're less static probably than they've ever been, and
when you see things like that, you got to think about how that applies to your
business and then I'm sure there're things that we have done, whether that's
GoLocal are ﬂying drones that other competitors going, hey, we see that and we've
got a -- we've got to ﬁgure out what they're seeing about the customer that makes
someone to do that.
But it's so interesting right now. I -- we get questions all time about what with Sam
Walton have gone into e-commerce, what would Sam Walton think about this or that
and Sam was all about change in competition and learning and evolving and I think I
think Sam would love this period of time because it's so dynamic. The things that
Doug and I talked about six years ago, so diﬀerent than what we're talking about
today and you've got to build a management team that can work its way through
that evolution, which I think we have at the company.
In the eCommerce business from a proﬁtability margin management standpoint, I
think we were pre-COVID kind of heading into a time where we were going to beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

A - M. Brett Biggsseeing that margin continues to get less of a drag on the overall business, where are
we today, what has COVID done to that, I assume the acceleration of the growth rate
has helped substantially, but I'm curious kind of where we are?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, we're still seeing an increase in our contribution margin rate, which is what you
would expect to see. Again, it just gets so diﬃcult to try to break that out in a way
that's meaningful because there are so many things we're doing that apply to both
stores and e-commerce, but I like the trajectory of the business, so we basically
doubled in the last couple of years and I think we could easily double it again in the
next -- the next few. Mix is changing and evolving, that's the greatest thing that can
happen in e-commerce business as you start selling more and more home apparel
things that have higher margins, you get more penetration from third marketplace
third party, those are things that we're seeing developing in the business that as you
grow sales, help you at the bottom line to where you wanted to get to and where
we're still working the chain on that. But I feel really good about the progress and
I'm very comfortable.
Overall margins. There is a lot of sensitivity right now, just given cost inﬂation some
of your price investment commentary. When you guys think through margin versus
share type decisions, how does the external environment dictate, what you guys do,
how do you think about what's best for shareholders and balancing the short-term
versus the long term, can you talk about?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, I think it's a balance but long term you want to grow share and we are growing
share and that's what you want to do long term. But given where I said our price
gaps are I think there is no way to be very balanced about it and I think when you
look at the results in Q3 and how we got to Q4, I think we have been very balanced
about it but long term, we want to keep growing market share and that's why we
developed this ﬂywheel, why we develop this ecosystem is we want to grow share.
But I see no reason why we cannot do in a very balanced way.
Yes. Last one for me and then we'll see if any in the audience. I think about the last
ﬁve years have been so dramatic at Walmart, in terms of transformation, what do you
think we'll be talking about ﬁve years from now in terms of what the major
characterizing factor, Walmart successful then?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I know and I hope we're talking about ﬁve years from now, which is and I believe we
will, which is the changes we made ten years ago and then have continued the
changes that caused the company to continue to thrive. If you go back to decisions
that were made. I've studied these decisions and I've studied the reports when these
decisions were made and the articles that were written when we went into grocery,
and when we went into Supercenters, they weren't all kind.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-01

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - M. Brett BiggsNot everybody believed in that strategy and when you look back at it now is the
greatest -- may be greatest strategic decision ever taken in business was what we did
in Supercenter and going into food it's phenomenal. I think the management team
all knows we're -- and the -- behind us we'll have that too is where we're facing those
decisions all the time. What is it that's going to transform this company that cannot
just keeps it relevant that makes it thrive in the future. For us, it's continued to be
great in-store, great food business, but ﬁve years from now, I think we'll be talking
about a business that the ﬂywheel you've seen on paper has come to life. And we're
interacting with the customers in a much more meaningful way. We're in their lives
more than we were. We're helping them continue to save money, which will always
do but we're saving them time. We're helping them live a better life, which is our
mission. People ask us you really believe mission, that is the mission we believe it is
not just something on the wall. But just serving our mission will get us ﬁve years from
now and where I think we're going to be -- which is a -- you're still going to
recognize Walmart, but it's going to be a business I think customers will see
diﬀerently than they see today, but in a way that's great -- great for their lives, great
for us, great for our shareholders, because we just know how to serve them and I
think will serve them in a way that no other business will be able to do. That's what I
think we'll be talking about ﬁve years from now.
(inaudible).
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
That's an interesting one. Question is around whether ﬁnancial services or healthcare
will be more impactful as far as helping people live a better life? You probably want
my answer, which is I think will be both because I know things that are going on that I
feel conﬁdent about in both spaces and it depends on the individual. There are
some individuals that really need help from a ﬁnancial standpoint of how to manage
their ﬁnancial life. There are people where healthcare is a constant acute and
prolonged condition that's the most important thing in their life.
And just I think we'll be able to meet each customer where they're at, I think that's
the beauty of what we're developing is Walmart can be to each customer what it
needs to be for that customer. You asked a question earlier about how do you keep
it from being kind of average for everybody, which is kind of where the mass
merchant concept started right was you just got to stack it high and sell it, but I think
now it's much more individualized and you've got to be able to meet each customer
where they're at and whatever is important to them and I can't think of a need really
that we can't satisfy in some way.
Okay. I think that's a good place to leave it, Brett. Brett, thanks for your time
