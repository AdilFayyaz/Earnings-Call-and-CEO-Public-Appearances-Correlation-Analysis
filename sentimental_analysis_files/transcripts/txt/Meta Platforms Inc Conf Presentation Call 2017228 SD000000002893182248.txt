{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our luncheon keynote today. We are
absolutely thrilled to have Sheryl Sandberg and Dave Wehner with us from
Facebook. We have a series of disclosures I have to read ﬁrst. So we'll get through
those. But I'll be able to do it while you're opening up all your wrappers.
So please note that important disclosures, including my personal holdings
disclosures and Morgan Stanley disclosures, all appear in the handout available in
the registration area and on the Morgan Stanley public website. Some of the
statements that Sheryl and Dave will make today may be considered forward-
looking. These statements involve a number of material risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to diﬀer materially. Any forward-looking statements that
Sheryl or Dave make are based on assumptions as of today. And Facebook
undertakes no obligation to update them at all. Please refer to Facebook's Form 10-K
for a discussion of the risk factors that may aﬀect its results.
Sheryl Sandberg is the COO of Facebook. She's been there since 2008. Dave joined
Facebook in November 2012 and has served as Facebook CFO since June of 2014.
It's the fourth time we've had Facebook at the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference. And
we are so delighted to have you here. Thank you. So very much for coming. We
really appreciate it.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
Thank you for having us. You all have been good partners to us through our IPO and
beyond. So we're grateful to be here.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Thanks. So I have a series of questions, a lot of topics to cover. There's always a lot
going on with Facebook. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the real drivers of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 2 of 16A - Sheryl Sandbergbusiness. You had another great year in 2016, with meaningful revenue growth, very
good community growth, I think the fastest -- the biggest DAU growth you've had
since you're a public company. How have the drivers of the core business evolved
over the years. And as you look ahead, Sheryl, would you talk about the big drivers
of monetization you see over the next couple years?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
The drivers of our business are really the same three drivers we've had from the
beginning. And I think continue out to the future, which are: users, how many people
use our services; engagement, how engaged are they, how much time do they
spend with us, what do they do; and then on the advertising front, the transition to
mobile. So as you said, the last quarter we reported our fastest user growth we've
had since our IPO ﬁve years ago. There are now 1.86 billion people using Facebook
every month.
And what's probably more important than that, is the engagement. When I joined
Facebook there were about 70 million users. And 50% came back every day. And
that is something the Company was very focused on and very proud of. So everyone
ran around saying, 50% come back every day. But you know, I was hired to try and
think ahead. And I had a view that we should only release metrics that were likely to
go in the right direction. And we all know your early adopters are often your most
ardent adopters. So I ﬁgured as we went from 70 million to 100 million to 200
million, that number 50% would go down. So I ran around early Facebook saying,
everyone, stop saying 50% come back a day.
Everyone completely ignored me, because it's Facebook and they don't care at all
who they work for or who you are. And they kept saying 50% come back every day.
And last quarter, when we reported 1.86 billion, we had 66% of our users coming
back every day.
So as we've grown, that number has actually gone up, which is something that I was
really surprised by. But something I think we're really grateful for because it means
we're part of people's daily lives.
Then, as we have so many people using Facebook as we have this increasing and
continued engagement, that gives us the ad opportunity. And the driver of our ad
opportunity is really about the shift to mobile. And people have made that shift,
right? Everyone here has a phone. Who here checks your phone ﬁrst thing in the
morning within ten minutes of waking up? Who here checks your phone within ten
minutes before you go to sleep? And many times in the day.
So the consumer shift to mobile has happened. The driver of our growth is helping
the advertiser shift to mobile happen. And it's an incredibly powerful device. So the
phone every single person has in their pocket or their purse, has 100,000 times the
computing power of the computer that sent the ﬁrst man to the moon, in 1969, which
I like to remind people at Facebook is not really that long ago, because it's the year I
was born. But we have a Super Bowl on that device, on mobile in the US every singleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28

A - Dave Wehnerday. And so, our job is to get advertisers to make the shift, much as consumers have
made the shift.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes. And I would just add that we're just building more and more products to make it
easier for advertisers to ﬁnd the audience that they want to ﬁnd on Facebook. And
we're doing that with a lot of integrated products. Custom Audiences has been,
continues to be a big driver of growth. A good example there is General Motors,
who used custom audiences to target owners of vehicles that had On Star in them.
But they weren't currently subscribers of On Star. And they were able to then target,
they were able to take their data, bring it to Facebook, target those potential
subscribers on Facebook. And they were able to even get down to granular, who
had been a previous subscriber and had fallen oﬀ, who was untapped, hadn't been a
subscriber before. And with that, launched a very speciﬁc campaign using creative,
that targeted diﬀerent kinds of users with video and with that see a 7% lift in
subscribers for On Star. So it was a very eﬀective campaign.
And we're continuing to innovate in that way, for advertisers across a broad swath of
diﬀerent products.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
There's no other platform on which you can have a Super Bowl and get to targeting
your current subscribers to a service diﬀerently from future subscribers, diﬀerently
from people who look like your current subscribers. But it's on us. And we have a lot
of hard work ahead of us, to help advertisers make that shift. Because it's deﬁnitely
the case that consumers are ahead of marketers there.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
And the audience is there, people are checking their phones in the morning, they're
checking before they go to bed. And Dave, engagement often is a hot button topic
among investors. I guess I'd be curious to hear if you have any update on
engagement, or time spent across the platform if we think about Facebook core,
Instagram. And Messenger. And kind of where that stands now?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes. Well I'd start with just daily active users on Facebook. That continues to grow
very nicely. So you alluded to this in your introductory comments. But we added 189
million DAU year-over-year. So we're continuing to see really strong growth in just
core engaged users on Facebook itself. And we're seeing that across the globe. It's
in the US, it's also in developing markets. So you have markets like India, Indonesia,
Brazil, growing very nicely. And that's driven oﬀ of us really focusing on providing
the best possible experiences across all diﬀerent platforms, including Android, which
has been very important. It's working with partners, with Internet.org, it's working
also with other carriers who are oﬀering more free promotional data plans.
So it's really strong engagement growth in terms of daily active users. And then on
the time spent per DAU which is another metric that we work on and track, we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 4 of 16A - Brian Nowak
A - Sheryl Sandbergseeing good, solid growth across the Facebook family and on Facebook in particular.
So we're pleased with that. And Instagram also continuing to grow very nicely
especially with ranked feed [ph].
The drivers of that, Instagram ranking the feed has been helpful. And for Facebook
itself, video continues to be a very big driver of engagement for Facebook, which is
making the content richer. It's been a continuing migration over time, from text to
photos to video. And with that has come time-spent growth. And so, we're focused
on that. And we've got obviously a team dedicated to driving better engagement on
Facebook. And it's paying oﬀ.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Great. And the engagement continues to be strong. And Sheryl, you mentioned how
one of the missions is to really bring more advertisers on the platform and help them
understand how to spend. You recently said there are 65 million businesses with
pages on Facebook, 5 million using Instagram with business proﬁles. I guess I'd be
curious to know, where are you in terms of active advertisers. And as you step back
right now, what are the biggest challenges you see to bringing more SMBs on the
platform to get them spending dollars?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
I think SMBs are one of the core competitive advantages we have, because it is
incredibly hard to get SMBs online. A third of small businesses in the US, the most
advanced market, have no online presence at all, not even a web page. And it's even
harder to have a mobile app. And to get people to use your mobile app. And so,
one of the things I think that's most core to the opportunity we face, is how many
small businesses use Facebook.
And the reason they use Facebook is because they use it as people. And then they
see other businesses. And that's how really, without any direct marketing eﬀort on
our part, 65 million small businesses have business pages that are active on a
monthly basis around the world. And we have 5 million Instagram business proﬁles.
And so then, the question is, how do we upsell them to becoming advertisers? And if
anyone's ever -- which I have -- you know, driven around with a Yellow Page sales
force, what you realize is that small businesses get a lot of hand holding to make
business purchases. The Yellow Page salesperson really will walk them through it.
And so, our early value proposition is, do you want to become a Facebook
advertiser? That sounds hard, particularly if we're going to ask you to do it yourself
online.
But when we say, do you want to spend $3 to boost that post, that's easy. And that
makes you an advertiser. And as we've gotten better at making more simpliﬁed ad
products, we've onboarded more advertisers. And today we have 4 million
companies advertising on Facebook and 500,000 advertising on Instagram.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 5 of 16A - Brian Nowak
A - Sheryl SandbergThe other opportunity we have. And I think this is a really big one, is to take the kind
of tools and targeting and creative tools that only large companies really have access
to. And make them available to everyone. 3 million small businesses have uploaded
a video to Facebook. That's a pretty incredible number. Some of that is organic. Most
of that's organic, some of that's paid. But there's no way even a million businesses
have ever produced and placed a TV ad, ever.
And so, the fact that everyone has these incredibly powerful phones, where they can
just upload a video and much as we can ask you to boost your post, you can send
just a few dollars to boost that, that gives us a really big on-ramp.
I'll share a local example. There's a company called Tree Hut, they make nature-
inspired watches. They're based in San Francisco. And they used our Dynamic Ads to
target people with speciﬁc ads based on products people looked at on their
website. They then used our Custom Audiences, to use their e-mail list so we could
target their current customers. And then our Look-Alike Audience product to create
a group of customers they could serve those ads to who had similar characteristics
to their current customers. There's nowhere else small businesses have access to that
kind of targeting, that kind of creativity. They used our Shop Now button for the ﬁve
days leading up to Black Friday and they had a three-time return on ad sales.
And I know there's a lot of thought right now about the state of our nation, the state
of economic growth around the world. Small businesses aren't just core to our
business, they are core to economic growth. 63% of job growth in the United States
comes from small businesses, more than 40% around the world. And we see that in
our clients.
So Tree Hut, since they started advertising on Facebook, has hired seven people. So
at every level, from our mission to connect people to growing our own business, to
what we think of as a responsibility to play our part in economic growth around the
world, small businesses are very key to what we focus on.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Understood. Whether you're a small business or a big-branded advertiser, it really
seems like measurement and eﬃcacy of the spend continues to be a hot button
topic that's coming up in the press a lot. So let me hear about, what steps is
Facebook taking through partnerships, improving the measurement, improving
veriﬁcation, to ensure that the advertisers are really getting the best bang for their
buck?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
You're absolutely right that this has been in the press a lot. And it's really core.
Because if our goal is to grow our clients' business, to ring the cash register, gross
sales, the only way they know that their ads are eﬀective is if we have the right
measurements. We found a mistake last August in one of our video metrics. It wasn't
a billable metric. But it's still something we take really seriously. So we really did a
pretty thorough review of all of our metrics. And we updated a lot of them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 6 of 16A - Brian Nowak
A - Sheryl SandbergAnd now, we're working hard to make sure we stay at the forefront of what
measurement is. We're very focused on third-party measurement. We know
advertisers want it. It enables other people to grade our homework. And now, you
can either verify or measure all of the Facebook ad impressions you get through
third parties.
We've set up a measurement council. So we've brought measurement experts from
our clients and agencies in-house. So that they can -- not in-house like hiring them,
in-house on regular meetings -- so that they can give us real advice but remain third
parties with that perspective. We also set up a Measurement FYI channel, which is
like our Newsfeed FYI, because our metrics are going to continue to evolve. What
you should expect from us are continuing updates to our metrics, because in our
space the metrics are so new and the products are so new, we'll continue to do
better and better.
One thing that I think is really worth this audience thinking about, though, is what are
we measuring in the ad space? The advertising industry, for a very long time. And
still today, focuses on proxy metrics. You know, how many people saw an ad, how
they feel about the ad, how many people watched a video all the way through?
Those matter. But they matter because they are the best indications companies had
for a really long time of how eﬀective those ads were. What really matters is going all
the way through from the ad to the sale, whether it's online, oﬄine, whether it's a car
driving oﬀ a lot or a bottle of mouthwash moving oﬀ a shelf.
And so, where we're really focused is helping people get to outcomes
measurements. We're focusing more and more of our work, our product work, with
our advertisers on helping people pick the right outcomes. Do you want to sell a
product? Do you want to acquire a new customer? Do you want to measure your
conversion?
I think the whole industry will be improved if we can use the power of technology,
which we now have, to measure all the way through the funnel.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
I thought it was interesting on the last earnings call, you talked about how one of
your ways to ensure that the ad products are as relevant as possible is to focus on
vertical speciﬁc oﬀerings, kind of honing in on what that vertical needs. So I guess,
can you give us a couple examples of verticals where you've had success like that?
And as you span across the many diﬀerent verticals at advertisers, where do you still
see the biggest opportunities for improvement?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
So we'd like our advertising products to work in all verticals. And our growth has
been very broad-based across verticals, across regions, across large and small
advertisers. Our top verticals have been e-commerce, CPG, retail, entertainment.
And media and gaming. And we build speciﬁc products for those. I think we've had
particular success in our Dynamic Ads product, which really helps you target theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 7 of 16A - Dave Wehner
A - Brian Nowak
A - Dave Wehnerright product. And our goal is of course to show the right product to the right person
at the right time.
We are now sending those products to other verticals where we haven't done as
well. So travel. Our new dynamic ads for travel let you target ads to people based on
destinations and dates that we think you're interested in based on your behavior.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, I mean. So I think we've been hugely successful in the e-commerce space, as
Sheryl mentioned. But on the travel front that is an area that we're focused on. And I
think there's other opportunities as well if you just look at the pool of advertising
dollars out there broadly, in areas like ﬁnance, where we have a relatively low
penetration. So I think the success that we've had in e-commerce with dynamic ads I
think can translate into other areas, as well.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
And Dave, to stay on the way the platform could evolve, video seems to be an
increasing area of focus just based on the comments on the Fourth Quarter call. You
mentioned earlier, driving a lot of the engagement things. So I guess as you -- one,
as you think about investing in video, help us better understand the type of product,
the type of video content you're looking to bring to the platform. Then, can you talk
at all about the structure of the investment? Do you see it as a revenue share? Do
you see licensing arrangements? Just how do you see the content evolving on a
video perspective?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Sure. Let's just start with kind of originally what the evolution was, which was, how do
we just bring richer content to Facebook going from text, to photos, to video? We
made a decision early on to have autoplay video in feed. And that drove a lot of
engagement. And so, our focus is on, how do we take that -- how do we promote
sharing a video, how do we bring more people to Facebook to share, whether they
be people or small businesses, or professional content providers or celebrities? And
so, what we've focused on, is innovating in product. And we've launched Facebook
Live, we've got 360 videos, we've got formats like Stories on Instagram, where video
is an excellent format.
So overall we've geared a lot of our product development and innovation around
how do we make our products better with video. Then, we're also looking at, how do
we expand the type of video that gets shared on Facebook? And one of the ways
that we're looking at doing that, is through providing incentives from a business
model perspective, for professional content providers to bring content to Facebook.
And we're doing that via revenue share.
Now, we are kick starting that ecosystem with some experimental budgets to show
content creators about what can be possible on Facebook. So we're not looking to
build a massive studio. But we're looking to sort of kick start that ecosystem and
head towards a self-sustaining revenue share model. And we're going to be doingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 8 of 16A - Brian Nowak
A - Dave Wehner
A - Brian Nowakthat from a revenue perspective, with our Ad Break product, which is eﬀectively a
mid-roll type of ad product, which should work for longer-form content than what is
currently on Facebook today. Now, that's not super-long-form content. But it's not 10
second, 15-second content. It's longer than that.
So all of these things are early. We'll have to see how they develop. But we hope to
use some budget to get things started. But that's the focus is to get to a good
revenue share model with content providers.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Revenue share with the attention to content, mid-roll ads kind of coming, one last
question on the core business, Dave, is around ad load. You made some comments
over the last year or so, around kind of the thoughts on ad load on the core
Facebook product. Talk to us about how you think about ad load. And also can you
help us put perspective around pricing and kind of other drivers of the revenue, just
beyond core ad load?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Sure. Ad load, as I've kind of said in the past, there's sort of the -- there's both the
supply side of our ecosystem and the demand side. The demand side is about, how
do we make great ad products for advertisers to bring more of their dollars to
Facebook versus other places. So we're doing a lot of innovation there. And then on
the supply side, there is users, there's time spent, there's ad load. So those are the
three kind of drivers on that side.
Ad load has been a key factor in driving growth. It's a balance factor with these other
factors. But it's been a key factor in driving growth over the last several years. And
one of the things that we believe is that ad load does not have as much room to
grow necessarily going forward, as we get to mid-2017 and beyond. And for that
reason, we've been pretty transparent about that for the last few quarters, about our
expectation that ad load won't grow as quickly in the future.
Now, when we have constrained supply growth due to any factor, we'll see prices go
up. That's just the normal supply-demand mechanism in our auction system. So yes,
price will oﬀset some of that. But ad load is a factor that's been driving growth. So
we think as that becomes a less signiﬁcant factor going forward, our overall revenue
growth rates are going to come down.
Now, not surprising, given we've been growing at like a 50% compounded growth
rate for the last several years. So I don't think it's shocking that that would happen.
But it's one of the dynamics that's coming into play here.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Understood. Sheryl, moving to Instagram, oﬀ of the core, it seems like Instagram
monetization is coming at a relatively measured pace, as you explore the right ad
products, continue to innovate the overall oﬀering. I guess I'd be curious to hear,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 9 of 16A - Sheryl Sandbergwhere are you now in the monetization of Instagram relative to mother ship
Facebook?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
We're pretty excited about Instagram's monetization path. Facebook and Instagram
are we think by far the two most important mobile ad platforms out there. And there
are kind of two parts to the Instagram ad platform. There's the consumer experience.
And there's the infrastructure of the ads.
So on a consumer experience, Instagram beneﬁts from the increasing visualization of
the mobile experience. You know, when you think about what everyone here was
doing on your phone, four years ago it was text. You know, even two years ago, how
many people were really taking videos? How much were videos buﬀering? It was
harder. But as things have gotten more visual, as the photo, the ability to deliver
high-res photos increases the ability to deliver video, the visualization of Instagram is
obviously what's driven its growth. And that's a really great opportunity for
marketers. Because being able to tell your story visually is something marketers have
always loved. And so being able to do it on Instagram was a unique consumer
experience.
What that's sitting on top of, is the Facebook Ad System and that's a pretty unique
opportunity for us. So the reason Instagram was able to get to 500,000 advertisers
this quickly is, we have 4 million at Facebook. And when you come in through our ad
ﬂow, whether you're working with a direct representative or you're buying online, we
are able to sell you Facebook and Instagram and the Audience Network, with one
purchase. We're using the same targeting capabilities. We're using the same
measurement capabilities. Those things took us a really long time to build up at
Facebook. But we can plug them into Instagram and it'll take time. But one day we
will do the same with our other apps where we have time and attention.
And when you see that, what happens for marketers is, you're able to extend your
reach. So Progressive Insurance has always been a pretty active advertiser with us.
They run those pretty funny ads, if anyone's seen them, with the character, Flo. They
ran an ad for us on -- talking about how to get a quote. And they did the A/B test of
running only on Facebook. And then running on Facebook, Instagram and the
Audience Network, which was our third-party ad product. And the conversion more
than doubled by adding in Instagram and the Audience Network.
And so, that shows that even with the size of Facebook we are able to provide a lot
of incremental value. And make it highly-scalable.
Instagram is exciting not just because of the format and the creativity and our ad
system. But really the engagement we're seeing. We rolled out Instagram Stories just
ﬁve months ago. And people love it. I love it, the feedback is great from people. And
we already have 150 million people using the product. And we just started testing in
the last quarter advertising. We've been working with just 30 global advertisers. But
the feedback we're hearing both from advertisers and consumers is great. So weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 10 of 16A - Brian Nowak
A - Sheryl Sandbergthink the increased engagement, particularly around Stories, means Instagram has
pretty broad runway and a pretty clear path to how we execute against it.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Understood. Now, Stories is the latest innovation. It's great for putting together
people's daily lives, not [ph] what they're up to.
Connecting the world is a very big goal. If you step back, I'd be curious to hear how
you plan on reaching your next 100 million users, or your next billion users. And is
there anything you can share with us about diﬀerences in the way people in
emerging markets use the product? And how does that impact the ability to
monetize them in advertising?
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
We've deﬁnitely thought a lot about this, because our mission is to connect the
world. And even at 1.86 billion there's 4 billion people who aren't even online.
They're not accessible to data. And so, we know that their experience is going to be
diﬀerent. The next billion people who come online are going to have smaller
screens, lower bandwidth. They're going to likely speak languages that aren't really
that well-supported online, right now. And so, we know there's a lot of work to do.
We also know that our product development has to take that into account. Mark
started something a while ago called 2G Tuesdays internally. So for one hour on
Tuesdays, a lot of our engineering and product folks will use a 2G phone. If you use
Facebook on a 2G phone, it is a terrible experience. It loads so slowly, right? It's so
data-heavy. So video-heavy. So photo-heavy. And it's those type of product
development moves that got us to Facebook Lite. Facebook Lite is fast. It works with
low bandwidth. And we now have 200 million people using it. And importantly,
having a much better experience than they would be having.
We take the same approach to our video, to our advertising products. So video.
Video has been great, as we've said for advertising, it's part of what's really growing
on Facebook. Video does not work for a lot of the world. And for the next billion
people coming online. So our ads engineers created Slideshow. Slideshow is a
photo product that just loads and scrolls through photos really quickly. So you get a
video-like experience using -- the video is ﬁve times more bandwidth than
Slideshow.
And so, we see local advertisers all over the world who have never used video,
doing Slideshow ad campaigns. But we also see global CPG companies running the
same campaign globally. But targeting high-bandwidth phones with video and low-
bandwidth phones with slideshow.
We've also thought a lot about how we get the next billion online. The people who
aren't connected to data at all. And at its core, this is really an economic challenge.
The World Bank puts global poverty at $1.90 a day, 10% of the world lives below that
line. The implicit cost of Facebook data for the average US user, for everyone in thisFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28

A - Brian Nowakroom, is $1 a day. So that means that the developed world is -- the developing world
is living on half of what we spend on just Facebook data. So the economic challenge
is big.
So one of the things we've done, we've done a partnership in 60 countries with
carriers to provide Free Basics. And Free Basics is a way for people who otherwise
couldn't aﬀord it, to connect to data. We give them a platform of diﬀerent services.
We always include Facebook. We always include information on maternal health and
child health, often the ﬁrst time they get it. We include things like job postings,
things that will really help them. And what's interesting is, a lot of the people who are
coming online are not switching from doing things oﬄine, to online. They're doing
them for the ﬁrst time. These are people for whom they've never banked. And now
they can bank -- who don't have access to even basic maternal healthcare, who now
have access. And so, we've worked to provide Free Basics all over the world.
We're also investing in the technology. Out of that 4 billion, 1.6 billion actually have a
technological challenge where they're not living in areas where they can connect to
data. We have our Aquila airplane, which we've now done some test ﬂights on
successfully. It has the wingspan of a 737. It weighs as little as a small car. And it uses

Right, it's amazing.

You know, is it there? Of course not. But we're having some early success. And we're
prepared because it serves our mission and we think it's important in the long run
for our business to really invest behind getting more people online.
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Brian, I would touch on the fact that there is a real opportunity from a business
perspective in these markets, certainly if you take a long-term view like we do. But
even in the nearer term, I mean, in 2016, we had $4 billion revenue from Asia-Paciﬁc,
$2.5 billion from the rest-of-world. And about half of the Asia-Paciﬁc revenue is what
you would characterize as developing, emerging market. And all of rest-of-world is
what you'd characterize as emerging markets. So there's real -- we've got billion-
dollar-plus businesses in these developing markets.
So we think there's a real opportunity. If you were in 1995 saying the biggest
companies 20 years from now, half of them would be in China in the Internet, you
wouldn't have thought that. So we take a long-term view. We think there's a big
opportunity across the globe to provide value and also to build a good business.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
One of the other platforms you have that also has a billion users, Messenger. Seems
like you could build a pretty good business oﬀ of that, as well. We know that theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28

At least, we think. Dave, could you just give us an update on the monetization
potential. And how you're thinking about cadence of monetization for Messenger,
learnings from the bots. And just kind of where we are, the Messenger potential?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Sure. So I think we've got feed products now. We feel like we know how to monetize
feed products today, whether it's Facebook or Instagram. And Sheryl talked about
the great leverage we have with being able to bring ads from Facebook to
Instagram. With Messenger and with WhatsApp, we're working through the phases
that Mark has talked about. First we focused on growing the user base. And there we
have over a billion users on both of those platforms. So I think we feel like we've
done really well in terms of success there.
Second is, how do we make it an engaging platform for businesses and consumers
to interact? And we think we're making real progress. Thoughts is a good example of
that. Activision. And I think I saw Bobby in the audience at some point, I know he's on
up next -- you know, they launched a Messenger bot as part of their Call of Duty
game. And you could interact with one of the characters in Call of Duty. And by
interacting with this bot, you could also unlock new content, new missions. I think in
the ﬁrst 24 hours they had over 6 million interactions. So we're really proving that
this is a platform that can add a lot of value to enhance relationships between
businesses and consumers.
Then on top of that, we're experimenting with advertising and other types of
interactions with Messenger today. We're beginning, we're further behind with
WhatsApp but we're getting there with WhatsApp as well in terms of business-to-
consumer interaction.
So we think there's a big opportunity here. It's going to take time. It's early. We're
learning. We don't have it ﬁgured out like we do with feed-based products. We think
there's a great opportunity here given the scale of these platforms and the richness
of the interactions that you can have. And also the power that AI can bring to it for
both businesses and consumers. So big opportunity. We just have to see how it's
going to play out.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Is it -- on WhatsApp, is there a diﬀerence in the way that people interact and use
WhatsApp versus Messenger? Then, what about on the business front? How are
businesses using WhatsApp compared to how they use Messenger right now?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
I think at the core, the pedigrees of the products are diﬀerent. They started diﬀerent
graphs, right, phone graph versus your Facebook graph. So that does deﬁne how
you're interacting with people in a lot of markets where there's both used. Certain
geographies are more prevalent one or the other as well. Then, the character of the
products is diﬀerent. WhatsApp is focused on speed. It's always going to work. It'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28

A - Dave Wehnerless focused on as many features as there are in Messenger, where you see more
focus on things like, how do we innovate around the camera and get more
experiences there -- how do we make it more fun. And whimsical, at times. So I think
it depends on the character of the product.
Then, with the businesses, Messenger has a big advantage of, we've got a ton of
businesses on Facebook today. So we've got the 65 million business pages. That's a
great opportunity to leverage that scale. And bring them into the experience of, how
do you leverage messaging as a platform to interact with your consumers. People
are not doing phone calls anymore. There's a great opportunity to have really unique
interactions with your consumers. How do we also bring technology to bear, in terms
of AI, to help that work at scale? So lots of interesting stuﬀ to do there. But early.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
And we're patient, we've never rushed. We've always invested in the consumer
experience ﬁrst. We know that even with the power of the ads [ph] infrastructure that
we bring, we want that consumer experience to be right. And we're happy to
experiment kind of for as long as it takes, that we can ﬁgure that out.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Dave, on the last earnings call, you gave guidance around OpEx and CapEx. And
some would describe it as somewhat aggressive. It's quite a bit of spend, my term.
Could you just talk through, what are the main investment priorities, kind of in both
OpEx and in CapEx this year? Then maybe give us a little bit of perspective on how
you think about the budgeting. And then candidly how conservative you are in the
overall guidance process?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Well I think we're trying to call it like we see it. And what we expect to do and we're
trying to achieve. We think there's great opportunities to invest in this business. So
what we're looking at is, how do we fund those investments across a wide variety of
diﬀerent time frames. We've got -- we're focused on the core, of course there's lots
of opportunities to continue to improve Facebook, make it great for video. How do
we also -- how do we continue to scale the infrastructure? How do we build the next
generation products? There's many things to invest in. And what we've done is
increased our recruiting infrastructure, increased our footprint in terms of our
engineering oﬃces, to be able to scale globally more quickly.
So ﬁrst and foremost, we're going to see an acceleration in head count growth. So
we grew at about 34% last year. One of the drivers is going to be, we're going to see
that come up this year in terms of the speed at which we're growing headcount. So
that's one of the key drivers. Also, we're investing in non-headcount areas like R&D,
we talked about the content side. Then, other areas like marketing and the like.
Then ﬁnally, we're making a big investment in CapEx. We think that our infrastructure
is strategic for us to own it. And to operate it. And we're investing $7.5 billion across
the globe in building up data centers and all of the associated infrastructure toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-28

ROI. We've got to make sure we provide the best service to our consumers and to

{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
As part of the guidance and kind of forward commentary, you've been one of
bangers of the drum saying, we're a GAAP company, not a non-GAAP company.
Why move toward GAAP? Why is that an important message for Facebook to send
out?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Yes, I think the reality is how -- that's really just reﬂecting how we think about it as
managers. So when Sheryl and I sit down. And Mark. And we all sit down and ﬁgure
out how people are getting paid, we don't go, they're getting paid this salary. And
let's not spend any time talking about what stock comps they're getting paid. Of
course, we spend a lot of time talking about the compensation that we pay to
employees, regardless of what the form that compensation is. And the biggest
diﬀerence between GAAP and non-GAAP, in the way that it's used in the industry, is
the stock-based compensation side of things.
Now, there's some value in the non-GAAP because it can help deﬁne what the trend
is in terms of the growth rate, taking out certain eﬀects that are driven oﬀ of it. But I
don't think you can really look at what a company is doing from a proﬁtability
perspective and ignore a major factor of stock compensation.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yep, amen [ph]. On capital allocation, you have $30 billion of cash on the balance
sheet as of the end of last year. You now have a new share repurchase authorized.
Talk a little bit about, kind of capital allocation, priorities in the Company. And how
should we think about the timing of the repurchases being completed?
{BIO 2419389 <GO>}
Look, the priority for the Company is growth, making sure we've got the capital to
grow. And to expand on the opportunities that we see in front of us. So ﬁrst and
foremost, priority growth. Now, we are sitting with $29 billion in cash, we generated
over $11 billion in cash last year. So we do think there's opportunities to be
opportunistic about repurchasing shares to oﬀset dilution. And that's what the $6
billion share repurchase authorization is about. But that doesn't have any ﬁxed time
frame. And we're going to be opportunistic about executing on that.

For those of you who haven't seen it, Workplace is basically Facebook for work. You
would actually have two apps. You have your app which is your regular Facebook for
your friends and family. And one that's internal to your workplace. And it looks and
acts just like Facebook. You can have your groups, you can have a news feed, you
can share. We used Facebook internally. We've had our own version of Workplace all
along. And we think it's part of what's contributed to our success, that we are a very
collaborative culture. We use Facebook to share. So we have lots of ways people are
collaborating all day. And using Facebook to do it. And so, more and more other
companies were asking us for that. And so we built it and rolled it out.
We now have 1,000 companies using it. Some interesting examples, the government
of Singapore is using it. And what they've found is more than 80% of the people who
are on the product are using it on a very regular basis. So they're seeing much more
connectivity than they have before.
Danone, which is one of the largest CPG companies in Europe, they make Dannon
Yogurt amongst other things, they put 100,000 people on it and a third of those
people are factory workers who had no corporate IT connection or corporate e-mail
before. And they're seeing a lot of engagement.
We think the same things that keep us able to share and connect in our real lives,
keep us able to share and connect at work. And so, we're pretty excited about the
impact this can have on companies. And we're pretty excited about the feedback
we're getting.
