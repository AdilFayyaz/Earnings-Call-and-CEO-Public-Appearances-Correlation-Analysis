Presentation
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Everybody, I can't tell you how delighted I am to welcome Microsoft, very special
guest, Kirk. We will let Kirk talk about his background, what he does at Microsoft
exactly and how long he's been doing it. I'm pretty sure it's a spectacular career
progress. But I also want -- on a separate note, this is Day 3 of the conference. And
we really wanted to extend our appreciation for sticking with us over the past three
days, attending all the sessions. And it's really the best three days of my professional
life. The conference is where companies, investors and we all come together and
really splendid, splendid. I will be depressed tomorrow. Seriously, I'm on a high right
now. I'm going to be very depressed tomorrow.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
So with that out of the way, Kirk, thank you so much for attending our conference,
very much appreciate it. Can you just give us a level set as to what exactly your role
at Microsoft is? What you've been doing and what you intend to do in the future?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Great. Yes. I know. I'm still ﬁguring that out. So I run product management for our
Microsoft 365 line of products. And so that is a new oﬀering that we introduced in
the market. I'm sure we'll talk a little bit about this morning. That includes Oﬃce,
Windows, Enterprise, our Enterprise Mobility and Security suite and a whole bunch
of products associated with that. I've been at Microsoft for, gosh, since 1992. I worked
in a bunch of jobs, running engineering teams, running project management teams.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

Celebrate your 25th year there?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Well actually, I was at Amazon.com for about three years. So I'm really around 23. But
I'm close, getting close, getting close.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
And yes, please, I interrupted you as you were walking through your responsibilities.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Oh, no, that's good. So yes, we're responsible essentially for the portfolio of
products around Oﬃce, Windows, again, EMS, as we think about introducing this
new product called Microsoft 365 across our commercial segments and education
segments as well. And it's been a tremendously interesting time the last couple of
years at Microsoft and the transformation we're making to cloud. And certainly,
Oﬃce and the Microsoft 365 oﬀering over the last year are just a big part of fueling
that growth. So it's been a fantastic couple of years. Stock's at over $100, which is
pretty darn good. I haven't seen $100 in a long time so.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Seemed unthinkable 4 or ﬁve years back.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. It's been amazing.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Yes. I remember very smart clients, who will obviously be unnamed, telling me -- very
smart clients, that stock will never see $30. The company will never earn more than
$3, never. It's not like this time frame or something but...
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Satya's done an amazing job. You'd think about, gosh, can one person really have
such an impact when the company is so big and there's 100,000 employees and one
person can have a tremendous impact.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
One client who is -- again, who will be unnamed, comes up with the best acronyms
for stock symbols. And MSFT currently is Miraculous Satya Software Company.

Thank you. You know who it is. So thank you. So I know you guys made a very small
acquisition a couple of days back.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
What was that?
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Hub. And then it's got something in front of it.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
GitHub, that's right.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Oh, yes, that's right, yes. Can you tell us more -- sorry to put you on the spot. But I'm
sure you've been in the know. You've been able to digest this, speak to people at
Microsoft. What are your thoughts on this GitHub acquisition?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. So obviously, it's very fresh. It's very exciting. I think it's been reported. Satya was
super passionate about it personally, which was great. When you think about -- at
least when we think about in many ways what's fueling the growth at Microsoft and
so forth, cloud is certainly a big part of it. The reinvigoration of the developer
ecosystem is a big part of it, too. And developers is something Satya's incredibly
passionate about at the company and in large part because developers are fueling
innovation in so many parts of the industry. It's really at the center of everything,
whether it's ﬁnancial services, health care, retail, manufacturing, you name it. There
are people building technology to help move these businesses forward and
reimagine them in incredible ways.
And so at Microsoft, we want to make sure that we do everything we can to foster
that developer ecosystem. And the opportunity with GitHub was a really incredible
one, we thought, to bring together at the company. We also recognize as big an
opportunity as we see to help developers better collaborate and share technology
and bring forward, that we also have a huge responsibility in this space to continue
to maintain the open platform nature of what Git does so that any developer, any
tech, any framework that is going to remain a core part of the value proposition of
what GitHub does, the fostering and nourishing that community of developers that's
there is incredibly important to us. Then running it in many ways like we've run
LinkedIn as an independent organization. And that will be a key piece as well. So
we're really enthusiastic about it. Obviously, it's early days. But we're very, very
bullish about what it can do.

Q - Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerYes. What Shankar and I were talking about in our note in looking at the deal was we
said, ultimately, the developer base is a good on-ramp to the Microsoft Cloud. And
when they develop these applications and put it in their (inaudible) and then when
they're ready to put it in production in large-scale deployments, there is a path to the
Microsoft Cloud. Is that a possible avenue that it could synergize longer term for
Microsoft?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
There's deﬁnitely opportunity there. But I think ﬁrst and foremost, we want to really --
and similarly to how we've, I think, approached LinkedIn. We want LinkedIn to grow
in and of itself. And some of the results that you see with LinkedIn, as an example,
not to sort of switch topics or anything. But the growth just that we saw in the last
quarter, it's something like 37%. When previous to the acquisition, I think the quarter
before was like 17%. Like we want to do everything we can to drive that business
leveraging the strengths of Microsoft similarly with GitHub. If there are assets at
Microsoft that GitHub can use, that's fantastic. But I think, ﬁrst and foremost, it's
about the success of GitHub. Then over time, of course, if there's opportunities to
help on the Microsoft side, that's fantastic, too. But nourishing that developer
ecosystem, the open platform and that community is the priority for sure.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. Let's shift to your business, the Oﬃce business.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. Great.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
It's a massive business, nearly $25 billion in annual revenues, larger than many of the
independent SaaS companies. So congratulations. You have a really big SaaS
business. You have a big IaaS business. Separately, in their own stand-alone merit
base, they are the largest 5, 7 businesses in SaaS. So how important -- just level set
for us how strategically important, we all talk about Azure IaaS because of the
Amazon halo eﬀect. But talk to us about how important really Oﬃce 365 is for the
company, the strategic relevance?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. Well I think that maybe there's a couple of diﬀerent ways to look at it. I think if
you hear...
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
And can it be a continued growth business? Because there's a feeling that Oﬃce is
going to be (topped) out and then it's all like GDP growth, whatnot.

Page 5 of 18Q - Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerYes. I know. I've heard that for 15 years. It's one of those things where I think when
people look at the company at the highest level, there are 2 substantive growth
drivers. Of course, there's lots of important businesses. But the 2 biggies are really
around Azure and then Microsoft 365, which is in many ways the evolution of Oﬃce
365. And so I was talking about developers being core to the mission and value
proposition of the company, we think that productivity and collaboration is also core
to the sort of spirit and soul of what Microsoft really is. We've been in that business
for a long time. It's evolved in many, many ways. And Oﬃce is kind of at the center of
that value proposition. And so from our perspective, it couldn't be more strategic. It
couldn't be more important. And I think that it's a very interesting time in the market
right now. We are seeing in business environments this sort of new culture of work
that's been emerging over the last couple of years. And it's driven by a whole
number of shifts in terms of demographic shifts, like the millennial population
coming into the market. Something like, by 2020, more than 50% of the population
will be millennials. You've got big shifts in the market in terms of how physically work
gets done.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
And you're the other 50%?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, exactly, Gen X, I'm the lost generation. But it's actually changing really the way
people work together. The notion of teamwork and collaboration is super diﬀerent
than sort of when I was growing up in the early '90s in the workplace. The notion of
sort of the individual hero isn't as important as the success of the team and
collaboration. But I think the meta point is that, for the ﬁrst time in a while, when I go
talk to CIOs and information technology leaders in businesses, they are as interested
in serving the needs of the end user, the people in the business and getting them
engaged, giving them the tools that they want, the modern tools that they sort of
experience in their personal lives in the workplace.
And 10 years ago, it was all about security and compliance, of locking things down
and structured work. And it's amazing the pressure that this next generation of
workers is putting on to BDMs and the business leaders to have great tooling in the
workplace. And so that's creating a huge opportunity for us with Oﬃce because we
feel like we've got this sort of incredible balance of being able to solve and service
the needs of end users as they're trying to create things, as they're trying to team
and collaborate together, as they're analyzing data, working on a project, whatever it
might be. But then also have that on a platform that is secure, that is compliant, that's
got the control that folks need.
And so the interesting part here is that, when you think about the cloud transition
and sort of looping back to how you started the question or framed the question,
many of these workloads have been workloads that have moved to cloud ﬁrst. And
that's in large part why Oﬃce 365, I think, has been so successful. We've been able
to leverage the broad installed base that we have sort of in the legacy on-prem
world and bring that base to the cloud with a workload that's very, very hot for
businesses right now. And as you're suggesting, Oﬃce has done incredibly well theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

A - Kirk Koenigsbauerlast couple of years with Oﬃce 365 as the forefront, with the next big step being this
Microsoft 365 evolution, too.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
So when we look at the old Oﬃce versus the new Oﬃce 365, it's not just that Oﬃce
runs in the cloud. It's a lot more than that. So help us understand, somebody that's
deployed Oﬃce 365, what is the value they're getting out of it that they could not
get from Oﬃce 2013 or Oﬃce 2010 or Oﬃce 2007. I think we're on Oﬃce 2010.
We're still not on 365. I hope that we will get on it one day. So what is my life going
to look like when we upgrade to Oﬃce 365?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, for sure. Well ﬁrst, at the broadest level, Oﬃce 365 has a much more diverse
value proposition than many people, I think, think about. It's not just Word, Excel and
PowerPoint. It's the secure mail backend that we have with Exchange. It's sort of
document sharing and collaboration services with SharePoint and OneDrive. It is
real-time communications with Skype for Business, which we have a new product
that will essentially supersede that, that we can talk about called Microsoft Teams.
There are also a variety of new and emerging workloads as a part of it, whether it's a
product called Microsoft Stream or Power BI, they're also a part of Oﬃce 365 for
analytics and video-based content. It's a really broad set of services to help people
be creative, to help people on analytics, to help people with teamwork and
collaboration. And that's essentially the broad value proposition.
In addition to that though, we build security and compliance into the product itself.
And that's a very, very big driver, by the way, of the growth in moving to cloud and
so forth. And we can certainly talk about that. But one of the key parts of the value
proposition relative to sort of the old legacy world, one element of it is cloud
delivered. And that means a few diﬀerent things. It means that customers will be up
to date on the latest capabilities and value. And that's important because the world's
moving quickly and technology is changing and end users want to have the most
up-to-date stuﬀ as opposed to, if you were saying, you guys are on 2010 or whatever
it is. I mean, literally, that software was built in 2007, we started working on Oﬃce
2010. And now...
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
We like to test things. Sometimes it's buggy.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, exactly. But now like we're literally delivering software on a weekly basis on
mobile devices. For our corporate customers, we give them options whether they
want to consume the software on a monthly basis or in longer chunks. But essentially,
this notion of being always up to date is very, very important, again, both for end-
user value. But also just listening to the Cisco conversation a few moments ago, the
ability to be able to deliver a secure platform particularly in this world where there's
just such a vast array of diﬀerent threats. The most secure environment is in the cloud
these days. I mean, the number of security professionals that we have. We haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

A - Kirk Koenigsbauerthousands of people working on security at scale and being able to deploy that in
real-time to our customers, it's just a very powerful value proposition.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Yes. I was intrigued when you said some of the functionality included collaboration,
chat and then Teams. You said Microsoft Teams?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Microsoft Teams, yes.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Yes. We've been hearing a lot in the context of the GitHub acquisition, its implication
for Atlassian and what Atlassian does, et cetera. So I've had discussions with
investors what to make of this whole -- the space that OneDrive is a part of, which is
the whole content management, collaboration, folks like Slack and yourself, uniﬁed
communications folks like RingCentral, et cetera. And your tremendous initiatives to
get into their videoconferencing, audio conferencing market. That's a big chunk of
your SKU. How do you see those disparate functionalities playing out because we've
followed the collaboration market for about 20 years and it's really failed to
materialize in a really pretty signiﬁcant way. But what about it changes now that
maybe with Oﬃce 365 as the overarching umbrella, what are the chances that all
these things come together?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. No. It has been a space that's been around for a while. It's had many lives. And I
think the one that's quite interesting now that's really fueling it is around the notion
of messaging-based collaboration is obviously quite hot. And we can talk a little bit
about that. But essentially our value proposition to companies is, look, you need the
right tool for the right task. And so many CIOs I'll go and talk to will say, gosh, I just
want one thing. Can't one thing solve all my collaboration needs? And the reality is,
that would be nice. But it's just not really realistic. The nature of project work is so
diﬀerent. You and I could be working on a project together. Maybe it's just a
document we're working on or it could be a team of 50 or 100 people working on a
project. Projects can last a couple of days. They can last 6 weeks. They can last years.
Projects have diﬀerent centers of gravity. Some are very task-based. Some are
document outputs. Some are about innovation and creating new products. So it's a
very broad space and people like to work diﬀerently it turns out, too.
So our approach has been to deliver with Oﬃce 365 this notion of the universal
toolkit. So what we mean by that is, we have a variety of diﬀerent tools for the right
type of collaboration project or the culture of a team in terms of how they want to
adopt a particular project. So for example, you referenced SharePoint and OneDrive.
When people want to work on documents with Oﬃce, SharePoint, OneDrive, the
Oﬃce applications, making those work incredibly well together to do things like real-
time collaboration to have sort of seamless workﬂow to make it easy for you and I to
share documents together, to be able to track changes and see what's happening.
That's a very important collaboration experience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

Q - Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
A - Kirk Koenigsbauer
Q - Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerThere's other important parts you mentioned. Uniﬁed communications is really key.
We see a tremendous amount of growth of our Skype for Business Online service
today, whether it's using instant messaging workload, meetings and collaboration,
voice. You talk about the total addressable market or the TAM of some of these
spaces. Voice services is a very, very large one, particularly when you think about
add-on services like PSTN services and so forth. And so we've been investing deeply
in that area for a long time. And that is really coming together quite nicely.
Then in this notion of sort of chat-based experiences, we built this product called
Microsoft Teams. We think of Teams as essentially a hub for teamwork, which in many
ways has the value proposition you're talking about of bringing it together all in one
very uniﬁed approach. And Teams absolutely has messaging capabilities. It's
threaded, persistent chat, like a lot of the diﬀerent services that are out there. But
what we've done, sort of the magic of that product is the fact that we're integrating
these Oﬃce services directly into it. And so if you pop open the Teams environment,
if you see it, you'll see that Word, Excel and PowerPoint are integrated beautifully
into it, like Microsoft OneNote is integrated into it. Power BI is integrated into it. As
well as now we are adding our uniﬁed communication services. So things like...
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Videoconferencing.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Videoconferencing is a part of it now. You can make a phone call from Teams. You
can set up structured meetings or schedule meetings as well as ad hoc meetings.
And that canvas or that scaﬀolding that we have with Teams is one of the reasons
why...
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Integrates with calendar.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Integrates with your calendar. You can have a Team calendar associated with it and...
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
And it's got AI built-in.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
And there's a lot of opportunity for AI across all of Oﬃce 365. But communications is
one of them. We talk about a value proposition of intelligent communications. For
example, one scenario we just talked about at the Enterprise Connect conference a
couple of months ago, I guess, now is setting up a three or four-way phone call. For
most humans, that's actually tricky to do, like how do you -- which buttons do you
press on your phone? Now you literally, with Teams, can speak into the Teams UI,
whether it's on your phone or in the shell and you can say, hey, let's set up a callFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

Yes. I've been telling a lot of people during these presentations that I've not set up
my voicemail on my desk phone from eight years back because instructions came in
a manual. I said, no way. I still don't know why the whole world of communications
has not moved to cell phone, running your capabilities on.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
There's deﬁnitely a big transition. I go to businesses, I see fewer and fewer desk

{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
I know that one of the salient aspects of the Oﬃce business has been that revenue
growth has been outstripping unit growth. So presumably, there's a lot of upsell
that's going on. Can you help us understand where are we in this whole E3 cycle?
And from the E3 to E5 upgrade cycle, what are the things that we should be looking
for? And what does an enterprise that has deployed E5, what are the business
beneﬁts? And what does their life look like, particularly maybe Microsoft has already
deployed E5 internally.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Oh, yes, for sure. Well gosh, there's a lot in that question. Let me sort of unpack it a
little bit. So at the broadest level, it's obviously a big business, as you referenced. It's
complex. There's a bunch of diﬀerent workloads. But the business model is relatively
simple. It's basically a P x Q business model. We want to get as many sockets as we
possibly can. That for us...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

A - Kirk Koenigsbauer{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
I'm glad you said that because I thought I was missing something. P x Q, that totally
resonates.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Super simple, Econ 101. And so we want to drive as many subscribers as we possibly
can. We see a tremendous amount of opportunity to continue to have overall
installed base expansion of, broadly speaking, the Oﬃce set of workloads. We still
see growth in the sort of mid; to high single digits, which is fantastic for a business
that has as many sockets as it already has. And I'm talking commercial at this point.
And we see opportunities in places like SMB, which is tremendously
underpenetrated in terms of what the opportunity looks like ahead. We see
opportunity in this category of workers called ﬁrst-line workers. Oﬃce has
traditionally gone after the knowledge worker, information worker market. The
people in this room, essentially, people that work on PCs that have particular focus
for higher needs. But then there's a whole class of workers that we feel like the cloud
economics can allow us to target. So for example, whether it's hospitality workers,
retail professionals, whether it's ﬂight attendants, health care professionals that don't
necessarily sit in front of a PC all day. But absolutely have the needs for scheduling,
for collaboration, for task management and so forth. And that we see as a big socket
opportunity for us as well.
I'd also say emerging markets for us is an interesting opportunity, particularly as we
think about mobile-ﬁrst, mobile-only markets. We've traditionally targeted PC-centric
parts of the business. But we think emerging markets has a tremendous potential as
well. Then the second part of that is, of course, not just getting the sockets. But then
driving as much ARPU as we possibly can, balancing the share need. Obviously, you
don't want to go too far on ARPU because that can impact your share. And so we
spend a lot of time thinking about those models.
To your question on where are we on the ARPU side, we continue to see ARPU
growth, which has been fantastic to see. A big part of that is the transition from on-
prem to cloud. We view that as a part of the P equation in the sense that we have
higher LTV from our customers. We're able to deliver more services to them. Of
course, there's margin on top of the services that we're delivering as well. And that's
fantastic. We still have -- and then there's customers that have sort of purchased our
online services that we're moving up to higher tiers. We have roughly 40% of our
base still not on E3 and above. And so there's still a tremendous opportunity to
move from the sort of E1 and stand-alone workloads of, say, the SharePoint or
Exchange to move to E3. That's a big part of the ARPU mix. In fact, that's frankly the
biggest part right now of the mix because there's just such tremendous opportunity
there. Then as you referenced, there's this thing called E5. E5 is the highest tier of
our service for folks that aren't sort of steeped on it. And E5 has a value proposition
around, well, some of these voice services that we talked about around
communications, analytics services, things like Power BI and some sort of...FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

Does it have Teams, Microsoft Teams?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Microsoft Teams is in the E3-oriented services today or some of the services, actually
E1 and E3, depending on what it looks like. Some of those services though for calling
will be in the E5 tier for sure. Then security and compliance are both big drivers of
the E5 value proposition, whether it's sort of threat intelligence, ATP-type services.
But also compliance with GDPR has been a really big push. I would say that the
world was sort of slow in realizing that this isn't just something that's going to aﬀect
European companies. And so particularly in the last 6 to nine months, we've seen big
markets like the U.S. wake up to GDPR. But we see -- E5 is about -- we're about three
years into the journey on E5. And it's a big factor of ARPU shift as well. But we see a
tremendous amount of opportunity going forward.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Is there any resistance to -- for customers to upgrade to E5? What do you usually
hear, oh, it's pricey or I don't need the functionality or I'm not ready for it or maybe
there's no resistance at all, it's just the issue of educating the customer base.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Well I could say there's no resistance at all. But I think we've been somewhat -- a bit
of an old dog who's been on this journey a while with these P x Q businesses. When
you introduce these next tiers of service, whether it's, geez, the Oﬃce client going
from standard to enterprise or Oﬃce 365 introducing E3, E4, the E5 shift or this
Microsoft 365 shift which has E3 and E5 components as well. There's always an
inﬂection point where you really begin to see hockey stick part of that growth. And I
think we're still sort of moving up the curve on the E5 side for sure. But the value
proposition around, I would say -- it depends on the customer because we serve so
many diﬀerent customers. Security and compliance for sure are the top workloads
that are really driving that E5 value proposition right now. In fact, it's very diﬃcult for
me to go visit a customer and not talk about security, not talk about compliance. And
there's a lot of fragmentation in that market. We build our security and compliance
capabilities right into the product so that's a bit of a unique value proposition. We
talked a little bit about AI earlier. That's a key piece of it as well. And that's something
that customers are looking to deploy right away right now and the sales cycles on
those are faster than, say, the sales cycles on something like voice, where ripping out
a PBX and putting in new cloud-based software, that has the longest sales cycle.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
What's wrong with that?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. Well it comes to like when companies are building new buildings, that's a really
natural time or when their contract comes up. And some of these contracts are 6-, 7-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

dynamics are a little bit diﬀerent across the workloads. But if you've studied the math
on it, we oﬀer relatively sizable discounts on E5, over buying the component stand-
alone. So there's absolutely an economic value proposition even if customers aren't
interested in deploying right now a particular workload or even a couple of
workloads. There's a tipping point where they'll say like, okay, shoot. Maybe I'm not
ready to do voice. But I want your analytics capabilities, I want your compliance
capabilities and your security stuﬀ, let's just go with E5. And that, we're seeing a lot
of that.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. Got it. Yammer several years back, has that made its way into Team or is Team
a complete rewrite of what exists with Yammer?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, I know. Yammer's been a great acquisition for us. It's a part of that universal
toolkit that I referenced in terms of the right tool for the right task. If we think about
something like, well, the scenarios we walked through. We talked about document
collaboration. We talked about Teams and teams of people working together.
Yammer is another interesting part of the value proposition and one that I would say
has gotten new life breathed into it over the last couple of years as CEOs and
leaders of big parts of companies want to be able to get more in touch with
employees in the organization. And so they want to be able to have a broad-based
communication and a discussion essentially in an organization. And so we think
about Yammer as that sort of outer loop of communication that, again, would be
used for more community-oriented purposes. So for example, Microsoft, Satya reads
a community, a Yammer community. He looks at it. I think he looks at it every day.
And any employee can post any question on it. And he responds directly or he'll
delegate it to one of his directs. Maybe if it's a legal question, he'll have Brad...
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
A bot.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, exactly. There's no bots on it right now. But you could have a bot on it, I guess.
The idea is to foster that employee connection. But Yammer's done quite well
because businesses are really interested in having that vehicle to be able to talk
broadly to the organization and have that dialogue, which is really, really diﬀerent if
there's just a small group of us working together on a project. And so we've been
quite pleased. We have done a bunch of work on Yammer over the last couple of
years. Some of that work is showing up as end-user value. Some of it is infrastructure
work in terms of integrating some of the core capabilities around, oh, gosh, group
technology to make it integrate easily into -- whether it's Outlook or Teams, whether
it's doing things like compliance capability, security capability, all that, single sign-on
with the rest of the Oﬃce 365 services. There's a bunch of integration work that
we've done, too. But a lot of great energy, a lot of great value on mobile devices, of
course, very, very key. Some are core -- we're pleased with it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

It's very diﬀerent looking product and value proposition, a lot of innovation that has
been introduced in the product.
At this juncture, if anybody has a question, just raise your hand. We'll get the mic
over to you, just checking to see. I know Shankar on my team deﬁnitely has a
question or 2. You have a question, right? Okay. You can shout. I'll paraphrase your
question. You can ask. Don't be shy. Putting him on the spot. I do this.
{BIO 21876475 <GO>}
Really? (inaudible) Maybe a question on the Enterprise Mobility Suite. And you
talked about the installed base, experimental users (inaudible). Can you talk about
how that's trending and how the growth rate -- projected growth rate you see for
next year, kind of the puts and takes around that?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. So for the room, just I don't know if everybody heard the question around
Enterprise Mobility and Security. It is a big part of Microsoft 365. It's a big part of our
business all up. It's seen tremendous growth. Installed base of -- (inaudible)
Referenced, we publicly quoted about 65 million, which is great. It grew 55% year-
over-year. So the growth is incredibly strong for EMS. EMS has a bunch of diﬀerent
workloads. It's almost a suite of products similar to, say, Oﬃce 365.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Can you tell us what exactly EMS is?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. I ﬁgured I could do that. It's got an identity component. So folks who've thought
about active directory or Azure Active Directory, that's a key part of it. Identity is very,
very core to not just workloads like Oﬃce and Microsoft 365. But they're applicable
to many businesses that need to set up an identity system. Security has moved to
identity. It's no longer the sort of perimeter-based or even for that matter hardware-
oriented. It's literally the notion of identity is so core and so essential to security. So
that workload is a huge driver of the growth in and of itself, which is great. There are
also security and compliance components that are part of EMS, too. There is, for
example, Azure -- we just launched with Azure Active Directory an advanced threat
protection set of capabilities is one example. Just went to (GA) in the March time
frame. There are compliance capabilities as well, Azure Information Protection. So in
other words, providing services to help things like data loss, data leakage protection
of documents or whatever it might be.
Then the other important component of it is managing devices. And so we talk
about modern management with EMS with a service that we have called Intune,
which can manage devices of all varieties and ﬂavors, including on iOS and on
Android. It has capabilities around things like conditional access and so forth. So itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

A - Kirk Koenigsbauerreally is a suite that's around identity, that's around device management, that's
around security and compliance. And its business model is one again that the
product is sold separately. But also has a very, very natural attach motion to Oﬃce
365. And it's one of the reasons why we decided as we launched Microsoft 365 to
bake not only Oﬃce plus Windows Enterprise. But also the EMS suite into it. And so
you're seeing us do a lot of integration work to make that a really sort of seamless
experience for customers. And it's a big growth driver for us for sure.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
So by calling it 365, we are denied our vacation? Just trying to be funny.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
This is your 28th one of these?
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Exactly. Like if it's Europe, got to be Microsoft 340.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
The U.S., Microsoft 375, overworked. I'm curious to get your thoughts on -- there was
a reorg done at the end of March. What was the rationale for it? And how do things
look now post the reorg, objectives?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, for sure. Yes. We did do -- it was a pretty substantive reorg internally. I don't
know if people really care in the outside world. But it was a big deal internally in the
sense of we moved...
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
If it's a big deal internally, it is a big deal.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
All right. Got it. I see. Now essentially, when we think about sort of advancing our
cloud and platform aspirations broadly, whether it's on the platform and IaaS side or
if it's on the SaaS side more, as I mentioned earlier, Azure and Microsoft 365 are sort
of the hero products for the company right now. Obviously, there's many other
products. But those are key drivers for us. And we created essentially 2 centers of
gravity for core engineering at the company.
And one is led by Rajesh Jha. And he runs what's called the Experiences and
Devices Group, of which I'm a big part of. And that's all about sort of bringing the
product and product ethos and the experiences of this sort of end-user valueFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Kirk Koenigsbauerproposition that we've been talking a little bit about this morning together. And so
it's the Oﬃce components, it's the Windows shell and the Windows experience
components. There are components of EMS as we talked about. There are also
device experiences from our Surface line of products, whether it's big hub devices or
the Surface -- the new Surface laptop or Surface Book, whatever it might be. And it's
really bringing that whole notion of the experiences together with the devices in one
organization. So that's one big part of it.
The other part of it is, of course, the cloud and AI part of the company. Think about
that as bringing together all the assets on the platform side and pushing that
forward. Again, the GitHub acquisition is sort of important from that perspective as
well. It is sort of the center of gravity about how we think about developers and the
infrastructure.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
You guys like San Francisco.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes. I like San Francisco.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
The last 2 acquisitions, the most valuable ones have been in San Francisco.
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
That's interesting to say. Yes. And so that creates a nice center of gravity there. Those
2 big engineering orgs absolutely work very closely together. For example, we're
talking about EMS. Parts of EMS are built in the cloud and AI group, parts of it are
built in the E&D group. And so we have a lot of those kinds of experiences. And
that's important. So it's not like we're going back to the old days of divisions or
anything along those lines. It's still a functionally aligned company. But these 2
centers of gravity will really help us accelerate the ambitions on the cloud side. And I
think that's the genesis really.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
I think you mentioned -- oh, yes, there's a question. (Nadi), can you get the mic over
the center table.
Just going back for a moment to the discussion about Oﬃce P x Q. When you think
about the 3-year time horizon, I guess, 2 questions. One, do you think the mid; to
high single growth in units is sustainable over that time horizon? Then secondly, if
you had to force rank the growth that you think you'll get from units versus pricing,
which one is sort of the bigger driver over that, over that period?

Page 16 of 18Q - Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
A - Kirk KoenigsbauerYes. Interesting. So on the ﬁrst question, we do anticipate that we'll be able to
continue to grow our installed base in this sort of range that we've been in. I think
that's a huge opportunity for us. And I talked about some of the drivers of where we
think some of that growth will come from. Obviously, there's still some room in the
large commercial space and public sector space. But a lot of it will come from these
new categories or opportunities that we have around these ﬁrst-line workers, in SMB
and we think emerging markets and so forth.
Then on the ARPU side, again, we continue to have, we feel, a lot of opportunity in
that on-prem to cloud shift and shift from E1 stand-alone workloads to E3 will
probably be the big driver for us. Then we continue to be quite bullish about the E5
potential in this year, in particular are beginning to see real strength in compliance
and security. And we talked a little bit about Teams. We talked a little bit about Skype
for Business. The voice and communication space, we also see quite a bit of
opportunity going forward.
In terms of dividing out what percentage will come from where, we're not sharing
that level of detail here. But I think we have opportunity in both P and in Q to
continue to drive the business. With these per-user businesses, there is, of course, as
you drive further sockets out, you do get to some big numbers. And so will the
growth rates be exactly what they are now 3 to ﬁve years from now? Of course, that's
going to look a little bit diﬀerent. But again, the ARPU growth opportunity that we
have is, we think, quite substantive.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Any other question? I just had one ﬁnal question/observation. I think you mentioned
the word Windows once in this whole talk. What's happening with Windows? Tell us
about Windows. I mean, we hear a lot about Oﬃce 365, Azure. But anything to say,
anything to say?
{BIO 5905758 <GO>}
Yes, for sure. So I've been talking a little bit about Microsoft 365. And I think that's --
we really, in fact, it's interesting to take a step back. The hero that we're really driving
right now when we think about our productivity and collaboration experiences is
Microsoft 365. And Microsoft 365 is Oﬃce. You've asked me a bunch of Oﬃce
questions, which is great, love it, take it any day. But Windows is a core part of that
and moving people to the Windows enterprise SKUs as well as EMS. And Windows
remains as important as ever in terms of delivering a rich endpoint experience on PC
devices and increasingly on diﬀerent types of devices like Surface Hub and so forth.
We're doing quite a bit of work between the Oﬃce and the Windows engineering
teams to make sure that we have a much more, I guess, I would call it coherent, well
integrated, symmetrical set of experiences as people are using the Windows shell
and are using Oﬃce-oriented experiences on those devices.
Rajesh now in his leadership team, there's Windows leaders and Oﬃce leaders
sitting together and working on the same problems and so forth. So this
reorganization, I think, is actually so important for the Windows business and the
Oﬃce business in that it brings these teams together in a way that Satya's really beenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-06-07

Windows business, there is no Oﬃce business, there's Microsoft 365. And that's the
sort of push that he's really driving for. It's not just this marketing bundle that we
ginned up. We've reorganized the sales force. We've reorganized our engineering
teams. We are leading with Microsoft 365 as our hero experience. We didn't talk
much about it. It's growing triple digits in terms of seats. It is the direction that we're
moving in. And Windows is absolutely fundamental to the value proposition of
Microsoft 365.

On this note, I want to thank you all for sticking with us for three days. This is going
to be the third day. And we're going to be wrapping it up in a few hours from now.
Special call out to folks that made the trip from Australia, Singapore, Japan. Had one
gentleman that took a direct ﬂight from Zurich, 12-hour nonstop. Another person that
made a 16-hour trip from Singapore. So we really appreciate your support of the
conference. And we heard the feedback last year that if it's just two days, it's not
really worth it to ﬂy all the way over. So we added more companies, extended the
format, made it three days. Hopefully, next time, it will be a 4-day conference at
some point in the future.
There's so many companies that we're creating in tech, creating in software. You look
at the pipeline. Kirk, we had yesterday 4 companies, private companies in
DevOps/whatever you want to call it, infrastructure. They're all $100-plus million in
revenue, growing 100%. So 2, three years from now, they're all going to be public.
And you guys are going to be spending, hopefully, 3, four days with us. A lot of
those companies will be software. So really appreciate your support. Again, I'm
going to be very depressed tomorrow after this high getting it from this conference.
Kirk, thank you very much for taking the time to present, really appreciate your time.
