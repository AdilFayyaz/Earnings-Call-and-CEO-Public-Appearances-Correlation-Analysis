I believe we're live. If so, well, hello and welcome to dbAccess Global Consumer
Conference. It's day one of day four -- of a four-day event, and I really hope everyone
has a great set of meetings this week and, certainly, the least amount of tech issues.
I'm still certainly myself trying to get my video centered. I'm Paul Trussel, the DB US
retail analyst. And to kick things oﬀ, I'm delighted to be hosting Judith McKenna, the
President and CEO of Walmart International. Thank you, Judith, for being with us
today.
For those that don't know Judith as well, she's a Walmart veteran, today responsible
for all of Walmart's footprint outside of the US, which spans I believe 23 countries.
Prior to leading Walmart International, she served as EVP and COO of Walmart US,
where she played a major role in the company's online grocery strategy, leveraging
her insights and experience from numerous leadership roles for Asda in the UK.
Judith is also on the board of Flipkart and PhonePe in India, which we will certainly
dig into as well during this conversation. And in terms of format, I will host Q&A with
Judith and we will work as much as we can into about a 30 minute session, all right?
So, a little bit truncated, but we'll get through as much as we can. And certainly, I'll
keep an eye out on the Q&A. Feel free to put into the chat questions, just so we
know that we're hitting the priorities.
With that, we're going to go ahead and get started, and we're going to put up a
slide quickly as Walmart has provided a forward-looking statement, on this slide, for
you to take a view.
And let's jump right in. Judith, how are you?

wish we could be in person, but not today for some time, but -- and a warm welcome
to everybody who tuned in as well.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Absolutely. So, Judith, let's maybe start a little bit bigger picture. One of the more
notable changes over the past few years is just the speed in which Walmart has been
moving, really playing a lot of oﬀense as supposed to maybe a more for defensive
stance. Just discuss some of these key changes that you and the management team
have been taken action on and what allows you to be as nimble of an organization as
you are, just given your size. And also with that, how do you think about making
investments versus really showcasing to shareholders improvements in proﬁtability?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah, and I think nimble is a really good word for it actually, and probably not what
people expect from a business of our scale. And we've been working hard not only
to make sure the foundations of the business are strong, but as you've said really
becoming much more innovative and totally customer-centric in the way we think
end-to-end from a business perspective. And -- but you reckon it completely and you
know it well, Paul.
And going back to the days of Sam Walton, he was ultimately an innovator, I could
say, because whether it be supercenters, Retail Link, satellite communication, they've
always been things that Walmart has done and done well. Everything we've done
has been successful I'll remind you. But actually, the whole ability to test and trial and
learn and innovate and be prepared to invest in order to be able to do that is huge.
As I look and I think about the journey for the US and I think about the journey for all
of our international market, there's probably three things that stand out to me. They
are the recipe if you like -- the ingredients to be able to be successful in an
innovation space. The ﬁrst is you've got to be customer-centric. And I think the
events over the last 14, 15 months have made us more customer-centric than we've
ever been before. We're using data to understand more. We're using better insights
to really stay on the front foot.
The second one I'd say is you've got to be inquisitive and out-turned about new
technology and uses for a technology and ﬁgure out what problems you're trying to
solve, rather than how can I use this to do something. And I think we've got way
better at that over the years as well.
And then, ﬁnally, the environment that I think that Doug and the entire leadership
team are creating is a place where the right talent and the right capabilities reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 10Q - Paul Trussell
A - Judith McKennawants to come and work. So, if you look at some of the folks that we have now in our
leadership team, people like Suresh Kumar, who is our Chief Development and
Technology Oﬃcer, is a phenomenal add to the organization that brings a breadth of
knowledge and a tech base that we wouldn't have had before.
And as we think about those investments, you asked me about sort of shareholder
versus the business and what do you think about it. The two are mutually exclusive
and if you think about one of the areas we're probably becoming well known for,
and it's been fascinating to watch this journey, which is automation. Yes, it takes
investment to get automation into the business. But ultimately, it pays massive
dividends, improves your customer service because you can pick more eﬃciency,
your accuracy is better, but equally a good productivity beneﬁt for you as well.
So, I don't see this kind of move to innovation as being an either-or between
investment and shareholders. And I'm sure we'll talk about it. There's lots of levers
that we can pull out scale allows us to do. And as we connect the businesses
together more, the ﬂywheel you hear us talk about all the time, that really help
beneﬁt how we can pull those diﬀerent leavers, so that in sometimes we're investing,
in some places, we're reaping the rewards of those investments, and you try to get it
into this virtuous circle and the beneﬁts that we bode, right?
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
Absolutely. Thank you for that. So, let's talk about the evolution of the international
business. I mean, you have had a number of transactions recently, Judith, and we'd
love to hear more about your thought process around the sale of Argentina and UK
and Japan. Help us understand the rationale and how that's going to impact the P&L
going forward? Any other -- just help around how you think about where you want to
be doing business in overall footprint?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah. And so, I came into this job 3.5 years ago. And I didn't [ph] originally assume in
International. I've been at this for 17 years to just be into [ph] international as Head of
strategy. And at the time, I think we've started to come up with this very clear
strategy phrase, which we need to be in strong local businesses that are powered by
Walmart, which means that each business needs to be strong, have a long-term
sustainable growth in the market in which we operate. But we'll use that scale and
capabilities to make that happen and to join the lots of people around the world,
best practice sharing, tech, whatever that looks like.
The other elements of that that became clear is if you'd asked me ﬁve, 10 years ago,
I'd have said that we were -- we always wanted to be in control of businesses. We
wanted to own businesses and operate them. And I think we ﬂex that over time, so
we became much more nimble, again to use your word from earlier, about the way
that we think we can operate, and we were way less worried about being a 100%
owner of something.
Join those two things together and whilst international has been a phenomenal
business, we went through diﬀerent phases of its history and it's been cashFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10Q - Paul Trussell
A - Judith McKennagenerative for the company overall. What was clear was some of those markets, and
maybe I'll use the UK as the prime example of that, it is very close to my heart as you
well know, which is we knew that business would need increased capital investment,
it would need a diﬀerent way of doing things and a diﬀerent way of working.
And if you look at the business of Walmart overall and, say, the investment we need
to make into Walmart US, in Mexico, in India, you can't do everything. So, we ﬁgured
that we would make some smart choices about changing our ownership structures
and going into minority. So, we did Brazil two years ago. We since done Argentina,
Japan. And now, we've done Asda as well. And what I'll tell you in the mix of that
from a thought process perspective is that I think we still have a lot to gain from the
way we structure those transaction and that's two fold.
If you think about Japan, Seiyu in Japan is probably a good one, that's now a
combination of KKR if you've got might just some private equity thinking into a
business, Rakuten, one of the most forward-thinking digital businesses in Asia, and
Walmart and our experience particularly in grocery home shopping. Combine those
together and, actually, we stand to learn a lot from the way that is operating a board
of (inaudible), so I don't think when you think about this, we should think about as
we've just walked away from market. We're actually setting a stretch where we can
learn more eﬀectively. But there's no doubt today that we operate actually in markets
with good growth opportunity.
If you think about India, which I know we're going to talk about as well, because I
never get to do one of these without talking about India. The culture is great. But
also Mexico, which is -- it's a phenomenal business with huge growth potential still
and really strong returns for it too. So, I think excited about where we do operate,
anxious and keen to get the learnings from the divestments. And there is one of the
things that is letting us do, Paul, which is we are providing global sourcing services to
Brazil, Argentina, even though we sold a 100% stake, Japan and the UK. That is
allowing us to start commercialize our global sourcing platform and we will learn
from that, because now we have external parties that are buying from that.
But when I think about the changes that we've made, it's easy to say we've got
smaller and we have. There's $35 billion top-line impact from the divestments this
year, which we disclosed in Q1. But we can also see ways to grow in the future too.
And I think some of those services may allow us to have a diﬀerent footprint
internationally in the future.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
So, you really just hit on this, right? You obviously are pressing forward in a number
of markets that have a lot of growth potential. Maybe just let's follow up and dig a
little bit deeper as you think about these big markets, Walmex, Canada, China, India,
how do you think about capital allocation between those markets? And also, where
do you see the largest opportunities for growth as well not just on the top-line
though, but also proﬁtability upside?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 10Yeah. So, everything we do is measured by how do we create these strong local
businesses, which are powered by Walmart, and I will keep saying it because it's
such a good way to sum up what we do and the way that we think in international,
which means that no diﬀerent to what you've heard us talk about for the US in our Q1
results. We will continue to invest where it matters and where we can invest in the
customers, creating some productivity and invest in new proﬁt areas and new proﬁt
sources future as well.
It might be easier and simple for me to give you a quick thumbnail on each of those
markets that you've mentioned. Because sometime as we think about international
being a hole, well, in fact that strong local business is a series of individual market
strategies, which add up into that hole. As we think about capital allocation, I also
think a bit like investor. There's no pure science to this. It's a bit of art as well as you
think about what you need to invest and when. But China, clearly, our Sam's Club
business there is incredibly strong, double-digit growth has been reported for the
last number of quarters and we're looking to accelerate that business.
Hypermarket, more like the supercenters in the US, and we are going through a
transformation process for them. They were impacted by COVID and fruitful [ph] to
them, and I think ﬁguring out for them what the right format is for the future,
particularly focusing on our general merchandise oﬀers. And the reason that's
important is kind of the third element I think for China, which is O-to-O, online to
oﬄine, probably the most advanced market in the world for this. We've learned a
stack from them about how to deliver fast, what you need to do. But both for Sam's
and for the Hypermarket business, the capability to do online to oﬄine, those
formats, those physical formats give us the anchor to be able to do that. So, that's
the China.
Canada, this is one of our strongest returning businesses, great business, really
strong. Omni-channel really is a way to go for that in a core remodel program to help
support that as well. And Mexico and India, I could talk about all day (inaudible) and
the two things that are common for Mexico and India is that they are for access and
they oﬀer value to people right across the country in which they operate. Mexico all
of the international markets is probably the one that's most customer-centric in the
way that it's thinking about an end-to-end transformation of its business to be way
more connected.
It's just launched something which is called, BAIT, which is Bodega Aurrera Internet
and Telephony but in Spanish, which my Spanish is terrible, I've done it in English,
which is a way to give internet access to people and data access to people that
wouldn't normally be able to aﬀord it. So, that helps drive their ﬂywheel. And when
you look at the US's ﬂywheel and you look at Mexico's ﬂywheel, whether it's stages
of development that actually quite similar in the way that they're all building on each
other and putting the customer at the middle of it.
And then of course, we go India, so Flipkart and PhonePe businesses both really
strong, both doing well. I'm really pleased with what they've done since we acquired
them. We've said that clearly N number of time. And you asked me aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Q - Paul Trussell
A - Judith McKennaproﬁtability and what that looks like too. And what I would tell you is that we want all
of our businesses ultimately to be proﬁtable. Clearly, that's one of the reasons we're
in business, but we also recognize that everybody's on a diﬀerent curve and we will
invest where it matters to make sure that particularly in developing market we're
getting in the right place in that curve and that with meeting customers where they
need us to be, so that we're bringing them into the ecosystem.
Sometimes that does need some investment and might make that curve a little
longer, because once we've got it in place, we can really double down on things like
AdTech and ﬁnancial services to people, which are these proﬁt streams that can ﬂow
into.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
So, let's stay with India and Flipkart. How -- where is Flipkart on that proﬁtability
curve that you just spoke to, especially relative to when you made the acquisition?
What should we know regarding the impact to the business from some -- of what's
happened over the past, few months with lockdowns and other aspects? And what
also can you tell us if anything around a potential IPO for Flipkart?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah. That's my number one asked question on the IPO for Flipkart, so I'm going to
tell you that my the answer that I give to everybody, which is that we always made it
clear from the day we made the acquisition of the investment that we would be open
to an IPO, but we've also been really clear we'll do it at the time that's right for the
business. It's not an output. It's not a target for us to do that. But if we build a strong
business and we continue to do the things that we need to do to ensure there's
long-term and sustainable growth, that is a possible route that we would consider in
the future, but certainly no speciﬁc timeline on that.
And proﬁtability-wise, I think we talked about that. What we're interested in for
Flipkart and we're learning a lot about is whilst their core business that changing
their mix there to be -- to double down on the higher margin areas such as fashion,
for example, which really helps their margin mix and their contribution margin,
they're also doing a really nice job of building up our tech business there too. And I
think what we've seen there is strong growth and the connectivity that that gives
them.
One of the investment areas through that we're making against that is in the
wholesale business, which is serving the small, medium-sized businesses, some of
them -- people may not (inaudible) in India and providing services to them on a
business-to-business basis, but then also you have a nascent grocery business. The
grocery penetration in India is massively low, accelerated through COVID. We're just
expanding our oﬀers there. And it's one of the few areas where Walmart can really
help and support in terms of the learning for working with that. So, overall, we're
meeting our expectations and sometimes exceeding them about where we hoped
our business would be. So, lots of positive things going on for Flipkart.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Page 7 of 10Q - Paul Trussell
A - Judith McKennaPhonePe is of course the other business there as well. For those that don't know, it's
payment platform and it is less than ﬁve years old, and we said in Q1 that it's just got
through some just over 200 million users, it's just crossed 300 million user platform -
- user mark on that, which is remarkable in a ﬁve-year period. They are a transaction
platform. So, whilst they're anchored in payments, what they're looking to do is to
see ways to be able to be more inclusive to customers everywhere across India. So,
they're going into new ﬁnancial services areas, be that gold. Gold is huge in India for
those people who know the Indian market and then also into an insurance, mutual
funds and diﬀerent areas, which are all strengthening to the P&L ultimately when
those businesses come oﬀ. So, conﬁdent and happy with the progress the
businesses are making.
You asked me about COVID, just we were chatting, earlier such a challenging and
harrowing situation in India. Our hearts goes to everybody who have been impacted
in some way by that, and we're doing all we can as a business to help support that.
And there is undoubtedly been an impact and we talked last year about the closures
that we had due to non-essential items being delivered. There are local closures in
place at the moment, but that has a short-term impact. But the oﬀset to that that I'm
seeing is an increase in digital penetration overall in India. And the Indian
government said many -- several years ago that we wanted to digitize India to
become a digital India, and it's done a lot of things to enable that, such as the UPI,
the united payments interface -- uniﬁed payments interface, and a lot of the platform
they put in place. And I think you will now see the shift into those areas. There's one
area that I think we will see a greater acceleration is grocery for India, so that's why
we're really thinking about that as well.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
Great. Thank you for that detail, Judith. Speaking of digital, that's obviously a key
focus across every geography. Maybe help us understand what digital penetration
does look like in some of the key international markets? And what are maybe some
key capabilities from a technology standpoint that are really work ﬂagging and call in
out that may be diﬀerent than what we are used to seeing and dealing with here in
the US?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah. Digital journey has been extraordinary. And when I started out in the UK, we
launched online grocery, they welcomed business in online and those kind of
businesses. And you look at the UK today, there's lots of penetration that's there and
that has happened to degrees around the world.
In Q1, we told you that digital percentage of service 16% was our contribution to
sales, so you can get a feel for that about the increasing importance that it's having
for us. Obviously, the weighting of Flipkart in our portfolio does have a big weight
on that. And I can't see that penetration ﬂipping back quite honestly. I think there
was some work by McKinsey recently that said, people who shops online the very
ﬁrst time over the last 12 months are more likely than not to continue to shop to
some extent, but the good news is they'll still come back to stores as well. So,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 10Q - Paul Trussellhopefully, for Walmart, we get the best of both worlds there, which is exactly what we
what we want to do.
And technology, we think of innovation and best practice sharing as just being
technology, but it's not just that. We learn from each other in so many diﬀerent ways
and we share talent and we share capability. But in reality, the US has been kind of
the source of a lot of knowledge because, frankly, they can make the largest
investments in some of these areas and we did able to export that around the world.
I think Mexico and Canada in particular are really beneﬁting from the kind of digital
transformation that the US is undergoing, whether that be for last-mile delivery,
whether that be picking capabilities, whatever those areas look like. But we also see
around the world, we are creating pockets of innovation. So, Canada, for example, is
using blockchain and its supply chain to look at how it invoicing and receiving. That's
a really important task for the rest of the world, and the US will take a look at that as
well.
I've talked about payments in India, and PhonePe's innovative approach, the way
they connect, the way that they think about and attracting customers and what they
do will bring that on board. And then in Flipkart, they've got some really good, very
cool stuﬀ around voice and around local language as well. And in voice, we just
introduced voice for shopping on grocery in India and it twice as fast to shop in
English on voice, but three times as fast to shop in Hindi. So, just really interesting
ways that we're learning about how the customer connects with us and how you
bring more people into that ecosystem.
So, the other way and -- I mean we nobody talked about this very much is that we do
something which we call parallel learning. And so, take something like the market
fulﬁllment centers that you've heard us talk about for the US, so these are the
automated boxes that sit on the side of the store and take the majority of picking
out. You need the densities be able to do it, but it gives you a huge productivity
speed and the customer experience is much stronger as well.
And the US -- we actually tried one of these donkey's years ago back in the UK, one
of our things that didn't work. And but in the US, we've talked about this for some
time, while Canada is also testing one. But we're going to test two diﬀerent
technologies. So, same output to test two diﬀerent technologies, so that we get the
parallel learning rather than one market does it, spreads it to some other market, so
you get much better ﬂexibility and speed to iterate.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
That's great color and exciting things going on around the world. Judith, maybe to
close out, you mentioned ﬂywheel earlier and maybe we can just circle back to that
as you think about where you are currently in managing this international business.
Talk about the ﬂywheel eﬀect and what you're able to drive in terms of eﬃciency,
then productivity improvement? How that's may be able to lead to leverage across
the cost structure? We'd love to hear a little bit whether that's bigger picture orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 10A - Judith McKennamaybe some market-by-market examples and how that may be parallels as well to
the US business?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah. I guess now -- the work has been done on the ﬂywheel and the articulation of
that to get the clarity of the connectivity of the business I think has been fantastic in
the US in particular. I think that the thing about ﬂywheels is that you keep putting the
little parts in place of them and, ultimately, it starts to get traction of its own and each
piece interconnects and feeds into the next one. It's the entire dictionary deﬁnition
of what a ﬂywheel does. It generates its own energy and momentum over time, but
you've got to be patient putting those pieces together.
You think about the top of the ﬂywheel, that is the customers coming in and its
winning the primary shop, be that in our stores or be that online. You think about the
3 o'clock at the ﬂywheel pull, it's all about building loyalty in deepening our
relationships with our customers. So, I think about this we sell them things, but we
get to them how they want it. We then connect with them in diﬀerent ways, ﬁnancial
services, health and wellness in the US is a huge example of that, and bring them
back into the ﬂywheel.
You then come into the 6 o'clock area of that ﬂywheel and you thinking about
productivity, so that scale that you can get and the automation that it brings and
what you can do as well as the connectivity that allows you to have new proﬁt
streams. Ultimately, you invest all of that back into the business again and your
customer value proposition. And I go through that every time I talk about the
ﬂywheel, because it's helpful to remember how it works and what those pieces are.
The US is doing some amazing work there. Our AdTech in particular so impressed
with Walmart Connect, and in fact, we've taken the idea of Walmart Connect and we
now have Walmart Connect in Mexico and in Canada. Mexico saw 100% increase in
advertisers on that platform in Q1, which is remarkable growth for it. So, that ﬂywheel
applies everywhere. Slightly diﬀerent in India, because we don't have physical stores,
but the concept of it is still true, bring people into the platform, deepen your
relationship with them, create eﬃciencies and alternative proﬁt streams as a result
having those people, and then invest it back in to value and access for customers.
Mexico is probably the one where I'm seeing it come to life the most. And I think the
twist that they have is they think about this ﬁnancial services capability providing
services to the unbanked to people that really need it, creating this internet
connectivity into people is an extra part of that ﬂywheel at the 3 o'clock level if you
like where they can see the opportunities that exist, and that came from and -- say,
why aren't customers interacting on Walmart.com in Mexico? And one of the
answers was the oﬀer -- one of the answers was they can't get on it. There isn't any
access to it. They need data. They need internet to be able to do it. So, the team
developed these two things. First of all, they developed this oﬀer on bays, with the
second is they put kiosks in some of the stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-07

Q - Paul TrussellAnd I've tried putting kiosks in stores before they've been a complete disaster,
nobody uses them, nobody wants to. And the data stores in Mexico, they're fantastic,
because that is a way to access full range for customer. So, the ﬂywheel is applicable
everywhere. The US is doing a great job against it. But my job and the job of the
teams around the world is to tailor it for each market and be very careful where we
did [ph] one solution ﬁt all for the international business, and that's really the
approach that we've taken. It comes back to these strong local businesses powered
by Walmart, now powered by Walmart creating strong local businesses and that is
important to remember.
