Good morning. I don't know about you guys. But when I saw the ﬁnal cut of this
video a couple days ago on the plane it gave me the chills and it makes me so
incredibly proud of everything we've accomplished in 2016. But this is my third ICR
and so when I reﬂect on the past couple of years I remember being in this room two
years ago and there were a whole lot of skeptics in the room. It wasn't a fun time.
The brand had been harvested for a couple of years and we set out a pretty
ambitious agenda of returning to positive comps, returning to the eﬀortless loyalty
that we knew from our guests that we had someone neglected. And then building
the men's business, building an international strategy, building a digital ecosystem.
And really getting back to a level of performance from a margin and from an
earnings standpoint that had deteriorated over a couple of years.
Today we are actually in a position, with the strongest management team that the
company has ever had, to deliver on all of those promises. So I am really, really
pleased with the progress that we have made and our FY 2016 accomplishments
really speak for what we have been able to do.
Oh, forgot about that. I am not going to read it. But you know what that means.
So when you think about FY 2016, ﬁrst, from a product standpoint, we were very
intentional in returning to being a design-led organization that lives really perfectly
at the intersection of function and fashion with a very clear mandate that we do not
design product if it doesn't solve a problem for the athletes. And as long as we do
that, as long as we listen to our ambassadors, we have seen incredible success.
What we have seen with the relaunch of the pant wall, the success of our Nulu fabric,
the recent success of our Nulux fabric, which is an evolution of Nulu for higher
intensity cardio workouts, really speaks to the fact that when we deliver innovation to
our guests they respond incredibly well and we see very little price resistance to the
innovation that we bring to market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-01-10

Page 2 of 8As we become design-led we'll also build an overarching design vision between
men's and women's. For those of you that have been in our store, you can probably
very clearly tell the diﬀerence of how the product is coming to life, how much better
it's merchandised, how easier it is to put an outﬁt together. And how both the men's
and the women's business live in the same space.
So returning to being design-led, focused on innovation. Three years ago the
pipeline, like we said, was very, very dry and today I feel like we have got a pipeline
of innovation that is relatively full with a very clear roadmap for the next three to ﬁve
years and actually a little bit beyond. So very excited about that.
From a guest experience standpoint, we have started playing with a lot of diﬀerent
formats. You have heard us speak about the co-located format. It is really our ability
to take markets where we are already very successful and build bigger stores so that
the men's have a larger presence and the women's business we can actually show a
broader assortment, especially as we get into new categories. So the co-located
have been a tremendous tool in allowing us to the stronger in markets where we
already have a very strong presence.
Then in markets where we don't have necessarily the market-holding capacity for a
full store, we have been playing with locals and the locals are really a very strategic
evolution of our showroom model. You think about the local that we have in Tokyo in
Harajuku or the one that we have got in Fort Collins. Those are 1,000 square foot
locations, really, really well built that allows us to bring the brand to life really
powerfully with our ambassadors. And while they are small square footprints, we
have amazing digital air cover.
Then when you think about guest experience, I'm really pleased with what we have
been able to do with our international expansion. I was in Shanghai right after our
earnings call. We opened two stores in Shanghai, one in Beijing.
For those of you that have been in the Asian market, our store in Shanghai, the ﬁrst
store in Shanghai is the IFC Shanghai. Very similar location to what we have got at
IFC Hong Kong. Right across from Apple; indoor entrance, outdoor entrance. It is an
absolutely fantastic location.
And the second location is at Kerry Center. They are both about 2,200 square feet.
And when you think that we took that ﬁrst trip two years ago to open a showroom to
now be in a position to have these two outstanding locations that have since the
opening exceeded our expectations, I'm really, really pleased with our focused
strategy in China, which is about densiﬁcation in both Shanghai and Beijing before
we go to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.
Something that is obviously very clear is that the way the market in China engages
from a digital standpoint is very diﬀerent than how we engage in North America. So
we are building a team in China to really have a strategy that is focused on that
market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-01-10

Page 3 of 8Then in London -- I mean so we have seen the Asian market grow a little bit faster.
We have seen faster growth in Asia than we have in Europe and it doesn't really
surprise us. I think the European consumer is a little bit more skeptical of North
American brands. But when they are engaged with a brand I think they are actually
incredibly loyal and, to some extent, maybe less ﬁckle.
In Q3/Q4 we have actually seen a ramp up in our performance in Europe. I am ﬂying
this afternoon to London for the opening of our incredible location on Regent Street,
which is obviously one of the most prestigious shopping streets in the world. We
have got this amazing 6,200 square foot location right across from Hamleys, the toy
store. And so when you combine that with our presence at Harrods, Covent Garden,
Marylebone. And King's Road we really feel like we will have London really well
under control before we sort of spread our wings beyond the UK.
From a brand and community standpoint I mean we love the way we go to market.
We love our ambassadors. We love our educators. We love being focused on
grassroots.
What you are going to see us do in 2017 is be a lot louder in how we amplify the
message. So don't expect us to have a spread in Vogue magazine or have a Super
Bowl ad. I know we have talked about it; I don't think we can aﬀord it. But expect
really us to be really intentional in how we take a lot of our local stories put them
together and have really powerful global stories.
I think we have an opportunity to do a really, really good job as we grow as a global
brand to be very clear and concise about who we are as a brand and what we stand
for.
Then from a people standpoint I have mentioned it -- I have mentioned it earlier. I
am very, very grateful for our 12,000 educators around the world. They are clearly at
the core of our success. They create experiences day in and day out that are second
to none. But I also want to recognize the management team that I get to work with
every day.
It is the strongest management team that the Company has ever had; certainly the
strongest management team that I have ever worked with. And being able to
accomplish as much as we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time
and be in a position today to have great margin and a return to earnings growth,
clearly would not have been able to do any of that without them. So I am very, very
grateful for the team that we have got in place.
Then ﬁnally operational excellence. Initially, we are focused on returning to positive
comp, guest loyalty, being focused on product. Then the last hurdle that we needed
to tackle was really sort of building pretty much from scratch an infrastructure and a
supply chain that could handle the complexity and the scale of the business,
especially as you think about our ﬁve-year plan. We are very much on track with that
and it shows in our gross margin results.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-01-10

Page 4 of 8Stuart HaseldenSo a lot of tremendous accomplishment in FY 2016 and I want to be clear; there are
all lot of things that we have done well and there are plenty of things that we can do
better. You think about our accessory business; we think it is a tremendous
opportunity at 7% or 8% of our overall business right now. We think it is a 12% or 15%
opportunity.
I mean there is an opportunity for us to be much stronger in jackets and outerwear.
And so we have plenty of runway within the current category, within women's and
men's. But also as we think down the road with new categories.
So before I let Stuart give you a little bit more detail, we are very much on track with
our ﬁve-year plan to double revenue and more than double earnings. If you think
about the breakdown of the business, I mean the breakdown of men's and women's
we think about that as a $3 billion/$1 billion sort of breakdown. The North American
continued build out across the men's business, digital. And new categories is a $3
billion opportunity.
We think about building the digital ecosystem as having the potential to be 20%,
25%. And I want to be really clear that we are not stuck with that number. I mean I
think it is really, really critical, especially as a vertical brand, that we build channel-
agnostic strategies and that we don't get stuck in trying to drive traﬃc to either
channel. The guests really have the choice to engage however, whenever. And
wherever they want with the brand and we have to be there for them in a really
seamless manner.
So think about as we launch a lot of innovation in the bra category -- you are going
to want to go try them. But you might decide to buy the Align pant online. And we
are going to see guests engaging in very diﬀerent ways through diﬀerent channels.
This is how we are qualifying the opportunity right now and I think it could be very
diﬀerent in diﬀerent parts of the world, especially if you think about China.
Finally, a $1 billion opportunity with 25% penetration for our international expansion.
It has been a long road for the past two years. I'm really proud of what we have been
able to do. I'm grateful for the patience that you have had because we have had ﬂat
earnings for quite some time and I feel like now we are actually ﬁnally in a position
where with the team, with the strategy we are ﬁnally at that inﬂection point where we
have momentum, eﬀortless loyalty from our guests. And a roadmap that we are very,
very excited about tackling.
So thank you so much and I will let Stuart take on from here. Thank you.
{BIO 17615686 <GO>}
Thanks, Laurent. We will move on to some details on -- I'm going to skip through.
These are some slides that we had just that reiterated the key growth pillars thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-01-10
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 5 of 8Laurent spoke to that we have also highlighted consistently on our earnings calls and
it is really the underpinnings of the growth story.
But moving on into the ﬁnancial update; this is my favorite slide. I always start every
presentation with it. It is a nice picture. In all seriousness, I think it is important for us
to step back and have some perspective on the momentum and the trajectory that
the business has been on.
As you look at the remarkable picture here and you think about what has happened
over the last several years, there has been more competition and notably, as you go
back to 2013 in particular, some pretty signiﬁcant self-inﬂicted issues that even
despite all those things the Company has been incredibly resilient in delivering
consistent top-line results, which is really the underpinnings of any growth story. And
so I think as we now emerge from -- a lot of the new infrastructure investment that
Laurent talked about as we -- in the aftermath of 2013 and 2014 and the investment
phase that we have been in in 2015 and 2016, we are more conﬁdent than ever in
this arrow continuing to go up.
And the potential for us to achieve the ﬁve-year goals that we set out at the
beginning of the year to exceed $4 billion in revenue by 2020, we're more conﬁdent
than ever in delivering on that. And really it is based on those four growth pillars that
Laurent talked to in terms of product innovation, the continued expansion of our
North American store and e-commerce business, the investments and the outsized
growth in digital and our e-commerce strategies. And international. Really pleased
with the progress we have made this year in each of those areas and it shows in our
ﬁnancial results and in particular in the top line.
This is in the backdrop of a pretty tough environment. It is a tough space right now
for most retailers and we are pleased with, again, the resilience of our business and
the momentum that we have in Q4 that will take us into Q1.
The next slide just gives us some additional details on really the composition of the
2016 results in particular, reaching a new high-water mark in terms of revenue. And
the growth here really balanced between stores and e-commerce.
The store business consistently positive across all geographies, across all vintages,
every age class seeing expansion in comps and sales per square foot and in four-
wall proﬁt. So we are pleased with the health of our store ﬂeet and excited as we see
the e-commerce and digital strategies gain momentum. It is an important area of
investment as I mentioned.
And also as our business becomes more intertwined in terms of an omnichannel
strategy, our stores and our website and our e-commerce strategies are more
connected and more intertwined than ever, as we are able to pool inventory and
satisfy guest demand across channels wherever they want to shop. And so we are
excited to see that element of our strategy accelerating.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-01-10
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 6 of 8The combined comp will become a more and more important indicator of the health
of our business as the omnichannel nature of our business accelerates. But
nonetheless, we are pleased as we look at the traditional deﬁnitions of those
channels, how they perform.
Then as we look at -- looking at it from a category standpoint, the men's business
incredible momentum. It is an area we feel has incredible potential. We are excited
at some of the new leaders that have joined the Company. Ben Stubbington, our
new men's designer, is really helping to be a catalyst for forging and developing our
new vision for our men's business, among others as well. And so really excited to see
the mid-teens consistent growth in men's as that becomes a bigger part of our
business.
Women's, remarkable what we were able to accomplish last year with the Pant Wall
relaunch and the double-digit comps that we have seen in women's pants all year.
We are now comping the launch from last September in Q3 and Q4 in a very healthy
way, in a robust way that speaks to just the opportunity that we have and also just the
pipeline of innovation that Laurent talked about. Obviously, women's pants is the
heart of our business and for us to be able to deliver double-digit comps in our most
mature category is remarkable and speaks to that innovation strategy success.
Finally, as we think about square footage expansion, new stores, it really breaks into
two buckets: the North American picture and then the international picture. Laurent
mentioned a lot of the innovation that the team has developed, particularly in North
America, it is really inspiring to see how -- as we think about real estate, it is not an
asset conversation; it is a market conversation.
We look at every market and determine and assess the demand that we see in each
market. We then assess the retail footprint that we have to determine what the
optimal strategy should be for each market and that oftentimes will include
expansions, relocations. We are excited to see the success of the new small store
format, the local.
And so the innovation that we have been able to bring to the real estate strategy, in
North America in particular, has been really inspiring and we are seeing great results.
Laurent mentioned some of those even on the Q3 call, where we have seen really
remarkable results where we have expanded stores to make room for a more fuller
expression of our men's business in particular.
International, exciting momentum, also as Laurent mentioned. In the near term, the
balance of our square footage growth will likely be still weighted to North America.
But over the next few years that will tip and become more heavily weighted to our
international markets. So a lot of exciting developments this year.
Then as we provided some update on holiday results yesterday with our press
release, just wanted to have a slide here so that we could speak to and just highlight
our thinking around where Q4 is emerging. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-01-10
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 7 of 8Fourth Quarter started out slow. November, for a number of reasons, was a slow
start. We saw an acceleration around Black Friday and into Cyber Monday that was
exciting.
December was a choppy period. There is some signiﬁcant calendar shifts year over
year, which inﬂuenced how we planned the business. But as we step back and we
look at December as a whole, we were really pleased. It was a really strong period
for us. We saw really strong full-price selling; great execution, both in stores and
online. So we were really pleased with how holiday performed and how our team
performed.
As we then look to update the guidance, we essentially are seeing the business
trending to the high end of the range that we had provided back in December and
so we have updated it accordingly. As we think about this range and the mid-single
digits being 4%, 5%. And 6%, I would say we are trending to the high end of that
range. And so we feel it is a strong performance in a diﬃcult environment and we
think this also connects well to the outlook for Q1 that we will talk more about on the
Q4 call.
Then lastly, just wanted to highlight some of the drivers for 2017. Obviously, as we
discuss the results of the full year in March as we report Q4 we will have more
information to oﬀer for 2017. But as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are really
conﬁdent that the momentum that we have seen from a top-line standpoint connects
well to the targets that we set out for the ﬁve-year period. We are also conﬁdent that
the gross margin recovery that is driven primarily by the product margin recovery
puts us well on track to achieve the gross margin levels that will support over the
next few years us achieving that operating margin that starts with a two.
So pleased with -- and as we think about just the revenue in particular, again next
year will be the continuation of our strategies that we've mentioned, a few of which
are noted here on the slide. And as we think about gross margin into next year,
speciﬁcally we have seen the inﬂection in our product margins coming into full focus
in Q3 of this year. That will extend into Q4, as we have indicated in our guidance.
Would expect to see a step function improvement in product margins and gross
margins through the ﬁrst half of next year, Q1 and Q2. And that will be the
culmination of all of the work that we have done over the last two years to improve
how we source our products, to include just our own internal processes, as well as
logistics and the manner in which we partner with our suppliers.
So all of that will achieve the lion's share of that step function improvement through
the ﬁrst half of next year. Beyond that we will see ongoing improvements in product
margin at a more modest pace as we are able to deliver improvements in
merchandising, ongoing improvements from a sourcing strategy standpoint as our
volumes continue to ramp. And we are excited to get into the work of identifying
how we continue to build on the success that we have seen so far.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-01-10
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 8 of 8In addition to that I would expect to see occupancy cost continue to moderate in
terms of the degree to which there are headwinds. The international expansion has
been part of the big headwind that has accounted for much of the pressure on
occupancy as a rate of sales. As that store ﬂeet scales and seasons we will be able to
see a moderation in the occupancy pressure that we see there.
And likewise, the portion of gross margin that is related to the costs associated with
the product team will also moderate from a degree of deleverage. So all those will
be favorable factors for gross margin into next year and beyond. And so as we look
into 2017 we see strong potential for gross margin expansion based on all the factors
I just mentioned. Beyond that we will see more modest gross margin improvements
as we are able to have a continuous improvement strategy to evolve our cost
structure.
From an SG&A standpoint, as I mentioned, we have had a couple years of pretty
meaningful investment. We are a growth company; we will continue to invest for
growth. We believe as we are able to deliver revenues in the mid-teens range we will
invest in our business, in our growth strategies, in our infrastructure in a similar level
that allow for the opportunity to have a modest level of SG&A leverage.
As we think about the business, we really leverage SG&A on total revenues. So as I
mentioned, in the mid-teens range enables us to leverage, have some modest
degree of SG&A leverage. Embedded in that assumption is a low double-digit
square footage growth and a mid single-digit comp growth. I just wanted to clarify
that point in particular.
Again, very excited how the business has performed in the Fourth Quarter, excited
for how that connects to, we believe, a very strong outlook into next year and
beyond. And really excited to continue into the next chapter of the story. So with that
we thank you for your time and look forward to chatting with everyone separately.
