Good afternoon. Welcome to the 2017 Microsoft Financial Analyst Brieﬁng. It's great
to see so many of you here in Seattle. And a special welcome to those joining us
online. I hope you had a chance to watch Satya, Scott and Harry this morning at the
Build opening keynotes where they shared a lot of the exciting innovation
happening at Microsoft. And we have a really great agenda here today for you.
We'll start with Satya. Satya will come out and share his perspective on the growth
and innovation happening at Microsoft. Then Judson Althoﬀ, who's the head of our
Worldwide Commercial Business, will come out and talk about how our customers
are transforming. Next, Phil Spencer, who's the head of Xbox, will come talk about
the opportunities that we see in the gaming space. And of course, ﬁnally, Amy Hood
will come and talk about how Microsoft continues our transformation journey.
So without further ado, let's go ahead and get the show on the road. Thank you, all.
And I'll see you back at our Q&A.
Please welcome Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Oﬃcer.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you, Chris. Thank you, all for being here in Seattle and coming and spending
time with us. Hope you had a chance this morning to see the keynote. And also
tomorrow, we have a lot more to cover in terms of our innovation agenda. And I
hope you get a chance to see the keynotes tomorrow as well.
So what I thought I'll do is set some context. We get the chance to talk to all of you
every quarter. But we thought we'll take this opportunity using our developer
conference to talk more about where is technology going and what Microsoft is
planning to do with all the secular shifts and what does that mean for our business.
One of the things I hope is clear to you. And we've done a good job of
communicating it. And more importantly, staying consistent with it is: we've spent a
lot of energy and time building connected tissue between our sense of purpose and
in the enduring mission; having a real ﬁrst-class world view as to where is technology
going and being able to make sure that we're placing bets on the products we build;
having a high ambition. But the ability to back it up with execution; and then
ultimately, having a culture that allows you to do all of it.
I always think of that sense of purpose and mission and culture as the 2 book ends.
They are enduring. But they need constant work. You have to use it to guide the
choices you make. Pretty much, you can't just say, just given the sense of identity you
have, you can't just go to every market and talk about that being a market that you
can enter. You've got to have a real capability, something that you can uniquelyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

Page 3 of 37contribute. So using that as a ﬁlter. But at the same time, not falling in love with any
current generation of technology that we may have even achieved success with. To
be able to question that status quo, that's, to me, is what it's all about, especially in
the tech business. But pretty much I would say in any business that's got strong
network eﬀects through digital technology. I would sort of posit to say that getting
that balance and connection right between these 4 elements is probably more
important than any temporal strategy. I always say that, look, every business has a
growth phase. And then it ﬂattens and it declines. The question is what are you
doing right after. If you are going to be a business that's going to be there after one
core hit is done, which although it happened to every business, that has had lots of
growth.
And in our case, at Microsoft, we've had that. Over 42 years, we've been able to hit
the right markets. And here we are on Techmeme 42 years after, duking it out with a
lot of new players and a lot of new context and a lot of new competition. So there
must be something we're getting right. That customer relevance and business
growth, to me, is the ultimate test. But you've got to do a lot of work on these 4
elements to be able to relevant with customers in business growth.
So I spent, quite honestly, more time thinking about this, reﬂecting on it and making
sure we're greater getting this right. I know this much more so now than even three
years ago as to how important that balance and keeping that balance and getting
that balance right is.
Now for me, this mission, as I've always said, is more than a set of words. It's a real
living guide. Everything that we do will always have that question of is it relevant for
people, can we then also make it relevant in the organizational context for us. When
we think about software, one thing that comes naturally, given our DNA, is to think of
organizations as a ﬁrst-class construct in the software we build. Sometimes we've got
that balance to a point where it's more about the organization, less about the
people. Those are big mistakes. But again, doing the right thing for people at the
same time for the organization is really what we seek in all of the products that we
build.
We deﬁnitely think of this as a global business. We operate in 190-plus countries.
And it's complicated. But that complicated business and staying there over the long
run has huge ramiﬁcations in terms of our overall long-term growth, because there
will always be changes in macro in diﬀerent parts of the world. You've got to adjust
to those. But that footprint of being a multinational company that operates across
the globe, especially in a time like this and having that wherewithal to be able to
create local opportunity in every country, because that's perhaps something that's
missed. When I go meet even a head of state anywhere, every head of state only
cares about one thing. It's about their country ﬁrst. It's America, America. You're in
the U.S., it's about the America ﬁrst. And in the Britain, it's about Britain ﬁrst.
And what you're talking to that head of state, what they care about is what have you
done in terms of local taxes, what have you done in terms of local small business
productivity, local large business competitiveness, their educational outcomes, theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 37entrepreneurial work. That's what matters. And when I look at what Microsoft does,
that's where I get -- I feel that we have real long-term prospects in those countries.
Any company that just collects rent internationally and think that, that's a long-term
stable business I think will be in trouble. Whereas in our case, it's always about
creating local opportunity in all of those countries. And I believe it matters for
building a global multinational company, even in tech, long term.
Now perhaps the more salient point, which will be reﬂected throughout, is that
ultimately, our business model asks for this as well as our customers care about this,
which is: it's not about our platforms, our technologies, our products; it's what they
can do on top of it. So that notion of we build technology so that others can build
technology, super-important aspect.
One of the examples I'll give is what happened in the auto industry is fascinating,
because as soon as the car has become the most exciting high-tech product, one of
the key things that automakers needed to decide is who is going to be their trusted
partner when it comes to something like the cloud or even some of the AI
technology. And in the world where there is confusion as to who is competing, who
is partnering, Microsoft being clear about what our intent is, what our capability is
and then being able to make sure that we can deliver on it has created tremendous
amount of trust. And obviously, that's why all the American companies, the Japanese
and German companies, we have fairly big, big design wins across the board when it
comes to the cloud and auto.
We are well and truly on our way on this mobile-ﬁrst, cloud-ﬁrst world. And as I sort
of talked about it this morning, we have this profound shift going on. And one thing
that I've learned over the years at Microsoft tracking all our platform shifts is the
feedback loop between the apps that are getting built. And if you closely listen, you
closely watch what they're doing and how they're pushing, you really can deﬁne
what that next platform shift is. And when I look at whether it's the IoT applications,
what's happening in the home with even around the Xbox or what's happening in
meeting rooms at work, it's clear as day that the cloud and the edge are both getting
infused with AI and intelligence. The user experience itself, as I described it, is
getting distributed across multiple devices. And this is not just a dumb shell. It is user
experience with very rich state in it with very rich natural user interface in it, whether
it's speech or vision or gestures. But it's multi-device. It's even aware of how you
want to perhaps complete one task going from one device to the other device. So
when you say that it's going to be multi-device experiences, then the next logical
thing is the data and the AI that's making those experiences rich itself is getting
distributed.
In fact, you see this very clearly today in the cloud where people who will train in the
cloud were using, say, GPUs, take that model, deploy it in the edge to be able to
recognize people, places, things, using even commodity cameras, for example. But
ultimately though, you want to be able to make inferences on the edge. So you want
to take the same model that you trained and you want to deploy it. But you -- if you
want to make inferences at the edge without latency, you will need to perhaps even
train in the edge. So we can clearly see -- I mean, if you're generating 100 gigabytesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 37a second in an autonomous car, the chances that you will rendezvous everything in
the car are going to be low. So you need compute where data is getting generated
so that you can create intelligence.
So distribution of intelligence, our AI and data. And that ultimately leads to I think a
pretty profound shift in what is, as I described it, the inner and outer loops of how
one writes the logic. You start writing logic using these server-less constructs that get
triggered by events. They just don't run in one place. They have to migrate to where
the event is happening. Then the complexity of distribute computing we've just
introduced by that one statement needs to be managed. Just saying it's a Docker
Container means nothing if you can't manage the complexity of all of these
containers and think about a compliant application, model drift. So these AI models
that you built in. And if there's going to be drift and you've got to be held
accountable, the inner and outer loops of what you do as a developer and the
computing infrastructure needs to support these new types of workﬂow.
So it's a pretty profound shift and clearly builds on what has come before, like all
technology, the mobile-ﬁrst, cloud-ﬁrst world evolving to this intelligent cloud and
intelligent edge world, we think, is deﬁnitely what we're going to be talking for years
to come. And we have a fantastic structural position here. The -- I've always had
those -- that we never should think about our servers or even our end device
operating system as somehow legacy. But we've got to modernize it. So this shift of
Windows to Windows as a service, the shift of servers as the edge to the cloud is not
new news. It's something that we've been working towards. So the fact that we now
have Azure Stack or the Azure IoT Edge or even Windows IoT, think about what's the
biggest, most pressing concern of any IoT deployment. It is the security of the end
node. And when you say security, that means someone standing up to patch those
devices.
So to me, having these runtimes that are cloud-managed. But are running on the
edge can give local intelligence is a big structural position. Even the way we think
about the multi-device app model, you'll hear more about it tomorrow even in the
keynote, is what we want is one device in a person's life to be a Microsoft device for
us to be able to in fact improve things on all devices. That's a very diﬀerent way to
think about even, silicon-up, for sure, there's a programming model and an
abstraction. But there's a cloud-down abstraction.
So I feel that where the world is going is better suited for what we, as a company, do
well and even the structural position that we have. And we deﬁnitely plan to keep
building on this worldview.
The opportunity, one of the things that as I look back, the key has been from from
whether seeing the PC market for what it was possible for us to do, seeing the client
server market, the cloud market, those are all good things that we were able to
capitalize on, build good technology, build for share positions. One of the
fascinating things that's happening right in front of our eyes is what we thought was
a massive marketplace of $2.5 trillion of IT spend all moving to cloud is, in fact, not
the limit. The reason why we think of this, this $4.5 trillion is for the ﬁrst time, goingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 37back to my auto example, Azure is not just getting built in to power the back-oﬃce
applications or back-end applications of the client-server era. Autonomous cars and
connected cars didn't exist in the client-server era. Connected elevators didn't exist.
Precision farming or precision medicine didn't exist. So we're suddenly becoming --
the cloud is getting built into the COGS of the world. So it's not just the OpEx. But
the COGS that's all being digitized. And that's the opportunity that's in front of us in
this massive digital transformation that we see in pretty much every sector of the
economy. And there's example after example that we can go. In fact, Judson, who
will come up next after me, will just take a couple of examples to kind of give even
the tenor of the conversation we're having with these customers that whom we've
worked with historically over the years with PCs and client-server. But I must tell you
that the qualitative change of the depth of our conversation now, when you're
suddenly not just powering their oﬃces system or an ERP system or what have you.
But you're built into their COGS, is very diﬀerent and that's we're evolving to.
Now one of the things that Amy and I spend a lot of time along with all of the other
senior leaders, especially in R&D, is to think about how do we bring these 3
segments as you think of them or the 3 ambitions that we have, 3 R&D lines that we
have together. Because quite frankly, over the last three years, you've seen us both
set markers and deliver on those markers and make continuous progress across
these 3 ambitions. And each quarter, we obviously even talk about segment
progress. But the real trick is to be able to make sure that your cost of customer
acquisition as well as your lifetime value are really optimized by doing the right
things across all 3 ambitions. Otherwise, why have all these 3 things in one
company? I mean, at some level, the theory the ﬁrm dictates that we be great at this.
And to me, that's a place which we've not talked much. But I want to give you a view
of how I think about that, because to me, that connective tissue between these 3
things, which by the way, Steve and Bill and others did a fantastic job of construction
it during the client-server era.
Most people thought of it, we had a Windows business and server business. We had
one business. They were all connected into one cycle. And so now in this world, we
want to do the same. And I just want to give you a little bit of peek at it.
Now ultimately, it's about people and organizations straight from our mission and
digital transformation. So let's take something like gaming. It's one of the ﬁrst places
where we have brought a lot of our assets together to say, let -- what can we do.
Most of you view gaming as, well, Microsoft does have an Xbox business. And I think
you understand the console economics and you have measured us by it. It's a much
broader thing for us. We took the position we have with Xbox LIVE. The number of
subscribers of -- it's the biggest gaming social network, which monetizes far superior
to any other gaming social network. And that now spans both the Xbox as well as the
PC, right? That was the ﬁrst change. I mean, you could say, why is it that we didn't do
it? But guess what, PC gaming is a growth market that. So is the console. So if you
attach the same gamers across them using one social network, that's powerful.
Now we have all these new business models, whether it's subscriptions -- and now
with our Beam acquisition, this is another phenomenal thing that's happening. It's noFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 37longer anymore about just the people who are playing the game, it's also the people
who are watching the game. So when do you do Windows+ G on any PC, you're
broadcasting immediately. And the broadcast is being seen not just on PCs and
consoles. But on phones even. And so to me, turning every Windows machine, every
PC essentially into a broadcast station and increasing the reach of what people are
doing is tremendous. In fact, most streaming happens on the PC, us and Twitch.
And in fact, what's happening is not just games streaming; in fact, devs streaming.
Bill Was on -- today on Beam. And so it's not long -- just not about gaming. But even
as soon as we launch the 3D Paint, we had people, artists who were using Surface
Studio and streaming their art. So to me, being able to connect the dots around
gaming, stretching it to these new forms of expression like creation, using the same
social network to bootstrap that and not even stopping there. In fact, one of the
things that Phil Spencer will come and talk about is how can we even take some of
that and put some of the back-end services on Azure for gaming. After all, gaming is
a big driver of consumption in the cloud. So those are the optimizations that we're
doing. And those are the innovations that we're doing and the connections we're
making with gaming. And Phil will come and talk more about that.
Similarly, we're doing this with even the professional worker. LinkedIn to me starts
with the 500 million members. There was approximately 750 million knowledge
workers in the world. Now for each one of them, we have the capability, starting with
LinkedIn, which gives them the best ability to realize their economic opportunity, to
be able to connect all of the assets, whether it's Outlook or Skype, OneDrive and
bring everything that we have for their personal productivity as well as their
professional productivity. So when you think about us and our Consumer Oﬃce 365
growth, it's not just Consumer Oﬃce 365 growth. But it's that connective tissue of a
Windows machine running Oﬃce 365 with the LinkedIn professional network, really
all coming together to help you get familiar with the tools that you will then work
and also use at work. And having that ability to have multiple identities and the same
tools infrastructure and similar workﬂows is supercritical. So that's what we're doing
in terms of productivity and comms in terms of bringing these assets together.
Now one of the other places, which is again very exciting new for us, is we've always
thought of knowledge worker, information workers. And I said -- talked about the
750 million people. But it turns out, some of the IT spend and allocation that's
happening nowadays is not just for the knowledge worker. It's, in fact, for these front-
line workers, whether it's in hospitality, whether it's in manufacturing. If you look at
some the early case studies of HoloLens, where HoloLens is getting deployed a lot is
in the oil rigs. It's in the front-line maintenance of aircraft.
And so people are spending top device dollars to equip their people doing high
precision work in the ﬁeld with digital tech to be able to bring up the CAD pictures,
to be able to then ﬁx the right part, because that has a lot of economic value for
them. So across all of these, whether it's in retail or in hospitality, healthcare or
manufacturing, we're now very focused on the front-line worker. And we're bringing
a full suite. And you've seen this ﬁrst more concretely with Oﬃce 365. But our
ambitions go beyond that with even devices like HoloLens and mixed reality andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 37bring it together. We sometimes reference and think about this increasingly as
Microsoft 365 for the front-line worker, starting with the device all the way to the
service from time scheduling to communications and to be able to really help them
communicate and bring them into the total, I mean -- and it's also a very important
CEO agenda item from a culture change perspective, which is when you think about
all of the workforce and you really want to include them and their impact ampliﬁed,
this becomes a huge priority for them.
Another area, obviously, which is super-exciting -- we even had an event last week
called the Business Forward event, is around enabling the professionals across every
department inside of the enterprise. We've had a nice healthy Dynamics business.
But now the combination of LinkedIn, Dynamics and Oﬃce 365 gives us a very
diﬀerent type of SaaS footprint to go and change the game. Some of the
fundamental issues of this market today are these disconnected and monolithic
suites, this data is not connected at all. Every application is customized diﬀerently.
And we've completely changed that game where now you have Oﬃce, Dynamics,
LinkedIn as one connected data graph. But the most important thing is this common
data service, I can't emphasize the importance more having lived in this world, that
it's so important to think about -- like most business process is always dynamic,
always changing in time. It's because one of these biggest fallacies that I buy a
business process system implemented once and forget about it. It's not the case. I
mean, if it were that simple, we would all be happy.
Businesses are changing, changing in time. So you want to be able to have a tool
chain that allows you to be resilient to that. So having a common data model that
allows you to do that and then workﬂow engines on top of it to be able to customize
the process. But not having one bespoke solution by app, is super-important. So we
now have this entirety. And this something that Scott talked about in the keynote,
where if you are a SaaS application on Azure, that entire thing essentially comes for
free to the customer. So we even have some business model as well as
programmatic changes that can be pretty dramatic ampliﬁers of our position in this
space.
Now shifting -- so we talked a lot about the end user, both starting with gaming and
consumers going to the professional user at work. But the organizational beneﬁts. So
that's one of the other fundamental things that we think about. Another triple-digit
growth thing for us has been our Secure Productive Enterprise. Now that's the
highest end of what we do with everything from Windows 10 to Oﬃce 365 and
Enterprise Mobility Suite. And being able to bring this modern management and
security along productivity and communications is a thing that we can now start
having conversations with organizational beneﬁts. And so to me, this is the peak of
what we can do by empowering every person. And of course, it's ultimately about
powering the digital transformation itself with Azure. And if you've watched the
keynotes this morning, both the AI as well as the infrastructure and data keynotes,
we've made some signiﬁcant advances in it.
The ﬁrst, I would say, is we are only the hyper-scale cloud provider today that
operates in -- across all of the regions that many of the large multinationals expect usFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 37Operatorto operate. We meet the, I would say, the geopolitical realities of the world where it
is and where it will be versus some naive view of it, which is I think very important to
customers who want to trust us and build on top of us. We also have this hybrid and
intelligent edge. It's a pretty unique structural advantage and an architectural
advantage. And I believe the game changed today even with everything from Azure
IoT Edge to Azure Stack. As I said, I think we have a fundamental way to serve
customers from oil and gas to retail, to automotive or any industry for that matter
more so than any one of the other hyper-scale cloud providers that we compete with
on a day-to-day basis today.
We also have some of these rich capabilities, whether they're an AI, I hope you've
picked up 2 things. One is the launch of the Cosmos DB with the move to the cloud
and with the changes in data and the types of data. You require new databases. And
this planet-scale database that supports multiple data types beyond relational, I
think, is a massive breakthrough. It's as big as SQL for us. And we're now very
excited about building that out.
Also what we're doing with AI. To me, sometimes I feel that it's not about the AI
capability I have in HoloLens or in Skype Translate, that's all fantastic. That sort of
gives us, I would say, the muscle to build AI. But what's most important from a digital
transformation perspective is what's the intelligent customers can build. What's the
point of having parlor tricks that we can do, if they can't, in the context of digital
transformation? So that custom layer -- Harry talked about custom speech, custom
vision, custom text. The ability to build on top of what we have. But to customize it
for their acoustic models, for their computer vision needs, I think, is going to be
breakthrough. And so between the new database and this custom AI layer, we feel
that we have these higher layer capabilities that can power the data transformation.
Then, the last point we don't stress enough. But ultimately, as computing becomes
more distributed, it becomes more complicated. And developer productivity,
everything from that CI/CD, right, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment,
the advances we've made with with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Online, it's like a
SaaS service for developers. And once you get beyond sort of the ZIP codes of San
Francisco and Seattle, they matter a lot. When you want to empower the developers
everywhere, you need to be able to give them that pit of success that they can ﬁnd
and stay in. And that's what we've always done traditionally at Microsoft. And we
plan to do that as a big diﬀerentiator of the Azure Cloud.
So that's really a set up for you to think about the value props that we're creating for
people and organizations, how we're connecting the dots between our 3 ambitions
so that ultimately it's about improving the unit economics of everything that we do,
whether it's in the cloud, whether it's a SaaS service or whether it's our device by
bringing these assets together and in response to this digital transformation
opportunity. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a ﬂavor.
And I think next you'll have Judson come up and talk a little bit about a couple of
customers. And I'll come back for Q&A. Thank you, all very, very much.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

Business.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Good afternoon. So I have 3 things I really want to talk to all of you about to provide
some objective evidence around our commercial growth and the progress and
momentum we're seeing in this space. The ﬁrst is how digital transformation is really
fueling a lot of momentum for our commercial customers. The second, how when
enterprises are choosing to go to the cloud, they're choosing to to go to the cloud
with Microsoft based on the investments that we've made in security, data privacy
and sovereignty and on a true global scale. And the third, how commercial
customers are really becoming the digital partners of the future and these
partnerships are actually creating very unique opportunities for us in the
marketplace.
So Satya talked about a lot about digital transformation and about how our 3 bold
ambitions or our 3 core areas of innovation compose together to enable digital
transformation for customers.
I thought what I might do is at least explain what digital transformation means to us,
because if you hold 100 people into a room and asked them what they thought
digital transformation is, you'd probably get 100 diﬀerent answers. To us, it's very
simple. It's a wave of business innovation that is empowered by cloud technologies
like the Internet of Things, augmented reality, artiﬁcial intelligence and data that
enables businesses to grow better and faster and more eﬃcient than ever before. It
has impacts across 4 core areas of our customers' businesses. One, it's driving new
innovation in how our customers engage with their customers. It's also changing
how our customers empower their employees, how they optimize their operations
and how they actually transform their own products.
I want to talk to you a little bit about the impact that is having across industry. The
logo slide you see behind me here is just a reﬂection of the customers where we've
driven our digital impact over this last year. And from aerospace to agriculture, from
Boeing to Land O'Lakes and Ecolab, to the world of creating candy in Hershey's
realm, to counting the beans with UBS, we're having a material impact in growth
across all of these industries.
So recently, we announced a partnership with UBS, where we've taken their risk
management portfolio, all of their software assets and put them on top of our cloud
platform to enable their risk management solutions to run 100% faster than they've
ever run before at 40% the cost. This extends the ecosystem of risk management
solutions they can provide to not only their employees. But their entire partner
portfolio that leverages their digital assets.
In the realm of Hershey, I mentioned how we can actually digitally transform candy.
We have taken the internet of Things and enabled Hershey to create the Internet of
Twizzlers by actually IoT enabling the machines that create candy. Sort of almostFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

Page 11 of 37laughable, yes. It allows people to actually extrude licorice like never before. But the
business impacts are real. In fact, Hershey is now saving $0.5 million per batch of
candy they produce as a result of using AI to predict the formula in which they
produce the candy, the temperature, the humidity, the speed and operational
settings of their devices. It's dramatically improving their operations.
We also announced a few weeks ago a partnership with Maersk. Maersk has been a
commercial customer of ours for many, many years and we've provided them with all
kinds of technology assets. But what's new about our relationship is we've taken the
software they've built. See, many customers are actually becoming ISVs. We've taken
the software they've built, put it on our platform so that they can actually change how
they do business. Rather than just shipping containers from port A to port B, they can
now deliver quality of service solutions and guaranteed SLAs across the entire
supply chain and logistics business that they operate. It's also opening up new
partnerships for them as well as they extended to keep people that create smart
cities and smart ports. And so it's completely changing how they do business with us
as well as how they do business with their partners.
I want to actually drill into what it takes to drive these scenarios to market and really
create an impact with customers, because we've been doing a lot of work to
eﬀectively retool our sales force to really make an impact with customers. That's truly
diﬀerent from what how we've operated in the past. So I want to take you through a
couple of in-depth scenarios.
The ﬁrst is with Land O'Lakes. And so when I say Land O'Lakes, you say -- thank you,
butter? Thanks for being a part of the survey. And so you might say. So Judson, how
would you digitally transform butter? Well so in fact, if you actually see, if you deeply
understand Land O'Lakes business, they of course are in the dairy business. But they
also produce feed and seed for farmers. They are a coop. In fact, the farmers that
they serve actually own their business. And so we've been on a journey with them for
multiple years about helping them reinvent their company from the type of talent
they recruit into their company to how they engage with farmers, their customers, to
how they actually even reshape their business to modernize and capture the value of
the data about their business. And so many of these digital scenarios, the data about
the business actually becomes more valuable than the business itself.
So a bit of a time line and the journey that we've been on with Land O'Lakes. We
started them, as I said, several years back in helping them to rethink how they attract
millennial talent into a company that's been around for many, many years. So the
most important thing for them ﬁrst was to get productivity in the cloud, productivity
enabled across every device. Whether that be how they simply communicate over e-
mail, how they collaborate with video and voice, to how they share information
across their enterprise social fabric. From there, we went on a journey to empower
them with our Surface devices. And if you think a little bit about how this journey
maps to what Satya unfolded earlier, it's very similar. You think about the need for
customers to actually empower their employees through these user -- per user
productivity scenarios that are very personal. That's, in fact, the journey we were on
with Land O'Lakes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

Page 12 of 37It became very, I would say, revolutionary to them when we started actually analyzing
their product. And you might once again say, okay. So let the cat out of the bag here,
how do you digitally transform dairy? Well it turns out after working with them to
better study their business and understanding the data that they possess, they have
decades' worth of satellite imagery for all of the farms that they support around the
world. So we took all the satellite imagery and loaded it into the cloud, then put an
intelligence fabric on top of it so that we could start to predict the hybrid seeds and
the volume of seeds and soil treatments that would best produce crop outputs on a
given plot of land. And when I say a given plot of land, down to 1 square meter of
dirt in fact. From there, we actually could create a prescription for how you would
variably plant a farm. We then work with them and John Deere to take these
prescriptions, download them into semi-autonomous driving tractors, variably plant
farms with the hybrid seed prescriptions from the cloud and the intelligence that we
produce.
The net impact and output is pretty astonishing. It turns out an average acre of land
produces about 130 bushels of corn per acre. Using this technology, we can produce
over 500 bushels of corn per acre. So we've improved the impact and their output
by 3 to 5x, depending on the farm that we work with them on.
I want to reﬂect again about how important it is strategy that Satya articulated
relative to where we're put our R&D investments and how that directly applies to
customer engagements like this. Satya talked about Cosmos and the need to be
able to harness data. He talked about intelligence and intelligence at the edge.
These things compose together in a very diﬀerentiated fashion for us at Microsoft.
Intelligence gets all of the attention these days. But it is in fact data that fuels
intelligence. In fact, if you think about it, a system can actually be as intelligent -- only
as intelligent as the data over which it reasons. And If you don't invest in getting your
data estate in order, you can have the most elaborate AI strategy and all you will do
is make mistakes with greater conﬁdence than ever before.
And so this notion of being able to harness all of the data, the traditional relational
state, the unstructured data in the cloud, what we're bringing to bear with Cosmos is
actually what brings this solution at Land O'Lakes to life.
We then moved to just variably planting farms to actually changing the type of food
they produce for cattle and for livestock. We've taken the same kind of AI algorithms
for the data that they have and can track the life cycle of a cow and the dairy output
that cow has produced based on the type of feed that they're given and the hybrid
feed that they're fed throughout their life cycle. And again, we're having a massive
impact on the output and the product that they produce.
Finally, the latest state in our journey with them is we're actually using augmented
reality, our HoloLens technology to help not just farmers in North America. But
farmers in remote locations around the world, better understand how to use the
same technology. So we literally have farmers in Africa participating in an
augmented reality session, with farmers in North America to compare the seed yield
output scenarios that we're driving to market with them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 13 of 37So you can see this is a very diﬀerent type of business that we've ever had with our
commercial customers. It's not just about selling them product. It's about actually
changing their business outcomes, their digital realities. The net of it, though, when
you think about the ﬁnancial impact and how Satya reﬂects upon this growing total
addressable market that we have now is just that we're actually doing twice as much
business by revenue with Land O'Lakes as we've ever done before. So there is a real
economic bottom line impact to our shareholders as a result of empowering our
customers to achieve more in their own reality.
I thought I would actually share a video with you, because to me, the most
astonishing impact is actually when you hear it live from the farmer, what's the
impact from the farmer. So please roll the video.
(presentation)
So it's a good story about how what was once just a commercial customer
relationship for Microsoft has actually become a true partnership. We're helping
Land O'Lakes take their solutions to market, sell more eﬀectively. And as a result,
they've created a precision agriculture business in excess of $13 billion. So when I say
partnerships are really fueling our growth, that's happening from Land O'Lakes
through to Boeing, through to Maersk, through to UBS across industry.
I want to talk now a little bit about how we've learned from this experience to evolve
and actually scale it more eﬀectively to many customer scenarios. Satya talked about
the connected car. And we have, in fact, struck agreements with BMW, Renault-
Nissan, Toyota, Ford and Volvo as a result of our digital eﬀorts. And what we've
learned through the engagement at Land O'Lakes is that it takes a diﬀerent kind of
sales force, frankly, to interact with our customers. You have to deeply understand
the industry that the customer operates in. You have to provide much greater
technical expertise. You actually kind of have to roll up your sleeves and code
alongside the customer to help them along this digital journey.
So through our learnings over the last couple of years and engagements like Land
O'Lakes, we've created a Microsoft digital organization that goes and works with
customers like Volvo.
And so you can see on the timeline that we have with Volvo, it's a much more
compressed engagement cycle with very much the same kind of output. We've been
involved here now really in depth over the last year. And we started out with a
precision envisioning session that leverages assets that we called the Book of
Dreams, that talk about how across a given industry you can leverage these
technologies to really change your business and provide material impact. From
there, we decided the most immediate impact we could have for Volvo would be in
how they design products and bring them in market with greater speed than ever
before. So here, we turn to HoloLens and augmented reality again, which enable
them to do much faster turns and iterative reﬁnement on the product design. We
then actually struck a partnership, once again, where we've embedded Skype forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

autonomous modes for their cars. The results for them have been very impactful. The
S90 product came to market much faster than any previous product they've ever
released. They've received all kinds of industry accolades for the innovation they've
brought to bear. And once again, it is a partnership. So again, it's really 3 core things:
digital is fueling a tremendous amount of growth for us. In fact, enterprises, when
they're choosing to go to the cloud are choosing Microsoft because of the long-term
investments we've had with them, the scope and scale, the breadth across industries,
the security we can bring to bear, the local data privacy and sovereignty capabilities
we oﬀer. Then the partnerships that we can create, really again, taking our
commercial customer relationships and creating the digital partners of the future, are
really what's transforming our growth. So that's all I had to share with you. Next up,
Phil Spencer, will talk about our Xbox strategy. Thanks.

{BIO 16406265 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you for that. I appreciate it. So Amy and Satya said if they were
going to let me come out here I had to wear a collared shirt, no gaming T-shirt. So
my counter was I'm going to start with a gaming video. So thanks for putting up with
my gaming video. I'm really happy to be here to talk about what we're doing at
gaming at Microsoft. And why I actually think it rides a lot of the same trends that we
see going on at Microsoft that's causing all of the great growth that we're seeing for
the company.
Now I don't know how many people in here actually track what's going on in
gaming. So I'm going to start with some just basic numbers. And then I'll get into
actually what we're doing in this building oﬀ the strengths that we have.
So gaming all up is a massive business. So we're 2 billion gamers on the planet, over
$100 billion spent in gaming, since 2012 the gaming business has doubled. Basically,
any device that somebody has, when Satya talks about the smart edge, if the device
has a screen, gaming's probably the #1 form of monetized content on that device.
And deﬁnitely one of the highest use and highest engagement sectors. So for us, at
Microsoft, when we thought about our path forward, we said we came from a place
of console. We came from 1 device. But we really started look at the assets that we
had in our business and realized that, obviously, the #1 asset that we have is our
customers and the engagement that they put into our network, that is Xbox LIVE.
What we're seeing going on now is pretty remarkable, Satya mentioned it earlier.
We're seeing game broadcasts just grow incredibly quickly. In fact, if you look at a
major eSport competition today, the ﬁnals almost certainly eclipse any sports ﬁnals
that you're looking at today, whether it's the NBA ﬁnals, whether it's the Premier
League ﬁnals. If you look at something like a League of Legends eSport ﬁnal its
broadcast numbers, it is truly incredible. If you look at game video all up, it's biggerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 15 of 37than Netﬂix, it's bigger than Hulu, it's bigger -- it is just incredible the amount of time
and the amount the passion that gamers put into the activity, the hobby that they
have. And for Microsoft this was a great opportunity for us to ride that digital
transformation.
When I think about a gamer's journey, I'm going to start on a slide that has none of
our content in it, just to think about. Gamers come into the gaming cycle through
many diﬀerent devices. Consoles clearly one of those. The most engaged customers
go out and buy a bespoke piece of plastic to plug into their television to go play
video games. But millions of people are obviously playing games on their phone, on
their PC, any device that they can get, because they want to play content, they want
to build great games. And content is what we believe draws people into our cycle.
And this is why we're investing in great ﬁrst-party content like Minecraft, like Halo,
like Forza, Hot Wheels pack shipped today if anybody looked at it, it's really good,
Hot Wheels is great.
Driving usage into our social network, that's where people become sticky. They
make friend connections across our network. The entitlements of the content that
they own live in our social network. Then they start to build loyalty. If you think about
a typical service graph, you would call this the engagement cycle. They invest in who
their friends are. They invest in their persona. They become very sticky in your
network. Your dow number goes up because the persons coming in. This is where
they communicate with their friends. It's amazing on Xbox Live today when I watch,
we see this spike when kids come home from school. And they get on Xbox Live with
their voice chat microphones on. And they don't all play the same game. They
actually just sit and discuss, it's their hangout, it's their digital hangout. Now some of
them will go play Minecraft together while some maybe go play Call of Duty
together, then they'll come back, then they'll go oﬀ and play diﬀerent games. But it
becomes where their friends, their digital friends live. And where they stay
connected to them. And of course, it starts to drive commerce. And once you start
getting the commerce ﬂywheel going, a magical thing happens. New content
developers come into your cycle and start bringing new games to your network and
the cycle starts all over again. New hits get created in your ﬂywheel. And the ﬂywheel
accelerates. Now when we look at this graph from our perspective, Xbox LIVE is the
thing at the middle. Xbox LIVE is the component of the graph that is accelerating.
And you hear it now. And Amy and Satya talk on their quarterly earnings. We talk
about our MAU number on Xbox LIVE. What usage are we driving. And is that
number going up? And it is. But also a magical thing that is happening that doesn't
show up in that number, it's actually growing across all devices. We have more
engaged console payers than we've ever had. But we also have more engaged PC
players. And frankly, getting our own Windows customers to connect on our own
gaming service should just be table stakes for us. But how do we get these people?
People on iOS and Android to connect into our gaming network. Well if you look at
game broadcast, usually over half of the viewership is on a mobile device. This is
somebody who is actually watching gameplay on a mobile device. And we have a
clear opportunity there to connect the cycle and actually make those monetized
engaged customers in our graph. But obviously, you also have huge content like
Minecraft that's ours that does incredibly well in the mobile space. We invest in our
ﬁrst-party content to kickstart the ﬂywheel in new areas. And owning assets likeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 16 of 37Beam and Minecraft at the same time allow you to create new interactive innovations
between the viewer and the player, which creates both new fun. But also new
monetization opportunities for the streamer themselves and for the content creator
as more people play.
When I talk about loyalty, I also talk about -- this happens to be my avatar on Xbox
LIVE. I am P3 on Xbox Live, if anybody wants to add me as a friend. But it was
amazing thing when we added avatars because we got a lot of feedback from our
core customers before that nobody's going to create an avatar, nobody cares about
this thing. This became not only something that everybody did on our network, it
also became a really good business selling avatar items to let me put my T-shirt of
my favorite football team on my avatar because that becomes my digital persona.
And I want you to think about when we look at some of the trends going forward in
the MRAR space. And what it means if I actually have a representation of me digitally
and how that might ﬂow into a mixed reality world. That's going to be very important
to us. And the commerce has started. In the last quarter of calendar year '16, we
announced we had our ﬁrst billion-dollar monetization quarter on Xbox LIVE. And
the great thing that we see is developers have ﬁgured out not only how to sell front-
line games on Xbox LIVE but monetized into the tail. So as engagements going up
on these games, the monetization is also going up. The fundamental way a game
company drives their business is about monetizing high-value engagement on the
network and Xbox LIVE is the core of that. So you see these great companies
bringing real hits to our business. And we are a major retail partner for these
companies, even forgetting the fact that we sell a console or that we sell our own
games. These are major channels for them selling their own content, which then
means the next hits come in. We have our big show, E3, which is the second week in
June. We'll stand on stage and we'll talk about the next wave of big hits that are
going to come into our gaming graph. So this is how we think about it. We think
about monetization, drives developer power, because developers want to come
where monetized customers are. We will continue to invest in our ﬁrst party
opportunities to accelerate the ﬂywheel all leading to Xbox LIVE growth. The secular
transition right now that we see from broadcast to play, more broadcast hours will be
viewed this year than gameplay hours. And both numbers are actually going up. So
you see this expansion of engagement, not just through players but also through
viewers.
The nice thing about gaming for us as well is when you think about new technology
trends, things that are happening whether -- and I've been around Microsoft and
gaming long enough to remember, whether it's AI, whether it's 3D rendering,
whether it's graphics, whether it's just what a GPU and a dedicated piece of silicon
means in a device to go drive high resolution. Gaming is always at the forefront of
engagement and usage because we know those customers are early adopters. So
when you think about what we're doing in mixed reality today with HoloLens and our
Windows mixed reality shells that we're bringing, you'll see more of that at Build, I
think the gaming engagement that we have is going to be the killer asset that we
have to help accelerate our move into these spaces. And Metaverse isn't something
we've talked a ton about. But when you think somebody living in a virtual social
network like Xbox LIVE. And then that environment becoming actually physical so

Amy E. Hoodthat space and I'm actually able to interact with them directly, the gaming assets that
we've built, the friend network that we have the personas that people have created
on Xbox LIVE will be incredibly important.
Games as a service I talked about. And it's becoming more and more true. Now the
retail game business is still doing well. And you see huge games running -- but huge
games running and doing a great business. But you also see tremendous gaming
assets that are built in a free-to-play model where they rely on that ongoing
engagement and Xbox LIVE is the oxygen that is able to bring users to those
customers -- to those games regardless of what device they're on. And the
broadcasting capability is critical. And Satya mentioned this. The line at the bottom is
another thing that we probably haven't talked enough about. We usually talk about
the consumer-facing features of our Xbox LIVE service. There's a whole another side
of this which is our developer-facing features. As developers want to build these
games, sometimes small developers, 3 people in a garage that have a great game
idea, they now want to build service-based games. They want to build service-based
games that are able to reach tens of millions of players and potentially hundreds of
millions of viewers. And on the back of the work that we do with the Azure team and
Xbox LIVE to create a developer surface for Xbox LIVE, we can unlock the capability
of 1 developer or a room of 400 developers with the tools that we bring. So we're
investing a lot in enabling our Azure game services to reach every developer that's
out there using our learning on Xbox LIVE and the needs that our developers have in
the area of broadcast and gameplay. And the gaming business is riding the same
secular transition in digitization that we see in every other business. And the position
we have with Xbox LIVE, with our ﬁrst-party assets and our ability to reach a
customer on any device that they're on, I think will be a strong growth for us in the
future. So that's what I had.
It's now my great pleasure to get to introduce Amy. And I want to just take one
second because I've been with the company for a long time. And I think there's a lot
that's happened in the company in the time that Amy has been our CFO. I think she's
done a tremendous job as our CFO. She is a pillar of me being at the company and
the strength and the performance that the company has delivered over the past few
years. So please, strong welcome for my friend, Amy, to the stage.
Please welcome, Amy Hood, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer.

Hello. I didn't have Phil just come talk about gaming because he said something
nice. It's actually -- and I'll get a chance to talk about it. We sometimes pick topics for
this audience that we feel like you may not understand the structural importance of
enough. And why they're so important to us and gaming is one of those. So I hope
you got a feeling of how critical we think it is of an asset to the future.
I'm going to quickly sort of talk more ﬁnancially, not surprising, about some of the
trends we've just talked about. Our focus over the past few years has come from theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 18 of 37ambitions that we talk about, ambitions for us also happen to be reporting segments
to you. What I would say though is really the acceleration, however, doesn't come
from their individuality, it comes from their overlap. And so I think what you're going
hear me and you've heard Satya talk about it is really a pivot about how they tend to
work together to make a more important ﬂywheel that builds on itself.
If you think about people, you sort of used 2 frames, right? People and organizations.
One of the fundamental construct of that is selling per user. And there are lots of
things we sell per user. Let me walk quickly through the consumer ideas that we sell
in that value. The ﬁrst one is really Windows. And Windows in its broadest sense. The
goal is for us with Windows has been quite simple over the past few years, to grow
users and grow fans. Windows 10 has higher satisfaction than any previous version
we've had of Windows. We're incredibly proud of that and the journey we've been
on. The progress you see in the gray line of modernizing, that install base,
particularly in consumer is fundamental to creating opportunities for our services to
extend beyond Windows. Things that you might think of as extending beyond
Windows, particular to the OS, would clearly be things like the Store, search and
search and its relationship to the browser. And hence, all the investments we've
made in Edge. And much of the progress that we've made in Edge you see in our
search growth.
What I would say here is I think about really Surface as a fundamental part of what
we do to move Windows forward. Surface has stood for creating new categories. The
2-in-1 category, Studio with an all-in-one that's beautiful, that's optimized for ink and
creation or whether it's the new laptop from last week, we've been announcing
things such at a pace I'm losing time horizons, that one was last week. And what it
says about the future of an OS. And so when you think about our hardware, think
about it as naturally showing and showcasing the innovation we're making with our
software.
Then you think about what's the next thing we sell per user, right? A natural
extension. The ﬁrst and the one people think about the most is 1 of the 2 cores that
we have in terms of especially on the consumer side, consumer vision. It's of course
productivity, right? When you think about what we doing, you think about
productivity. And when we were here two years ago, we were really talking about the
transition to the new subscription model and when we will get through it and would
we get through it? And the answer is we're through it. And we feel really proud
actually of getting to that $26.2 million -- 26.2 million person subscriber base. When
you think about that, that's another networked asset, right, that can take advantage
of the Oﬃce graph and add value to the Oﬃce graph. And I think at this point, even
when you think about the growth curve, we're thinking about here on consumer, you
have to think this is happening even with overall consumer PCs in decline. So this
really means attach is doing quite well. We're continuing to see subscribers, we're
seeing good renewal rates. And we actually feel really good about the value we've
added to this business. And of course, its relevance across multiple end points even
beyond Windows itself.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 19 of 37And we next talk about the next fundamental part of productivity, which was really
the investment we've made in LinkedIn on the members side. Think about as
LinkedIn having 2 fundamentally diﬀerent things, right? It has member value. And
then it has business solutions value. And we'll separate those for this purpose. This is
really saying we have 500 million members. We announced that last Monday as well.
But really, when you think about the health and vibrancy of any network, it's not the
total number, it's whether or not the sessions and engagement is growing. And what
you can see here is that sessions are actually outgrowing membership.
Engagement's getting better. We're adding value. The team is incredibly focused on
adding value to the member. And while member growth is important, it's really
about their engagement and what we can add to them. And if you think about a
slide Satya showed where it shows the Oﬃce 365 graph sort of a LinkedIn data node
as well as -- you combine nodes in your mind, you can see the potential to even add
more network and valued assets to the 2 endpoints I just covered. The ﬁnal one. We
kind of have 2 cores, if you think about it, what we're uniquely good at doing when it
comes to the things Satya talked about. You have to really think about your
competencies. The second one, in competency of bringing this networked active
user bases together is gaming. When you look at this graph, think about the top as
being our total growth we kind of expect overall in the Xbox MAU. What's
interesting, really, is the curve and the acceleration we've had -- this is two years ago.
We had nothing beyond the console, nothing. We're already at 25% of our Xbox
user base, really using Xbox and engaging with it beyond the console. All those
other endpoints that Phil talked about. And frankly, with the extensions and some of
the thoughts we have on the importance of mixed reality to this business, I think, that
number, obviously, we think can go to 40% and I think the real question is when
does it get to a perfect overlap where no one will only play with a single endpoint
ultimately when you think about the extension value and the networked assets. But
you can really see our conﬁdence in our ability to land that broader strategy. And
some people know, this is already $110 billion market, consoles, games and the
services that relate to them. Growing really double digits. So when you think about
us, we've got a multibillion business that's proﬁtable and growing proﬁtably. And the
foundation that lays to add on the new business models, whether as Phil mentions,
ads, subscriptions, selling gaming in that direction, whether it's the ability to think
about ARPU additions through low-value watchers, whether it's the video models
that we have through assets like Beam. I think it really opens up the possibilities that
market far beyond a $100 billion that we're already able to compete very eﬀectively
in.
Now let me pivot to more of the model of the org, adding value to organizations.
And of course, we're going to go right back to Windows and per user value, right? It
all starts at selling user value. And then we'll extend that to departments and
ultimately to app development. But the ﬁrst one, which is what Satya talked about, as
a secure productive enterprise. In our world what a secure productive enterprises is,
is generally, one, think of it as running Windows 10 in a modern state, taking
advantage of security and management, maybe using our unique hardware assets as
an instantiation of what's possible. For example, the Surface Hub a large screen
device, right? It's a natural and only ability for us to create a category that creates a
more productive workplace. You can think about it, of course, as Oﬃce, right, Oﬃce
365. That's a secure productive enterprise asset. Think about it as our most modernFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 20 of 37tools being used and deployed together to have the most secure and manageable
and consistent environment. And we shortcut that to call it the secure productive
enterprise. The ﬁrst component, obviously, is Windows.
When you think about Windows, we've combined 2 things because I think of them
as similar, right? It's sort of what's our OEM Pro business, right, selling commercial
devices and selling our own devices and into commercial businesses. Whether they
want to buy Surface for a certain group of users and not for the entirety, whether it
works better for mobile versus not, it's really about building, again, showcase
devices that extend the building. We've done a very good job of seeing pull on
Windows 10, we've talked about that. We've seen growth in the market. We continue
to see very good endpoint demand for Windows 10. And I think that OEMs have
seen it too in terms of their conﬁdence in building machines in advance of what we
continue to feel as a pretty strong global, actually, environment in the commercial
side.
And on top of that, what I've also added is we added a new KPI this year. And I'm not
sure everybody still understands what it is. So I thought I would take an opportunity
and explain a bit more of it. It's Windows commercial products and cloud services
revenue. What that really means is the part of our Windows value sold into the
enterprise that looks far more annuity like. It's sold more traditionally in our EA, has
the same concept of adding multiyear value. It tends to give you certain upgrade
rights. But when -- the more important things that have resonated far more with
customers have been things like the advanced threat detection tools that we've
launched -- we shortcut it and customers often refer to as ATP. That value is what
we're seeing a big transition here from what used to be even a nonannuity business
for us to a consistent double-digit annuity grower when people see the value that we
put into some of our security and management products. It's, I would argue, a very
compelling price point compared to many of the vendors that we compete with
often in this space.
Next, we're back to Oﬃce. I think two years ago, I showed this exact graphic. And we
said this is what we felt about both growing our install base and moving the install
base. It's just to orient you, right, Oﬃce 365's at the top. It's tough when I use the
shades of blue, we're sort of a blue-themed company. That's the cloud component
of the install base, the annuity component is next. And this nonannuity basis at the
bottom, right? And so when you think about where we are, we're actually tracking
ahead of where we said. And frankly, if you were to look at this graph, this is at 50%
currently of our current install base. So I think we feel very good about the transition
about the pace of the transition, about the deployment numbers. That's the $100
million we refer to publicly and Satya often references in terms of moving our
customers forward to this modern, secure productive enterprise. And so I think when
I look out, I feel pretty conﬁdent in the trajectory we're layering out here. But I also
want you to see the conﬁdence in continuing to grow the install base. Install base
growth for us is in many things like I think you just saw Satya talked about, front line
worker expansion, right, continuing to make progress there. Now this doesn't
actually talk about room for ARPU improvement, right, that's not what this graph is
about. This graph is about moving both growing the install base and moving the
install base forward. When you start to think about our ability to deliver the LTV, weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 21 of 37showed LTV chart also -- these all kind of blend together some days, the same LTV
chart by moving certain customer types. What I would say today is not only am I
more conﬁdent in delivering on every LTV scenario I showed you two years ago, I
think I may be increasingly conﬁdent as we start to see the results in early value
props out of E5. It takes a while for them to land just the way it does with any
enterprise cycle. But I really do feel our opportunity for ARPU expansion especially in
the customers that we've already moved to E3 to conﬁdently move them to E5 gives
me even more conﬁdence that the LTV numbers can continue to even get better
than we showed two years ago.
I also talked about Exchange. Exchange, you'll notice, I think this is one where many
people wonder, could you still grow the install base? Again, just like they wondered
about Oﬃce, not only have we delivered on install base growth, you've seen it, we're
a double-digit install base grower. I do think we continue to have opportunities as
well in Exchange for many of the same scenarios we talked about. I do think we are
on track to do a little better maybe than we thought we'd be. We've actually
accelerated the growth in the past year or so. I still think even when we continue to
add install base, we can continue to still have that cloud transition up into the 70s,
which I feel quite good about. I will call out, in both these charts, the nonannuity
component continues to exist, right? I mean, there continues to be a base there that
slowly comes down over time. But I do want to realize that it won't go -- it's not this
sort of -- it goes away on any given day. This is a bit about the life of any product, has
a bit of a longer tail.
Now I'm going to talk and move from what people think of is that Oﬃce per seat
concept to a slightly diﬀerent per seat concept. Windows and Oﬃce, you think about
them as covering everybody, right? In most entities it's a broad breadth product, you
tend to move organizations in lumps, right, with broad customer agreements we
happen to call enterprise agreements. Quite diﬀerently is our Dynamics investments
plus the LinkedIn business that's more of a business solutions. Sale, right, selling
value to HR professionals or to sales professionals. When you think about this chart,
ﬁrst of all, we have a Dynamics business, it's roughly $2 billion, growing consistently
double digits. But what's really changed is the modern, actually, product road map
that we've delivered on. We now call that thing, for consistency, Dynamics 365. It's
not just the CRM suite tools, it's all the way through, including our ERP solutions are
now cloud based. We sell, not in large suites. But more in a focused role-based
model. The value is quite diﬀerent. We feel very good about our value prop. When
you think about these charts, when we add in the opportunity we have with LinkedIn
and the announcements that we made 2 weeks ago right before earnings on some
of the integrations you'll see, such as Dynamics 365 for sales plus LinkedIn Sales
Navigator. The second product we set in motion that would be ready for July would
be Dynamics 365 for talent plus the LinkedIn HR solution. We'll both be able to sell
those to end customers. And so you really think about that as adding, I think, some
accelerant to our ability to grow on both sides. And this should be over a $5 billion
business for us in FY '18. That is a very meaningful foot in the business solution space.
And I think our ambition here is quite high and our expectations for growth are also
high. I think we have a unique worldview. And you also see the distinction here is in
that combination plus the acceleration wound up with about 70% cloud business
when you look out a year, it will already be a pretty modern install base.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

Page 22 of 37Now let's go to Server & Tools, as I guess people referred to it, ancient history. But I
think that's what I often still call it, dates me. What I would say here is I think the big
question people have always had is was this going to be a transaction business
where you replaced a consumptive workload that we used to sell as a server with
Azure revenue. I feel like with the CAGR that we felt like we've delivered in this
business, which in a constant currency basis, I feel is durable, I think is the word that I
used on the earnings call, durable, double-digit revenue growth. I think we have
shown, really, the power of having an intelligent cloud with an intelligent edge. Think
about that as hybrid shown as revenue growth. And I feel very good, especially if --
and I would urge you to spend a little more time seeing that 2-hour Build keynote-ish
from this morning and watching all the value that got landed, whether it was Azure
stack, whether it was Cosmos DB, or frankly, whether it was some of the SQL and
database value you saw. I think we feel very good about the continuation of value of
the intelligent edge, particularly in this business.
Generally, we have talked in our business about a run rate. And I love run rates. But I
thought because we talk about gross margins, we would show the revenue in
quarter, this is actual nonrun rate revenue. We will have, as we look at the guidance
that we gave, we'll be close to a $15 billion commercial cloud business this year at
roughly a 50% gross margin. We feel like we've made a ton of progress here,
incredibly proud of this business. And I think in many ways, when you look at these
growth curves, this is growing 55% this year on a very big and strong base. And so I
think when you try to get a sense of our aspirations here, I think you can get a sense.
I would also say about our $20 billion run rate target. It's still our target. We'll still get
there in FY '18. And we'll still report on it. So you know when we will get there. That's
what I call accountability. But I do think when you get to this size and you start
getting as close as we are, I think it's easier just to show the ﬂat-out revenue
numbers. And so there you go for comparability as I know you all try to build your
models into summing columns. I think you try to make them sum. But some days.
Let me talk about a little bit about then why all these metrics that we call KPIs, why
do we pick them? Frankly, what you just saw me do in all of that presentation was
explain why each of these matter. In your mind if you can almost think about which
ones relate to each other in a per user motion, they don't correspond to our
reporting segments. Many of our motions are fundamentally connected to each
other but not connected within a segment. And so the appreciation of what really
moves together, right? Windows commercial deployment absolutely can move the
needle on our Oﬃce 365 commercial MAU. The motion of updating your enterprise
to a modern, secure production enterprise absolutely will accelerate user's adoption
of Oﬃce 365. The absolute same is true of the logic we've built with Dynamics 365
and its relationship to Oﬃce or its relationship to Azure, all the Dynamics
components are built on Azure, use Azure, the extensions of them, encourage ISPs to
build through Azure, all of those lands, right. But they land in productivity and
intelligent cloud. And so the interrelationship that we see of these assets, I just felt
like was more appreciated if you kind of use a frame of saying what do I sell per user,
the secure productive enterprise. How does it relate to our ability to sell more
compute, which you all think of as Azure, or more value add. And so these are why
we pick them. But I wouldn't say they move individually. They move in relationship.
Our commercial cloud we talk about is one thing because frankly, our motions ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 23 of 37selling are one thing. And when I think about the results we've seen in Azure this
year, which I'm incredibly proud of. The investments we've made in the sales engine,
think about the stories -- they're not really stories because they're true, that Judson
just said, the customer examples he gave were never about this is an Azure example
couple, this is an Oﬃce a couple, this is an Dynamics example. And oh by the way,
here's a HoloLens example. They were fundamentally about interconnectivity of
these assets. And so I hope if you take away anything from today other than trying to
ﬁgure out the scale of my graphs, that's -- I know, there's like tools that I think do that
for you. So I'm just going to rely on you to go for it. But what I would say is what I
hope is that you understand the scale we're operating at, our ability to continue to
improve our margin structure and the interrelatedness of both our motions in the
ﬁeld and our sales maturity that we've grown as well, as how that shows itself in our
results.
Now I'm going to move to what everybody's been waiting for, which is accounting,
because if you're not excited about accounting, you're going to be after this. Oh,
shape of (AFT), this is what you really waited for, the shape of FY '18. Revenue
growth, obviously, will be continued to be focused on and dependent upon our
commercial cloud strength. Been true for years, continues to be true again next year.
I will remind you as you are building out your models, we still have a headwind on a
phone comparability issue for H1. After H1, it goes away. We do expect the company
gross margin to decline a little bit. That is from commercial cloud. But also we have a
full year of LinkedIn amort in the model. And so I would encourage you to include
that as you think through the structure. We have hardware launches, one of which
Phil referenced which is Project Scorpio. That tends to have and can have an impact
on company gross margins in a given year even if the structural improvement in
every segment increases. Commercial cloud gross margin should continue to
improve, I show you the graph, even as Azure mix increases, which it will. Operating
expenses will have a full year of LinkedIn. We will continue to invest in LinkedIn and
our commercial cloud to support and because of the customer engagement we see
as well as the opportunity we see to deliver and continue to deliver top line revenue
results. FX, hard to predict. But based on rates now, will have a bit of a headwind in
H1 on revenue, really no impact on the OpEx side. Continue to remain conﬁdent in
our LinkedIn impact for '17 and '18. And capital expenditure year-over-year growth
should be similar to '17. This is when we plan quarter-to-quarter. You saw the impact
this quarter, we were light -- could be -- we said it can move out. This one this early,
it's similar. Will continue to evolve and see what we need to do.
Now, accounting. Two new standards got adopted this summer, right, when we start
FY '18. First and the most importantly, neither of them impact free cash ﬂow. Neither,
right? Now, the leasing standard I'll do ﬁrst it's on is the far column. It only impacts
the balance sheet, okay? The revenue standard, which I think is the far more
meaningful one as you try to work through the impact on the P&L. We did disclose in
our Q3 10-Q that it's for a year ago, which is the only one we could completed to
give you the estimate for, about $6 billion of revenue impact. That $6 billion is
primarily, right, the Windows 10 deferral that we adjust for non-GAAP already. So that
adjustment would then go away, right? There is some impact to both the productivity
and business process segment as well as intelligent cloud, because of this
component here. If you sell a new license on-prem in a multiyear agreement, nowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 24 of 37A - Amy E. Hood
A - Chris Suhthat's a -- I'm narrowing the scope for you a little bit, right. So if you sell a new on-
prem multiyear agreement. And you have a new license in it. So it's got to be not just
a -- not a renewal, renewal there's no impact, a new license, you have to account for
the license component up-front, all right. That will have some impact. It particularly
has impact quarter-to-quarter because it depends on the timing of when your EA has
come up and get signed. And it's not consistent through the year. So what it will do
is introduce some quarterly variability. But over the course of the year it's a much
smaller impact, right, because it would net much smaller than any individual quarter.
Now let's talk about how we're going to work you through that transition, just so
everybody can plan. In July, we will report, obviously, Q4 in the old way because it's
still the prior year, right? We will ﬁle our 10-K under the old standards, right? We will
give guidance using the old standard so that you can kind of understand
comparability-wise what Q1 looks like, okay? Then August. In August, we will provide
two years quarterly of restatements. So you'll have all of '16 and all of '17 to start to
see the impact. We will also convert the guidance we gave to the new form. So you
can start to see -- you'll then have -- that will be 8 quarters plus you'll get the
guidance converted and you can start to see trendlines. Then, in October, we will
only report in the new way, right. For some of you that have been covering the
company for a while, this will look familiar to how we rolled out some of the
reporting segment changes because of its familiarity, it tends to work a little bit
easier, it makes Q4 cleaner and the guide cleaner. And then any reconciliations
cleaner. So this is just so you can prep as you think about July and not trying to do all
sorts of conversions in a very, very busy time for all of you too.

Ross MacMillan from RBC. And thanks so much for the presentation today and all the
incremental insights. I actually had a question for Satya. You said, when talking about
SaaS applications on Azure that you had some new business model and problematic
changes coming, that would dramatically change your position in the market. Could
you just maybe drill into that a little bit more?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
One of the things that, Scott, talked today was about how if your SaaS -- business
SaaS application vendor, who is hosted on Azure, the entire tool chain that we have
between Power BI, Flow as well as Power Apps is something that, under no
incremental cost to the customer, they can use that not only with Oﬃce 365. But now
with that SaaS application. And it's got multiple beneﬁts. Ultimately it's about the
customer having the ability to compose applications that span their communication
and productivity pieces in O 365, the Dynamics 365 or any other SaaS application.
Because most of what business process is, is it's going away from these monolithic
suites to composable business process that span multiple SaaS solutions and the
toolchain enables that, the business model enables that. So that's the big shift.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}

Walter Pritchard, from Citi. Just, Amy, on OpEx. I think in past years, you have been
much more prescriptive about, with your range on OpEx. And it seems like there's
actually more moving pieces into next year, just to name some uncertainties you
have, LinkedIn, which was growing their OpEx pretty fast as a standalone. You're
running that standalone. And I guess we want to maybe understand some of these
moving parts in OpEx. Is LinkedIn kind of still growing OpEx like they were
independent, looks like you're actually going to growing your core OpEx, could you
help us understand maybe the factors on those and if there is anything else that we
should think about with the qualitative piece you gave us?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. The reason I didn't give an annual number is, frankly, because we're still looking
at accelerants. I want to be really clear. I feel really good about our commercial
revenue opportunities. And frankly, if you sat through this morning and didn't leave
feeling like we've got a lot of opportunity to grow, I feel badly, actually, like we didn't
do a great job of explaining that. And so, what I would say is, I sometimes think that
when you give an annual number, then you all kind of focus just on that instead of
me saying, wait, we should spend more because we are landing revenue growth.
And there's so much opportunity for TAM expansion. And so frankly we're still
working it. LinkedIn, I do really think of, as a separate entity. We run it that way. They
run much more on a calendar year basis, not a ﬁscal year basis. Works ﬁne for me.
And so we're still working through with them what FY '18 will look like. We feelFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

Q - Philip Alan Winslowconﬁdent what H1 will look like, not as much on H2, we'll work on it. And so this is the
sort of my level of conﬁdence currently, recognizing that I feel like you all know, that I
work hard with the SLT and Satya to make sure every dollar we spend is put on the
right place. So everything I said doesn't mean that we're not working hard to
reallocate capital, move it to the diﬀerent places, make sure we feel terriﬁc about
where it's going. But I'm not quite ready to say x is the number.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
And I think Walter, you've tracked us for a long time. And I think you've consistently
asked us even about how do you see new business growth and then obviously how
proﬁt growth that's commensurate with it. But I hope that what we have
demonstrated over the last multiple years is, we're repositioning this company to
participate in new growth markets and the discipline that Amy talked about is
underneath, you may not see it obviously in the just the aggregate number. But the
amount of what I would call capital allocation that happens internally is probably one
of the more tough things that we've done in the last multiple years. And we'll
continue to do it. Each one of these businesses has got diﬀerent opportunities. I
mean, if you take even the LinkedIn case, some of the integrations we talked about
are going to be funded in a big way so that we can make sure that we realize that
potential. I mean, yes, we run it "standalone" so that the culture of LinkedIn and the
way they innovate is maintained. But it has not stopped us in some sense from doing
all of the important integrations. So it's probably the ﬁrst acquisition where we just
got some pole results back, where people in the company are feeling great. And on
top of that, we have all of the integrations on where we head as a road map are all
on track. And so to me that art form is what we need to master and make sure we
foster. And we'll always take those opportunities.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And just so you're clear, he means the happiness of employees at LinkedIn, ours are
still happy. But -- and I would also say we also did our -- got our survey pull back too.
Our culture and our conﬁdence is also at all-time highest inside the company. And
so, I think both of those are a good thing.

Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo. A question for Satya and then follow-up for Amy. Satya,
wonder if you could provide some historical context because obviously from the
picture that you are here this morning, that you were here for the client survey area
at Microsoft. And I want to talk about the intelligent edge or we call it Microfog,
whatever you want to describe the next paradigm. But wondering if you give us
some sense of the previous paradigms? Main frame to client server, client server to
web tier. You saw this tick-tock between centralized and distributed and then the
expansion out a number of devices and applications. What do you think is similar
about intelligent edge, Microfog, whatever you want to call it. And what's dissimilar
from the prior cycles and then just a follow-up to that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

Microfog. I think, I'll have a better name for you, intelligent edge. The thing that there
is for sure what is secular in all of this is what I think you referenced, which is there is
going to be more computing. And computing is going to be more distributed. And
so if you sort of take that, this makes absolute natural sense. That's why we always
conceived of hybrid, not as lets tier the cloud to some legacy. But let's tier the edge
to the cloud. That was sort of the design point that we built even for SQL Server 2017.
The fact that you can take a database and stretch it, is adding a cloud tier to it. The
thing that's perhaps exciting in terms of this generation versus the client server
generation is the expansive nature of the devices, right. I mean, think about the
computer that is running at in commodity cameras with computer vision, not
something we saw in the client/server era. Some of the work Microsoft Research is
doing is taking some of the DNNs that we have and the ability to compress them
using some techniques like pruning and binarization. So that you can run them even
on a Cortex M1. And so that means, you've trained in that cloud, you're deploying on
the edge, doing inferences on the edge. So to me that's what's going to happen. It's
going to happen with end-user computing, it's going to happen with IoT, it's going
to happen at home, it's going to happen in meeting rooms. And to me, what is -- the
currency of here is data, as Johnson said, it's data that's semantically enriched.
Microsoft Graph is that, right, it's semantically taking people, their relationship to
activities and their devices, making it a ﬁrst-class developer platform, hugely
important when you want to stitch experiences across devices together, having this
edge compute in intelligence, super important. So I think, in some sense it's the
most natural thing. But it's much bigger than any client server opportunity we had.
And it's going to be bigger if I sort of in tandem with the cloud bigger than what
people conceived as just cloud computing, because cloud computing by deﬁnition
on its own has limits. You can't sort of have centralized computing that spans all of
our computing needs.

Michael Turits from Raymond James. This is a question for Satya, perhaps for Amy as
well. You guys have spoken a lot about machine learning in the last year. And I
assume invested there as well. How do you guys think about monetizing that
primarily in the balance, is that primarily the Dynamics that Azure will just be smarter
and, therefore, more value-added and more proﬁtable or there's speciﬁc SKUs and
there will be monetization of that, what's the balance between those?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
That's a great question. Time will tell in terms of all of the various monetization
vehicles. But we think of the fundamental technology that's going to be pervasive
throughout everything that we do will have a high component. So you're right, today,

cool things is Windows Hello and the speed of image recognition for instant on and

capable. Because 250 million of them next year will be AI enabled, if you will, with
those capabilities, with both speech computer vision and touchscreens. Then, as you
rightfully pointed out, every SaaS application, whether it's the LinkedIn newsfeed,
which probably is one of the biggest attractive things for us to apply a lot of AI
technique because of the yield on that page to what we're obviously doing with our
search, to what we're doing with Xbox LIVE. For example, when we do player
matching, that's an AI inclusion. Then, of course, in Dynamics 365 and Oﬃce 365,
everything from the focused inbox to how we do security is another huge area where
AI is being deployed. But on Azure, we're already seen how AI can get built in to
some of these higher-level services. I mean, take one of the things that we did with
the recent release of SQL. You now have SQL Server at the edge capable of reaching
a GPU running Python or R. And so you really converted essentially even SQL into an
AI product. So we will have multiple infrastructures, SaaS and even our end-user
devices and operating system all infused with AI. And in the process, we will also
look for other AI products. And so, it's a broad spectrum. But we start from a
structural position of infusing AI into business that we're in.

Now that we have HoloLens, we're now taking the same shell and that's going to be
part of Windows. That's what you'll see tomorrow, powering every Windows machine
that's capable with this mixed reality shell. So for us, we don't think of VR and AR as 2
separate categories. One app model, one shell and one platform play. So that's
showed to some degree the biggest monetization in the short run will be starting
this fall, every Windows OEM license is essentially monetizing VR for us or
monetizing mixed reality software asset. And of course, we think the ultimate
computer is the computer that you have in front of you all the time. So vision
becoming a computer is something that, we believe in and we'll keep making
progress on it. So you'll see us change form function with new devices, create
categories and democratize those categories. We're not, as I've always said, in the
device business just to be in devices. But to do you even get the software right. I
think, Allen Kay is the one who said, if you're ever serious about your software, you'll
build your own hardware. And that sort of one of the things that we're learning by
building these devices. But we have a clear strategy like we've proven by building in
HoloLens and then democratizing it through all OEMs, all devices and that's how
you'll see this monetize.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And even how many of the VR experiences people have today, how many of them
are even come from a Windows PC. And so I do think when you think about
monetizing, Mark, it would -- it is, I think, not per se about the hardware, although we
may. It's eﬀectively building the ecosystem that runs that creation activity at its core.
And you tend to see it whether it's OEM license or not.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
And I'd say 2 are the things since we have both Justin and Phil here, which is one is
gaming, is they are in Minecraft. And VR and AR is deﬁnitely in mixed reality the big
deal for us. So that's one of the monetization level for us. And if any -- and we knew
that going in and we always anticipated that in some sense. I wanted to buy
Minecraft because we knew that this was going to be the case. But the frontline
workers and the traction we have in frontline work, I had not sort of thought of it as a
place where -- most of these digital transformation projects, as you rightly pointed
out, most companies are investing in tech now for their frontline workers. But they're
not traditional compute endpoints. And interestingly enough, HoloLens and itsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

How about you come up here in front, Shannon.
(Shannon Cross), Cross Research. Satya, can you talk a bit about the hybrid cloud
and how you see the progression? Included there's a lot of discussion about Azure
Stack today. And I think one of the comments was sort of got to Azure Stack and
then it's easier when you ﬁnally make the transition. But I'm curious there is sort of
timing and how you're thinking about it playing across and maybe how the new SQL
announcement today as well sort of play into that?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, we have customers who have existing estates, whether that's
compliance, data sovereignty needs, other reasons why they want that ﬂexibility with
hybrid. And whether it's our SQL product or Windows server product or a
specialized appliance, essentially like Azure Stack, we will have all of those options.
That's one side of the conversation and we're maturing that and making a lot of
progress on it. Like even the carnival cruise line, there are some use cases where you
absolutely need that. But what's most exciting to me though is this emergence of this
new edge, right. So that -- there's one way, I think, the conversation -- the way you
even talked about the question is, I want to take my estate and move it to the cloud
and this is "stop gap." Some of it is true, which is people will even say, "Hey we want
this to be a hybrid environment for a while because we are regulated" or "we're not
yet sure of the cloud." But what is interesting is, that this edge is a permanent state,
not a transitory state, which is you want to have Azure Stack as the edge of the cloud
or you want SQL deployed inside of Azure Stack as a permanent state or you want
the Azure IoT runtime. And the reason for that architecturally is pretty
straightforward, why? Because you're generating tons and tons of data. I was just
talking to somebody in the oil and gas industry. And the amount of data justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

A - Satya Nadellabecause of the census that are generating is growing, car example I already gave.
And you don't want to rendezvous all of that with the cloud, you just cannot. The
latency will not allow it, the bandwidth will not allow it. And you need to still make
inferences locally, because you do not want to wait for some model to get uploaded
in the batch way to tell you that something is going to go wrong and you got to
make a real-time decision. And so compute will go to where data is getting
collected. So that's the new phenomena. Just as we're talking about hybrid and
cloud growth, that's happening, while there is even the edge of the cloud that's
growing in parallel. And that's, I think, the exciting part and sometimes you could
even say there's a complexity to it. But to me architecturally my approach for both
those use cases is exactly the same. So it's not like we're doing something diﬀerent
for somebody who wants to use it as a way before cloud. But I'm also essentially
future prooﬁng them for what is post cloud event.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Let's go to the center.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Thanks for your talking time this afternoon. I want
to talk a little bit about digital transformations. Digital transformations seems like
something that today is very much an enterprise play. Justin was telling us about sort
of specialized team to go in to Volvo and change their business processes. But
Microsoft has always been about all hawk size companies. How does that go down
market, does that go to small and mid-size businesses. And if so how? How do you
get your partners and the resellers to actually be able to do digital transformations
on?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
That's a great question.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Great question. I would say, on that second part, I think the answer is ISVs. I think the
best way is every ISV -- one of the things that's so fascinating to me is whenever I visit
a country, you see the Dotnet, SQL, ISVs by industry, right. We have a huge install
base with these ISVs build essentially, digital transformation solution in the client
server era. Now we want to recruit each one of them, have them build using all of the
componentry. That's why we want to give them as much leverage as possible. Here is
IoT. Because I want even a SaaS like mentality to the building blocks of Azure. So
that, that developer whom we know deeply can get maximum leverage so that they
do the work that they can do in their country. So these micro verticals, by country, by
geo, I think is going to be a signiﬁcant part as a way to scale. The thing that is
happening, though, is -- the big transformation story. You take Nissan, you take
Volvo, you take Boeing, they all have supply-chain and distribution chain. So they are
acting as those ISVs. So in some sense, what Judson said, I think is pretty much,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

A - Amy E. Hoodwhether it's Land O'Lakes or Boeing, they are to us now like what SAP was say in the
mid-90s when I was sort of working with them on SQL. So to me, interestingly
enough, these industrial transformation applications being done by large companies
are essentially ISV solutions that span out to the supply chain.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And I do think, you're right, this has always been. We've actually had a great and
strong enterprise business. But we've always done incredibly well in the mid-market
and below through both -- whether it's our partners or the extension through our
ISVs. One of the example Satya gave, that I do think we probably should have
people understand better is this motion around App source for us, Power Apps, that
is a very natural way to provide digital transformation. The way most businesses
experience it, which is in smaller chunks. Take my own ﬁnance organization. I could
name 5 or 6 things we've done in the past six months, which were about using
smaller components. You change an audit chain, you change a tax process ﬂow. The
partners in those it may be KPMG, it may be EY, it may be another third-party. But
those are pull for whether it's Azure, or there are some of them are built into Oﬃce,
some of them use a bot framework to do credit services. That is digital
transformation. But Don, I think these are very -- listen I love Judson's examples, they
are big, they are massive and they are complete. But I would say, just as many we're
seeing are the way even we've gone about it. And that's actually all small companies
or even midsize companies have to do and are capable of doing those same
changes at that scale. We do rely on partners primarily for that motion.

Let's, how about Karl.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Thank you, Karl Keirstead of Deutsche Bank. A question for Amy. Amy, I was
intrigued by the slide you put up on the server product business and I did some
quick mental pie chart sizing.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
And it looks like you're calling for pretty extraordinary Azure growth in ﬁscal '18. So I
wanted to ask you assuming that and given that you're not guiding to an
acceleration in CapEx next year, it would seem that one take is that Azure gross
margins must be poised for some pretty good expansion in ﬁscal '18. So I wanted to
ask you is that the correct take and if that's true and Azure becomes a larger portion
of the cloud mix, is it actually possible that the rate of increase in your overall cloud
gross margins goes down next year because the Azure piece is so large?

A - Chris SuhOne, that must be (inaudible) work. So this is the downside of technical innovation, I
guess. It's edge intelligence right there in Karl's PC. Here's what I would say. I am
incredibly conﬁdent in the Azure business that we've built over the past year. The
investments we've made, you literally see them, in the examples Judson gave. And
the customer adoption we've seen and in really the changing conversations that we
have with customers. So I do feel very good about it. Certainly, there's some of that
conﬁdence is shown in that slide. Whether I'll get my mix right between how it lands
and -- versus Azure or Azure Stack and it shows up diﬀerently. Listen, this is us right
now telling you where we think it will be. It's bull park, right. But the conﬁdence is
certainly there. And your comment around is that sort of how to think about the
gross margin at the commercial cloud level is absolutely right. Azure will be with this
growth rate and increasing mix in that number, even if I have high expectations for
Dynamics and Oﬃce 365 that you saw as well. And so I do think it may -- it could
weigh a bit more. But again this is sort of -- it depends how the mix roles through the
year. I also have great optimism, for example, in Dynamics 365, where the margins
are obviously structurally quite diﬀerent.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I mean, one of the things, Karl, is that's tough to model.
I know nothing is tough to model for you all. But for example, every IoT project that
ﬁrst started, started as just a IS project, then they started consuming some of the
higher-level services we had in IoT, which had SaaS like characteristics in a very
diﬀerent margin structure. And the thing we realized is as soon as you're doing IoT
and you're doing data analytics and predictions, you need ﬁeld service. And so we
started seeing ﬁeld service attached. These are -- these new things that start at one
place and then will end up in a diﬀerent place. And so there is mix as well as the path
dependence. So to me one of the key guidance for especially our ﬁeld is to become
world-class at being able to envision that for customers, because if you are very
short-term focused, we won't see the transformation. That I think is, would be a big
miss on our part on your behalf, if we don't go after this generational opportunity,
we are so well very positioned. And I'll deﬁnitely take that with your permission.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
But what I would say is what you're hearing Satya say is more that, when we think
about compensation or models for our sellers, we think about it as the commercial
cloud moving the entirety of their estate experience, whether it's the per user motion
I talked about, whether it's the I'll call it per department, because it's a business
application. That motion plus either Azure sitting under it, whether it's Windows 10,
which shows itself as IoT, those motions were sort of wanting the equal amount of
passion for in the ﬁeld as opposed to just Azure or just this or just that. And that's
why I say, I think, I'm close if it shows itself in a slightly diﬀerent mix because of the
way the contracts land. I mean I'll live with that as long as we're transforming the
customer in the right way.

One for Satya and one for Amy. Satya, your position on the of intelligence cloud,
intelligent edges, very unique position relative to two other public cloud companies.
When do you think that position will manifest in terms of the kind of market share
that Microsoft can gain in the public cloud that's more akin to what you've had in the
legacy on (inaudible), which I think is 60% to 65% share of workloads. Do you think
we could ever be at a point where you could replicate the kind of market share with
your pivot intelligent -- cloud intelligent edge? One for you, Amy. If all of this is right,
in ﬁscal '20, do you think commercial cloud, $30 billion run rate is crazy or is it okay
within the ballpark at a 60% gross margin if I could add?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
On the ﬁrst one, I would say the following, which is, I think most people forget we
had tough competition even in the client server era. We were not marketing, it
depends on -- we may have had unit market share leadership in positions. But we
did not have, for example, in the database revenue market share. We were very, very
low share compared to others. So I look at this as not like, oh we had a lot. So
therefore we should ﬁrst recoup that. I think that there is -- the TAM is much bigger
than it ever was in client server. And so we're going up with that as our fundamental
posture. The intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge is absolutely structurally
something that's unique to us. But at the same time, we'll have fresh and new
competition. There must be something we're doing right, as I said, that we attract
every 10 years new competition and that's awesome. And it's too early to start
thinking about share, when -- as we are talking about it, the fundamental architecture
or what we are counting is shifting. But I do believe that the digital transformation
infrastructure opportunity is going to be lot bigger for us than anything we achieved
in the client server era.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
And I'll just say, we'll be close to 15 on a pure revenue basis this year, at a 50%
margin. I feel really good about that. What I focus on is, I want to continue to see
revenue growth across all the nodes. And I want to continue to see margin
improvement across each node. How that manifests itself in one number over time,
we'll just wait and see. But it's very clear, every team working on this has as much
passion frankly as I do about we've set a bold target. I'm Superconﬁdent we're going
to get there. Whatever next target we set or don't set, it will continue to be bold. And
I think what you should see in these numbers is our ambition. This morning to this
afternoon. And I really hope you'll tune in again tomorrow. I think, you'll see a
diﬀerentiated vision. Where you ﬁnd value. And where you ﬁnd margin is ultimately
in diﬀerentiation. And so, that is what we have to land. If we do that, we'll be in great
shape, is much more how we think about it.

A - Satya NadellaOne last one. I appreciate all the interest. I think we have time for one more though.
So 2 questions actually, if I may, for Satya. This morning you spoke of -- your
comments this morning rather and again this afternoon, brought to mind comments
from the earliest part of your tenure, which had to do with ubiquitous computing and
artiﬁcial intelligence. And you're evidently building upon that. It's clearly
propagating. The question though is, could you talk about Microsoft's own internal
execution and management of product development. You have over 30,000
employees in R&D at any given time. You have 2,000 or more that you're looking to
add and it's a big complex organization. Could you talk about what changes you've
made to the execution, process, management of development to continue the road
map in execution that you've achieved so far? Secondly for Amy, could you talk a
little bit more about your cash ﬂow expectations. You've just recently got into a $40
billion annualized run rate in cash ﬂow, is it unreasonable to expect that sometime in
next two years, you could get to $50 billion or more?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
On the ﬁrst piece, you're absolutely right, which is the term I used. I think, in the ﬁrst
mail even was ubiquitous computing an ambient intelligence. And as all things,
many of these ideas are not new, these are ideas out of Xerox Parc. And the -- it's that
realization of distributed computing that I think we're seeing. Where there's going to
be more computing in our lives, there's going to be because of that more social
complexity of computing for end-users and more complexity of distributed
computing that needs to be tamed. And we deﬁnitely are positioning with that
worldview as opposed to thinking about it as client/server Redux with 1 mobile app
and 1 cloud app. That's a pretty narrow mobile ﬁrst cloud for its deﬁnition, this is the
more expensive deﬁnition of it. The cultural change at Microsoft is all-encompassing,
quite frankly, because in some sense the way for us to approach how we do R&D
cannot be done just by thinking about R&D. We have to sort of say everything from
what our sales teams are doing to what our developers are doing. We're in the
business of trying to anticipate unmet, unarticulated needs of customers. Yet, you
got to get into that posture, especially in a company like ours that has had
tremendous success. Sometimes those feedback loops get sort of disturbed. You got
to get back into it, where you are able to conceive of new ideas and then go at it
with uniqueness, which is, there is no point looking around and say, hey who else is
doing what and let's just do that. That's just not the way innovation is driven. So I feel
that we have that sense of purpose, we have our set of worldview of where is
technology going, in tech you can't just meander. You have to have a ﬁrst-class view.
You march before its conventional wisdom and stay with it. And then you got to have
ambition. You can't sort of be beholden quite frankly, do any org structure and
category deﬁnition. That's one of the other things that holds you back, one of the
things Amy and I ﬁght all the time internally to make sure, is we're not doing
allocation based on previous revenue and backward looking structures. We've got to
be able to think about something that's new. So I would say it's really, every group
changing and it'll never be done. And I will never claim any perfection at any point in
time. If anything, I'll have my list of things that I'm and terrible at. And I hope we use
that as inspiration to keep pushing, keep pushing. But I feel good that people areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-05-10

shortcomings and get better, which I think is the start of anything.

And on free cash ﬂow view, I think.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
That's quite the transition.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
That really was from of a worldview of internal optimism and how you build
relevancy to free cash ﬂow. They're related by the way. What I would say is we're at
that point where gross proﬁt dollar growth, especially, I think, our conﬁdence at
where we are in the cloud. And you've seen those transitions, you've seen our
increasing eﬃciency. And even though, I think, demand is high and I feel good about
that, I do think the improving eﬃciency you'll see in the capital expense, which I've
talked about. Ultimately, even if I did give a guidance around operating expense,
you know that we're always going to do exactly what every successful company
does, when they want to exist and be durable over decades and decades, they
reallocate. And they move and they move conﬁdently and they consistently do it. I
think that will also impact positively ultimately free cash ﬂow. And so while I'm -- I
don't do two years, I barely did the shape of 18. I do think it's certainly metric we
have focused on more in the past year in terms of discussing it and guiding to it. And
it's certainly something I managed to internally in terms of what ultimately matters,
especially when you got a lot of stuﬀ running through the P&L.
