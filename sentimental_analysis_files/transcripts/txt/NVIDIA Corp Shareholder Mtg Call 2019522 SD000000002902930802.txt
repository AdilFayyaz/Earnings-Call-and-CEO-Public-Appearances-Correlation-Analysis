Page 2 of 11Thanks, Jensen. First, a few housekeeping items. We have opened the online portal
for stockholders to ask questions during the meeting. If you have a question, please
enter it into the portal. And we will do our best to answer it at the end of Jensen's
business update in the time permitted. In fairness to all attendees, we will limit each
stockholder to 1 question within our allotted time for Q&A. We welcome the views
and comments of all stockholders. But in order to conduct an orderly meeting, we
cannot respond to those that are irrelevant to the company's business or operations,
related to pending or threatened litigation or personal grievances or are derogatory
or in poor taste. We may also provide a single response to multiple questions
generally asking the same or similar things. You can also vote your shares online until
the polls close.
During the course of this meeting, we may make forward-looking statements based
on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number
of signiﬁcant risks and uncertainties. And our actual results may diﬀer materially. For
a discussion of factors that could aﬀect our future ﬁnancial results and business,
please refer to the reports we may ﬁle from time to time with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K. All our statements
are made as of May 22, 2019, based on information available to us as of today. And
except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.
We will ﬁrst address the matters described in the company's proxy statement dated
April 12, 2019. We will then complete the balloting process. An announcement will be
made regarding the voting results. And then the oﬃcial portion of the meeting will
be adjourned. Jensen will provide a brief business update. And then we will answer
questions received through our online stockholder forum as well as questions
submitted online during the meeting.
I have a complete list of the stockholders of record of NVIDIA's common stock on
the March 25, 2019, record date for this meeting. I also have an aﬃdavit from
Broadridge, certifying that they commenced the mailing of the relevant proxy
materials on April 12, 2019. I am appointing Chris Woods of American Election

{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thanks, Tim. This past year, we posted strong growth and made signiﬁcant advances
in computer graphics, high-performance computing, artiﬁcial intelligence andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-22

Page 4 of 11robotics. We did this against the headwinds of cryptocurrency and an array of
macroeconomic uncertainties. It was a very challenging year.
But our core belief in our mission to apply the computing model we pioneered to
solve problems we can uniquely solve remains as strong as ever. NVIDIA is at the
center of modern AI, the greatest technology force of our time. AI, a combination of
special software and chips, enables computers to automatically recognize complex
patterns and perform tasks learned from a great number of training examples.
Simply put, AI is software that learns. If computer programming enabled automation,
then AI is the automation of automation. In a way, AI is software that learns and
programs itself.
AI starts by learning from a vast quantity of data on joint computers powered by
NVIDIA's Tensor Core GPUs. Imagine learning language by studying every document
in Wikipedia or the Library of Congress. To do this in a reasonable time, companies
use NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, a new breed of GPUs we invented. These are the
same processors that create and simulate virtual reality video game worlds but
enhanced for artiﬁcial intelligence. NVIDIA's AI computing platform is used by nearly
every Internet company and oﬀered to researchers and developers by all cloud
service providers and computer makers. We're an open platform.
Our work in AI is built upon a computing approach we pioneered over a decade ago
called CUDA accelerated computing. CUDA achieves performance simply not
possible with normal computers. It requires an end-to-end approach from processor
to system to system software to algorithms to understanding of applications and
continuous optimization between them. CUDA is the architecture of all of our GPUs
and all of our systems. It's been downloaded some 13 million times. There are 1.2
million GPU developers in the world today.
Over the past several years, we've extended CUDA with domain-speciﬁc
acceleration libraries for our growth markets. Collectively, we call this suite of
libraries CUDA-X.
Our strategy led to strong ﬁnancial performance last year. Revenue grows 21% to
$11.72 billion. And gross margins expanded to 61.2%. GAAP earnings per share were
$6.63, up 38%. And we returned $1.95 billion to shareholders through dividends and
share repurchases.
Our gaming business grew 13% to a record $6.25 billion. Our ProVis business also
achieved a record year, growing 21% to $1.13 billion. And our automotive business
grew 15% to a record $641 million, driven by the adoption of next-generation artiﬁcial
intelligence capabilities under the hood and inside cockpit. Our data center
business, which is up 52% to $2.93 billion did not meet our expectations as
customers slowed their purchases in the Fourth Quarter. This overshadowed what
was otherwise a landmark year of expansion of our data center portfolio with new
technologies for inference and data science.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-22
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 11As reported in last week's Q1 results, NVIDIA is back on an upward trajectory with
growth in gaming laptops and RTX adoption leading the way. Accelerated
computing is a kind of supercharged computing. This year, we made great strides to
advance it. We introduced Turing, the world's ﬁrst GPU designed to accelerate ray
tracing, a method that simulates the physics of light to create realistic computer
graphics. Ray tracing was ﬁrst described by one of NVIDIA's researchers 35 years
ago. NVIDIA RTX ﬁnally makes it possible to do in real time.
The support from game, ﬁlm and digital content industry has been overwhelming.
Microsoft announced a new Windows DXR API that NVIDIA RTX accelerates. Epic
and Unity, the game engines that power the gaming industry, both announced new
engines for RTX. Major game studios are developing games with RTX. Pixar
announced adopting RTX for future ﬁlm production. Every major renderer supports
RTX, including Adobe and Autodesk. It's now clear that ray tracing is the next
generation of computer graphics.
Soon every gamer and creator will enjoy the dazzling eﬀects -- results as the entire
graphics industry moves to the new standard of ray tracing. NVIDIA is the engine of
modern AI. Our computing platform addresses the end-to-end development of AI
from data processing to AI model training to model deployment. We start the AI
journey in training. As AI models of all kinds are entering large-scale deployment,
our focus is expanding to inference. In inference, the use of NVIDIA GPUs is rapidly
growing for applications where latency is critical like real-time video analytics, real-
time object detection for self-driving cars, speech recognition and conversational AI.
AI will continue to drive hyperscale and cloud Internet companies with new services
like conversational AI, which is on the cusp of broad adoption. At the same time, AI is
spilling out of the cloud and into enterprises and their products and services at the
edge.
The world's largest industries, transportation, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing,
robotics, smart cities, retail are deploying AI to build autonomous machines and
intelligent devices. We've partnered with the world's leading systems makers to
build NVIDIA edge AI servers for the enterprise and the edge. We've developed
domain-speciﬁc platforms spanning cloud to edge technologies to bring AI to
vertical markets. These platforms will be connected to public or private enterprise
clouds but will be doing AI near the action, perceiving and recognizing the context
and automating tasks.
For transportation, NVIDIA DRIVE is an open end-to-end platform for autonomous
vehicles, from AI computing infrastructure to simulation to in-car computing.
For healthcare, NVIDIA CLARA supercharges medical imaging instruments with AI,
boosting an essential tool of early-disease detection.
For robotics, NVIDIA Isaac oﬀers a virtual reality simulator where robots learn skills
and Compaq Computer for all kinds of robotics, from warehouse bots to delivery
bots to service bots.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-22

to create services that will make our cities safer and more eﬃcient.
Cloud to edge AI will further fuel the exponential growth of data and put more
demands on computing at every point along the way. Its biggest impact will be on
the biggest computers of all, data centers. As Moore's Law comes to an end, the
traditional approach to data center design no longer applies. Data centers will need
to be architected as giant compute engines with tens of thousands of compute
nodes, designed holistically to -- with their interconnects for optimal performance.
Mellanox solved this early. Their high performance InﬁniBand interconnect
technology and high-speed Ethernet products are used in over half of the world's
fastest supercomputers and in many hyperscale data centers. For our part, we're the
best in the world at developing high-performance computing platforms. Together,
NVIDIA and Mellanox can optimize data center scale workloads across the entire
computing, networking, security and storage stack. We look forward to closing the
acquisition by the end of this calendar year. The world's demand for computing
shows no signs of slowing down. The computer model we pioneered is the best path
forward to serve the world's insatiable computing needs. The markets it serves are
important, large and growing. We have excellent strategic positions in all of them.
And we're inspired to continue to advance the most powerful tool of our time.
Thanks, Jensen. We'll now move to Q&A. First, we'll address questions and
comments that have come through our stockholder forum. And then we'll respond
to those that come through the virtual meeting portal. We created the forum so that
our stockholders would have the opportunity to ask us questions prior to the
meeting, allowing for more eﬀective communication.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
I will read out loud each question or comment, except removing personal details. In
some cases, we received multiple questions asking about the same or similar topics.
So we have grouped those questions together to avoid repetition. As Tim mentioned
earlier, in order to conduct an orderly meeting, we will not address questions or
comments of a personal or derogatory nature, those related to pending or
threatened litigation or those that do not pertain to NVIDIA's business or operations.
First question. After a disappointing Q3 and Q4 of 2018, how do you, as directors,
plan to restore value to your shares and the company as a whole? Do you plan to
distance manufacturing farther from the crypto market due to a surplus of
merchandising left in the wake of the unexpected drop-oﬀ in crypto markets? What
are the 3 main factors that are likely to increase the stock price in the upcoming
quarter? Can you get the stock price back to $250?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-22

The fundamentals of NVIDIA's long-term opportunity are strong. The accelerated
computing model NVIDIA pioneered is leading the computer industry forward. And
artiﬁcial intelligence, of which NVIDIA is at the center, is the most powerful
technology force of our time. NVIDIA is working to create long-term value for
shareholders through our platforms that address large market opportunities in front
of us. While we faced turbulence at the end of last year due to higher inventory in
the channel than desired, we're conﬁdent in our strategies and growth drivers
looking forward. We believe NVIDIA is back on an upward trajectory. We're focused
on driving 3 growth strategies: RTX ray tracing, acceleration in AI computing and
robotic systems like autonomous vehicles. We're also excited about our pending
acquisition of Mellanox, which will help us drive data center architecture for high-
performance computing and AI from the cloud to the edge.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Next question. What political contributions are you planning to make?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
NVIDIA does not have a political action committee or other formal plan or process
for making donations to politicians or political parties. Of course, our employees are
free to make individual choices and donate to tenants as they see ﬁt.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
How is NVIDIA planning to diversify its portfolio? Is it planning to enter new
segments?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
NVIDIA is focused on some of the highest growth and most important industries of
tomorrow. We are a leader in consumer market with our gaming business. We're the
engine of digital designers and creators all over the world. Our AI computing
platform is in every major cloud service providers and oﬀered by leading computer
makers. And we serve important industries from transportation, healthcare, scientiﬁc
computing retail to ﬁnancial services. We discussed our long-term strategies and
business opportunities in detail at our Investor Day in late March. You could view the
presentation and webcast in our Investor Relations website.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
How did you use Trump's tax cut? How much went to you and how much to the
shareholders?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
The ﬁnancial impact of U.S. tax reform has beneﬁted NVIDIA. But our tax rate is
based on a number of factors, including our geographical mix of proﬁts. We operate
and are taxed in many diﬀerent countries. So the 14% U.S. corporate tax -- U.S.
corporate rate reduction does not directly translate into a corresponding tax savings.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-05-22

A - Jen-Hsun HuangWe outlined our strategy for use of our cash at our Investor Day in March. Our
presentation and webcast for Investor Day can be found on our Investor Relations
website. After we complete our Mellanox transition, our priority for our cash is
investment in our business so that we can realize the large and expanding market
opportunities we have in front of us with gaming, data center and autonomous
vehicles. We will invest in hiring and related needs as well as key capital investments
and facility and computing infrastructure. Our next use is to fund our capital return
program, which continues to return value to our shareholders through quarterly
dividends and stock repurchases.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
What is the executive compensation? How much does the average employee make?
And what is the percentage of the executive compensation? And how do you justify
that diﬀerence?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
The compensation of our executive oﬃcers is detailed in our 2019 proxy statement,
which is posted to our Investor Relations website. The proxy statement includes a
section called pay ratio, which compares my compensation to our median
employees' compensation for ﬁscal 2019. Last year, our median employees'
compensation was $155,035. And the ratio of my compensation to our median
employees was 88:1 for the second year in a row. By comparison, the average CEO
pay ratio for public companies was somewhere around 270:1. Taking care of our
employees and their families is incredibly important to me. So we oﬀer competitive
compensation as well as comprehensive beneﬁts. Building a company where the
greatest minds come to do their life's work is the best way we can serve our
shareholders. We aim to provide total target compensation for all levels of
employees globally at the 50th to 65th percentile of market. Plus, all employees
receive equity and are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan so
they can share in the growth of our company. Each year, we ask our stockholders to
vote on our executive oﬃcers' pay, as we are doing today. Our compensation
committee considers the result of the say-on-pay vote as well as pure company data
when it determines the structure of the following year's executive compensation
program. The program is designed to align our executives' interests with those of
our stockholders by emphasizing performance-based cash and long-term equity that
is only earned if the company achieves rigorous ﬁnancial metrics. We've been
pleased to receive positive feedback from our large stockholders regarding our
compensation program during our annual engagement eﬀorts.

How is the lack of substantial progress in the trade negotiations with China aﬀecting
the current and 2020 business performance of NVIDIA in the country? Has the trade
situation in China aﬀected proﬁts?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
There is relatively little direct impact on us from the tariﬀs on China imports. Most of
our partners have moved or are moving their impacted assembly work to other
regions such as Taiwan and Mexico, which aren't aﬀected by the tariﬀs. But the tariﬀ
war is obviously not good for anybody. And we hope the U.S. and Chinese
governments look for a solution that is wise and leads to fair trades, which is
important to all of us.

Have you considered selling yourself or merging with another larger company,
including Apple?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We are building one of the world's great companies, meaning technologies that will
drive the most important industries and lead to long-term growth. We believe
technologies and markets that we're focused on like artiﬁcial intelligence, are
signiﬁcant growth opportunities for our company and stockholders.

We are pretty excited about the global growth of eSports. We have many marketing
activities in this arena, including streamers, team and tournament sponsorships, for
example, NVIDIA was the oﬃcial graphics platform of The International in 2018.
GeForce also holds boot camps from its eSports studio in Santa Clara, Munich and
Shanghai, where it sponsors teams to come train for tournaments on RTX-powered
systems.

Stockholder questions and feedbacks are important to the management and board.
We decided to hold our annual meeting virtually because it invites participation by a
broader group of stockholders. To provide a similar level of engagement to the in-
person meeting format, we have invited stockholders to submit questions through
our pre-meeting forum and now during our meeting. Given the number of questions
we've received and answered, I think the format has worked well. Simona, back to
you.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
One more question, as it came in over the portal. Would you please give us an idea
of how much revenue is generated for NVIDIA on a per trust basis on the TuSimple
Chinese autonomous projects, which is powered by NVIDIA tech that includes
NVIDIA GPUs, DRIVE PX 2 autonomous computer, Jetson TX2 and more? Thank you.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thanks for the questions. TuSimple is one of the most innovative autonomous
trucking companies in the world. And they're doing really spectacular work. Rich
sensors surround the trucks and they look quite far down the road. And the amount
of processing necessary to support all the sensors and the redundant and diverse
algorithms that are running in the DRIVE PX computers is really quite signiﬁcant.
There are many GPUs that are inside a TuSimple autonomous driving truck. And one
of the things that's -- that this highlights is really the open platform of our
autonomous vehicle system. NVIDIA's DRIVE is adopted by startups and self-driving
cars, robot taxis, trucks, shuttles, grocery delivery bots of all kinds, buses of all kinds,
it is an open platform and it's end-to-end from data processing to deep learning
training for artiﬁcial intelligence models, to simulation of regression of a large body
of data all the way to the autonomous driving computer inside a car. And so as a
result, companies all over the world could take advantage of this open platform to
enable the world to move towards a safer and more eﬃcient world of transportation.
And so this is a really exciting growth opportunity for us. Thanks for your question.
