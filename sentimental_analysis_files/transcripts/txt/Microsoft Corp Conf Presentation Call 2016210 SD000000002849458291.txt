{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Thank you, everybody, for sticking with us this afternoon. We are honored to have
Microsoft with us today. We've got Bill Duﬀ, Corporate VP and CFO of the Windows
and Devices Group. He's held multiple positions at Microsoft since he joined in
2004. He was the CFO of the Operating Systems Group, CFO of the Phone Division.
He led Strategy and M&A for the Mobile Communications Business and, prior to that,
he was in investment banking at H&Q which was acquired by JP Morgan, as we all
know.
So with that, thank you for making the time for us today.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Thanks for having me. This is (inaudible).
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So this is a conference where we have specialists and generalists. Obviously
everybody knows what Microsoft does. But can you help give us just level-set people
on what comprises the group that you're responsible for. So what's in the Windows
and Devices Group?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. So Windows and Devices -- probably the best way to think about the Windows
and Devices Group is when you look at our reporting segments, Microsoft reports its
results along three segments. One of those segments is called More Personal
Computing. And More Personal Computing is comprised of Windows -- our core
Windows licensing business; Devices -- so that's both Surface phones and all of our
incubation devices; Gaming, which is really our Xbox business; and Search. And
those four areas comprise More Personal Computing. And the way to think about my
role is I'm the CFO for that segment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-10

Great. Thank you. So again, you've been at the company for 12 years. Satya took over
a few years ago. What are the biggest changes you've noticed in -- we've read a lot
of stuﬀ about it being external parties -- but what are the changes you've seen put in
place ﬁrsthand?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. I think -- it's been an interesting time at Microsoft over the last couple of years. I
would say during my entire 12 years, it's been interesting -- a lot of change. But if I
look back over the last couple of years and sort of what's happened at Microsoft, I
think there were a few big things that really changed the direction. And what you're
seeing at Microsoft today is a direct result of these. And actually, one of them
happened right before Satya became CEO. We did a very large reorganization under
Steve Ballmer. And it was really one of the things that he did prior to leaving the
CEO role. And he did a reorganization of the company into four big product groups
and really organized the company around engineering. And so we had an Operating
Systems Group, a Devices Group, a Productivity Group and a Cloud Group. And a lot
of the innovation and product development that you're seeing today is a direct result
of that. On the Operating Systems side, we brought together Windows, Windows
Phone and Xbox. And we started to leverage the technology in a much more direct
way and think about a more unifying product vision from that. And Windows 10 and
some of the products that we've delivered recently came out of that organization a
couple years ago. Then when Satya came on board, he really embraced that
reorganization. And I think he did two main things that got us on, I think, a better
path from Microsoft perspective. First, he very clearly laid out the strategy and the
aspirations for us as a company. So we talked about a mobile ﬁrst, cloud ﬁrst world
to reset. Like this wasn't the PC business. This wasn't sort of the legacy Microsoft
business. This is the new world in which we're competing. And we need to be
relevant in that new world and we need to move directly into that new world. I think
he laid out a couple of clear aspirations for us as a company. He talked about $20
billion in cloud revenue and really focusing on investing in that area. And we think
that's an enormous opportunity for us at Microsoft. And he also talked about -- more
relevant to my area -- a billion monthly active devices. And this is really about
reigniting the Windows ecosystem and the Windows client platform and thinking
about the business as not only a transactional business where we sell a PC. But
thinking about it as an ecosystem and a long-term relationship with our customer
and thinking about our business model in a diﬀerent way from a Windows
standpoint. So I think he clearly laid out the strategy and the aspirations. Then,
married with that, he's really focused a lot on culture. And I know this permeates the
media a little bit. But there's a huge change within Microsoft. I think he talks about
the growth mindset. He talks about leaning into issues, not getting locked in to old
paradigms, rethinking opportunities and how we compete and just upping the pace
of change and innovation at the company. And it's really permeated throughout --
particularly in the product groups. But I think all across Microsoft. So the pace of
change, leaning into the opportunity, having the clarity about the long-term goal has
really worked well over the last couple years. And I think internally, from an
organizational standpoint, people feel pretty good about where we are.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-10

With Windows 10 -- and you somewhat alluded to this so now you've got Windows
kind of all merged -- one code base. Now that you've kind of changed your go-to-
market strategy a little bit with Windows 10 in terms of how you're doing the
upgrade, how do we -- can you help people think about the -- you're just thinking
about Windows monetization entirely diﬀerently than you did in the past. Can you
share with us how you think about it?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. Yes and no, we're thinking about it diﬀerently. Certainly when we thought about
Windows 7 and our operating system business with Windows in prior generations,
we really thought about a multi-year development cycle. We would launch our
Windows version and then we would sell a lot of devices and then we would go back
and work on the next version of the operating system. And really with Windows 10,
we're thinking about it completely diﬀerently. From a product perspective, we're
thinking about it and we call it Windows as a Service where we're continuously
improving and bringing new functionality to Windows on a much more rapid
cadence. And so somebody who chooses a Windows 10 device is going to get this
enhanced functionality and improved functionality over time. From a business model
perspective, we're also thinking about that engagement and how do we deliver
value to our end customers and how do we capture some of that value in our
business model. We think there are big opportunities for us, both on the enterprise
side as well as the consumer side. Some of this is showing up in our results right now
where you see us talking about our attached businesses -- or our post-sale
monetization businesses. You hear us talking about the opportunities in search, the
opportunities in gaming. So fundamentally we're thinking about a customer lifetime
value for a Windows customer. We're thinking about the installed base more versus
the upfront transaction. And this has really changed how we develop the product,
how we market the product and then how we engage with our customers after they
buy Windows PCs.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So with over 200 million Windows 10 users today -- and Satya put out a goal of a
billion devices in 2 to three years -- I should say there's 200 million Windows devices
today. And he (inaudible) out a billion in 2 to three years. How do you get from here
to there?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. I think if you look at -- one of our biggest strengths as a company is our installed
base of PCs. And there's a massive installed base with PCs. Estimates are over 1.5
billion active out in the world today across both commercial and consumer. So we
think that's a massive opportunity to upgrade our current installed base, or users that
are already using Windows PCs -- it's a fragmented base. So we still have users using
XP machines. We still have a lot of users on Windows 7. We have a lot of users on
Windows 8. So part of it is just upgrading this installed base and making sure thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-10

Heather Belliniwe're delivering the value in Windows 10 such that it makes sense for customers to
upgrade. We're seeing a lot of early success on this. And we're seeing -- we talked
about the 200 million unit ﬁgure. The vast majority of that is upgrades. But we also
have new device sales and we're bringing innovation to Windows for new use cases,
new form factors, new price points of devices. And so also we'll get there through
selling new devices and continuing to satisfy both the commercial PC environment --
which we're starting to see the upgrade to Windows 10 -- and also the consumer
side where the consumer side still has a large vibrant PC opportunity)
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
How do you get -- so fast-forward a couple years.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
You get to that 1 billion users. How do you think about reaching that next billion? I
know these are big chunks we're talking about. But whether it's Oﬃce users or
Windows users. How do you think about getting this -- a new base of customers, a
lot of which might be in emerging markets at this point?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. In my last answer, I talked a lot about --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}

{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Technology? Then we have investments across the company in a bunch of diﬀerent
areas. So if you think about outside of Windows, we have services that we're
delivering much more to customer bases on other platforms -- so on Apple devices
or Android devices -- today. That's been another shift that Satya has really --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Overseen over the last couple of years. If you think about our mobile strategy, not
only are we continuing to ship Windows phones. But we're also getting much more
focused on delivering Microsoft ﬁrst-party services across all of these diﬀerent
platforms, whether that be Oﬃce, whether it be Skype -- Skype's always been there.
And so one of the opportunities is to engage these users on Microsoft ﬁrst-party
services and then make sure that we deliver better value with Windows and bring
them back to Windows. Then there's just new device categories. And in one of these
areas that we're really focused in the Windows and Devices Group is what are those
new device categories and what new incubation opportunities do we have because
the world just doesn't stand still. It's -- we've seen the rise of mobile over the last
couple of years. There's going to be new platforms that come along. We're investing
in those new platforms on a software -- from a software perspective and from a
hardware perspective. And so we're continuing to lean outside of the PC ecosystem
to look at what are those next opportunities and to make sure we catch them at the
point in time where we can be successful in expanding our market opportunity there.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So again, as you mentioned, you've gone from multiple code bases to one code
base in Windows. Talk a little bit about how that has helped the speed of innovation
for the platform, as well as helped you reduce cost.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. This is one that's been a multi-year journey for us. I mentioned earlier that we
had a big product reorganization a couple of years ago. And what we did is we took
the Platform groups together and we took Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox and
put them together and put them on a unifying platform. At that time, we took a lot of
cost out of the system. If you thought about the way Microsoft was structured before
is we were structured sort of on a vertical business group basis. And each business
group would make their own decisions. And because there were certain market
realities, we had a lot of duplication of work. So you had multiple teams working on
networking (stacks), you had multiple teams working on store and commerce
systems and things like that. And I would say over the last couple of years, we'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-10

Bill Duﬀtaken a lot of that out of the platform. There's still some left to do. We migrated the
Xbox (inaudible) installed base to Windows 10 before the end of the year. So we'll
continue to get eﬃciencies as sort of all of these platforms migrate to Windows 10
and our new platform. But from a platform perspective, a lot of those costs have
been taken out. So it's more a matter of us making sure we're investing in the right
areas and investing for growth. Where we see the bigger beneﬁt now is on the
cadence, as you mentioned. And so we're not in an environment where we'll ship
Windows and then three years later we'll ship another big version of Windows. We're
on an entirely diﬀerent cadence. And we haven't quite exactly said what that
cadence is and how -- when our next release is coming. But we are on a step-
function increase in how we're delivering new services to Windows -- new
functionality and new services to the Windows platform. And so you'll see that
cadence really accelerate.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Does Windows as a Service help combat piracy at all or are they always one step
ahead?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Piracy is a -- has been a challenge for us historically. We had --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
For all of software. You're not alone. You have good company.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
For all of software. Yes. Exactly. We -- it does help in certain instances, I think. We've
actually been fairly successful in certain parts of the world through working with our
hardware partners, working with innovative pricing programs and changing our
pricing structures and strategies, thinking about our customer lifetime value and
thinking about the value of the opportunity a little bit diﬀerently. And I think all of
those factor into sort of making sure that -- there's sort of two elements of piracy.
There's the element of we want to provide the best Windows experience --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
And for us to provide the best Windows experience, we want to make sure it's
genuine, that the experience is not hijacked in any way. Then there's the business
model aspect. Both are really important to us. And we're working on both of those in
tandem.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-10

Okay. I want to switch to the Devices part of the segment for a minute. When you
ﬁrst launched Surface, there was a lot of debate in the market about whether this was
the right direction to take the company. But if you fast-forward to today, you guys
seem to be out-innovating the people who've been doing this the entire lifespan of
the company -- and I'm talking about SKUs such as Surface Pro and Surface Book. So
how do you, even today, strike the right balance because you guys continue to -- or
at least to most people -- seem to be out-innovating kind of -- a little bit more each
year?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. We -- you're absolutely right. When Microsoft entered the Surface business, it
was a big change for us. And it was a big change for our partners as well. And I think
at the time there were many tough conversations with our partners about what we
were doing, why we were doing it. And what we hoped to achieve. And we were
pretty consistent, even at that time, to talk about our investment in innovation. So we
felt like there were investments that we were uniquely capable of making across the
hardware/software layer. And there were investments that we were uniquely capable
of making from a -- deﬁning a new category and building market awareness around
a new category. And that's what we really did with Surface. And so what I think you
will hear now is a lot of our hardware partners understand the investment in Surface.
If you look at 2-in-1s as a category within PCs, it's certainly a growing category within
PCs -- all of them are leaning into the opportunity and all of them see this as a --
strengthening the health of the Windows ecosystem and pushing it in new directions
and expanding the opportunity for Windows. And I think we continue to think about
hardware in that way. We continue to think about it as a way to drive innovation, a
way to expand the market opportunity for Windows. And also as a way for us to also
be proﬁtable. We think there's a proﬁt opportunity as well. And it's striking that right
balance because we do get tremendous scale from our hardware partners. They're
incredibly important to us. I actually think that they're doing great work. If you look at
the premium laptops that are in the market today from our hardware partners,
they're better than they've ever been. We have amazing lineup, they're leaning in to
a lot of the innovation. And it's striking that right balance with our hardware partners.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
How important is it for Microsoft to maintain a presence in the smartphone market?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Phones has obviously been a challenge. I think that mobile is a big opportunity.
Mobile is an adjacent opportunity, if you think about it from an overall platform
ecosystem perspective. We've retrenched over the past year. We made some
announcements over the last -- over last summer where we've restructured our
phone investment. Instead of trying to compete in all markets at all price points with
all customer segments and being a (of-scale) global provider, we really entrenched
and said, "Where do we think we can drive innovation and where do we think we canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-10

Bill Duﬀget some initial success and grow from there?" And so we're continuing to invest on
the software side for mobile scenarios. And that mobile scenario is everything from
all screen sizes.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
So in screen sizes, you can think of Surface as being a mobile scenario. You can think
of smaller screen sizes being mobile scenarios. So we'll continue to invest on the
software and the hardware side there. But we are where we are and --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
We'll continue to compete.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
If Android ends up owning the majority of the developing markets even still kind of
5, 10 years down the road, how do you ensure that Windows is something that
people in these countries grow up with and know and are familiar with and use as
they enter their professional lives?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. I think that whether --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Does it matter? Maybe it doesn't matter.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Whether it's developing markets or developed markets, I think Windows has to be a
diﬀerentiated value proposition. We think we have diﬀerentiation in a lot of diﬀerent
segments of the market. We certainly think we have diﬀerentiation around
productivity. We think we have diﬀerentiation in the enterprise. A lot of these are
developed market scenarios. We have diﬀerentiation in gaming. But for us to really
compete overall, we have to know what we stand for, we have to continue to drive
diﬀerentiation. And we have to eﬀectively compete with the right business models in
the right (inaudible).FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-10

Bill Duﬀ
Heather Bellini{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
And we're driving down both of those. We have -- on the business model side, we
talk a lot of sort of thinking more holistically about our business model, thinking
about a customer lifetime value, thinking about what are the diﬀerent licensing
programs and services that we can deliver so that we can compete at diﬀerent price
points in the market. And so it's one of those things where we are going to continue
to compete globally and it's up to us to make sure that Windows has a very strong
value prop there.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
If we switch over to Xbox for a second, what would you say are some of the key
growth catalysts as you look out over the next few years?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Xbox is interesting for us. It's -- when we think about Xbox at a very high level, Xbox
is an amazing franchise. It's got a deeply-engaged customer base and it has a great
brand with the gamer segment in general. Xbox as a business, historically for
Microsoft, has been a very console-led business. So the whole business model was
to sell in the console and then the attached services to the console -- or to drive
engagement through the console. And really one of the things that we've rethought
and that we're changing with Windows 10 is to think about Xbox as really the gaming
platform. And if you look at the overall gaming addressable market, console is a big
market opportunity and Xbox is a big player there. PC is a bigger market opportunity
in the gaming market. And really they're not a signiﬁcant player there, other than
underlying technology. We (inaudible) license fees. We participate in that way. But
we don't have -- we've not extended Xbox to the PC. And so we're thinking about
Xbox as much more of a community. So we think about -- the key metric for us is the
engaged user base and our Xbox Live active users. We've actually shifted the way
we've talked about it publicly from how many consoles did we sell to how many
Xbox Live active users do we have. And we think there's a lot of power there and we
think there's a big market opportunity to bring our Xbox across console and PC and
to engage users with content -- our own ﬁrst-party content. We acquired Minecraft
recently. That sort of expands us across form factors and it also expands us out of
core gaming. We have a Halo franchise. We have great ﬁrst-party franchises and we
have services that we can deliver to that highly-engaged user base. So we think
that's a pretty big opportunity for us.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I want to pause for a second and see if there's any questions from the audience.
Okay. We'll hold them for a second. So another way you've been monetizing XboxFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-10

Bill Duﬀhas been transactions -- right? -- and the marketplace. Can you share with us kind of
how that business is evolving and kind of what you see for the future?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. We -- Xbox as a console-led business continues to do very well. We've seen
some shift from retail to digital. But overall, overall transactions continue to grow.
Engagement continues to grow on the console. What I was talking about earlier was
really about how do we extent that to the Windows ecosystem and the Windows 10
devices. And we are going to bring back content to our Windows devices. We
actually launched the ﬁrst launch of a AAA game through the Windows 10
marketplace recently -- Rise of the Tomb Raider. It's early. We're learning. But when
you think about bringing this content to Windows and using our distribution
mechanisms and our engagement mechanisms across our global customer base, we
think there's a big opportunity for us to distribute third-party content through our
store. Gamers are a big part of any store transaction and that's a signiﬁcant area of
focus for us.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Now how do you think of virtual reality as an opportunity for Microsoft? Not
HoloLens.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
We'll get to that. Because virtual reality -- because you guys have been relatively
quiet versus, say, what Sony's been talking about from a console perspective and
with Gear VR. Obviously the ocular (inaudible) is only running on Windows
machines. But how do we think about whether it's HMDs or using a Windows device
as similar to what we're seeing with the Gear VR? Where are you guys? What are you
betting on there?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Well I think we've bet on -- we're -- as we were talking about earlier --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}

Bill Duﬀgaming, whether it's entertainment, whether it's productivity. It's just the use cases,
to me at least, from my opinion, are signiﬁcant and out there and obvious. But we're
still very early. And so from a Windows perspective right now, we obviously have our
ﬁrst-party bet, which is hardware on HoloLens. And we can talk about that in a
second. On the virtual reality side, a lot of the virtual reality players are leveraging
Windows PCs. And if you think about it as part of the Windows PC ecosystem, we
have diﬀerentiation on Windows there. We have diﬀerentiation in terms of the power
that we provide with these devices. We have diﬀerentiation on graphics. We're
investing a lot in software in that general area. But we haven't really talked at all
about any sort of ﬁrst-party roadmap in that area.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And any questions from the ﬁeld? I was going to shift. I don't know if someone
raised their hand. Anyhow, from a video game perspective --
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
First-party (huddles). You guys have had people talk about what if Halo were a VR
game, right? How could would that -- how do you think about software development
at Microsoft for VR?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Software development for VR -- we actually have a pretty signiﬁcant eﬀort. Some of it
is on the gaming side. Some of it is on --

{BIO 18415528 <GO>}

Yes.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}

business. But this is ﬁrst-party content across our platforms. And so we think about
what are the devices that we want to target with our games and how do we thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-10

Bill Duﬀabout it bringing value to our ecosystem. And so if you think about our Studios, a lot
of it is around Xbox Live and sort of engaging with the Xbox Live user base. And so I
think these new type of gaming scenarios are going to be a big part of that. We also
have pretty signiﬁcant eﬀorts, I would say, on the AR side with HoloLens --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
To make sure that we're providing the visionary scenarios and the proof points
where people can see what's possible on these types of platforms and the types of
opportunities that they unlock.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So with HoloLens, it seems like you're taking -- correct me if I'm wrong -- making
more of an enterprise bet initially than a consumer bet? In the past, we've seen this
type of kind of revolutionary technology take oﬀ faster on the consumer side. Is
there a reason why -- what was behind the decision to focus on the enterprise ﬁrst?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
I think it was more around -- we see a big opportunity across both. We see some
really, really interesting use cases on the enterprise side. When we talk to our
customers, they're very excited about the diﬀerent scenarios that they can see with
HoloLens on the enterprise side. And so --
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Can you share with us some of those enterprise use cases, broadly speaking?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Well they could be anywhere from virtual showrooms, if you think about it from a
sales force type of scenario. So you don't necessarily -- you're sort of in a room, you
have your goggles on and you can see -- you could see cars, you could see other
things to sort of -- you're not necessarily in a physical showroom.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right.

Bill Duﬀlook in a certain environment? There's all sorts of stuﬀ that's just really, really
interesting. And once you sort of walk through some of these scenarios, you start
thinking about the 10 other things that are interesting as well.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Right. I wanted to go back to -- one of the stats that Oculus put out was that right
now -- I think Nvidia put it out, actually -- the installed base of PCs capable of
running Oculus (inaudible) about 13 million.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
How do you see this as a driver of PC demand over the course of the next few years?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
I think it's a good opportunity for us. Any sort of innovation -- gaming has always led
innovation on the hardware side, on the software side and the PC industry. And
there's -- gaming is a -- the gaming PC market is a signiﬁcant part of the overall PC
market. So when we see these new use cases that require faster processors, more
memory, higher-resolution screens, all of the new capabilities from the hardware
side and the capabilities from the software side, we think this will factor in to the
overall demand on the PC side. It's tough to -- it's tough for me to know where I think
the long term is extremely bright, as I talked about for these things. I don't know
what's going to happen over the next couple of years. We'll see. It's -- we're early
stages and it's pretty speculative.

It's -- if anyone hasn't checked out the HoloLens part of their website, you should
check it out. There's a lot of interesting demos on there, both from a consumer and
an enterprise side.
