{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Welcome, everyone. I'm Brett Iversen, Vice President of Investor Relations. This is the
ninth in our series of quarterly videos, focusing on strategic areas that are top of
mind for our investors. Today's discussion will focus on a couple of our
environmental, social, and governance or ESG initiatives. We brought together two
of our key leaders to answer your most frequently asked questions. We have Melanie
Nakagawa, CVP, and Chief Sustainability Oﬃcer, and Natasha Crampton, Vice
President and Chief Responsible AI Oﬃcer. As always, we welcome any feedback on
speciﬁc topics, the format, or other suggestions you might have after you view the
video. Please reach out to our investor relations team directly with any feedback.
With that, let's kick things oﬀ. Thank you both for being here. Excited to get into this.
To start, the areas of responsible AI and environmental sustainability, we get a lot of
questions from our investors, it's very top of mind, you know, how would each of you
summarize the core commitments in your areas?
{BIO 21843910 <GO>}
I'll get started. So thanks so much. So in 2020, Microsoft had made commitments to
be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste all by 2030, while also protecting
ecosystems. We're three years into that journey and we remain steadfast in that
commitment. 2022 was a reminder to all of us that to mitigate the most severe
impacts of climate change, our impact needs to extend beyond the four walls, and
we must continue to accelerate investments that will enable progress for decades to
come. We believe that Microsoft has an important role to play in developing and
advancing new climate solutions, but also recognize that the climate crisis can't be
solved by any single company, organization, or government. The global community
needs partnerships, policies, and global commitments to really ensure a healthy
future for all of us.

A - Melanie NakagawaYeah, this is a great question, Brett. And when it comes to responsible AI at Microsoft,
it is both a practice and a culture. So in practice, we've been working to advance
responsible AI for nearly seven years now. We've built an internal governance
structure for developing and deploying AI, and it's really grounded in these six core
principles that we have. So, fairness, privacy and security, reliability and safety,
inclusiveness, accountability, and transparency. We put these principles into practice
across the company and at all levels of the company. And this approach is really
helping us build a culture of responsible AI as well.
As a company-wide eﬀort, it engages teams working in policy and research and
engineering. And as we've done for sustainability and accessibility and security, we
really want to evolve from responsible AI being something that people must comply
with to something that they actually really strive for and take pride in.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
I love it. Thank you both. For each of you, you could talk about -- and you've kind of
alluded to this even in the opening, but why this is so important to Microsoft's
success. How do they mitigate risk, what do they mean to our employees and
customers, how do they create new opportunities? Whatever you want to hit within
that basket of questions I ask you, Melanie, maybe you can start us again on this.
{BIO 21843910 <GO>}
Well, ﬁrst on this, it's a -- this is the basket of issues. We really see it in three ways. It's
getting our house in order, it's what we're doing with customers and then globally,
how do we have an impact? So earlier this month, we released our annual report in
May of this year. That is our annual sustainability report, and it really shows that
progress into this three-year journey that I talked about on our way, the 2030
commitments: to be carbon-negative, water positive, zero waste and to protect our
ecosystems. We reported on carbon -- and I'll get into some details here. On carbon
that while businesses grew -- while our business grew 18%, emissions actually
declined by 0.5%. On water, we were able to contract for over 15 -- over 15 million
cubic meters of water replenishment projects.
And that's really going to be over the volumetric lifetime of those projects. On waste,
we have that zero waste target. We actually diverted around 12,000 metric tons of
solid waste from landﬁlls and incineration across our direct operational footprint.
And on ecosystems. We actually have protected over 12,000 acres of land. So
meeting our company's carbon-negative commitment is intricately interdependent
on transitioning the world to clean energy infrastructure at the end of the day. Our
paths will be similar and progress will appear slow until the foundations are really set
and ready to take place. So like training for marathon as a runner I think some of us
are, it will take focus, planning, and perseverance to reach the ﬁnish line. Our
sustainability-connected community at Microsoft, they are over 9,000 strong here at
Microsoft. These members and these employees provide such a vital component to
how we're collaboratively driving progress on environmental change, both within the
company and externally.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13

A - Brett IversenOn that second basket, the customer sustainability journey, as a tech company, we
have a role to play with a thousands of corporate customers, who put their trust in
Microsoft technology. Many of our customers have already made a climate pledge,
and Microsoft is working to help move them from pledges to progress, much like we
are. Companies can only manage what they can measure. And Microsoft is
committed to helping our customers measure their environmental impact in a timely
and accurate manner. So in June of last year, 2022, we launched the Microsoft Cloud
for sustainability. This is a comprehensive environmental sustainability management
platform that includes the Microsoft Sustainability Manager. Microsoft Azure
customers also beneﬁted from signiﬁcant upgrades over the past year to the
emissions impact dashboard, which helps customers understand that emissions
impact from the results of their use of the Microsoft Cloud. And then we also
released a preview version of something we call the Microsoft Planetary Computer.
This enables customers to measure, monitor and manage ecosystems that may be
aﬀected by their operations and to make important decisions related to climate risk.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes, a lot happening. I have three girls at home. And I -- they peak up -- they perk up
the most when they hear what we're doing on sustainability because it's so talked
about amongst their peer group as well. So what would you add?
So from our responsible AI point of view, we've always operated Microsoft for them
is core belief that when we are designing and developing AI responsibly, we're not
just leading, developing responsible products. We're developing fundamentally
better products. And we've known for a while that trust is really essential to the
adoption of new products. And it's particularly true when you're talking about
frontier tech like AI. So that's why we've been working so hard to operationalize our
eﬀorts across the company and build this culture of responsible AI as I was
mentioning.
Look, our employees are being trained on responsible AI practice there and learning
how to integrate our practices into their work. And we've been building tools and
providing resources to help them on their journey. Look, as our customers are
exploring the immense potential of AI, they're turning to Microsoft not just for our AI
products, but for insights into how to deploy it and use it responsibly. So we really
want to share as much as we can. We are committed to making sure that our
customers do have that knowledge necessary to use AI responsibly, and that's in part
why we've published our own material. So we have a playbook with the responsible
AI standard. And we publish that externally to make sure it's available as a resource.
We've also shared a template for an impact assessment, which is one of the early
practices that we adopt for our responsible AI work. And we've shared sample
transparency notes as well.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
You both are busy, I'm sure. The trust piece that you mentioned, I have a lot of
friends on the sales side, and you're going kind of to the cloud portion of our
business and all the products and solutions we sell there. They -- it's the biggestFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 13A - Natasha Cramptonthing. Like you would think it's price and things like this, when we're competing
against some of the other great companies out there, but that trust piece is the
biggest portion of the decision that they're hearing consistently. So I'm touched on
it. Maybe another one for you. You've been involved in the responsible AI work
through key points of the development that we've been on. Can you help us
understand how it's evolved over time? And move from principles to really, to your
point, kind of core in the operations on how we do it?
Sure. So I think it's fair to say that a decade ago, this ﬁeld of responsible AI that we've
been pioneering at Microsoft, it just barely existed. So for nearly seven years now,
we've worked to advance responsible AI at the company. And we think of this as sort
of building artiﬁcial intelligence products and services grounded in strong ethical
principles. So let me give you two examples, concretely, of how we've progressed
this practice over the last seven years.
So at the very beginning, we had those six principles that I mentioned earlier, and
those principles continue to serve as the North Star, but principles alone are not
enough. So one of the things that we've done is we've taken those principles and
really double-clicked down on them to provide concrete, actionable guidance for
our engineering teams. So we've basically answered the question of how do you
build an AI system fairly? What does it mean to be accountable? What does it mean
to be transparent? So we now have this playbook that our engineering teams use,
and as I mentioned, we make it available publicly to really spell out the concrete
actionable steps that need to be taken to live up to our commitments here.
Second, we've been working on tooling. One way of making sure there's a
consistent practice of responsible AI at Microsoft is to build tools to keep engineers
in their day-to-day workﬂows. So whether it's tooling for fairness or interpretability,
or making sure that we're really understanding if we are seeing errors, why are they
clustering in a particular way? We've built tooling for teams to be able to understand
that better. And we don't just build that for our teams internally, we actually bake it
into Azure ML, our development platform, so that all of our customers can take
advantage of it too. So look, today we have almost 350 employees focused on
responsible AI as part of their role. And we've got people integrated in our product
teams, and they come from a huge range of disciplines. Next year we intend to grow
this number of people working in this space even more.
Look, I have found over time that organizational structures do matter to our ability to
meet the ambitious goals that we've set for ourselves here. And so one of the things
that we have done over time, as well as building out the practice itself, is to make
changes to our structure, to make sure that our needs are being met. So last year we
made two key changes to our responsible AI ecosystem. First, we made critical new
investments in the team responsible for the Azure Open AI service. This is a service
that has all of the cutting-edge models from open AI available within it. And second,
we infused some of our user research and design teams with specialist expertise that
had previously been centered in one particular team.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13

A - Melanie NakagawaSo, the way I think about this is, responsible AI has today been a journey and it will
continue to be. So as we go forward, we know we need to learn and continue to
evolve along the way, especially as governments now are starting to deﬁne more
concrete policies and regulations that will govern this space. Now as we go, we're
committed to sharing our learnings and making sure that we are learning from
outside the company as well.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 21843910 <GO>}
Her governance point is just so important because on sustainability, we share many
of the same important issues. So on governance for sustainability, we've had the, I
guess, privilege and opportunity to have our commitments announced by Satya and
Amy Hood and Brad Smith in 2020, really demonstrating the executive sponsorship
for commitment. And then from a governance perspective, internally, Microsoft also
charges a carbon fee internally to our business groups that help us do the work on
carbon removal and carbon reductions and really helps business groups see the
opportunities in their own mitigation plans and reduction plans. So, I could
underscore that point enough about the importance of the internal governance that
allows us to, frankly, move forward in both of our key issues.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes, resonates with me too. And yes, thank you. We'll stay here. I know you're newer
to Microsoft. Maybe a little bit on what brought you here and how you think about
helping the company reach the ambitious sustainability commitments. And how you
see the work evolving over time.

we're recording this. so letting you know it.
{BIO 21843910 <GO>}
It's relatively new, and it has ﬁrst, been just an incredible privilege and a pleasure to
join in a company that has been frankly, one of the forefronts of leading on
ambitious commitments around sustainability and matching that with actions and
that annual report we do each year is really just chock full of the speciﬁc projects and
actions and initiatives where we're investing. How I got here. So my background is
I've been a policymaker, diplomat, an investor in a private equity fund, working with,
I'll say, tech companies around the world. And part of what brought me here is really
bringing the nexus of technology, policy and ﬁnance all together from a
sustainability perspective. And how do we leverage those experiences that I've had
into the role of sustainability all up at Microsoft? And so that was part of the journey
to get here and what led to it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 13A - Brett Iversen
A - Natasha CramptonAlso, in terms of kind of where we go from here, these past few months has really
been about learning about Microsoft's journey to get to its 2030 goals and making
those investments. Every day, I sit with our -- I wake up to our policy team in
Washington, D.C. who helps inform us about what's happening both in the US and in
Europe and around the world on policy actions that are helping to drive the
sustainability agenda. We're really beneﬁting from the fact that in 2015, the world
governments got together and said, we are committed to a no greater than 2-
degree Celsius warming future for the world. And that's really important. And we
have now -- since 2015, governments have been putting in place policies, initiatives,
and actions. And companies have been stepping up. That's helping drive businesses
for us to participate in on sustainability, but also helping to drive these commitments
to actually meeting the goals that we need for our planet. And so it's been quite a
journey so far, and I'm excited to be here.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes, good. Well, we're happy to have you. So we've already talked a bit about how
Microsoft operationalizes your responsible AI commitments but if we get a little
deeper into just the governance and management of these issues, we get a lot of
questions on this, like, what's the Board involvement, how does your team work with
Microsoft leadership and even the broader org to achieve our goals? So Natasha,
can you help with this?
Sure. So it's really not a cliche to say that for responsible AI to be meaningful, it really
starts at the top. So at Microsoft, our Chairman, and CEO, Satya Nadella, supported
the creation of our Responsible AI Council to oversee our eﬀorts across the
company. Now the council is chaired by Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith, to
whom I report; and also Kevin Scott, who's our Chief Technology Oﬃcer. Kevin is in
charge of setting the technology vision for the company, as well as overseeing
Microsoft Research. Now I think for me, there's joint leadership, it's really core to our
eﬀorts. Because what it does is it sends a very clear message that Microsoft is not just
going to be a leader in the technology of AI, that Microsoft is going to be a leader in
responsible AI.
Now the Responsible AI Council convenes regularly and it brings together
representatives of each of their policy and engineering and research groups that are
dedicated to responsible AI. This includes the Oﬃce of Responsible AI that I lead in
our AETHER committee, and we also bring together senior business partners. These
are our partners, who are responsible for the implementation of our program in their
teams. For my part, I ﬁnd those council meetings to be both challenging and
refreshing. They're challenging because we are working on a hard set of problems,
and progress is not always linear. Yet, we know we've got to confront the diﬃcult
questions and make sure that we are driving accountability. The meetings are
refreshing because there is just this collective energy and wisdom among the
members of the Responsible AI Council, and I often come away with fresh ideas
about how we can advance the state of the art.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13

A - Melanie NakagawaAnd to your speciﬁc question, Brett, about the Board, the environmental, social, and
public policy committee of the Board provides oversight of our responsible AI
program. So we have regular engagements with the committee, and that really
makes sure that we're bringing the full rigor of Microsoft's enterprise risk
management program to our responsible AI work.
{BIO 21843910 <GO>}
Actually, similarly, that ESPP Committee of the Board also provides oversight for our
sustainability work as well.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Love it. Our investors love hearing that. So thank you both. Melanie, there's so much
discussion on the challenging topic of Scope 3 emissions and how we address that.
And for audience that maybe not be as familiar, it's greenhouse gas emissions that
aren't from a company's own sources or it's purchased electricity, but rather from
across the entire value chain, you're going to upstream and downstream to
customers that are using our products. So, how do we think at Microsoft about this
challenge and what are we doing to help ourselves and others address it? Because
you know we don't have direct control of that. I'm sure it's a challenging topic.
{BIO 21843910 <GO>}
Well, great. Your knowledge of Scope 3 is fantastic.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yeah, that's right. I studied, I studied. I don't know.
{BIO 21843910 <GO>}
(Multiple speakers)So at Microsoft we are in the implementation stage of our
sustainability journey all up and you really highlighted a key part. So Scope 3 why
are we ﬁxated on it? Why is something that you need to know about? Scope 3 for
Microsoft is around 96% of our overall emissions. The Scopes 1 and 2, around 4%. So
Scope 3 is ultimately our decarbonization challenge and our opportunity. It
necessitates the co-evolution of the best practices from businesses and technology
and policy among thousands of global stakeholders. When we made the carbon
negative commitment in 2020, it wasn't just a challenge to support sustainability of
our business, it was also an invitation for the world to participate in this journey,
translating this into action and then action into impact.
A major roadblock in our way is what we call the hard-to-abate emissions sectors.
This is like materials. Think concrete. A prime example of this is our growing sources
of Scope 3 emissions. One other example in addition to concrete is semiconductors,
chips. The global manufacturing of semiconductors could probably account for, by
some estimates, 3% of overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. And one big
challenge is that they are manufactured in countries such as South Korea, Japan, and
Taiwan, where clean energy is just not abundant to service those types of
manufacturing facilities. So decarbonizing semiconductors and other hard-to-abateFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 13A - Brett Iversen
A - Natasha Cramptonsectors such as concrete and materials really depends on transitioning the world to
more cleaner energy sources, cleaner grids, cleaner infrastructure.
In the future, the countries that build and operate the cleanest grids, we really
believe are going to have a competitive advantage. Those economies will really be
serving customers like us who really want to see our purchasing be tied to those that
are aligned with our commitments. Those countries where Microsoft and others have
ambitious climate commitments, those are the countries that we're going to want to
invest in and procure from. So, we're also -- another way we're addressing this
challenge with semiconductors and other materials, is through Microsoft's billion-
dollar Climate Innovation Fund. This fund is investing in technologies and companies
from all stages in renewable electricity to low carbon materials. We also invest in a
fund called the Southeast Asia Clean Energy Facility. And this helps build renewable
energy projects throughout the region.
Another company that's really exciting to highlight is called Prometheus Materials.
They produce a microalgae-based concrete for buildings that sequester carbon
during the manufacturing process. So this technology is estimated to reduce carbon
intensity by up to 90% compared to traditional units. Another similar company is
called Carbon Cure. They produce low-carbon concrete by injecting carbon dioxide
into the concrete during the mixing, where it mineralizes and strengthens the
product and reduces the overall emissions. These types of investments, you could
see appearing in physical infrastructure and other types of infrastructure out there.
And that just means when you compare that to traditional, you're actually choosing a
more climate-friendly, a lower-carbon product, potentially a better product at the
end of the day. So these are the types of innovations we've been investing and
thinking about.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
It's fascinating. Like that's -- those are some cutting-edge examples. It's interesting to
hear about -- especially from somebody who spends his time on the ﬁnance side of
the house. So thank you for that. Natasha, similarly in your space, there's obviously a
huge interest. We get a -- every question since this calendar year started for our IR
team has included AI as a topic. Given the recent advances in the generative AI and
that we've -- are incorporating across all of our products and services, what
responsible AI issues are unique to generative AI? And how is the company working
to address those?
Well, ﬁrst, let me say that I'm very happy that we've come to this generative AI
moment with the beneﬁt of seven years of responsible AI work up until this point,
because that has allowed us to mature our governance systems, our tools, our
practices to get ready for this moment. And there is much from our practice that
we've been building up all of this time is directly relevant to our generative AI work
as well. So for our generative AI systems speciﬁcally, we do use state-of-the-art
methods to make sure that we are identifying, measuring, and mitigating their risk.
And as I said, this does build on this long experience that we've had of operatingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 13A - Brett Iversen
A - Natasha Crampton
A - Brett Iversenthese large-scale enterprise and consumer services. And of course, our deep
partnership with OpenAI as well, that's been really critical.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yes.
Perhaps it's easiest to illustrate what some of the unique considerations are here by
just using our new Bing implementation as an example of the sort of things that we
do. So as I mentioned, the ﬁrst step in the process is to identify the risks of these new
systems. For the new Bing, we did this through a process called red teaming. What
red teaming does is it allows you to bring together a multi-disciplinary team to really
push on the edges of the system and understand where the challenges are. Now the
thing about red teaming is it's a bit like identifying an iceberg ahead. It's very
important that you understand that, that iceberg is there, but you don't really
understand the size and the shape of what you're dealing with. So having engaged
in red teaming on the core components of the system, especially the new model that
came from OpenAI, we then moved to a systematic approach to measurement
where we could start to measure what is the size and shape of those icebergs, which
are really diﬀerent types of risk surfaces that we can have for these new systems.
Then we move on to a mitigation phase. And the purpose of that phase is to really
think about what are their layered approaches that we can adopt to mitigating the
rest of these systems? And in many ways, we really use a defense and depth type of
approach, similar to what you might think of in the security context. So we make sure
that we not only bake safety right into the model at the core of the system, but we
wrap safety around in diﬀerent layers on top of that as well. So some of the core
issues that we addressed as part of this identify, measure, mitigate, process included
making sure that the responses that you would get from the new Bing would be
grounded in Bing's search results. Sometimes people refer to errors that generative
AI systems make as hallucinations. For us, we think of those as being situations,
where we have not grounded the response in Bing search results.
It was a huge help to us here that we had the Bing infrastructure to really to leverage.
So we've taken a number of steps there. We've also made sure that using some of
our past fairness-related work, we have made sure that Bing is not producing
responses that might be reinforcing stereotypes or otherwise, being unfair. So those
are just a couple of examples of both how we have leveraged our past work, but
we've layered new mitigations and techniques on top of that. And I feel conﬁdent
that we'll continue to build out those systems and harness those learnings. I think our
incremental release strategies, where we've carefully controlled the release of these
new technologies have been extremely beneﬁcial, and that -- those will be a core
part of our approach going forward.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
I love all the diﬀerent responsible AI sharing that you've given us. There's this cross-
discipline element across -- and what I've heard on most of these, it's not something
we're just doing on the side. It's embedded with all the functions, and it's a veryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13

Page 10 of 13A - Melanie Nakagawaintegrated cohesive conversation, which I think is critical. So it's come out in all of the
diﬀerent topics. Given that, I'm still just picturing us injecting concrete, like I need to
learn on this stuﬀ. Given that we have the of you together, which again, I appreciate,
how can you -- what can you tell me about how you see AI and sustainability
interacting in the future? We get questions on both, but as you think about the
concepts together, potential harms of rapid AI transformation, to our environmental
commitments, or we're ﬂipping it, what are the promises of AI? And maybe that's an
accelerant for global sustainability. So how would the two of you help me think
about that? And maybe Melanie, you can start us oﬀ on this one.
{BIO 21843910 <GO>}
Thanks, great. We believe AI is an essential part of building a net zero future. AI is
already playing a role in improving sustainability management as well as
measurement and accountability. When you think about there's this really kind of
awesome potential of what the opportunity set is with using AI. So to pick up on a
theme from earlier, concrete and cement. We are seeing how the use of AI can really
accelerate rapidly the discovery of alternative materials to high carbon materials
such as cement. So if you think about it, AI can reduce the design and validation
process for new materials by an order of magnitude and can lead to faster
innovation in these materials such as low-carbon concrete that can be used in
building materials for things such as our data centers and reducing the overall
environmental footprint and carbon footprint to those data centers.
The AI provides an opportunity to go from the trial-and-error process to really rapid
iteration. We've also used AI and partner with it to create satellite imagery that
produces ﬁrst of its kind atlas, a living atlas, if you will, to map the world and measure
the utility-scale solar and wind installations on the planet, allowing users to evaluate
clean energy transition progress in diﬀerent parts of the world and diﬀerent
countries and track that over time. This tool is called the Global Renewables Watch,
and it's a partnership between The Nature Conservancy, a nonproﬁt, and Planet. And
it really provides unique spatial data on land use trends to help achieve the dual
aims of environmental protection and increasing renewable energy capacity around
the world.
While the prospects for AI to advance sustainability are tremendous, the second
thing we must also think about is the other side of the ledger. So on one side, you
have the amazing potential for AI to accelerate our clean energy transition and
sustainability goals. And on the other side, we have to also recognize that these AI
models use more energy for scaled compute. So we are committed to not only
bringing on additional energy onto grids around the world, but also working to
ensure that that energy is coming from carbon-free resources of electricity. Microsoft
today is already one of the largest purchasers, corporate purchasers of renewable
power, and we're helping to advance innovative commitments to carbon-free energy
sources, like a contract we announced with a fusion energy company called Helion
back in May. We're also investing in research to measure the energy use and carbon
impact of AI and working on ways to help make large AI systems more eﬃcient
through things such as the green software initiative, reducing the energy
consumption through more eﬃcient compute and network traﬃc.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13

Perfect. Natasha, can you add to this interesting fusion between these two concepts?
Well, I think Melanie did capture the key points very, very well. I mean, I do think it's
essential that we use AI to address the biggest challenges of our time, and of course,
that includes sustainability as well. And I'm also really grateful that Melanie's leading
the charge for making sure that we are proactively addressing the energy needs of
the compute demands for these new AI models. That work to better deﬁne the
questions and also undertake further research is also critically important. We do
need to deeply understand the problem space here and make sure that we are
working towards ﬁnding answers that are durable going forward.
One other dimension that I'd perhaps, add, is that in May, we released our ﬁve-point
blueprint for AI governance. And part of that blueprint was recognizing that as this
technology moves forward, it's just as important to make sure that we have proper
control over AI as it is to make sure that we are realizing its beneﬁts. So one of the
speciﬁc points that we've recommended was that we thought that for AI systems that
are controlling critical infrastructure, they should have safety breaks. So we can think
of these systems, which the government would need to deﬁne a class of, as systems
that might be controlling our electricity grids or our water supply.
And similar to the safety protocols that we've put in place for other very important
core technologies, we need to put these brakes in for AI systems as well. So you
might think of the safety breaks that we've put in for elevators or school buses or
high-speed trains. Conceptually, we need the same AI safety breaks for critical
infrastructure as well.

Makes sense. We've covered a lot of ground in a short period of time. So thank you
both. As we close out, if you can each share a little bit about how you think about the
future in each of your areas. And thoughts for the road, I would say, for our group?
And Melanie, if you can start us oﬀ?
{BIO 21843910 <GO>}
Sure. Well, the future. So we're optimistic. I'm an optimist by nature, but we really feel
good about the businesses that we are investing in, that we're purchasing from. And
we're conﬁdent in our strategies and remain committed to reaching our 2030
commitments. And we're going to continue to help build the foundation for 2030 by
doing a few things. So ﬁrst, we're going to be advancing public-private partnerships,
advocating for favorable clean energy policy to bring more carbon-free energy to
the grid, and investing in countries that build and operate the cleanest grids.
Second, we're going to leverage our role as one of the largest purchasers of --
corporate purchasers of clean energy and renewable energy. We're going to be
building markets for the things that we need and procure from. And we're going toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-13

sustainability markets for water replenishment, for carbon removal.
And then third, we're going to be improving corporate governance, sustainability,
and accounting to ensure that sustainability reporting readiness is really top of our
priority list for the sustainability team. We want to make sure we're developing
eﬀective carbon accounting standards and initiatives that really underpin that
reporting readiness. And then lastly, we're going to be helping to realize the
potential of this next-gen AI to build innovative climate solutions that we need. We
believe that innovation is a critical component to solving the climate crisis. And that
investment of capital plays an important role in accelerating the availability of these
new solutions that may not be ready for the market today or commercially at scale.
So through the Climate Innovation Fund, which is a $1 billion investment fund, we are
really looking to use the CIF to help advance and create some of those markets.
We're going to be investing in and we have continued to invest in innovative
technologies and business models that had the potential to produce really
meaningful, measurable climate impact by 2030.
Since the founding of the CIF in 2020, Microsoft has allocated more than $600
million of that $1 billion into around 50 investments. That includes sustainable
solutions in energy and industrial systems and natural systems. And we're really
looking forward, from a global perspective, to continue to advocate for public
policies that confront and accelerate climate action that we want to invest in
mitigation and adaptation and resilience, and ensuring that this is a just transition for
all that are involved. We also want to make sure that we're aligning the international
climate reporting and disclosure requirements that are coming out to ensure that
they align with sustainability measurements and really are implementable. It's really
critical that companies, non-government organizations, and governments all work
together to ensure consistent, robust, and interoperable standards, especially
around greenhouse gases. Those reporting metrics are really critical. And what's
exciting is that digital technologies play a really important role in not only calculating
those emissions, tracking those emissions, and ultimately, reporting those in a digital
ledger.
New sustainability reporting requirements are already on the way. So earlier this
year, the European Commission passed the Corporate Sustainability Reporting
Directive, the CSRD. And this directive is really signiﬁcant for many companies, not
just for Microsoft. And in the case of the CSRD, over 50,000 companies are likely
being aﬀected by this new reporting requirement. So really dedicated to helping
manage our own reporting requirements, but also using our technology and data
platforms to help scale ESG reporting and performance demands for our customers.
Through the Microsoft Cloud for sustainability, for example, we're delivering new
data management capabilities to improve regulatory reporting, governance, and
accountability, and drive sustainability progress from both the data management
solution play to also AI integration reporting templates and automation going
forward.

A - Brett IversenFor my part, I'm enormously optimistic about the future of AI and I'm conﬁdent that
Microsoft is uniquely well placed to lead in this moment. We have spent signiﬁcant
time and resources to be ready to build and deploy AI responsibly, but we also
recognize that we are just one company here. We will do our part, but it will take a
whole of society approach here. We need to come together to deﬁne those right
guardrails, to secure those beneﬁcial uses, but also to guard against the misuse of AI
technology as well. We're engaged with governments around the world as well as
civil society organizations, academics, industry partners, our own customers and
partners here at Microsoft as well. So I'm conﬁdent that our commitment at Microsoft
to responsible AI is steadfast. If we keep humans at the center of our eﬀorts and we
are willing to be humble and to learn, we as a company can continue to move
forward, nimbly and responsibly to really advance this transformative new
technology.
{BIO 22252603 <GO>}
Yeah, thank you both so much. I know how many questions we get from investors,
and I can only imagine how many you're getting across all of the things that you do.
So I know you're both very busy, so I appreciate the time and we thank everyone for
watching. ESG, as you've heard, is built into everything that we do as a company and
we're glad we had some time to talk to you about it today. Thank you.
