Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. My name is Zach Kirkhorn, I lead
ﬁnance here at Tesla, and welcome to our Investor Day.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 2 of 74Elon R. MuskFor those of you here in the audience, at our global headquarters in Austin, Texas,
we welcome you. Thank you for being here and thank you for traveling in. For those
joining us virtually, thank you for being a part of the day today.
So as we reﬂect back on the history of the company, there's been distinct phases of
product advancement, technology innovation and rapid volume growth. The most
recent of which has been the global expansion and localization of the Model Y
program.
And so today, we want to talk about the future. We don't want to talk about this
quarter or next quarter, we want to go further out into the future. And we've divided
today's presentation into three parts. The ﬁrst of which, we're going to go macro.
What does it take to convert earth to sustainable energy generation and use. The
second, we want to talk about Tesla's contribution to that global need. And we're
going to go function by function, through the company, and you'll meet our entire
leadership team, and we're going to get into the details of what those teams are
doing as part of the broader goal.
And then in the third part, we're going to bring it back up and talk about what this all
means for the company as a whole.
So before we get started, statements made in this presentation are forward looking
statements, that are subject to risks and uncertainties. More details can be found in
our written materials.
So with that, let's get started. Part one, Elon Musk and Drew Baglino.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
All right. Master plan Part three. So as Zach was mentioning, the thing that I think is --
we wanted to convey, probably more importantly than anything else that we're
talking about here is that there is a clear path to a sustainable energy earth. It's not --
it doesn't require destroying natural habitats. It doesn't require us to be austere and
stop using electricity and sort of be in the cold or anything. The story, and I think if
this holds together quite well, and we will be actually publishing detailed white
paper with all of our assumptions and calculations is that, there is a clear path to a
fully sustainable earth with abundance. In fact, you could support a civilization much
bigger than earth than -- much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be
supported sustainably on earth.
And I'm, I'm just often shocked and surprised by how few people realize this. Most of
the smart people I know actually don't see a -- this clear path. They think that's,
there's not a path to a sustainable energy future or at least there's not one that is
sustainable at our current population, or that we have to resort to extreme measures.
None of this is true. So we're going to walk through the calculations for how to
create a sustainable energy civilization. Yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

And to set the stage, today, our energy economy, it's -- let's be honest, it's dirty and
it's wasteful. Over 80% of global energy, primary energy comes from fossil fuels and
only one-third of that global energy actually ends up delivering useful work or heat.
This is the problem statement, but we're here to talk about the solution.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. It's like if -- for -- on some of this I'm going to elaborate because there's a very
wide range of technical expertise out there from people who are like, whatever, Level
9 Wizards in this subject, to people who do not do engineering at all.
So, like when you -- if you have a gasoline car, you're converting less than a third of
and maybe only 25% of the energy and the gasoline is converted into motion, the
rest is turned into waste heat. That doesn't know -- doesn't do any good role. And
there's a lot of energy required even to get the oil out of the ground, to reﬁne the oil
and to transport the gasoline to the gas station.
So when you look at all that for a typical gasoline car is -- it is actually going to be
using less than 20%, fully considered, of the energy from the oil actually goes into
motion. So this is a -- when I see people -- when we see people doing calculations
for what does it take to create a sustainable energy earth. They assume that the same
energy amount is required for an electriﬁed civilization versus a combustion
civilization. This is not true. Because most of the energy of combustion is waste heat.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And even to get the fuel to combust in the ﬁrst place and get it to the end use,
there's a lot lost along the way. I mean, this is the primary energy consumption, 165
petawatt hours a year. Petawatt hour is a trillion terawatt -- trillion kilowatt hour. So it's
a -- large amount of energy. But the nice thing about electriﬁed economy, there's a
better way, we're going to talk about it, is that through end-use eﬃciency and
through eﬃciency along every step of the way. Actually, the total energy use, it
halves. So this is one of the most enabling aspects of electrifying everything, is that
the sustainable energy economy is that much easier to accomplish. It's actually half
the problem statement of the fossil fuel economy.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. And we're being conservative here. So it could be better than the half. But we're
trying to have assumptions that are reasonable and not overly optimistic, in fact,
slightly pessimistic. So it's really better than half, but just say, for -- it's easy to make
the argument that we need half as much energy with an electric economy versus a
combustion economy.

Andrew D. Baglino
Elon R. Musk
Andrew D. Baglino
Elon R. MuskYes. So how the Master Plan works? You want to talk about --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. So the thing that is needed in -- at very large scale, that is not currently present,
is a vast amount of battery energy storage. Our rough calculations are that this is
about 240 terawatt hours or 240,000 gigawatt hours. This is a lot of batteries, but it
is actually a very achievable amount, we'll go into details on that.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So that's a combination of electric vehicles and stationary storage. So if you got solar
or wind, you got to store the energy when the wind is not blowing, when the sun is
not shining and -- so we're assuming sort of an 8 to 1 ratio of stored energy to power.
So 30 terawatt hours of power -- that's -- so 30 terawatts of power. Our actual capital
expenditure calculation for manufacturing investment is more like $6 trillion, but we
should made it higher to make it $10 trillion.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And this is across mining, reﬁning, battery factories, recycling, vehicle factories, all
the things that we're going to talk about, needing to invest in to build this
sustainable energy economy.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Now if you look at the total world economy, it's just under $100 trillion. So if this
was spread out, say, over 10 years, it would be 1% of the global economy, over 20
years, it would be 0.5% --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Very doable.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
-- of the global economy. So this is, yes, not a big number relative to the global
economy. As Drew mentioned, you need about half as much energy with an electric
economy versus a combustion economy. And in terms of wind and solar, how much
land would be used? It's less than 0.2% of the land area of earth. I think, generally,
people don't realize quite how much energy is reaching us from the sun. It's roughly
a gigawatt per square kilometer. And sun doesn't shine all the time, but it's -- if you
multiply that by, say, four, for you to get the continuous power, four or ﬁve, then that
gives you the land area of solar. And you can put wind and solar often in the sameFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

double your energy.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
You can also put wind oﬀshore. It doesn't even --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
-- need to be on land. So wind is even more ﬂexible.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
You can put solar oﬀshore too.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
So Earth is 70% water. Anyway the point is that, with a pretty -- really, remarkably
small amount of earth's land area, we can go fully sustainable. Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And from a -- do the resources and raw materials exist to support this transition?
We'll go through that in detail, but we do not see any insurmountable resource
challenges at all. In fact, in the end, we should be mining less ore to accomplish this
economy than we currently do with the fossil fuel economy, and we're going to talk
through that.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Just to emphasize that again, the electriﬁed economy will require less mining
than the current economy does.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Less.

Elon R. Musk
Andrew D. BaglinoLess, not more. Okay.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
So this is the plan and now we get into a little more of the details of the plan.
Basically, ﬁve areas of work: ﬁrst, renewable power, the existing grid; second, switch
to electric vehicles; third, switch homes, businesses and industry heating to heat
pumps; fourth, high temp heat delivery and storage for high temp industrial and
chemical processes, and a little bit of green hydrogen in there for chemical
processes that need hydrogen; and ﬁnally, sustainable -- sustainably fuel planes and
boats. These are the ﬁve areas and we're going to go into detail on all of them.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, my personal opinion is that, as we improve the energy density of
batteries, you'll see all transportation go fully electric, with the exception of rockets,
that's awkward. But you can make the fuel with CO2 and water. So you can make
methane with CO2 and water. So -- and in fact that's --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And you could do that with just electricity.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, exactly. So -- in fact, on Mars, if we hopefully get there some point, the
atmosphere is CO2 and there's water ice throughout Mars. You can take the CO2
and H2O and turn that into CH4, which is methane and oxygen. So ultimately, even
rockets can be electriﬁed.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
So ﬁrst, repowering the existing grid with renewables. And this is going to be a
consistent theme. You'll see our estimates for the number of terawatt-hours,
terawatts and trillions of investment at the bottom of the page. This is already
actively occurring in front of us. 60% of the generation added to the U.S. grid was
solar in 2022. And actually, on a year-on-year basis solar deployment is growing 50%
year-on-year, as of 2022. So this is a serious upswing. And if we continue this trend,
this is going to be behind us before we even know it.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Second, switching to electric vehicles. Again, 21% reduction in fossil fuel use by
doing this alone. Obviously, Tesla is heavily engaged in this activity as -- along withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Elon R. Muskmany others. Overall, EV production grew 59% year-on-year in 2022 and EV's hit an
amazing 10% market share. I mean, it's an awesome milestone. I'm super excited to
see that. And like --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Right, this is, obviously, happening very rapidly. And, I mean, I think really all cars
will go to fully-electric and autonomous. And so riding a non-autonomous gasoline
car is going to be analogous to riding a horse using a ﬂip phone, that's basically
going to be the situation.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And we actually took somewhat conservative assumption here in terms of how many
batteries are required. Because the more the ﬂeet is autonomous, the fewer -- the
smaller the ﬂeet needs to be, just from a utility basis. So we're not accounting for all
of those beneﬁts, really much of those beneﬁts at all in this number. And what does
this ﬂeet look like? Just rough view from our perspective. Of course, we could be
wrong, but you can see the sort of breakdown of the ﬂeet by millions of vehicles.
Our goal is to do 20 million electric vehicles a year.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Fewer vehicles will be needed, at least passenger vehicles with autonomy. So
there's some debate as to what that number is, but it's some number less than the
number of vehicles needed today. There's roughly 2 billion cars and trucks in
operation in the world today. And --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. So what we show here is actually, I think, only 1.4 million or so. So --
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
-- we represent 1.4 billion, I mean, or so. So a smaller ﬂeet. And the numbers around -
- here in this presentation are around 85 million vehicles a year produced. Just to
give you a sense how we're thinking about this. Again, we're going to put all these
assumptions up online and encourage people's thought.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. So, yes. So we're basically heading rapidly towards an electric or autonomous
future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Exciting.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And one other reasons why EV's are so enabling is this end-use eﬃciency point.
Tesla Model 3, it's 4x more eﬃcient from the well to wheel than a Toyota Corolla. And
that's all about the eﬃciency of getting the electricity to the -- into the car in a
sustainable energy economy, and that how eﬃcient the car is in transferring that
stored energy to motion on the road. When compared to the engine in the Toyota
Corolla and all the extraction, reﬁning, transmission, distribution of the gasoline to
the Toyota Corolla.
And just for -- this is a fun reference. Model 3 can drive over a mile on the energy it
takes to boil a pot of water for pasta, and then it can drive another mile on the
energy it took to cook the pasta. And that pasta is one pound and Model 3 is like
4,000 pounds. Just give you a sense of just like what -- like, it really doesn't use a lot
of energy to move a Model 3, a 4,000-pound object down the road.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Also, heat is lot more energy than motion.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. But people, you just boil a pot of water then you think about it. Yes. It's just
interesting, how eﬃcient these cars are.
Next, switching to heat pumps in homes, businesses and industry. Right now heat
pumps meet 10% of building heating needs, install rates growing 10% year-on-year,
really needs to accelerate. Heat pumps can serve heat applications up to 200 C in
businesses and industry. And from an investment perspective, as you can see on this
page, it's actually the lowest hanging fruit in terms of displacing fossil fuels.
You might be saying, what exactly is a heat pump? So heat pumps don't move heat,
don't create heat, they move heat. When you think about, like, the natural gas
furnace in your house, like, it's -- it is generating heat itself. But what the heat pump is
doing is actually moving heat from outside of your house into your house. They're
just an air conditioner or a refrigerator in reverse.
So we're surrounded by heat pumps. There's like -- they're all over this factory, they
are in your house and all this really is about bringing them to displace all the fossilFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Andrew D. Baglinofuel heating in all of the homes, businesses and in the industry that we can. And from
the end-use eﬃciency perspective it's a 3x reduction in the total energy required to
heat these buildings. So a real obvious thing to do.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, heat pumps. They are in our cars, yes, as default.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
And at some point, we might make heat pump for our home.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. Maybe, maybe.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Maybe.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Next, a little bit more detail on electrifying high temp, sort of, industrial and chemical
processes. So over 50% of industrial heat is greater than 400 C. Where cement,
steel, fertilizers, chemicals, plastics, metals reﬁning all need like 1500 C. So we need
a solution here.
Ultimately, it's purpose-built equipment that enables electriﬁcation. Carbon graphite
is stable up to 2000 -- 2,800 C. There's other options in the 1500 C range like silicon
carbide, other materials. So the idea here is, you create and store heat when
renewable power is available. If this is a sustainable energy economy, renewable
energy is intermittent, peak of the day, you've got more generation than you need,
you make a bunch of heat then and then you transfer that heat into the industrial
process 24 hours a day using the stored heat you created, when the sun or the wind
was blowing. That's the concept here.
And then on the hydrogen side, we also need green hydrogen to decarbonize
metals and chemical reﬁning processes. This is things like ammonia, making steel.
There's roughly 120 million tons of hydrogen sourced from fossil fuel today to do
these things. And hydrogen can also directly replace coal, which is currently used in
a ton of steel production, through a process called directly reducing iron. You can
replace blast furnaces with a hydrogen reducing direct reduced iron furnace. And
this is the way to eliminate fossil fuels from these aspects of the economy, and the
CO2 associated with them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Elon R. Musk{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. And so, I mean, some of this, there's like room to disagree, but some amount of
hydrogen is needed for industrial processes. My personal opinion is that hydrogen
will not be used meaningfully in transport, but -- and shouldn't be. If you're going to
use a chemical fuel, you should use CH4 not H2. But unless it is needed for industrial
processes and can be produced just by splitting water essentially.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
I mean, some of that's been done for decades and decades.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
This is not rocket technology.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And lastly, a small part of the pie, but a necessary part of the pie, is sustainably
fueling planes and boats. Shipping accounts for 3% of global CO2. It's right for
electriﬁcation. Even with a lithium iron phosphate, long-haul ships can be fully
battery powered. So that's a great opportunity to electrify. Energy density is a little
bit harder for planes, but short-haul is doable today, with some improvements we'll
get long-haul underway. But even in the meantime, we can leverage sustainable
aviation fuels produced and stored using excess renewable electricity. There's a lot
of work going on in this space. And it's, yes.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I mean to really get a long-range aircraft and long-range shipping to use lithium-ion,
you need to redesign the ship and not just --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Or the plane.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Elon R. Musk-- and the plane. To take advantage of the fact that it is a new source of energy. It's --
that's -- it's a diﬀerent architecture. So just like with an electric car, you wouldn't just
take a gasoline car and stick a battery in it. That's very suboptimal. It's much more
eﬃcient to have the battery be the structure of the car and make it as -- make it mass
eﬃcient and optimize for batteries. To say, if that's done with aircraft, that you can get
long-range aircraft at around -- with cells at around 450-watt hours per kilogram,
which you can buy it right now actually. They are expensive, but I think that price will
come down.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
So when we stack up all of these eﬀorts, we end up with the numbers we shared at
the beginning of the presentation, 30 terawatts, 240 terawatt-hours, $10 trillion. And
you're -- you may be saying like, I need some context. Is this feasible? Spoiler alert,
it's entirely feasible.
Just looking at it from a growth rate perspective. How much do we need to grow the
deployment of these technologies? We're talking about only a 3x to growth rate in
solar and wind deployment. Solar is already growing at a breakneck pace, as is wind.
This gap is going to be closed really quickly. When we look at the electric vehicles,
they have to grow 11x. Well, they grew 60% year-on-year last year. That growth rate is
also going to close, pretty darn -- that gap is going to close pretty quickly as well.
And lastly, storage. Tesla's energy storage business has grown at 65% CAGR, since
2016. The global energy storage business is accelerating pace as well. I mean, all
these gaps are going to close. Especially as this momentum of the transition to
sustainable energy accelerates.
And of course, our goal on this page is 20 million EVs per year and 1 terawatt hour of
stationary storage per year, basically as soon as we can. And then, what about this
investment? How do I have a reference point on this investment? Elon mentioned it's
10% of one year's world GDP. Another way of thinking about it is, how does it
compare to what we're investing? Like, what we invested last year in the fossil fuel
infrastructure, and it's 60% of that investment. So actually, building this sustainable
energy economy is less than extending the fossil fuel economy from year-over-year
investment basis. So very doable.
When we look towards, does this ﬁt on the planet? Absolutely. Less than 0.2% of
land, as a reference point. The total land area intensively farmed today is 12.5% of all
land. So, I mean, you drive around, you see some farms, but you don't see them
everywhere, this is an order of magnitude, more than an order of magnitude
diﬀerence between farming and what we're talking about for sustainable energy
land.

Andrew D. BaglinoAnd what about on the mineral extraction side? So this is a cartoon that sort of gives
you a sense for all the ore and the, like, extracted minerals that are coming out of the
earth every year. It's about 68 gigatons. So each truck is a gigaton.
What does this look like when we're in a sustainable energy economy? Looks like
that. Fossil fuel extraction disappears. We replace it with the materials required to
fulﬁll the sustainable energy economy, actually reduces. Now it's not to say that we
don't need to continue to explore, bring on mining and reﬁning for the, sort of,
speciﬁc materials for the sustainable energy economy? We do. But the investment in
mass ﬂows are all very achievable, just looking at what is already happening on the
planet. Like, this is nothing out of scale of what has been done and is already being
done.
And then, we calculated on a sort of element-by-element basis. The resources are
there to support the transition. This is cumulative demand to move in the sustainable
energy economy direction until 2050 relative to USGS resources today. We're not
breaking the resource bank for any of these materials. And then when we look at
what really happens as we move forward. History teaches, the more we look, the
more we ﬁnd. What people think happens is, oh, there's this many resources, next
year there's going to be less because we're going to extract them. What actually
happens is, as we extract resources we ﬁnd more. And you can see on the right what
has actually occurred with the key materials to the sustainable energy economy.
Since 2000, the sustainable energy economy has been growing and Tesla has been
growing and all the industries around us have been growing. The actual resource

Yes. This is -- all seems to be quite a bit of confusion about the -- about lithium.
Lithium is extremely common. It's one of the most common elements on earth. There
is no country that has monopoly on lithium or even close to it. There's enough
lithium ore in the United States to electrify all of earth. If the United States was the
only place producing lithium. There's enough domestic material to electrify earth. It's
very common. The limiting factor is the reﬁning of the lithium into battery-grade
lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate. That's the actual limiting factor.

And the same is true for these other materials.

Right. Nickel is maybe the -- of them all, the trickiest one to solve. But as we showed
with the graph there, maybe need like 30% of the world's nickel -- known nickel
reserves. So --
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And the nickel reserves have actually grown since (Multiple Speakers)
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. There is more -- yes, exactly. So -- and you only need nickel for basically aircraft,
long-range boats and very long-range cars or trucks. But's -- the vast majority of the
heavy lifting for electriﬁcation will be iron-based cells. And earth is -- iron is actually --
literally, the most common elements on Earth. So a little trivia point. If you say like,
what is earth made of? By mass, it is most -- it is made of iron more than anything
else. And second, oxygen, and then everything else after that. So basically, we're a
muddy rushed ball, is what Earth is. So an iron cathode is sort of -- we're deﬁnitely
not going to run out of iron. There's so much iron, it's insane. So that's it. Yes.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. And ultimately, there's resource extraction. We go through this eﬀort. We built
these batteries and then we recycle these batteries. So ultimately, we're doing this to
build this sustainable energy economy, but the maintenance amount of ore that we
require is really in order of magnitude more -- less because of recycling.
So in the end, a sustainable energy economy is within our reach, and we should
accelerate it.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. I mean -- so this is really the main message of today. And I really wanted today
to be not just about Tesla investors who own stock, but really anyone who is an
investor on Earth. And what we're trying to convey is a message of hope and
optimism. And hope -- optimism that is based on, on actual physics and real
calculations, it's not virtual thinking. Earth can and will move to a sustainable energy
economy, and we do so in your lifetime. Thank you.

{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
Hi. I'm Franz. I lead Design at Tesla.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
And I'm Lars. I've been doing Vehicles with Franz for almost 13 years now.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
So I joined Tesla in 2008 to vertically integrate design into the company, that didn't
exist before, it was a pretty small team. I was tasked with designing most beautiful,
innovative and well-engineered vehicles on the planet. No small task, in 2008. There
is not a lot going on in the EV sector then. Since then, we focused on constant
improvement on cost, eﬃciency, innovation, things that you'll continue to hear about
today, while continuing to design the most desirable cars.
Today, we produce cars diﬀerently than we did 10 years ago. But the end result is
always an exciting, futuristic and desirable set of vehicles.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
Back then, we only had a handful of designers and engineers like myself, but we had
a great vision to radically change transportation.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
So back in 2008, where we're designing Model S, we didn't have a factory. In fact,
we had a really small engineering team and a tiny design team. But that allowed
design to lead all the conversations. It led us to innovate forward-thinking ideas like,
how do you ﬁt seven people into a sedan? Or how do you make door handles
disappear into the doors? Or putting a huge touchscreen into the center of the
vehicle, something that had never been done before.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
And then we won MotorTrend Car of the Year.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
Yes. And we won MotorTrend Car of the Year in 2013. Our ﬁrst great award, ﬁrst car.
Pretty good start. Kind of a home run, I think. But that whole process resulted in a
linear process that you see on the screen. We designed ﬁrst, then we engineered,
and then we ﬁgure out how to manufacture it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Franz von Holzhausen{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, I think that's really important. When we were designing the car together,
we didn't even know where we're going to build it, and so we came up with many --
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
I didn't even know Larz (Inaudible)
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
That's true. We didn't -- so once we got Fremont, we were very fortunate and we
ﬁgured out the manufacturing solutions, sort of, like we were ﬂying a plane and
putting the wings and building the engine at the same time. So we knew we had to
do better.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
Yes. We knew we had to be better in order to scale. And as part of the Master Plan
that you've read, Model 3 needed to be a smaller, more eﬃcient and more
aﬀordable version of Model S, but had to be equally great, it had all the things that
people loved in their Model S or Model X and -- but be much more aﬀordable. And
so we approached the process a little bit diﬀerently than the ﬁrst time around. Now
we had teams that we all work together. So we're able to combine design,
engineering and manufacturing process all at the same time.
But, somewhere along the way, we changed the manufacturing process to be fully
automated. And so we leaned into this whole new way of manufacturing a car, but
we had already engineered it. So things didn't quite go as well as planned.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
It was an amazing product, but it landed us in production hell. Many of us who lived
through that carry those battle scars. It was a great idea, but it wasn't the right timing.
Like Franz said, automating something that we designed to be built manually is
super hard. And we have many, many failed examples of that at the Fremont factory
that we ripped out. But some of them eventually still work. This is the one, I actually
worked on with a small team of engineers. It's still running today. And some of the
engineers that came by said, we couldn't do it or no longer with the company, but
it's running and it's running faster than ever.
So we kind of self-imposed constraints on the design when we were doing it to be
built manually, and we really didn't think about it. But despite all that, Model 3 is the
best-selling EV ever.

Lars MoravyYes. And Model Y, which is derived from Model 3 is about to pass that. But we knew
we had to improve the process further. And with Cybertruck, we designed a vehicle
around a vision, that actually started with the manufacturing process. And in this
case, the materials dictated the design.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
Forming full-hard stainless steel isn't rocket science, but it sure isn't easy and it
limited the way we could do it.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
Yes. Absolutely. It really forces to think about designing something in a way that you
couldn't normally stamp pan holes, you couldn't form them in a traditional way. So
you ended up with very linear bending processes that are just not in automotive,
kind of, language of manufacturing today. But it actually created a very eﬃcient end
process and one of the most dynamic designs ever, I believe. It's deﬁnitely
something that's going to change the road landscape.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
Hopefully, you guys saw it down there and you experienced it. It's deﬁnitely real.
Those are real trucks. We're on our way to build them. But what that stainless steel
opportunity did for us? It has led us rethink the factory footprint. We don't stamp
those. That's a huge part of it. We don't even paint them. So our footprint got smaller
and we started to think about innovative ways to take those constraints and make
great products.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
But that constraint didn't really change the end result of the truck. It's a super
dynamic truck and it has all the functionality you would expect out of any of the
other competitive trucks. And the best thing about it, it's coming this year.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
So ideally, after all that, we would design, engineer, manufacture, and plan for
automation happening together. It gives us the opportunity to question
requirements. This is something that is fundamentally only available at Tesla. The
places I used to work in the top manufacturing companies in the world, they don't sit
together.

{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
-- where I know has all these teams together, thinking about these processes from
the very beginning.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
In fact, all of those engineering teams, manufacturing, design, automation, they're all
in one work. They all report to one person. We can't point ﬁngers at each other. So
we have to solve them together, which is the best way to innovate. The traditional
way of making a vehicle is this, you stamp it, you do -- build a body in white, you
paint it and you do ﬁnal assembly. And what's interesting is, these shops are dictated
by the organizational structures that exist and they are dictated by the boundaries
that exist in the factories that are laid out. If something goes wrong in ﬁnal assembly,
you block the whole line, and you end up with buﬀering in between. This is at the tail
end of its manufacturing optimization.
Henry Ford, ﬁrst invented this assembly line in 1922. It's been 100 years and it's really
hard to make a change after 100 years. And when you watch it happen, it's actually
really silly to a guy like me. You take all these stamped panels, you put them
together, then you put them in a framing station, you build a body that looks
something like a car, you put the doors on and then you paint them. Once you get
the color, you take the doors oﬀ and then you start putting the interior inside the car.
It comes in through the openings that already exists. I wish it went in like this, big
piece like this, but there's actually people coming in and out of the car. There's
awkward movements. Then we lift the car up. We put stuﬀ from underneath it. We
put it down. Then we put the seats in the car. And ﬁnally, we close it all out with glass
and we bring those doors and went away for a trip and we put them back in the car.
Most of the time, we're doing this with a big giant car and moving it and doing really
nothing to it at all.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
What's funny though in this kind of whole process is that, just recently, Toyota had

Lars Moravy{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
That was humbling. But at Tesla, it's not good enough. If we're going to scale the way
we want to do, we have to rethink manufacturing again. It's part of the Master Plan.
We have to make another step change in cost. We started this on Model Y, when we
made these huge giga castings, and we deleted hundreds of parts. We simpliﬁed
assembly with the Model Y structural battery, where we decided the ﬂoor should be
a part of the car. The battery is the ﬂoor. We put the seats in the interior on the
battery and we bring it up through a big open hole and we assemble it. And this
allowed us to do things in parallel. Fully rethinking the process and reducing the ﬁnal
assembly line by about 10%. And we thought maybe we could do this other places.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, in a way the constraints become part of the solution, rather than a
problem.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
So when you think about what I'm trying to say, I really want to hammer this home.
When you have a car that's about 5 meters long and you have people working
around it, like we did in Model 3. And we change that to this process where we take
diﬀerent parts of the car and we can do more at the same time, like we did with the
Model Y structural battery pack. What you see here is us doing that on the front part
of the vehicle or the rear part of the vehicle. That means, we can get more people
working on the car or robots, working on it at the same time. That means, we have
better operator density, less time doing nothing. I call that space-time eﬃciency. It
has nothing to do with quantum mechanics. We can have that conversation later. But
we get 44% more operator density, which means more work, less time walking back
to the station, 30% improvement in space-time eﬃciency. And because we're not
building it in and out of the car with those slow movements of those robots, I
showed you from production hell. When we go to automated, it's going to be a lot
easier.
In the end that will probably look something like this, where we balance parallel and
series manufacturing in a way where we only do things that are necessary. With a
much shorter ﬁnal line blocking a lot less of the entire rest of the factory, so we can
optimize material ﬂow using the best practices. And what that means, it's going to
look something like this. Where we build all the sides of the cars independently. We
only paint what we need to. And then we assemble the parts of the car once and
only once. We put them where they need to go. The interior is attached from a
bottom-up or a top-down strategy, so there's more access for those robots and
people. We aren't moving heavy objects around and doing nothing to it. And it
means, we're doing more work on the car, more of the time.
And then when we take it, all of these tested sub-assemblies and we put them
together, we ﬁnally assemble the car, only one time, putting the sides on with all of
their parts to a front and rear that was already assembled, carrying the ﬂoor in withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Colin Campbellthe seats, and ﬁnally boxing it out with the doors one time. Just like Cybertruck. So in
the end, you get the same car, but it's not going to be a Model Y.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
Yes. This is not -- this is a Model Y for illustration, not the next-gen vehicle.
{BIO 22525342 <GO>}
In the end, what does that mean? To increase the scale and adoption of electric
vehicles on the orders of magnitude that we just showed you, we have to make
constraints part of the solution. It leads us to greater than 40% reduction in footprint,
which means, we can build factories faster with less CapEx and more output per unit.
Faster, less CapEx, more output per unit dollar. Zacks going to go into more details
on this later, but it also means through this innovation and some of what my other
engineering colleagues are going to talk to you about in the future, we'll reduce cost
as much as 50%. This is the two-for-one concept, you hear me and Elon talking
about on earnings calls.
{BIO 7162520 <GO>}
Yes. So I think our track record approves that we can deliver the best cars. And we
deliver the best cars in spite of, because of these constraints. And I'd love to really
show you what I mean and unveil the next-gen car. But you're going to have to trust
me on that until later date. Just -- and I promise we'll always be delivering exciting,
compelling and desirable vehicles like as we always have.

fast.
{BIO 17382259 <GO>}
Thank you, Lars. Thank you, Franz. My name is Colin Campbell and I have the real
privilege of leading Powertrain Engineering here at Tesla. We make the fastest cars
that you can buy for the money, whether they're electric or gas. And the Model S ﬂat
that we're looking at here, it has more than 1,000 horsepower and pound-per-pound
the motors in that car are as powerful as jet engines. Our cars are super fun, people
absolutely love driving in them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 21 of 74And the other thing that you probably all know about our powertrains is that they're
eﬃcient, our cars would go 25% to 30% further than other EVs in our class for the
same amount of eﬃciency. But at Tesla eﬃciency means more than just reducing
how much energy the cars use. It's about how we develop, how we manufacture,
how we reﬁne, and how we scale the powertrain.
Now the Model 3 and Y powertrain is a great example of this broader meaning of
eﬃciency. So since we launched it back in 2017, we've continuously improved that
powertrain and the factory that builds it. So the drive unit, the engine of the car is
20% lighter for the same power. We use 25% less heavy rare-earths than when we
started. And the ﬂower train -- the powertrain factory, which is behind me today, is
75% smaller and 65% cheaper than the one that we originally built.
And what I really want to emphasize is that, we did all of this without compromise.
Our cars are just as powerful, they go just as far, they cost the same or less, and the
factories have the same output. So, how did we do that? We did it by designing the
entire vehicle and the entire factory together as one company. And this sets Tesla
apart. We have small and highly-capable teams and to make a critical decision, we
can have the battery cell chemists, the mechanical engineers, the manufacturing
engineers, the supply chain team, the automation designers, the software
programmers, all in one room, working together in real time. And that allows us to
make decisions that are best for the whole car and to make them really fast. And that
approach is unlike traditional automotive engineering, which is really fractured. And
if you were to go buy like a premium German Electric Car, the engineers who
designed the drive inverter in that car, they did not work for that car company. They
worked for a contractor. And in Tesla, we design the entire car and the factory that
builds it.
I want to highlight a few examples of what we've been able to do in-house. Thanks
to that unique approach. So inside the charge of your Tesla are transistor packages,
and that's at the top of your screen here. And every electron that moves you down
the road ﬂows through one of these packages. We designed our own custom
package, which is what you're seeing here. And we can extract twice as much heat
out of that package as what we could buy oﬀ the shelf. And so what does that mean?
It means that the silicon carbide wafer that's inside those packages can be much
smaller. And silicon carbide is an amazing semiconductor, but it's also expensive and
it's really hard to scale. So using less of it is a big win for us.
And then on top of that, orchestrating all of these transistors and making them
switch in the right ways is computationally extremely intensive. It used to require four
microprocessors, which are shown here in the bottom left. We have developed our
own custom microprocessor. It's purpose built for high power electronics. It's half
the cost and it does in just one the job of all those four. And these are just two
examples of many, that I could use, to showcase our expertise in high power
electronics, and that expertise has allowed us to take the cost of the chargers. They
were in our Model S, when we launched it in 2012, both the cost and the mass and
cut both of those in half.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 22 of 74And even more important, the power electronics, they are central not just to our cars.
They are central to our superchargers, into our energy storage products, and
Rebecca and Mike will be talking more about that.
So in addition to the work that we've done is software and hardware, we've also
done a lot of work in-house on software. So this is the drive unit from Model 3 and
Model Y. And if we take a cross section, we see the stator and the rotor and they're
responsible for the core function of the drive unit, which is converting electricity into
motion. And our custom software lets us simulate the rotating magnetic ﬁeld that is
responsible for that conversion. And getting that simulation exactly right, it's central
to the cost, the weight, the size, and even the sound of the drive unit.
Now, you can buy software that will do all of this, but our tools are faster and they are
more accurate and that was not easy to do, and that allows us to quickly iterate
through millions of possible drive unit designs to ﬁnd the best one.
I want to highlight one more area where Tesla really excels, because we integrate
work that is often farmed out. So when you are making a new product, it's not
enough to think about the product itself, you have to think about how you're going
to make it at scale. So Tesla, our powertrain and our powertrain manufacturing
equipment is both designed under one roof. Engineers were designing the motor,
they are in the same room as the engineers who are designing the machine, that's
going to put that motor together. And that collaboration pushes us from Day 1 to
design products that are not only high performance, but are really easy to assemble.
So, all of this expertise that we have in the powertrain team and hardware, and
software, and manufacturing, it's going to have a major impact on our next platform.
In our next powertrain. So the silicon carbide transistors that I mentioned that are key
component, but expensive. We ﬁgured out a way to use 75% less without
compromising the performance or the eﬃciency of the car. And, of course, we know
the battery cells supplies one of the constraints on the scalability of EVs right now.
Our new powertrain is compatible with any battery chemistry and that will give us
great ﬂexibility in battery sourcing.
If we want to make EVs more accessible to people, they have to be cheaper. We've
reduced the drive unit cost to about $1,000, and we don't think any other automaker
is even close to that number.
Finally, the bigger factor is, the longer it takes to build. If we can build the same
number of cars from a smaller factory, we are going to be able to scale EV
production faster. Our next powertrain factory is 50% smaller than the one that's
behind me today, even though it has the same capacity. All of these improvements, I
think, are going to be transformative for the adoption of EVs and our ability to scale
them.
There's one more thing that I want to highlight. So I talked about how we had
reduced the amount of rare earth in our powertrains. And as the world transitions toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Peter Bannonclean energy, demand for rare earth is really increasing dramatically. And not only is
it going to be a little hard to meet that demand, but mining that rare earth, it has
environmental and health risks. So we want to do even better than this. We have
designed our next drive unit, which uses a permanent magnet motor, which do not
use any rare earth materials at all.
So how does all this ﬁt into the Master Plan? We can make lower cost products that
are still eﬃcient and compelling and we can make them at scale. We're going to use
less of constrained commodities, silicon carbide, rare earths. We're going to build
them all in compact and high-output factories that are easy for us to build quickly.
We're going to make that easy-to-scale powertrains, all the way up to the levels that
Drew and Elon mentioned at the beginning.
And this achievement, like all of the achievements that I mentioned today, it's only
possible because of the incredible people on our powertrain teams. They are
absolutely committed to the cause of sustainable energy and that is why we can do
what no other company can do. Thank you.
So next, I'd like to welcome my colleagues Pete Bannon and David Lau.
Thanks, Colin. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Texas. Picture here is the
low voltage system of a Model S from 2012. This car was primarily designed with
vendor source controllers integrated by Tesla. There are over 300 low voltage
devices that encompass everything from the mundane, like the light in the glove
box, to the complicated, like the infotainment computer, to the safety-critical like the
airbags, steer-by-wire, and break-by-wire.
The low voltage harness is built from individual wires, cut to length, crimped and
inserted into connectors. A manual process that is tedious, error-prone, and doesn't
scale well. Going forward, we want to reduce the size and complexity of the harness
and enable automated manufacturing.
{BIO 19018580 <GO>}
These wire harnesses introduced extraordinary complications, especially in the early
stages of development in bring up a vehicle, because when we're trying to bring up
this entire system and we see that it's not working properly, we don't know whether
it's a problem with the software, with the controller, the processor, any of the
endpoints in this entanglement of wires, and so we have to go and debug
everything, all at once, and Pete's going to tell us about how we're going to make it
better.
So I'm going to talk brieﬂy about a few things that we've changed over the years
since the Model S. With the Model 3 (Inaudible) Tesla started designing andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Page 24 of 74David Lau

David Lauincreasing share of our controllers by merging controllers together. And we were
able to simplify the design with a signiﬁcant reduction in wire count and weight,
going from as to three, we reduced the wire harness by 17 kgs compared to Model S.
And this is a pretty big deal. And just to put that into context, our VP of Engineering,
Lars, will deliver a bottle of your favorite spirit to your desk, if you've managed to
save a kilogram of weight from our car. So this improvement cost him quite a lot.
Did we skip one? Yes. The original Model 3 controllers were enhanced and then built
into Model Y. Those improved controllers were then moved back into Model 3, when
we introduced the heat pump. At that point, we had a shared controllers across both
cars which helps simplify our supply chain.
Those Model 3 and Y controller designs were then updated and enhanced for the
new versions of Model S and X that we introduced in 2021. For Cybertruck, we are
now designing 85% of the controllers in the car. For the next-gen platform, we're
going to ﬁnish the job and be designing 100% of the controllers to give us full
control of the design and the supply chain at the component level. Having full
control of the supply chain at the component level has been critical to Tesla over the
last few years, as the supply constraints have hampered our ability to build cars.
{BIO 19018580 <GO>}
And with that control comes control over all the software, which enables us to
develop features and functionality that we never even dreamed of at the time we
designed the hardware. So that's why you see software in your car is getting better
and better over time, in ways that we didn't even think of when we designed the
hardware in the ﬁrst place.
Yes. Sentry Mode is one of my favorite, last minute changes. With the introduction of
Model 3 in 2017, we deleted relays and fuses from the car in favor of e-fuses. E-fuses
replace moving parts with solid state transistors, that provide ﬁne-grained control of
the power system to software, and allow software to do advanced things like load
shedding in the car under adverse conditions. E-fuses also allow for software-
controlled retries for transient faults and they all allow for detailed monitoring of the
power system over time.
{BIO 19018580 <GO>}
Yes. The theme you hear a lot about today is software-controlled hardware. And
when I think about that in my team, software-controlled hardware is fundamentally
about being able to sidestep, what otherwise would have been static trade-oﬀs
between one attribute or another in a piece of hardware. We are able with software
to instill intelligence, context awareness, and context-speciﬁc behavior into what
otherwise would have been a piece of hardware that had to get optimized for one
type of scenario. We get more of everything.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Peter BannonIn 2022, we completed the transition of the lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion
batteries and -- which use a new tool as connector. We expect lithium-ion batteries to
last for the life of the car, so we don't expect anyone to wake up to a dead battery
ever again. This eliminates a major source of failures for our car. And the tool as
connector makes it easier to service the car and it also includes a software feature to
allow validation that the connector has been properly installed at the end of a
service event, which removes another source of failures in our cars. Obviously, the
mass and volume savings are also signiﬁcant, which is super helpful.
At Tesla, we're always trying to improve every single component in the car and a nice
example of that is the 15-inch display that was originally shipped in the 2017 Model 3.
Over time, the cost of the display has gone down 24%. We've been able to reduce
the weight by 12% and we've reduced the power by 33%. At the same time, we've
increased the brightness of the display by 50% and improved the color accuracy. So
this is one of our favorite things at Tesla just to make a component cheaper and
better.
At Tesla, the drive to improve eﬃciency in the car is never ending. I think of it as like
peeling a carrot, you just take a swipe at it, a little bit falls oﬀ, doesn't really make
much of a diﬀerence. But if you just keep at it over time, it accumulates into a pretty
signiﬁcant improvement.
One of the changes that we're looking to make right now is to change something
that's been steady for the last 60 years, 12 volts. 12 volts has been, as I said, for 60
years. The demand for power in the car has been steadily increasing to the point
where we now have to have pretty large wires to drive over 200 amps of current
around the car, which increases the mass and cost. With Cybertruck and all future
Tesla platforms, we will be moving to 48 volts. This reduces the current needed by a
factor of four. And since power loss in the harness is resistance times the square of
the current, a 4x reduction in current leads to a 16x reduction in lost power, while
distributing energy in the car. That allows for smaller wires, smaller e-fuses and
smaller controllers. It also allows us to make the heat sinks smaller, or in many cases
remove it completely, all beneﬁting the car in terms of mass and weight. 48 volts is
the future for (Inaudible) voltage design at Tesla and likely the rest of the industry in
due course.
{BIO 19018580 <GO>}
We welcome and encourage other OEMs and the entire supplier network to join us
on this evolution.
You bet. As the number of wires in the car is driven by the number of end points that
need to be powered and controlled. In the past, centralized control has led for wires
spanning the entire car. For Cybertruck design, we have moved to a local controller,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 26 of 74David Lau

David Lau
Zachary Kirkhornwhere the wire is connected to the nearest controller and those controllers are
connected over Ethernet. Wires are routed to the nearest controller, where the data
is converted into a network packet for transmission to the correct location on the car.
To be eﬀective, the network must be reliable, have low latency and low jitter, and
these are all attributes that we've been able to achieve with the current design. The
design is delimited most of the cross-work car wires in Cybertruck. And with the
next-gen platform, we're going to ﬁnish the job and eliminate all of them.
{BIO 19018580 <GO>}
There's some -- consolidated vehicle network allows us also to make a whole lot
more dynamic changes on the ﬂy to how components in the vehicle talk to each
other, rather than the traditional approach of separate CAN buses that are spread
throughout the vehicle and (Multiple Speakers) in hardware.
And one of the nice things is that, you can see the entire vehicle through a single
connection, which wasn't possible in the past for debug.
For the next-gen platform, we're looking to optimize the controller design across the
entire car and across all of the organizations, not just for a given subsystem.
Simplifying the wire harness will enable automation; 48 volts will allow us to reduce
the size, mass and cost of the low-voltage system, and those are one of the key
things to enabling us to scale production of the low-voltage systems to -- for the
Master Plan three. David?
{BIO 19018580 <GO>}
Cool. So I joined Tesla to 2012. And even in those very early days of the Model S, we
already have the ability to update software over the air in all the controllers
throughout the entire vehicle. At that time when other cars were just starting to
update software in only their infotainment units. And furthermore, we've had
sophisticated, anonymized data logging and telemetry capabilities that allow us to
understand how the ﬂeet is doing, what customers are doing with it, and how it's
responding in the ﬁeld to that usage.
These two capabilities combined, OTA updates, and data insights, give us the ability
to iterate quickly on our software and to maximize the amount that we learn and
proceed, and the progress that we make in every one of those iterations. We've used
these capabilities to inform countless design decisions, in both software and
hardware.
{BIO 20940148 <GO>}
Yes, one example is that, we were able to monitor and track the use of the sunroof in
our cars, and found that our customers never use their sunroof. So we've made it

Very barely. Yes, I've had some rest for a while. As another example, we are able to
use our collision data to design our crash safety systems for what happens in the real
world far beyond what regulatory and consumer ratings test prescribed. And then
furthermore, we're able to use that data to recreate in simulation all of those crashes,
every single time we make a change to the vehicle's design, or to the software that
controls the air bags and other restraint systems.
Here, on this graph, the gray dots that show up ﬁrst. Our speciﬁc crash tests that are
prescribed by regulatory and consumer ratings agencies throughout the whole
world. And the rest of the color that ﬁlls in around and on top of it, those represent
the crashes that we've seen happen in the real world. Those are what we design for
and what we test to.
Right. And last year, this data was used to change the algorithm for seat belt
tensioning to reduce injuries in the ﬁeld, which was OTA-ed to all of our cars.
{BIO 19018580 <GO>}
Here are a few statistics that demonstrate how staggeringly quickly we gain new
insights from the anonymized data that we've received from the ﬂeet, every day.
Everyday 123 million miles driven, 1.9 million charge sessions, and those rates are
only increasing as we deliver more and more cars into the world.
As another example, we've analyzed patterns in the way the ﬂeet drives and charges
to optimally size battery packs for our next generations of vehicles. And you'll hear
lots of other examples throughout the rest of the day about how we're using data to
inform decisions in the products and in manufacturing.
So you've heard a lot from Pete, Colin and others about how important vertical
integration is for us in hardware, but it's especially important for us in software. And
this is extremely diﬃcult from the way the rest of the traditional automotive supply
chain is set up. In most situations, all the controllers in the car are delivered by
diﬀerent Tier 1 suppliers, whose software is written by Tier 2 suppliers, who farm
some of that software out to diﬀerent Tier 3 suppliers and so on and so on.
Making a change that spans multiple components takes months of coordination,
before any work can even start. And furthermore, integration of software in the
server side with what's happening in our vehicles has always been a core part of our
DNA, and enables us to do things that nobody else can.
Most engineers think about the vehicle as a complete consolidated fully contained
system, but in the software team, we think about the system as including the vehicle,
as well as all of our back-end, server-side applications and infrastructure, and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Page 28 of 74Peter Bannon
David Lauresultant feedback loop from the entire ﬂeet that informs all the decisions we make
as an engineering team.
For example, we recently released a feature in Model S and Model X that
automatically, predicatively adjusts and raises the suspension for ride comfort,
before the car hits a section of rough road. We do that by leveraging the ﬂeet to
generate a map of road roughness everywhere our cars drive. Sounds pretty simple,
but requires coordination of software across a number of diﬀerent components
inside and outside of the car. The restraint control module, whose inertial
measurement unit senses the road roughness the autopilot computer whose GPS
module and localizer ﬁgure out where the car is in the world, our navigation server,
which aggregates the anonymize telemetry from the ﬂeet and annotates our map
with things like updated speed limits, lane topology and now road roughness. The
onboard navigation engine, which looks ahead of the route that the car is traveling
on and determines whether things are about to get rough. And ﬁnally, the air
suspension controller, which takes all of those factors into account and decides
continuously, whether it is appropriate to adjust the suspension for ride comfort.
And before we release this feature to the world, we sent prototype versions of it to
the entire ﬂeet that ran passively in the background, sending us anonymous data
about every time it would have engaged, which taught us exactly how it was going
to behave in the wild, in every environment, in every circumstance.
Being able to test new algorithms in the background without impacting the car is
really critical ability for us, especially for safety critical things like automatic
emergency breaking.
{BIO 19018580 <GO>}
And we've used it to iterate on early versions of our stability control algorithms,
which were introduced to the entire Model 3 ﬂeet in 2017 with extreme -- extremely
high conﬁdence, even on a very foundational and safety critical function.
Okay. So far, you've heard me talk a lot about how we leverage our software systems
to iterate quickly on the customer-facing product. But what I haven't talked about
and what we haven't said much about publicly in general, is how we leverage these
capabilities in our own internal operations. So for example, in the early days of
manufacturing Model S, we very quickly realized that there are a lot of diﬀerent ways
you could miss assemble a car. You could forget to plug in a wire, you could not fully
set a connector, you could pull apart from the wrong bin. So when we designed our
manufacturing processes for Model 3, and all of our other vehicles going forward.
We took a page from the software playbook, which says, test early and test often.
And we applied that mantra to every single car that we build at every step of the
assembly line. So now, when a production associate plug something into the car, the
central car computer sees that connection, conﬁrms that it's the correct part for theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

David Lautype of car that supposed to be built, installs a software update, if necessary, checks
conﬁgurations and calibrations, and runs a barrage of tests on that thing and all the
other things that are connected to it. And if it ﬁnds an anomaly that can't be ﬁxed
purely with software, it throws an alert immediately, that is displayed prominently on
the vehicles display as well as sent to back-end command and control systems, so
that a human can come over and ﬁx the problem, before the rest of the car gets built
on top of it.
And we're taking a similar approach in service through a combination of onboard
vehicle diagnostics, natural language processing applied to customer narratives,
when a customer schedules a service appointment and the suite of internally
developed tools. We are successfully diagnosing, scheduling and ordering parts for
over 33% of customer concerns in service.
Yes. And we also use testers built around our own controllers to test subassemblies
before they get to the car, which will be even more important as we go to Larz's
unboxed assembly strategy.
{BIO 19018580 <GO>}
100%. We'll know, with extremely high conﬁdence that before those boxes get put
together, that they are assembled -- they themselves are assembled correctly.
Okay You've heard at lots of other events about all the awesome things that our
autopilot and AI teams are doing to make the car drive itself, bringing us into the
future of autonomy. But we've also been thinking for years about all of the other
pieces that we are going to need to manage a network of autonomous vehicles. A
lot of this has been happening behind the scenes in the form of platform level
functionality, that will leverage later. But you've seen some of it surface already in
terms of features that our customers and our internal operations teams can beneﬁt
from.
Like in 2021, we built on top of our mobile app Phone Key and gave our customers
the ability to share their car with anyone by sending them an invitation in a text
message or an email. Last year, we introduced proﬁle synchronization, which
synchronizes your seat, steering and mirror positions, as well as your settings, media
favorites, and stored navigation locations across all vehicles in your account.
Internally, we have an app that allows our personnel and engineering,
manufacturing, delivery and logistics to view, locate and drive all Tesla owned
vehicles at their site. And when customers bring their car into service, when they
receive a Tesla's own service-loner vehicle, we are starting at some locations to
automatically add that vehicle to the customers mobile app account, so that
combined with cloud synchronized proﬁles and Phone Key, it's a completely
seamless experience. As soon as the customer walks up to that loner, it behaves and
feels exactly like their own car.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Page 30 of 74Ashok ElluswamyAnd all this is built on top of end-to-end encryption and cryptographically signed
commands. So that customer data remains private and obscure, and the ﬂeet only
trust commands from authorized parties. So that's a bit of a preview of all the pieces
that we're building, looking ahead to our future of autonomous ﬂeets:
synchronization, permissions management, security and privacy.
And that has been a whirlwind tour through some of the things that we're doing
behind the scenes to enable the eﬃciency, cost reduction and speed that we are
going to need for our next phase of growth and for the next phase of the Master
Plan.
And so now, to tell us about the latest in full self-driving, I'd like to introduce, Ashok.
{BIO 22648673 <GO>}
Thanks, David and Pete. Hey, everyone. My name is Ashok Elluswamy. I work on
Autopilot and Self-Driving at Tesla. I joined Tesla back in 2014. So I've been working
on this problem for almost nine years now.
Yeah. Some of you might be wondering, hey, what's the Self-Driving got to do with
the plan to a sustainable future? But it's actually a critical part of this plan and here is
why? Currently, when the car is not being used, it is sitting idly in parking lots, not
doing anything. But when autonomy is truly unlocked, this car, instead of being idle,
can go serve other customers. This fundamentally reduces the need to scale
manufacturing to extreme levels because each car is being used way more.
But this is no trivial problem. Building a scalable, self-driving system is I think one of
the hardest real-world AI problems out there right now. Nonetheless, we at Tesla,
have made signiﬁcant strides in making one of the most general systems at solving
this problem.
There are three main parts to get right to build a scalable problem. First is the
architecture, the architecture of AI system. Second is the data and third is the
compute. We'll start with the architecture.
At Tesla, we are betting on AI machine learning neural networks to help us build a
general vision and planning system. In the early days, we used to have single
camera, single frame neural networks that produce some outputs. These were
stitched together in some post-processing steps for the planner. But this was very
brittle and was not leading to great success.
So what we did in the last few years is transition most of our stack into this multi
camera video neural networks. These neural networks take in live feed from the car
in real time of the eight cameras in the car and produce a single uniﬁed 3D output
space. There are many tasks that we produce such as the presence of obstacles, their
motion, lanes, roads, traﬃc lights, what have you?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 31 of 74This is one example output that you're seeing here. This is from our occupancy
network that predicts the positions of obstacles and their motion. You can see that it
precisely captures the (Inaudible) violent motion of this truck next to us and this
helps the planning system to avoid a collision with this object.
Some of the tasks such as lane connectivity are more complicated to model using
navy methods in computer vision. So, we don't stop at the computer vision
techniques, but we reach out to techniques in other areas such as language
modeling, reinforcement learning to model this task. This is similar -- these networks
use similar techniques such as transformers, attention modules, autoregressive
modeling of tokens similar to what language models like ChatGPT do out there.
With such an end-to-end system of solving perception, we have really removed the
brittle post-processing steps and produced high quality output for the planning
system. Even the planning system is not stuck in the old ways; it is now starting to
use more and more AI systems to solve this problem. The neural network-based
planners are needed especially in complicated urban planning, when there's a lot of
other objects interacting with us.
This is for example an intersection, where we have to turn left while yielding to
crossing objects and to the pedestrians crossing the road. We have to do this both
safely and smoothly while respecting everyone's right-of-way and preferences. If this
was done naively, each conﬁguration would take 10 milliseconds of compute and
there are easily thousands of conﬁgurations to reason about. This would not be
feasible using traditional compute. But using AI, we have packaged all of this into a
50 millisecond compute budget so it can run real time.
The second big piece of this puzzle is the data. This is where Tesla has a unique
advantage because it can tap into the ﬂeet to access the exact data that can ﬁx the
problems. But raw data is not suﬃcient. We -- in order to train these networks, you
need label data, you need labels to supervise the networks. And if you only
depended on the human labelers, this data would be too tiny to train these large
multi camera video module. We need lots and lots of data to train these networks.
Hence, we have built a sophisticated auto-labeling pipeline that collects data from
the ﬂeet, runs computational algorithms in our data center and then produces the
labels to train these networks. Here, you are seeing a 3D reconstruction that is
happening by collecting various clips from diﬀerent cars in the ﬂeet and assembling
them all of them together into a single uniﬁed representation of the world around
the car. You can see all the lanes, the road boundaries, curb, crosswalks, even in the
text on the road being accurately reconstructed by these algorithms.
We don't have to stop at this kind of reconstruction. Once we have this base
reconstruction, we can build various simulations on top of it to produce an inﬁnite
variety of data to train for all the corner cases. We have a capable simulator that can
synthesize adversarial weather, lighting conditions and even the motion of other
objects to test all the corner cases that might even be rare in the real world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 32 of 74Here's an example of why this data is critical and how we can solve problems using
data. So back in the days, for example, in this case, we had some false breaking
where we thought this car that's actually parked there was going to move into our
path and hence, we were precautiously braking. But it is unnecessary because the
car is truly parked.
So how can we solve this? What we did was we mined the ﬂeet for similar cases
where the car is false braking due to some parked car. We added 14,000 videos to
our training set. And then once we trained the networks again with this new data, it
now correctly understands that okay, there is no driver in this car and so it must be
parked, so then there is no need to brake. And this is a systematic way to solve
problems.
And on the chart on the right side, you can see that every time we add data, the
performance improves. And then we can do this for every kind of tasks that we have
in our system. And this is what we call as data engine. We identify challenging cases
such as the one you saw earlier and there could be other diﬀerent types of
challenging cases too. We mine the ﬂeet for such data, put it through our auto
labeling system and produce the labels added to the training set. And once you
have the newly trained models, we deploy it onto the ﬂeet. If we rinse and repeat this
process, everything gets better and better.
The ﬁnal critical piece is the compute. In order to train these large models in a
reasonable amount of time, you need lots of compute. In addition, compute is also
required to produce the labels automatically. This is just compute in our data
centers. In addition, we also have high computers in the car, which can run up to like
150 teraOPS of compute.
On the back end, we have a 14,000 GPU cluster and roughly 30% is used for auto
labeling and the remaining 70% is used for training. We also have a 30 petabyte of
video cash and this is growing to 200 petabytes. All of this is going to signiﬁcantly
increase once we bring Dojo, which is our training computer onboard into this.
Just to give you a reference, just the occupancy networks that you saw earlier use 1.4
billion frames to train these networks. We have already shipped our FSD Beta
software to pretty much everyone that has bought it in United States and Canada.
This amounts to roughly 400,000 customers who can turn it on anywhere and then
the car would attempt to drive to the destination, is still supervised but it can already
handle turns, stop at traﬃc lights, yield with other objects and generally get to the
destination.
We have observed that people who use FSD are already 5x to 6x safer than the U.S.
national average. Like, I mentioned earlier, the solution to scalable FSD is getting the
AI architecture, the data and the compute just right. And we have assembled a
world-class team to execute on this. We are pushing the frontier on these three items
and as we improve the safety, the reliability and the comfort of a system, we can thenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Is there a video?
{BIO 22648673 <GO>}
Yeah, next leg is video.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's been weird seeing the arms and legs just separate. We have a whole lab full of
arms and legs with bearing in mind that when we did AI Day,(Inaudible) didn't work
at all. So, the rate of improvement here, I think is quite signiﬁcant. It's obviously not
doing parkour[ph], but it is walking around and we have multiple copies, I suppose
of Optimus. I think that's -- I think Tesla brings to the table that others don't have is
that we have the real-world AI -- we're the most advanced in real-world AI. So the
same AI that drives the car, which you can think of the car really is a robot on wheels
and this is a robot on legs.
So, as we solve real-world AI, I don't think there's any -- I don't think there's anyone
even close to Tesla on solving real-world AI, that same computer and software goes
into Optimus. So it's not that helpful to have a humanoid robot if you have to
program every individual action. It needs to be able to walk around autonomously
and solve tasks. You should be able to instruct it in simple things by showing visually
what you're -- what the robot needs to do or just telling it what to do.
So, I think that's a key advantage that we have and then we also are good at
designing things for manufacturing and then manufacturing itself. So the actuators in
Optimus are all custom design Tesla actuators. So, we design like the electric motor
with the gearbox, the power electronics, obviously the battery pack and everything
else that goes into Optimus.
We're actually quite -- we were quite surprised to ﬁnd how little was available oﬀ the
shelf because there's a lot of -- vast number of electric motors gearboxes and
whatnot that are available in the world. And we found none of them were useful in a
humanoid robot, virtually none. So, you have to custom design the actuators for a
humanoid robot. And so, the same team that designed the ground-breaking electric
motors that are in the say, the Model S Plaid designed the actuators in the robot.
So, I mean for practical purposes what this means is that we should be able to bring
an actual product to market at scale that is useful far faster than anyone else. And
assuming the things I'm saying are true or at least put it -- I think they are true, it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Rebecca Tinuccijust the question of the timing, you start getting into interesting questions of like,
what's the ratio of humans to humanoid robots? I think it might be greater than one-
to-one. Because you can sort of see a use -- a home use for robots, certainly
industrial uses for robots -- humanoid robots. I think we might exceed a one-to-one
ratio of humanoid robots to humans. It's not even clear what an economy means at
that point since the economy is output per person times persons, but if output is
much higher and there's no limit on persons, then what's the actual limit on the
economy? We're still pretty far from Kardashev Scales here, but we're getting there.
So anyway, so probably the least understood or appreciated part of what we're
doing a Tesla that will probably be worth signiﬁcantly more than the car side of
things long term. So charge --

{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Charge.
Hi, there. My name is Rebecca Tinucci, and I lead our Charging Infrastructure teams
here at Tesla. And at Tesla charging, we have understood since day one that a great
charging experience is the linchpin to electric vehicle adoption. And that
understanding has meant that we've always taken a holistic approach to charging.
That's a word that you've heard a lot here today, but what it means for charging is
that, we've considered every use case. We think a lot about what it means to charge
at home, even if that home is an apartment or condo, and we spend a lot of time
thinking about, what does it mean to charge away from home including if that's for
daily commuting or if you're going on a road trip. And this holistic approach has led
to some pretty incredible results.
In 2022, we provided 9 terawatt hours of charging across our various charging
methods, over 50% of that was supplied via convenient AC home charging. And
when our customers are away from home, they can visit one of our 80,000 charging
points that includes 40,000 of our beloved superchargers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 35 of 74Now getting here has meant that we've spent ten years building charging
infrastructure when basically no one else in the industry would do it. And while, we
certainly have a lot of areas that we want to improve, those 10 years have aﬀorded us
the opportunity to get pretty good at charging.
First, we have the industry's lowest deployment costs. Our costs are often 20%, if not
70% lower than alternatives and that goes for both our supercharging hardware and
deployments and our AC charging product lines. A lot of reasons that we're able to
achieve this. You've heard a lot of them here today, we've vertically integrated with
manufacture and engineer all of our own charging equipment. We share
components across our diﬀerent product lines. And on the supercharger side, we
also install and operate all of our own sites and that's led us to be pretty obsessed
with ﬁnding new ways to innovate around installation.
As an example, we have recently extended our excellence in manufacturing to how
we build supercharger sites. We are pre-building for post-supercharger units at our
factory and giga -- at our factory in New York. We load them on a truck. We truck
them to site and then we crane them into position. This method saves us 15% on our
deployment cost and we can install a site in a matter of days. Once we install a site,
we also operate at really eﬃciently. Over the last few years, we've been able to cut
our per kilowatt-hour cost by 40%. Again, a lot of reasons for this but one of the top
of the list is we've focused on increasing our site utilization. Site utilization is just how
many sessions or kilowatt-hours can we push through a site or a post, and basically
doing that allows us to spread our cost over more sessions, thus lower cost per
kilowatt hour. But of course, that's easier said than done, because when we push up
side eﬃciency, of course, the risk is that we have a poor customer experience and we
have wait time at our sites.
This is where trip planner comes in. Trip planners are in-vehicle routing or navigation
system. Other electric vehicle manufacturers or some of them have vehicle side data,
other infrastructure providers have site data. But at Tesla, we have both. And what
that allows us to do is to use trip planner to route vehicles towards available sites
and away from congested sites so we can balance our utilization without risking wait
time. And the results speak for themselves.
Over the last few years, we've been able to drive up site utilization by 30%, that
means lower per kilowatt-hour cost, while also cutting our wait time in half. And we
think this can get even better. Today, we're feeding trip planner with real-time site
information and information about vehicles currently at sites. Going forward, we'll be
moving that to projecting site occupancy based on the understanding of what
vehicles are currently routing to those sites. And ultimately, our vision for trip planner
is that it's the air-traﬃc controller for electric vehicle charging across all infrastructure
on a global basis.
And the last thing we focused on to get here is quicker charge times. We're really
proud of what we've been able to accomplish here. We've shaved oﬀ 30% of our
charge time -- average supercharging sites time, visit time over the last few years.
This has taken improvements on the hardware side, with our software on our on ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Page 36 of 74vehicles and on our infrastructure and we're really excited to continue pushing this
trend down.
Looking forward, the job does not get any easier. As you heard earlier, we aspire to a
fully electriﬁed global ﬂeet. That ﬂeet from an industry standpoint needs 9 petawatt
hours of charging on an annual basis. And while Tesla charging certainly doesn't
have to supply all of that, it does require that for our part, we have a few new focuses
in order to scale.
First, if you want a fully electriﬁed global ﬂeet, all of those vehicles have to have a
great and reliable charging experience. So, as many of you know, recently, we have
started opening up our networks on a global basis. Over 50% of our superchargers
in Europe are currently open to other electric vehicles. We've also opened up in
Asia-Paciﬁc with our ﬁrst sites in Australia and just yesterday, we opened our ﬁrst 10
supercharger sites here in North America in the U.S. to other electric vehicles.
We've also invested a lot to be able to make this a really easy experience for our new
customers. All you have to do is sign into our Tesla app to unlock a post and start
charging. We've also -- on physical site changes, we've also added hardware to our
sites, they're called magic docks and basically, that is installed in areas where we
have diﬀerent charging standards and they allow for other electric vehicles to come
to our site without having to bring their own adapters or hardware. We've also just
started installing our fourth generation, supercharger posts, those are being installed
in Europe ﬁrst. And while it's not a big mention -- not a big thing to mention, they do
have longer charging cables so that we can more easily reach the charge ports of
diﬀerent vehicles.
The second thing we need to make sure we do when we talk about scaling all of this
charging infrastructure is we need to make sure that it's powered from renewable
sources. We're very proud that over the last two years, we've procured enough
renewable energy to oﬀset the amount of charging we've provided to customers.
But as we look forward and we talk about this fully electriﬁed ﬂeet on a global basis,
we really want to make sure that the demand for charging more closely follows when
renewable sources are available.
Now this chart is on an aggregate basis for the U.S. and it varies based on what your
renewable generation sources are locally. But basically, what this shows is we want to
kind of move that charging curve and for solar and wind in this example, it means
more daytime charging. And we think the best way to go towards daytime charging
is to install AC charging that is convenient and low-cost, everywhere vehicles are
typically parked throughout the day.
So that's really the plan. While supercharging and home charging deﬁnitely stay a
big part of the puzzle, our teams are currently scaling to install AC charging,
everywhere vehicles charged during the day so we can power them from renewable
sources.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

KarnBudhirajSo, summing it up, while we've spent 10 years installing infrastructure that is low cost,
it's eﬃcient and it provides a great customer experience, we're really just getting
started, when we talk about supporting Masterplan Part 3. We've got a scale capacity
on an industry-wide basis to 9 petawatt hours on an annual basis. We've got to open
up to non-Tesla's and make the charging experience for everybody really great. And
we've got to power all of this via renewable sources.
And one more thing, yes, we've got to scale our infrastructure. And yes, we want to
power it via renewable sources at Tesla. So, we also want to make sure that we're
continuing to focus on providing really incredible charging experiences.
With that, want to welcome up our leaders of supply chain, Roshan and Karn to talk a
little bit a little bit about that topic.
Thanks, Rebecca. Hi. My name is Karn, and my team leads supply chain for
electronics, powertrain and battery at Tesla. And we've also got responsibilities for
indirect purchasing, construction procurement and warehousing and distribution.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
Hi. My name is Roshan. I've been with Tesla for over 14 years. My team manages
vehicle commodities, solar, logistics, planning and capital equipment.
10 years, forgot that. So today we wanted to provide you a quick overview of Tesla
supply chain and what really separates us from the typical automotive supply chain.
As you've seen in presentations prior from Pete, Andrew and some others, Tesla
designs a lot of the sub components that go into our vehicles. So, we're not buying
things that are oﬀ the shelf from suppliers. So, supply chain is not purely a
commercial relationship as it is in most other companies. We actually have an arm
within supply chain called supply, industrialization, engineering, and the burden of
taking a drawing, a design from concept and turning it into thousands of products
produced at the right cost and at the right yield falls with this group.
Of course, they worked very closely with design engineering. But really, the level of
detail that our engineers get involved in terms of building the capability of the
suppliers is pretty detailed. So, once we get a new part, naturally, with electric
vehicles, a lot of the supply chain doesn't exist. Our engineers would basically take
the drawing, turn it into the manufacturing concept, do the equipment selection and
physically go to the supplier and stay there for weeks or months however long it
takes to basically do the line bring up.
Once the line is brought up and we're hitting the right rates, the right quality at the
right yield, then we work on things like automation and yield improvement and
those types of activities. So there's a big group of mechanical, electrical, industrial,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 38 of 74Roshan Thomas
KarnBudhirajyou name it, engineers within supply chain and it's their responsibility to take care of
this.
Now, this is a huge strategic advantage because we manage every detail of our
supply chain because we are so integrated with our partners that we know about
issues before they happen, it's almost live. We've got dashboards, we've got
connections and across the 10,000 or so factories across the world that are making
our components, we have a pretty good view of the health of those suppliers and
this has been a key asset and how we've been able to kind of manage things
through a lot of diﬀerent issues over the past couple of years.
So supply chain is a game of perfection, perfection is a passing grade. It's like a-- if
one part doesn't show up, that line goes down and our CEO ﬁnds out about it in less
than 20 minutes. And Tesla is very diﬀerent than Apple, they outsource
manufacturing, we do at in-house. So supply chain is kind of right in the middle. And
perfection is increasingly elusive and very expensive if you kind of look at all the
issues we've had to encounter over the past year. And today, we're just going to talk
about how we got through the past and then what are we to do going forward and
how we're going to get there?
So, let me draw your attention to this slide. On the left, you will see a portfolio, our
existing portfolio of products, right? At the top, you've got the S and X platform; in
the middle, you've got three 3 and Y. I think, everyone's more than familiar with
those and then the Tesla Energy platform which is a very high rate of growth for us.
And you see --
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
Don't forget the solar and superchargers.
And solar and supercharger. Thank you, Roshan. And you'll see a reduction in so --
and then we've basically got the Tier 1 and Tier 2 parts. This might be boring, but a
Tier 1 supplier is any supplier that builds and supplies parts directly for consumption
in our ﬁve factories and our Tier 2 supplier basically does the same thing for a Tier 1
supplier. So they are the supplier to our supplier. And depending on the supply
chain of any one of these products, this can actually go down to the Tier 6 levels.
For example, if you're talking about the battery cell, we really get involved with the
minds of like what we're procuring, the lithium, the cobalt and all that sort of stuﬀ
because we're procuring such high volumes of it. So, you'll see a reduction in the
number of parts on the S and X platform to the 3 and Y platform. And this is because
of the great work our design engineers have done of making the car simpler and
easier to manufacture.
In parallel, we actually had a similar strategy and supply chain. We had cast a wide
net to a lot of suppliers through the S and X platform. There was a lot of suppliersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 39 of 74Roshan Thomas

Roshan Thomas
KarnBudhirajthat we invited to partner with us. And we used that platform as sort of a ﬁlter to see
which suppliers have the technical, ﬁnancial and cultural capabilities to match us,
right? Like, who do we invite to the party when we really scale things up. And we've
really dramatically reduced the number of suppliers that we were dealing with for
the 3 and Y platform, and this is an approach we'll continue to do for future
platforms as they come along that are even more high volume. So this has really
been our approach. It's made things a lot easier and it -- we could ﬁgure out the
suppliers that were capable of moving at our pace and then the ones that didn't
have the desire to or the capability to. You need both desire and capability.
Secondly, the complexity on the Tier 2 level is very high, right? These are the
suppliers to our suppliers and there are a lot of components. So think about silica
and think about resistors, capacitors, diodes, all the little assemblies.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
All the raw materials.
Raw materials, that's even further down.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
Yes.
But all these little subassemblies that have to come into Tesla, the complexity is
immense. So, even though at the Tier-1 level, we're talking about 8,000 parts total, it
seems like a lot but it's not a lot. The management of the Tier-2 is really where we
excel. And I'd like to illustrate that with an example.
Meet the car computer, very innocent sounding name and it's anything but, this is an
absolute monster to manage. So, I think you've all seen the picture on the left of the
autopilot board. That's the top of the autopilot board. The autopilot board also has a
bottom and the bottom is populated heavily with components. On the other side of
the heat sink, you've got the MCU, the multimedia cluster board, this board is
equally complex, it's also double-sided eight layered and these boards -- these
computers run so hard at peak operation that they have to be liquid cooled through
a heat sink. So, this assembly requires taking those two boards and then bonding
them to the heat sink, that's hermetically sealed as an assembly, of course, ﬂashing
the software and all that sort of stuﬀ and then that's one part number that comes to
Tesla.
So this is an example of one Tier 1 part number, that's a very complex assembly to
manage of the Tier 2 level. And there's more than 7,000 components here. There's a
-- as we stand here, components being assembled onto a car computer every 1.4FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Roshan Thomasmilliseconds, the line that builds this computer is the length of a football ﬁeld. So, it's
quite complicated. And initially, when we ﬁrst started building this board due to the
complexity of it, we had to rely heavily on labor, but once we dial then the quality,
the rates and the yield, we started focusing on making this more eﬃcient. The only
way to control cost is by removing labor. The ﬁrst step is removing labor. The second
step is fully automating and the third step is turning oﬀ the lights and letting the
factory run ideally. And that's going to be the goal for us here. So 95%, but our work
is not done, we're going to be going a lot further than this.
So, this illustrates the point that a part is not a part, a part has a lot of complexity
underneath it. Supply chain is a game of multiple tiers and what's made us
successful is our involvement and all the details with our supplier engineers that our
Tesla employees, that are Tesla supply engineers, so they are like on our payroll that
go and ramp-up these capabilities at our suppliers and then just managing each and
every attribute of it. 7,000 a day through the chip shortage, through the pandemic,
through all the other stuﬀ that we had to deal with was very diﬃcult to manage, but
because we had all the details, we were able to pull this oﬀ.
Of course, supply chain is not just about parts, it's also about logistics and a lot of
other things. So, I'll hand it oﬀ to Roshan for sharing some stats.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
Yeah. So talking about in board complexity. Just over the course of just last year, we
moved about 16 million pallets from our suppliers to our factories. Just to visualize
that, if you put those pallets side-by-side, it could cover half the circumference of the
earth. And talking about again the Tier 2 complexity, over 1 billion electronic
components get moved every week to support the production that Karn and team
manages.
This is right now, 1 billion components a week.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
Right.
52 billion a year. This is going to go up by the way.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
And on top of that, we also have the responsibility to make sure the right component
is supplied to the right service location to support the growing ﬂeet of our vehicles
and we have about 685 service centers that these components need to show up just
in time. And then we've also been as a result of pandemic and even before that,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

KarnBudhiraj
Roshan Thomaswe're working on dual sourcing and triple sourcing some of our critical components.
As a result of it, we have suppliers around 45 countries in the world.
Yeah. Our approach really has been to bring the manufacturing of subcomponents
closer to the point of consumption. It makes the supply chain more green because
you're not burning diesel moving stuﬀ around and it also gives us a security of
supply of having multiple sources in case one factory gets taken oﬄine.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
And that's how we got through pandemic also.
Yeah.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
So last three years were incredibly hard. Karn and I used to look lot younger pre-
COVID. But on a serious note, pandemic really changed the game of supply chain
management. We were just not being a regular supply chain person. We were rolling
up our sleeves and negotiating with state governments, city managers, mayors to
help kick-start our suppliers to restart their operations. There are some really
inspiring stories where our supply chain team really fought hard to make sure that
the factories don't go down. And it's also a testament to the resilience of our supply
partners.
Having said that, it was not all about resilience and never-give-up attitude. We had
also laid the foundation of having dual sources and also in many instances, we had
many things that we had simpliﬁed, the parts that we had simpliﬁed, the supply chain
design that we had simpliﬁed due to which we were able to get through the
pandemic in much better shape than rest of the automotive.
It forced us to adapt. We encountered issues one at a time. It was really a team eﬀort.
We heavily relied on the government relations team. You've literally had to -- the
COVID pandemic, as you're aware, happened at diﬀerent countries at diﬀerent
times. But unfortunately, you need all the parts to make the car. So at any given
point, there was one factory that was lying down.

Roshan Thomas
KarnBudhirajThere was one jurisdiction that was being -- that didn't want to -- they wanted to shut
down the factory because they -- you had an outbreak. So learning the rules,
understanding, coming up with arguments points, leveraging the team and getting
those, it was a diﬃcult but good experience.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
Exactly.
We learned a lot.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
Yeah. And as we were just ﬁguring out to work with COVID, then the port congestion
hit in on the West Coast. Logistics lead time went up by twice the amount and we
were operating with less than 35% accuracy in the system. That means at any given
point, the ETAs of the vessels were 75% oﬀ. So we ﬁgure out how work with that and
then the chip shortage hits.
Yeah, the chip shortage. That was a nightmare. But we got through it. I mean, I think
it's a testament to the tenacity of the team and the resilience of our supplier
partners. It's mostly behind us. And I think the results speak for themselves. Tesla was
able to grow production volumes at a time where the rest of the industry had a hard
time staying ﬂat. I think they shrunk actually cumulatively.
And we're often asked the question, how did we manage through it? And the answer
is very much kind of baked through the presentation today. First, we designed our
own electronics. So in order to control cost, we really had to go and build
relationships with all the Tier 2 suppliers to negotiate them directly. So, these
relationships were formed over ten years ago and we've really gotten to know them
well.
So when a shortage hit, we knew who to escalate to, who to call, who to ask for help
and really kind of swarming the issue at the point of constraint. So the best team,
strong relationships with vendors. And then we also have a pretty sophisticated
capacity planning function. Tier 2 capacity needs to come on earlier than Tier 1
capacity. Tier 3 capacity has to be even earlier. And our team does a very good job
of having that strategic alignment with all our partners to make sure that the capacity
is ready before we need it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 43 of 74Roshan ThomasWe're a mission-based company. Our goal is to put as many EVs out there. We did
not let the pandemic phase us. We were full the throttle. And it was pedal to the
metal in terms of our demand signal, that also helped. The silicon industry has very
long lead times, they invest billions of dollars in sophisticated fabs that take years to
build. So, that stability and demand is something they appreciate it and it's
something that is very, very much a Tesla thing.
So, this was looking back, right? This is how we got here. This is how we got from 0
to 40,000 cars a week. Let's talk about how we get to 20 million. So, the question
gets asked, is Tesla going to basically break the chip industry if we grow to 20 million
vehicles. The answer is no. But let me walk you through a logic on that. So as it
stands right now, a Tesla enabled with the full self-driving computer has four times
the silicon content of a regular vehicle. So at about the 2 million run rate, we're
consuming about 700,000, 12-inch wafer equivalents. That's the industry churn that's
thrown around for capacity in silicon. That's how much we're using. So little bit below
a million. And the global wafer capacity based on the estimates we've seen is about
135 million. So we're about 0.5 % of the industry, not a lot.
Now, if you get to 20 million, when we get to 20 million, and if we don't make any
simpliﬁcations in terms of part count, which is also a separate work stream, I think
Colin talked about it, Pete talked about it, we're not going to have all these diﬀerent
components, we're really going to simplify the architecture because simpler is better.
But even if you don't do that and we take the most pessimistic case, we're going to
need 8 million wafers, okay? And the industry is going to scale to 200 million by that
point. So still, we're less than 5% of market share. And if we run the same oﬀense we
ran all along and continue to work with our partners and invest in fabs and invest in
capacity, we'll have the capacity ready by the time we need it. So I really don't see
this as an impediment from a supply chain perspective to get to 20 million.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
Now, I would like to talk about a page that we took out of the electronic playbook
and applied it to the mechanical side. Our vehicles use currently the heat pump base
technology for the thermal system, but before heat pump, our vehicles used to have
a dispersed thermal system connected by hoses. Engineering was inspired from
circuit boards and then created a system, which was extremely integrated where
60% of the system was the size of a basketball where it contained about 100
components, 50 sealing interfaces and several diﬀerent manufacturing processes, all
were packaged into this tight size.
Now, why are we talking about this? Well, we launched a system right during the
outbreak of the pandemic in Model Y. The team was forced to manage 100-plus
components from diﬀerent suppliers around the world remotely. So, there are four
videos playing at the same time. One is the video of the manual line that was created
when we started the production and this manual line produced a lot of quality
issues, let alone throughput. So we quickly pivoted to a semi-automated line.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 44 of 74KarnBudhiraj
Roshan Thomas
KarnBudhirajBut in spite of that, although the three -- throughput was great, the quality issues
sustained. So our team decided that fully automated is the only way to go. So before
we automate the line, we created a 3D simulation. Now, not many companies or
teams have this capability. We're at this point now when a part gets packed, we have
the ability to create a 3D simulation of all the complex subassemblies that would be
involved in making the part and tell the suppliers exactly what equipment to
purchase, what to test and create an end-to-end line in simulation. And that's what
we did here.
So, with the help of a simulation, we had a very detailed subassembly cell, which was
juxtaposed with the suppliers' factory layout. And then we, after a back-and-forth of
iteration and optimizing the processes, we implemented this fully automated line in
less than eight months. And the results were remarkable, 99% reduction in labor
force.
So a line that would need thousand associates to build the super manifold in full
volume now just takes 10 associates. And the quality also went up by an order of
magnitude, we have a defect rate of less than 0.005% and a super manifold rolls out
every 7 seconds because we have created many automated lines. And these
factories are the size of two football ﬁelds by the way.
Roshan, (Inaudible) on that one. 99% two football ﬁelds.
{BIO 19053050 <GO>}
So why are we talking about this? In a world where labor costs are increasing, labor
participation is decreasing, there is a huge turnover and the cost of implementing
automation is going down by 3x in the next 10 years. This is how we are thinking
about complex assemblies and we were going to push this type of thinking into our
supply base more and more who will be building our complex assemblies. This is the
only way we think we can conﬁdently scale to the 20 million vehicles target.
To summarize, we have laid the foundation in getting ready to execute Masterplan 3.
Our strategy is supply chain design simpliﬁcation. We are going to make sure that
we have more control into the Tiers of the supply chain. We are going to grow
responsibly and sustainably with our long-term partners and we will automate.
Yeah. So going from 0 to 40,000 cars a week was tough? I mean it took a lot of trial
and error. It took a lot of learning, there's a lot of pain, there's a lot of mental scar
tissue as Elon calls it through that process. But now that we're at that level and the
foundation is set, going from 40 to 400 is not going to -- it doesn't really phase us.
We have a capable team. We've got capable external partners that have gone
through hell with this. The leadership team has galvanized behind the mission andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Drew and Tom for the next presentation. Thank you.
{BIO 18977664 <GO>}
Hi, everyone. My name is Tom Zhu. I'm now responsible for Global Production and
Sales and Delivery Service. I joined the company back in 2014, and I've been running
the company's business in greater China and APAC. Today, I'm representing all the
Giga factories and talk about how we can make more cars and faster.
So right now, we have four vehicle factories on three continents to serve our markets.
The total number of manufacturing employee is over 65,000. This is also including
our amazing team in Reno. They are making powertrains, battery packs or drive units
for our vehicle factories. The total installed capacity in all these vehicle factories is
about 2 million cars a year. That said, we're always looking for opportunity to grow
more capacity from the existing footprint. So, you expect this number will grow over
time.
To build more factories is the start to build more cars and we certainly the expert of
it. This is the before and after image showing you the progress we've made back in
2019 when we build a gig factory in Shanghai. So in nine and a half months time, we
built a greenﬁeld project to against established the vehicle factory. And three
months later, we started to deliver our ﬁrst customer vehicle.
People always ask me, how Tesla can build a factory that fast. Really, we learned from
our free manufacturer a lot. We talked to the survivor from the production and tried
to avoid all the mistakes we made, and we decided to design a straight line with
minimum number of up and downs and turns for easier manufacturing ability and
easier construction. We also challenged all the assumptions that people ever know
to build a vehicle factory, we deleted and we simpliﬁed all the redundancies and the
buﬀers that's helped us to save a lot of time.
Also, we have a very strong in-house construction team in Tesla. If there is ever a job
cannot be done by others better and we bring this in-house. So we have this in-
house construction team, have a full control over all the activities on site from design,
engineering to construction, site management. So this team not -- didn't just build
Giga Shanghai, they also build Giga Berlin, Giga Texas and Giga Nevada and they're
really the hero behind the scenes.
Like, Larson shared earlier, going forward with the new platform, the more modular
design and intensiﬁed Gigafactory will be able to make more cars and even reduce
the footprint. That also means we can build more factories at the same time. With the
drawing after of all manufacturing teams around the globe, I'm happy to share early
this morning, we hit the 4 million mark for total Tesla ever built. And the 4 million
vehicle actually built in this factory. When you took a tour on our shop ﬂoor, you
probably looked past it, right? So it took us 12 years to build the ﬁrst million vehicle
and about 18 months to the second -- building the second million. The third millionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Tom Zhutook us 11 months and just shortly less than seven months, we built he four million
cars. So we're getting better at a faster -
- exponential growth.
{BIO 18977664 <GO>}
Really kudos to the team. So what it takes to run the giga factory? Well, if you have
600 robots, 10,000 trained employees or 5,000 human and 5,000 Optimus and
100s of process, you can do it. Sounds simple, but it's extremely hard.
So there's two key metrics that we predominantly focused on. It is an overall
equipment eﬀectiveness and the cycle time. In Tesla, we're setting the passing grade
for our vehicle factories with 90% OEE and 45-second cycle time. What that means,
the OEE really evaluate the equipment uptime, the machine performance and
quality. Simply put, this is the actual production time on a good quality product
versus the plan, the productive time, the higher the better.
The 45 second cycle time that means you expect every 45 seconds that there's a car
rolling oﬀ the ﬁnal assembly line in the factory. And the faster we rent, the faster we
can get the economy of scale. If you look at the chart on the right-- on the left,
Shanghai be able to signiﬁcantly drop our labor hours per car during the ramp, the
little dip that has happened in the last Q2, 2022, because of the COVID shutdown.
And on the right is the Fremont model Y shop, even this is a 6 year old facility. The
team there will still be able to optimize the material ﬂow, eliminate all the single
point of failure and drive higher output, hence reduce the labor hours. And actually,
this factory keeps setting a new record. Yesterday, they just had a new factory daily
record.
Congrats Fremont team.
{BIO 18977664 <GO>}
Absolutely. So, how can we reduce the cycle time? Keep improving eﬃciency. We
followed the philosophy Elon shared about a building rocket, which is questioning,
basically found the right problem to solve and we start with delete, simplify, then we
try to accelerate to pressurize the line and ﬁnd if the solution actually work, and at
last, we think about the automation.
There's one example in Gigafactory Shanghaiing the paint shop, we ﬁnd that there is
an overlap baking range between the PVC sealer in the top coat, it was done by two
diﬀerent ovens and we decided to combine the two processes eventually that
helped us, didn't just help us to reduce the cycle time, but also save 9% of the
energy consumption and the 9% of the CO2 emission.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 47 of 74Andrew D. BaglinoAlso, we communized the S and X design in Fremont. Right now, we have a common
body and common headlamp. We eliminated about 40 parts and reduced about a
10% of the cycle time. So all these improvements really help us to get through a
faster ramp trajectory and we didn't just learn from these high volume existing
factories, we also learned from the new factories. Most recently, our Gig Berlin
factory team implemented a 5G private network on the shop ﬂoor, helped us to
overcome about a 90% of the over cycle issues for a particular process in GA shop.
We're going to soon implement this globally.
So right now, we have an integrated global organization from production all the way
to sales and delivery service. This will help us to strength feedback loop between
manufacturing and the service. We obviously want to bring a delight for customer
ownership experience to our car owners and with this direct feedback loop, we'll be
able to turn customer escalations and the feedback into quick actions and
improvement on shop ﬂoor immediately. With that eﬀort in the past six months, we'll
be able to reduce the time in service and early ownership service, also service
appointment with time signiﬁcantly.
So four factories not enough. If we want to hit the 20 million car a year target, we're
going to keep building new factories, new lines and that will come up with new
product as well. And with all Giga factories and now in the one organization would
be able to replicate uniﬁed ideas across factories. Also, we will help the new factories
that rent faster and also produce a better quality at the lower cost.
Now, I'm going to hand over to Drew to talk about cell manufacturing.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Thanks, Tom. Yeah, we're not just talking about new vehicle factories but also new
cell factories. And we're going to talk about how we follow the same model when we
do so. But ﬁrst I thought I'd just provide a little bit of an update on cell production.
So remember Battery Day, we showed this video with the spoon and how we went
from dry powder to ﬁlm. Let's just say, there's no spoon now. So many of you in this
room saw this on your tour today, but here is our dry electrode machine here in
Texas one of the lines, we have installed here, fully automated, no spoon from
powder and foil into coated electrode out. From a peak productivity perspective, per
tool perspective, is over 20x productivity of the tools that we showed folks on the
tour and (Inaudible) back in battery day. So we've made a lot of progress on the key,
one of the key parts of the cell manufacturing process.
And we've also continued to focus on reﬁning the way we make cells and the
factories that the cells go inside. We, as you can see on this chart, from typical 2,170
cylindrical cells to 4,680 made a huge leap, which is basically a 5x reduction in the
factory footprint and volume and footprint. And then from going from what we did in
Fremont in our pilot line to Texas, we improved further and we're improving again
when we go into Nevada. And what this actually represents is a series of actions
taken by a very integrated, holistic design team across the product design, theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Page 48 of 74Michael Snydermanufacturing design, the process design, equipment design and the facility design.
They all need to work together to make this happen. And you can see on the bottom
just as an example of simplicity up, investment down and scaling up, parts, we've
reduced the number of parts in the cell. Number of processes, signiﬁcant reduction
in the number of processes. And collaborating with those ﬁve design groups, we've
been able to result -- build -- end up in a -- with a factory that's 10x smaller
volumetrically, which means it's faster to get built. It's much lower CapEx per
gigawatt hour of output and we can go and scale to our objectives of 240 total
terawatt-hours, 1 terawatt a year, of stationary storage of 20 million vehicles a year,
with the scalability that is required to achieve our goals.
And we're not just looking at the cell factory itself, but also upstream materials where
necessary. What you see here is a -- the rendering of the 50 gigawatt hour a year.
Corpus Christi lithium reﬁnery that we've already broken ground on here in Texas,
the facility will start commissioning by the end of 2023 this year. This is a good
example of something where we're basically talking about breaking ground and
starting commissioning within 10 months and with actual production within 12
months, that's the target, similar to what we did in Shanghai, again the result of
collaboration and internal execution of construction and partnership with local
communities.
Third, this site is 30 minutes from the Corpus Christi ports, located directly on rail.
The process route we're taking is a direct soda ash leach of the input material, which
means there is no acid roasting. We don't have any of the sort of waste products
associated with an acid roasting step. We're designed to consume lithium
spodumene, which is a very commonly traded lithium rock. But it is ﬂexible to other
feeds from primary and secondary sources.
And similarly, we're working on our cathode facility here in Texas. Maybe you've seen
it as you're driving around, which is a 60 gigawatt-hour year cathode facility behind
the main building here, 10 months build time there as well. The install -- the
equipments being installed for the ﬁrst line as we speak and will be commissioning
starting next quarter. So we are doing this where we need to. Our plan is not to do it
always. There are lots of conﬁdent companies out there, but we are also trying to sort
of accelerate the pace of the industry by trying some new things that are a little bit
more scalable and de-risking certain innovations that improve productivity per -- in
terms of CapEx per gigawatt-hour and things like that.
And with that, I think that sums up our eﬀorts on the factory side. Mike, you want to
come up and we'll talk about energy. All right, take it away.

Michael SnyderFrom the beginning with this business, we have always focused on building
successful projects for our customers and not just the batteries in the box. We've
built a hardware and a software platform that is able to adapt to environments all
over the world, and that is able to scale from small island projects to large gigawatt-
hour scale batteries.
We've invested our time and our talent to best understand every aspect, every step
in the process and every risk of a project to ultimately provide a solution that is
thoughtful, intuitive, provides great value to our customers and is as plug-and-play
as possible.
And yeah, just looking at these projects, it's incredible to see them all come together
in one montage.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Seeing the future.
{BIO 4141423 <GO>}
Yeah. It's compressed. It's 10 years of building these projects and it's incredible to
see the impact and to see what we have in front of us.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Absolutely.
{BIO 4141423 <GO>}
We're on our sixth generation of our industrial product, which is the Megapack XL
that we're building out of the Lathrop, California. We've deployed over 16 gigawatt-
hours of industrial and residential products across 50 countries and really Megapack
is a market leader. Its best-in-class in eﬃciency, reliability, energy density and easiest
to install, lowest cost to install.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And we call it XL because it is actually the like largest, heaviest object that you can
transfer around the roads of the world without having to shut them down and get
crazy permits and things like this. So it is extra large. There is not going to be an XXL,
let's just say it that way.
{BIO 4141423 <GO>}
There's been incredible demand for the project -- for the product. 2023 is going to
be a great year. We have gigawatt-hour scale projects being built, the Lathrop
factory continues to scale and ramp up and there sinew products on the near-term
roadmap. So a lot to look forward to.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Andrew D. BaglinoHow did we get here? Number one, a maniacal focus on all aspects of delivering
stationary storage. What do we mean by that? What are some examples? As you see
here, the Megapack enclosure for one example, we designed the wire ways directly
into the base of the enclosure. So typically, you need to install a bunch of conduits
and cables under the ground. Now, you can lift them up and install them directly into
the base, increasing the speed of deployment and lowering the cost.
Next, we see the batteries in the power electronics and the power electronics is
really the beauty and the elegance of the Megapack. So, this is what converts the DC
power to AC power on the grid. The brain is built directly into the product. It is able
to connect to any grid in the world right out of the box. It allows it to -- all the
Megapacks on a given site to work as one unit. And really, it's what makes it what it
is. So I think it's the most incredible feature of the Megapack.
As you build out the full site, what we end up with is the most energy than solution
on the market upwards of 300 megawatt hours per acre. And just as a frame of
reference, this solution is 2x more power dense than a typical gas peaker plant. So
this is the future, this is where we're going.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
This is the product that retires the fossil fuels.
{BIO 4141423 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
One power plant at a time.
{BIO 4141423 <GO>}
We'll talk about power electronics a little bit more. Tesla is a leader in power
electronics. We've deployed over 1.4 terawatts across energy storage and vehicle
and we deliver more power electronics than the solar and the wind industry
combined on a per annum basis.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And power electronics, it's hard to under -- to overstate how impactful they are. They
are really the glue in the sustainable energy economy between generation, storage
and the end-use. Those power electronics devices are switching thousands of times
per second -- hundreds of thousands of times per second to eﬃciently react to
whatever is needed either in the car and the grid and because they are so like sort of
software driven at their core, they can provide functionality that hasn't been available
to the grid in the past and it's one of the reasons why renewables and storage
together are such a great solution.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 51 of 74Michael Snyder
Andrew D. Baglino
Michael Snyder
Andrew D. Baglino
Michael Snyder{BIO 4141423 <GO>}
Yeah. And one reason that we focus on power electronics and control so much is
because of the impact that it has on the projects directly. So, just as an example here
on the left, we have a ﬁrmware feature that we call virtual machine mode, and what
virtual machine mode is it contributes to grid stability like a car shock absorber that
dampens oscillations or vibrations and keeps the ride smooth. So you can imagine if
you don't dampen those vibrations, the vehicle could lose control or someone could
get hurt. On the grid, you could have a blackout.
We have one grid operator that is utilizing virtual machine mode and said they will
not operate their grid at 100% renewables unless they have this feature -- unless they
have virtual machine mode working.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 4141423 <GO>}
But they tried and it didn't work very well.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And virtually why is it virtual machine(Inaudible) like synthetic inertia, where you turn
the battery power plant into like through software behaving like it's a giant spinning
machine literally and that like inertia stabilizes the grid. And you don't -- but you
don't need a giant spinning machine. You don't need like a huge fossil fuel power
plant or giant hydro turbine. You're just going to have the battery do it. And you can
program it to whatever you need at that part of the grid or even have it be
dynamically changing as the grid conditions change, right?
{BIO 4141423 <GO>}
That's why we focus so much on and we believe it's the future of how batteries are
going to add value, it's going to be more about adding power stability just as it is
about energy.
Autobidder is another software feature I wanted to mention. Autobidder is an
autonomous energy trading platform that in its most basic senses, buying energy
low and selling it high and the owner can net the diﬀerence of that. But operating
battery storage is actually very complex, upwards -- needing upwards of hundreds or
even thousands of decisions every 5 minutes. So it's much more complex than a PV,
a solar plant or a wind plant or a thermal battery, a thermal generation plant.
And it's mostly because of the versatility and the ability of the battery to provide so
much value in diﬀerent ways that these decisions need to be made in real time inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 52 of 74Andrew D. Baglinoorder to optimize and get the most value out of the batteries that can.
So there wasn't a solution that existed in the market. So we built one ourselves in the
market that we've been to markets, we've deployed them in, in Australia, in Texas, in
the UK. It is proven to be a market leader. We're continuing to invest in Autobidder
as we expand to new markets.
Second point of how we got here? A relentless focus on speed of execution and
there's two points to be made here. First one is in building factories. What you're
seeing here is a time lapse of the mega factory that that was built in Lathrop. We
took it from a JC Penney Distribution Center to a world-class manufacturing facility in
less than 12 months, which is incredible. And really the way that we did this is similar
to what my colleagues have described, it's leveraging the vertical integration of
Tesla. It's getting the vehicle manufacturing team in the same room as construction
and engineering and making decisions quickly with all the decision -- with all the
stakeholders and decision-makers. We're using the lessons learned from Lathrop as
we speak, as we plan for our next factories.
Second, it's about installing projects faster. I've mentioned this already, but plug-
and-play is kind of at the core of what we're going for. Over the past four years,
we've increased the installation speed by 4x and we've reduced the total labor
involved across both construction and manufacturing by 3x. We think that this is key
to unlocking our ability to scale and our customers ability to scale with us. We need
to make be laser focused on reducing that time for when the Megapack leaves the
factory to when it is operational on the grid.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
And it's not just about centralized storage. It's also about distributed storage, the
future roadmap of (Inaudible)here at Tesla. And maybe some of you know about this
sort of retail plan we have here in Texas and I just wanted to talk a little bit about how
that all ﬁts together. So Tesla electric really unlocks the full value of distributed
energy and storage products. So it enables, our customers to become their own
utility. The data on the page is from our South Australia virtual power plant, another
Tesla electric setup that we have.
Over 2022, it's 5,000 customers that we have the data for. You can get a sense for
what's happening. So just if they were being provided default utility service and you
looked at the cost of serving them in electricity, on average, $140 a month. If they all
had solar and Powerwall, but the solar and powerwall wasn't interacting with the
grid, wasn't participating in the energy market, the cost of serving that customer
would go from -- would half, go from $140 a month to $70 a month.
If Tesla Electric is operating those assets in an intelligent way to beneﬁt the grid,
Tesla Electric being basically a software that we developed out of Autobidder for the
purposes of these distributed energy resources, we can actually pay the customers
to bring their energy services to the grid. That's what happened in Australia last year.
And it's always a little bit of a special case there. They represent the future, SouthFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 53 of 74Unidentiﬁed SpeakerAustralia in particular, solar and wind supplied 70% of South Australia's energy in
2022 that compares to 30% in Texas and 35% in California. But it -- but this is an
indication of where this is all headed of both centralized and distributed storage
resources, providing the key to unlocking fully renewable grids. And Tesla Electric is
the retail plan that we're using to bring that to bear for our customers that have our
products.
And this is how we're rolling it out. First, as it exists, it's available for in Texas for
people who have Powerwalls in their homes, but we need to extend beyond that.
Over a billion people live in markets with competitive retail electricity and there's
over 2 trillion in annual energy spend In these markets. This is a huge opportunity.
And the --our intention is to bring this to market-by-market in the same way that
we've approached Tesla Insurance where we can bring value to our customers to
reduce their total cost of ownership of our products.
So actually, what we're going to do next and this is pretty exciting here in Texas by
the summer, we're going to oﬀer a retail electricity plan to people who have our cars
where they can have unlimited overnight home charging for $30 a month.
This is part of reducing the total cost of ownership of our vehicles, and the reason
why we could do this is because Texas has a ton of wind, and in Texas, the wind
blows at night. So, actually, serving these customers with electricity at night for their
cars is the best thing to do for everyone. This is a way to incentivize people to charge
at home, at night directly, from renewable power. It's part of the grand Masterplan
we talked about at the beginning.
So we're very excited about this and we do see this similar to Tesla insurance as I
said, is further reducing the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles.
So putting this all together, we're really at the beginning of this massive ramp in
energy storage deployment.
Yeah. Reﬂecting back on the Masterplan, we talk about tens of terawatt hour --
needing tens of terawatt hours of stationary storage. So, we have our sites set on
annual production rates of 1 terawatt hour, which is 25x our capacity at Lathrop.
In the near term, we see really strong demand for the Megapack product, over 100
gigawatt-hours per year, in 2023 and growing by over 100 gigawatt-hours per year
over the next few years. So the demand is there and naturally as we continue to
focus on cost and speed and value, the things that we've mentioned, it's clear we
need to build more capacity and we need to ramp it quickly.
So while the challenge is big, it's also a huge opportunity for Tesla, it's a huge
opportunity for the Megapack business. And I'm excited to see the impact that it's
going to make on our good transition.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Thank you, Brandon. Hi, everyone. My name is Laurie Shelby, and I lead the
Environmental Health Safety, Security and Sustainability Team. I've been with Tesla
for 5.5 years.
So I'm going to talk about Tesla's impact, and of course, that starts with our awesome
team members. So you've heard a lot today about our amazing products, our
process, our software. You've seen lots of numbers and lots of graphs. You've also
heard a common theme and that common theme is that Tesla's team is what drives
our success and makes a diﬀerence. Whether you're in our factories, and our sales,
service and delivery centers, our warehouses or in the ﬁeld, you can see and you can
feel the collaboration that's happening. And you also can see the pride that

So we are creating a lot of meaningful work through our jobs. We're a huge
employer and we're growing every day. We're at 129,000, And more than half of our
team works in vehicle manufacturing, and almost 60% of our team is based in the
U.S.

Page 55 of 74Zachary KirkhornSpaceX and Tesla. In 2021, we got 3 million applicants. 3 million, that's incredible.
And our culture, our culture at Tesla is anyone at any time can raise an idea or make
an improvement, suggestions across safety, people, cost, production, quality,
because we have a very simple process called take charge. And take charge is really
employee engagement. And as take charges go up, as you can see in this graph,
injuries go down. And you know why? People who do the work -- the people who do
the work, know how to improve the work.
Sustainability. Sustainability is everything. It's our mission. You've heard about it all
day, part of our master plan. But at Tesla, we don't just tick boxes to meet a
requirement. We really focus on the impact that our products and our software will
deliver. In 2021, our customers avoided 8.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas.
That's equivalent to taking 1.7 million ice vehicles oﬀ the road for a full year. Yes.
We're also focusing on doing really good work and driving sustainability into our
operations. We have year-over-year reduction in our water use, in our waste, and
we're growing and building a renewable energy program within our operations, just
like supercharging as you heard. So it's not just about our products, it's the way we
make our products, both phases.
Tesla, our company is solving both sides of the clean energy equation. We've got the
clean generation, the clean storage. We also have zero emission transport. As this
slide shows, from 2012 to 2021, our products generated more energy that was
consumed by all Tesla vehicles and our factories. It's amazing. Yeah, I like the claps.
Yeah. I'll take all of the claps.
So our vehicles use less emissions than gas powered vehicles. Even in the worst case
scenario, 100% coal grid. The Model 3 has less emissions than the average ice car,
and we're only going to get better. You heard about that today. Every product we
make is more eﬃcient, every factory we build is more sustainable. So it's only going
to get better and better.
So, as we build our zero-emission future, we've been talking with our stakeholders,
with our shareholders about how do we improve our reporting framework and we
are aligning with a TCDF -- so TCFD. So we're aligning with the TCFD, which I know
many of you have been asking us about. I also want you to stay tuned because
there's going to be much more coming in our impact report. So, thank you all and up
next is Zach Kirkhorn.

Thank you, Laurie. All right. So this is our last section of our prepared remarks today.
Will kind of take what we've discussed today and summarize it at the corporate level
for our ﬁnancials. Maybe before I jump into the details here, we've never done an
Investor Day as a company.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 56 of 74We've never brought our leadership team out and asked them to talk about the
things that they're working on. So, I feel very fortunate to be able to work alongside
this group of people and support their teams. And I also just want to thank them,
they're in a room in the back listening to this, for all of the work that they put in to
today and getting the company to where it is today. So thank you to the Tesla team.
When we were preparing for today, folks were asking, well, Zach, what should we
talk about? And really the only guidance we gave folks is well, talk about the things
that you're working on, and talk about it in the context of the master plan. And what
did almost everybody talk about today in great detail, all of the work that they're
doing to take cost out. Because in this industry, in this business, you survive or you
die, based upon the ability to manage our costs.
And so I'd like to talk about cost as well. If we look at our longest-running scale
production product, this is the Model 3. We reached 5,000 cars per week, which was
our design capacity in mid 2018. And since then we've taken 30% of cost out of this
product. And there's two points I want to make about this. The ﬁrst is that cost
reduction as you have heard throughout the course of the day is deeply ingrained in
our culture. And I think one of the most important reasons why we are here today as
a company.
The second point that I want to make, is that when we're working on cost reduction,
it's easy just to take cost out and make our products worse. But we have to take cost
out and improve our products at the same time, this is the hard thing to do, but it's
the necessary thing to do to continue to move forward. And if you look at a version
of a Model 3 that we've built today and you compare it back to a Model 3 that we
built in 2018, there's a long list of improvements that we put into the car while also
taking costs out of the product.
Cost reduction doesn't just come from one place. There's no silver bullet here. And
we push the boundaries on volume with the Model 3 Program, increasing volume 3x
over this period of time. We've improved productivity. So in our Fremont factory, we
are twice as productive now as we were, in mid 2018.
We've made a lot of progress on overhead eﬃciencies and product improvements
as we've discussed, and a long list of other things including localization, our factory
in Shanghai. And as we ramp up volume and as we ﬁnd eﬃciencies, we work with
our suppliers to do the same and that leads to material cost reductions that improve
the aﬀordability of our products.
And as we look forward to our next-gen vehicle, our target is to reduce 50% of cost,
and we've talked about that a bit earlier today. From -- going from the Model S and X
platform to the 3 and Y platform, we took out 50% of cost. So the task here is to do it
again. And this is very important, because as we improve aﬀordability, the number of
customers who have access to our products dramatically increases, and as we link
this back to our master plan, it enables an exponential growth in our volume with
linear reductions in the cost of our products.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 57 of 74The second point I'll make here is that, and again cost reductions don't come from
any single one place. And so you can see the buckets here on the vehicle side,
battery and powertrain, manufacturing cost reductions and others, these buckets are
relatively equal in size. And so in order to take 50% of cost out of the product, we
have to go through everything.
But more importantly than just the cost of the car upfront, when we're transitioning
to a sustainable economy, particularly with vehicle ownership, it's really important to
think about the lifetime cost of the products.
And this chart here is showing what the total cost of ownership per mile is over the
course of ﬁve years. And we have to think about ﬁnancing costs, insurance costs, the
cost of power, Drew [ph] talked a little bit about that with the plans that were doing
in Texas, wear and tear and maintenance on the cars, et cetera.
And we're already at a place today in the U.S. where a base Model 3 on a cost per
mile basis is less than a Toyota Corolla, which is the highest selling car in the world.
And as we move towards our next-gen platform, we will continue to reduce this. And
as we work on Robotaxi variants of this platform, this cost will come down even
down even further. So this is a product that has -- that we expect to have substantially
lower cost per mile than the highest volume products in the world.
The next thing on cost reduction I want to talk about is operating expenses. We
spent a lot of time on our earnings calls talking about gross margins and product
cost. We don't spend a lot of time talking about OpEx, but I think this is one of the
really important parts of our story.
So since 2018, we've reduced our non-GAAP OpEx 60% as a percent of revenue,
and 75% on a per delivered car basis. This is quite staggering, and I want to go into
the details about how we've done this. The ﬁrst component of OpEx which is R&D,
the single most important thing here is that we constrain the number of programs
that we work on.
So minimizing the number of programs that we're running in parallel and the key
here is to maximize the revenue and cash generated from every program that we
work on. And also maximize the technology sharing between the programs. So we
talked a little bit about how power electronics and our energy business is shared
with power electronics in our vehicle business.
If we look at the SG&A side of this, I think, the story here is pretty dramatic. So we're
showing here a comparison of SG&A per car delivered, compared to the traditional
auto industry, which is both in OEM and the dealership network. And our estimates
are that we're 60% to 70% lower on a per car basis. And if you turn this into dollars,
this is many thousands of dollars per car.
This is part of the reason why on the last earnings call, I made the comment that we
think about operating margin more so than gross margin as a company, because theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Page 58 of 74integration that we have here on the SG&A side, particularly with vertical integration
into our dealership network, this provides eﬃciencies that give us a competitive
advantage from cost structure standpoint, relative to other companies.
The other thing that I'll note here is that this wasn't always the case and it wasn't that
long ago where these bars would be inverted. And if we go back a little bit in time,
when we talk about when we launched Model 3, in the Fremont factory, we went
from 2,000 cars per week which was S&X adding 5,000 a week to that for Model 3,
got us to 7,000 cars a week.
You've heard some folks here today talk about production hell, but I don't think
we've ever talked about as a company as back oﬃce operations hell, which also
happened at the same time. And 7,000 cars a week, 350,000 cars a year. We want to
go to 20 million cars a year and we're struggling at 7,000. And we're saying to
ourselves, we have to completely rethink the way that we're managing our back-
oﬃce operations if we have any hope of eﬃciently scaling this company.
And so this began a process that we're still continuing to work on today, but it's
something that we refer to as the Tesla operating system. So, in the same way that
we're vertically integrated into the software that manages our cars, we've also
vertically integrated into the software that runs our company. And all of our major
departments in the company are using not all of them yet -- but almost all of them
are using our in-house software.
Most recently, we removed third-party recruiting software and we're now running our
own recruiting software as a company. And this matters a lot because rather than
having a complex web of third-party systems that are generic solution, that takes a
lot of eﬀort to customize for our particular needs, we've been able to put in place
with an in-house applications engineering team, dedicated lightweight software that
does only what we need it to do and nothing more.
And that team works very closely with process improvement teams that sit within the
business, who are looking through all of the processes that we're managing as a
company, and following the exact same process that Tom mentioned in the
manufacturing space to look at our processes, delete process steps that we don't
need, simplify process steps that are existing, and automate what's remaining.
And the results of this have been, quite staggering to be frank. I think it's exceeded
our expectations as well. On the left side of this chart are some examples of the
eﬃciency improvements that we've seen within our SG&A areas as a result of the
strategy. The North American sales team is four times more eﬃcient now than they
were in 2018. Order operations team, ﬁnancial services, I mean these levels of
improvement are large and there's not enough pixels on the slide here to list out
everything. So it's just a couple of examples.
And then in the same way that when we look to take cost out of our products, we
want to feature up the product or improve the product while taking cost out, theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 59 of 74same has been true with the use of Tesla operating system and that integration with
our process improvement teams within the company.
And so we've increased performance and added capabilities, while also dramatically
reducing cost on a per car basis. There's a list of self-service functionality that we've
put in place, which customers like and also simpliﬁes our operations behind the
scenes. We've used the Tesla operating system to expand into our captive insurance
phase, which we are fully vertically integrated into. We run our own in-house
software. We have our own agents, our own claim software and claims folks who run
our insurance business.
This is also very important because as a technology company, data is very important
and we use the systems and the access to the data in the systems to pull out
extremely granular and targeted reporting that enables us to see every aspect of our
business in real time. So we can make adjustments to our operations as needed.
And there are sometimes, examples where we say, man, I wish we were tracking this
piece of data. Well, it's a team's meeting away from the applications engineering
team to make a request and then we can start tracking that data and make those
changes. And so the feedback loop associated with process improvement, inside the
company is pretty astounding.
The last thing I'll just mention here which is something I'm personally quite proud of,
we've made a lot of progress in our closed processes within the ﬁnance team,
getting our 10-Q and 10-K ﬁled, it's amongst the fastest of the 20 largest market cap
companies. So great work to the ﬁnance team here.
So all of this work on cost reduction is extremely important, because we have a lot of
money to spend ahead of us, to achieve our goals within the master plan. So we've
mentioned over the course of the day today, 20 million annual vehicle production as
our target, 1 terawatt hour of annual energy storage production, and then expanding
cell production, service and charging in line with the growth of those other
businesses.
And so we've estimated what we think the total cost to get there will be. And there's
certainly error bars around these numbers as we continue to progress and innovate,
but of this, we've spent about $28 billion of that so far in the history of the company.
And maybe this total investment looks large. I actually think it's quite small, relative
to our ambitions. And if you look at our 2022 operating cash ﬂows and you just say,
well, let's assume some modest growth to that, maybe not all that much if you're
being conservative, but the ability to pay for this level of investment from the
forecast that we have, is very achievable for us.
I'm often asked about capital allocation. I think, our strategy here is very
straightforward. I touched upon it, a little bit in our last slide, but just to be explicit
about it. Obviously, the priority here is to ensure that we're using capital to run the
day-to-day operations of the business. This is a working capital intensive businessFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 60 of 74Elon R. Muskand this has to be managed very carefully. And so, over the course of a quarter, there
can be multibillion-dollar swings in our cash balance up and down, just depending
upon the timing of when we build and deliver cars. So we obviously have to have
plenty set aside for that.
Downside protection is another really important area where we have money set
aside for that. And over the last couple of years, throughout the pandemic, I think
this just highlights why being ready for downside protection is important.
Preserving daily operations is the engine that then generates cash that allows us to
reinvest into the growth of the business and I'm very proud that over the last couple
of years, despite the ups and downs in the macro environment and interruptions to
supply chains, we have never once pulled back on our investments in growth, so that
remains a huge priority for us.
We do then after investing in growth, we look at opportunistic ways to spend our
cash. These are more ﬁnancially oriented where if the return exceeds a hurdle, then
we can place cash in that. This is part of our story of cost reduction in the Fremont
factory.
And then on the excess side, this is where the Board meets on a regular basis, and
thinking about what our cash ﬂow projections are looking forward and whether it
makes sense to do buybacks or dividends.
So, to wrap up the ﬁnance portion of the presentation today, couple of key messages
I just want to leave you all with here is that we use innovation at an intense level, to
drive costs down and improve the eﬃciency of the business. And the reason this is
so important is it allows us to improve product aﬀordability. This is particularly the
case when we move to our next generation platform.
Improving aﬀordability allows us to comfortably make investments that grow volume,
that volume generates cash, that then allows us to make more investments. And as
we integrate that going forward, it's our belief as a leadership team here at Tesla that
we're going to achieve unprecedented scale in the manufacturing space. And this is
what's ultimately required to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.
So with that, this completes the prepared portion of today. We're going to take a
short break, and then we'll resume with the live Q&A. Thank you all very much.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}

the day is that we're excited to announce that we're going to be building a

groundbreaking and whatnot, but we're excited to announce that the next Tesla

existing factories, so including California, Nevada, here in Texas obviously and well in
Shanghai. So we intend to increase production at all factories, so the Giga Mexico
would be supplemental to the output of all the other factories.
So this is not to be clear, moving output from anywhere to anywhere, it is simply
about expanding total global output. Yeah, so it's going to be good.
So, yeah, -- you okay, Laurie. So, I think that's -- yeah, we're quite excited to announce
that. In fact, I believe the Governor is here, it's hard to see. Welcome. Secretary of

groundbreaking and opening. So, let's see, with that we can move to, I guess, Q&A.
We've obviously got signiﬁcant bench strength here. Probably like a bench, maybe
we have too many people on stage, but we'll try to answer questions within reason.
Yeah, this is meant to be kind of more of a long-term sort of discussion as opposed
to what will be the production for the rest of the quarter type of thing. So let's try to
orient our questions towards long-term value creation and with that ﬁre away.

{BIO 1528384 <GO>}
Hi, it's Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Very exciting plans about the next-generation
vehicle and powertrains and batteries. I was hoping you can maybe talk to us a little
bit about the timeline for deploying this, and it sounds like it's more than just a
vehicle, it's is a kind of a paradigm change on how vehicles are assembled? How
batteries are put together and everything?
And does that also just get reconﬁgured into everything that you do. So, the model
Ys that are being built here will be built very diﬀerently in the future. Maybe just give
us some feel for what happens from here and what's the timeline for
implementation?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I'll talk a little bit about that, but broadly speaking, the most profound
architectural changes will be in future vehicles. Retooling a factory means bringing
the factory down for an extended period of time, and that we prefer not to do that I
think. But there are variants in how Model Y is produced. So we've got a variantFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

structural battery pack. And then there are a number of small improvements that
occur, but I think for really, really big changes, those would be future vehicles. Yeah, I
know you guys want to add? (Inaudible)
Me? Yeah. So, I mean as far as, I agree with you 100%, Elon, it's really easy to put
innovations in new vehicles, but long-term, we'll obviously bring them back. We've
always talked about that, but we don't want to take our factories down. As far as the
timeline goes, we're going to go as fast as we can, left to right. As always, Elon
alluded to the fact that Mexico will build our next gen vehicle, but we will also be
doing that in other plants. And so it's really about getting them all up and running.
We expect that to be a huge volume product, and we're going to move that quickly
over the next couple of years.
Let's go to Adam.
{BIO 3339456 <GO>}
Thanks. First, another winner, Mexico. (Foreign Language). That's great.
Congratulations. Elon, the question on applying ﬁrst principles thinking and
innovation to an area that up to now has seemingly been outside of your control,
and that is on mining and extraction of some of the key materials.
I believe a couple of years ago, you had a patent on sodium chloride to extract
lithium from some clays, spodumene clay and things of that nature. Any -- how does
that ﬁt into the plan of maybe bringing real innovation into a mining sector that
could use a little, maybe waking up and getting those costs down, because that
could be a real gating factor it seems.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, we're going to address whatever we think the limiting factor is at any point in
time. So we would like to do the least amount possible. So, we don't want to get into
the mining or reﬁning sector. We will do that if we have to. I do think the focus really
should be on reﬁning capacity. We need to make just a very giant [ph] amount of
anode, cathode, lithium, lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate. It's really the reﬁning
capacity that is the biggest choke point. Yeah. So that's why we're building a lithium
reﬁnery in Corpus Christi.
In terms of the mining companies that are out there, and looking at that part of the
value chain. So we do have large suppliers of lithium right now and we -- they are
aware of how we're approaching the Corpus Reﬁnery and the technologies were
trying there. And the reason we're making them aware of it is, because we think
they're fundamentally more scalable and as we proved them out, we plan to share
that with them. Because as Elon says, it's not really like we want to do these things,
we're doing them because it's not happening fast enough.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerSo if we can prove that it can be done faster, intention is to transfer that knowledge
to our large -- our current suppliers. And the same is actually true. There's actually a
clay process that we were playing with and we continue to work on. The same is true
on that. So we've worked with our suppliers as well on trials and we're sharing
knowledge there and the intention is just to help the whole world do this better. And
ultimately, this year is getting the lithium out or whatever it is out of the ore.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
And we're obviously building a cathode processing facility, just adjacent to this
building. So little further down the road you'll see another large construction that's
for cathode reﬁning. But we'd prefer others did that. We're doing it because we have
to know, because we want to.
Yes. And in that case, there just isn't really any large-scale cathode production in the
United States and it needed to be done. And again, if we're going to do it, we're
going to try to do it from a ﬁrst principles perspective. So we have tried a bunch of
new things there, we're conﬁdent that they will work, and as they prove out again, we
want to bring them back to our suppliers that they can build new facilities more
quickly with less investment.
Right, let's go to Ben.
Hi. Ben Kehler [ph] for Baird. So similar, on the renewable side, is there more that you
can do in Tesla to nudge the rest of the renewable industry to speed up, since it's
such big pillar of the master plan 3?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Well, I don't know what more we can do, but I can say that just like entrepreneurs out
there that want to have like a guaranteed chance of success, it would be reﬁning
lithium or anode and cathode or any materials whatsoever for lithium ion cells as no-
brainer. Yes, we're doing everything we can.
Yeah. On the renewable energy thing, the thing that that we can do at Tesla is the
more we reduce the cost of storage, the more we reduce the cost of stationary
storage, and the more we bring like ﬂexible load to the grid in the form of like cars
charging at the right times, the more valuable renewables are. Because in Texas,
right now, I wasn't joking, like there's a lot of wind.
And at night, wind is -- there's like almost too much wind, because they don't want to
turn the nukes oﬀ or whatever. So, bringing really low cost storage onto the grid,
makes renewables more valuable, which ultimately will accelerate their deployment.
So that's how we focus on it, I guess.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Q - AnalystYeah, Philippe.
Thank you. It's (Inaudible) Jeﬀeries. I've got two questions. The ﬁrst one, when I think
about in this industry, everybody wants to be Tesla. Every car marker is trying to
emulate what you're doing or done. The one thing they don't do is focus on having
as much growth as possible with as few models [ph] as possible. So I'm just trying to
understand as you aim for 20 million units in 2030. How many models do you think
you need to get there? And how does it ﬁt into your drive to hyperscale? How do
you manage this? And also, the fact that probably consumers at some point don't
want to see a Tesla or the same Tesla at every street corner. So I'm just trying to get
your sense of that.
And my other question is on bidirectional. I mean, you talked a lot about making the
world more renewables and better usage of cars. I think bidirectional charging is
one way of better using cars, but you seem to have been reluctant about doing that
in the past. So I'm just wondering what your latest views are on the topic.
Sure. Bidirectional, it wasn't like a conscious decision to not do it. It just wasn't a
priority at the time, I think is maybe the way to think about it. As we looked -- as we
continue to improve the power electronics in our vehicle, we've found ways to bring
bidirectionality while actually reducing cost of power electronics in the vehicle. And
as at all things Tesla, the goal is usually to get more for less, and so we are in the
middle of kind of like a power electronics retool, I would say that will bring that
functionality to all of our vehicles over the next two years, let's say, but it's -- yeah I
guess that's how I'll say there. Yeah.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I don't think many people are going to use bidirectional charging unless you have a
Powerwall, because if you unplug your car your house goes dark, and this is
extremely inconvenient.
Yes. Most of the value, it comes in charging the car at the right time. It's not really
about sending energy the other way.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. If you have a Powerwall that can take the house load, then you can use your car
as a supplementary energy source to the power wall, and then you're not going to
drive everyone crazy by unplugging your car and having the house go oﬀ. So I think,
there's some value there are as a supplemental energy source down the road, where
if you have a Powerwall, you've not diminished the convenience of the people in the
house.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

there -- are they good variants? No, mostly not. They're just variants for the sake of

United States and China impact your long-term ambitions there? Thank you.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Hey, Tom. Don't sweat too hard.
Yeah. Well, we're still growing our market share in China, quite as strongly actually.
Especially earlier this year, we had a price adjustment. After that, we actually
generated a huge demand, more than we can produce really.
And as Elon said, as long as you oﬀer a product with value at aﬀordable price, you
don't have to worry about demand. That's basically the philosophy that we follow.
We try everything to cut cost from supply chain, from improve the eﬃciency in the
factory and the pass down to add value to our customers. I think, you guys as long as
we continue to do that, I'm not too concerned about the market share in China.
And the second part, geopolitical, no one knows. We did our best. We actually
create a lot of jobs to the local community, and we generated also with -- at our
suppliers' factories, we'll create a lot of jobs as well, and we contributed a lot of to
the local economy. I think, as long as we're needed in this country, I don't see much
of the risk of that.

Colin Rush from Oppenheimer. One of the things I was struck by in the presentation
was the operational eﬃciency metrics that you guys were talking about. Could you
talk a little bit about the velocity of learning cycles and how you guys track that and
think about that as an organization, as you work into a variety of other areas from an
innovation perspective?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Anyone want to try that?
I'll say one very high level thing, which is you can't improve something you don't
measure and we're like ruthless measurers at Tesla. And once you start measuring
things that contribute to operational eﬃciency, you actually have a path to doing
something about it. So, I guess the key is a good measuring stick.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay. It's something I should say with respect to demand, which I've said it a few
times over the years, but it sometimes needs to be said again, which is the --
overwhelmingly the desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting
factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla, not do they want a Tesla. It's easy for people in
this room to lose sight of that. If your income is far in excess of what a car costs, then
you look at value for money, but you do not consider aﬀordability. But for the vast
majority of people, it is aﬀordability driven. This is why we cannot simply double the
price of the car or you could say and think about things in the limit where if you
hadn't inﬁnitely desirable car, but it costs $10 million, it wouldn't matter, because
most people do not have that. So demand is very much a function of aﬀordability,
not desire. Very important.
One of the things we weren't sure about was the price elasticity of demand for Tesla.
So like, as we lower the price, how much does demand increase? And we found that
even small changes in the price have a big eﬀect on demand, very big. So that was a
good thing to learn.
Yeah. And then, as -- this autonomy question is very, very big, because you could
potentially have -- I don't know ﬁve times the utility of the asset that you currently
have. So if a passenger car is 10 or 12 hours a week of usage, plus a lot of parking
expenses, an autonomous car could be 50 to 60 hours a week or something like
that. And you could get rid of a lot of parking expenses. So, if this is true then as
autonomy is eﬀectively turned on for the ﬂeet. It may be -- probably will be the
biggest asset value increase in history overnight.

Thank you so much, Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. So, as you start
launching this next generation vehicle and ramping up volume, what will be your
nearest term priority in terms of segment or vehicles focus? The slide that you
showed with two vehicles on the right seemed based on form factor. One of them
maybe looks like a van and other one looks like maybe like a smaller vehicle, like
potentially a Model 2 I guess. What is the nearest focus for you in terms of ramping
up the next-gen vehicle? And how do you make sure that by lowering the price point
so much, because the cost is going down 50%. You're not cannibalizing demand for
your existing vehicles.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Alright. Demand for our vehicles, in terms of desire to own them, may as well be
inﬁnite. It's indistinguishable from inﬁnite at this point. Aﬀordability is what matters.
So as you make the car more aﬀordable, we will have demand go crazy basically. The
issue is how do we build the cars? The hard part is building the cars. I can't
emphasize that enough. The hard part is building the cars and the entire supply
chain that goes with the cars. This is a logistics challenge of extraordinary diﬃculty.
All the things that have to go into the car have to scale with the car, while everything
is doing an exponential ramp. And if you miss even one of those things, doesn't
matter why, earthquake, ﬂood, ﬁre, revolution. I thought I've heard them all. Any part
of the supply chain gets interrupted, and you have a seizure. The hard part is
building the cars by far and the supply chain that goes with it. And do you guys want
to talk about supply chains though?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, we might.
In the presentation, I had mentioned perfection is a passing grade. We really need
everything to happen perfectly and the strategy for mitigating the diﬀerent risks,
some of which were anticipated and some weren't. It's really bespoke to the
situation, and then really the unique subject matter expertise and a deep knowledge
of the particular supply chain you're managing, to come up with strategies.
So we've seen everything from as Elon mentioned, ﬁrst the tariﬀs that ﬂew back and
forth. Then the ocean logistics issue, chip shortage, COVID, ﬂoods. There was a ﬁre in
a fab in Japan that knocked down. There was a massive COVID spike in Malaysia,
where a lot of the chips at the backend -- of a lot of chips was down there and more.
This was one that Elon was involved with as well. And yeah, that's, -- it's nerve-
wrecking. But somehow it works.
Yeah. And all those diﬃcult, I think we have been laying the foundation to be as
intimate to our -- all the tiers of the supply chain, building that control and directingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 68 of 74A - Elon R. Muskthe diﬀerent tiers of supply chain. That's the way we are trying to mitigate the risks
that come with it. Again, dual sourcing, triple sourcing, having redundancy is the way
we've been trying to mitigate for it.
Yes. And that's ﬁne. When we think about vehicles, when you think about three wires
and architecture, SX as an architecture, our next generation platform is more than
one segment. And really, we're thinking about all the segments that are available
that we haven't captured, and where the market would be, and designing it with our
supply chain partners, so that we can go quickly through those segments for where
we need. But to Elon's point, if you make a car desirable and aﬀordable, oftentimes it
doesn't necessarily matter what segment it's in, because it's one you want.
And we've seen that with Model 3, when a lot of people thought the sedans was not
going to be a great hit, but we sell tons of them. So the next generation platform is
not one vehicle, it is multiple and it's on the segment, that we will really try and focus
on that aﬀordability and desirability point more over than where we started.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes, I mean there's a -- I think, there's an old saying like battles were won with tactics
or is it won with logistics. The logistics challenges here are enormous. And when you
start like being a very signiﬁcant percentage of an industry, you can't overcapacitize,
it's not realistic.
And some of these things, like you said, like dual source or triple source, you can do
that maybe for small things, but you can't do it for big things. Because if you're triple
sourced, and one of -- it's like having a plane with three engines, where if any of the
three engines fails, you crash. You have to either overcapacitize, which drives your
CapEx up and it has idle suppliers somewhere in big warehouses or you design to
some overage that's reasonable, and then you have expedited costs, because
inevitably if there's something goes wrong somewhere, and you got to ﬂy things
around.
So it's really just the rate of progress is the rate at which we are able to scale 10,000
logistics problems. Most signiﬁcant of those is the cell production. And so, we
actually deliberately try to overdo cell production or cell supply to have that exceed
what is needed in vehicles, because if it goes below what's needed in vehicles then
the factories stall.
So, but then what do you do with all these extra cells? It's like, well, okay, so the
much easier thing to scale up and down, is Powerwall and Megapack output
stationary storage. So we can then overcapacitize in cells and packs, and scale
production of stationary storage, which is much easier to scale than vehicle
production. So that's strategically I think a good thing.

hours per year.
Dan. Let's go to Dan.
{BIO 17519730 <GO>}
Thank you, Dan Levy, Barclays. I think we know competitive dynamics diﬀer
signiﬁcantly by region, cost dynamics diﬀer by region. We saw that with your China
Gigafactory, far superior cost to what you had in (Inaudible) in your factory, but
they're clearly diﬀerent dynamics. So to what extent are the cost strategies that
you've laid out today, do they diﬀer by region or is there more of a global one-size-
ﬁts-all approach on reducing cost?
Yeah, I think we're pretty consistent on the strategy here, but we try to have as much
localize it as possible. Like in China, 95% -- over 95% of our supply chain are
localized, all the way from a ﬁrst-tier to second tier and to the third tier. And that
gave us -- generated a tremendous savings on COGS. And we also have a very
localized labor force, and we have access to skilled labor force in the region, in
Yangtze Delta region in Shanghai, I'm particularly referring to.
And among over 30,000 of employees in China, we have probably less than 20
expats. So very deep localization we have done there, to be able to have such cost
structure. And we try to replicate this approach elsewhere, and in diﬀerent Giga
factories. Of course, supplier base that are diﬀerent. The labor markets are diﬀerent,
region by region and country by country, but we try our best to localize.
Yeah, and I think that absolutely give us the advantage to compete with the auto EMs
around the globe. Another thing is we have this direct [ph] selling mode, like Zach
said, it would save tremendous money on OpEx as well. We have full control over all
the expenditures across the company. And we don't spend money on marketing or
advertising. Everything we saved will become -- the value we can oﬀer to the
consumers. So on that part we also follow pretty consistent strategy over the years.
I mean, certainly the manufacturing stuﬀ that Colin, Pete and myself talked about,
whether you make it here or you make it in Europe, or you make it in Asia, it applies
everywhere. We think about that from the ground up, not speciﬁc to any region.
Yes, just one thing I would add to Tom's point about localization and to Lars' [ph]
point here, but I would actually say that we're moving in a direction of more
standardization in terms of our factories, and our processes, and our cost reduction
approaches. So, as we've been thinking about the next generation platform, we've
been thinking about the volume that we aspire to build against that, how many
individual factories do we need to build? And what is the fastest possible way to
expand that footprint around the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

Q - Ashok ElluswamyWhat we've done with Model Y is each factory is an incremental improvement of the
previous factory, which requires engineering hours, engineering spend for each
factory design, and then you end up with factories that are slightly diﬀerent from
each other. And as we move towards the next generation platform, I think the term
you used Lars is copy-paste. So to get it right from the ﬁrst time, certainly there will
be things that we learn and we make adjustments to, but try to have as much
standardization and communalization as possible, which allows us to go as quickly as
possible with expansion.
(Inaudible)
Thanks. Two questions. One for Zach, and one for Ashok. So, for Zach, how do you
think about a long-term growth and operating margins for the business? And when
we look at $150 billion to $175 billion in CapEx, the remaining balance of that is that
essentially the CapEx guidance through 2030. For Ashok, the multi-trip
reconstruction that you highlighted, how is that diﬀerent for what Mobile Light does,
with the REM map that they have? And can you give us any color on the AP for
hardware?
{BIO 20940148 <GO>}
So with respect to operating margins, we intend to continue to improve operating
expenses as a percentage of revenue over time and we're continuing to take cost
out of our products and try to keep gross margins at a place that's healthy as well.
And so from the hardware perspective of the business, you know it's our expectation
that we'll continue to stay in a healthy place over time. And then there's a software
portion that's out and on top of that.
And so Elon has commented on this many times about the impact that full self-
driving software can have on the economics of the business. And in that space,
proﬁtability operating margins would be impacted dramatically. But speciﬁcally to
your point about CapEx guidance, the intent of that slide was not to provide speciﬁc
guidance, but to just be transparent about internally what our rough estimates are
and to provide context that we think getting to 20 million vehicles per year, and one
terawatt hour of energy storage is very feasible, relative to our expected cash
generation for the business.
That's a number that we'll move as we learn. We may choose to vertically integrate
more into things. We may ﬁnd eﬃciencies elsewhere, to the whole conversation
we're having earlier about do we do mining, do we not do mining. But the entire
point is to say that this is something that's entirely possible, based upon our forecast.
{BIO 22648673 <GO>}
Regarding the multi-trip reconstruction, my point I was trying to make was that we
want to auto label most of the data and we can collect data from the ﬂeet, and then
reconstruct local areas that can act as supervision for those trips. Since we want to
build a scalable, self-driving system, we don't want to really rely on HD maps orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

technology, but this is mostly for auto leveling. And this provides like precise 3D
labels for all the video sequences involved in the reconstruction.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
It's something that I don't know if we touched on this so much, but in terms of
training we have one of the biggest neural, net training systems in the world, and
that we expect to increase that to believe an order of magnitude by the end of this
year and probably another order of magnitude by the end of next year with some
combination of Nvidia and Dojo. So, a much of the scale of that is quite (Inaudible)
on people. It's enormous.
Maybe the ﬁnal two questions, one from Alex and one from Chris.
{BIO 16150582 <GO>}
Okay. Alex Potter with Piper. So, I deﬁnitely want to ask Drew or anybody else up
there for an update on dry battery electrode, right? So, if you try to over-capacitize
towards cells, scale, a lot of this, clearly there's a lot of moving pieces, and it's a
complex sort of orchestra with the supply chain, but a lot of it comes down to drive
battery electrode, at least to me.
So, how are you trending, that was the most fascinating part of the factory tour for
me and looking through that window and seeing that this is clearly not a science
project, but anything that you're willing to disclose yields progress where you are
today versus where you thought you were going to be. Yeah, thanks.
{BIO 21161872 <GO>}
Yes. I mean as you saw right, like this is a real factory making a lot of dry electrode in
an automated fashion. We've made a lot of progress. It's a spectrum like, we're
perfectionists and we have clear end goals, and we are -- every week that goes by,
making progress towards those end goals, whether it's speed of the tool, yield of
that process or the downstream process. We have installed out yet on the rate of
progress either ,and that's both on the anode and the cathode side.
And I think the great thing about where we are with the overcapacity that Elon
mentioned is it's giving us the opportunity to experiment as we go, rather than just
being like stock to something that we happen to kick oﬀ a year-and-a-half ago and it
is here, something that Elon has said to the team, many times is it okay to scrap
equipment or money. It's not okay to scrap time.
So, the way we've been approaching it us probabilistically what do we think is the
most likely thing to succeed, and even actually in the factory here you saw more than
one anode line, that they are actually operating two slightly diﬀerent versions of the
ﬁnal process step of the powder entering the tool and it's a competition. Which is
going to be more higher yield, which is going to perform better? And we have theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

technology as quickly as possible.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
The dry electrode problem is really quite a hard problem. We acquired Maxwell
really just for the dry electrode technology, but it just illustrates what a gigantic gap
there is between something working at small scale and at large scale. And we've had
an extremely talented team of engineers working on, to scaling the dry electrode
process and having it be reliable and consistent. And we've been grinding it hard
literally and ﬁguratively on this for quite a while. It seems likely that we will be able to
scale it to volume this year. Yes.
Yes. I mean we're basically increasing the output week over week, like roughly 1,000
week per quarter is our internal target, and we're tracking to that. I think the -- what
you saw is eﬀectively like a ton of material per hour per tool. It's kind of like hard to
like rationalize like what that really means. But it's, it is, it's diﬀerent than like, oh
something works in a lab.
It's like, when it's tons of material per hour, there's just diﬀerent kinds of problems
like -- even if you have like 0.1% escape of like ﬁnds into the enclosure that your
equipment is in, now you have a dust problem and like that could short out some
electronics. It's like -- just things like this, where when you're on a lab scale, you don't
even notice it. But when you're doing thousands of tons over the course of months,
it's like, oh, a new failure mode we found and that's where we're at. But we're
knocking those out though. And the team is grinding through it. But progress every
week.
The last question from Chris.
Thanks for taking the question. I have a few follow-ups on the next-gen vehicle. First,
when do you think we'll get a look at it, maybe a prototype. Second, are there any
details that you think you can share in terms of the size, the content, the
performance. And then third, I think you mentioned that you would produce it in
other plants in addition to Mexico, should we take that to mean that you can launch it
at an existing plant before you're ﬁnished constructing the new plant in Mexico?
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I think we'll actually have to probably decline that answer. We will have a proper sort
of product event, but we would be jumping the gun if we were to answer your
questions. Maybe another question, if there's. Yes. I don't know, anyone.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-02

I have two questions. This has really been a very impressive afternoon. Thank you so
much. Elon, I'm curious as you've doubled and you'll double again, how -- what
you've learned about sort of managing a larger enterprise, and what you might have
to do to manage a bigger enterprise. And then, secondly, I'm curious on your
thoughts on how generative AI and these rapid breakthroughs in AI in the last
months could help you make cars sort of less hard to make? Thank you.
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
I don't see AI helping us to make cars anytime soon. At that point, I mean, -- at no
point any of us working. Big problems, so we'll just chill out. I mean, I'm a little
worried about the AI stuﬀ. I think it's something, I don't know, we should be
concerned about. I don't think. I think we should need some kind of like regulatory
authority or something that's overseeing AI development and just making sure that
it's operating within the public interest. And it's quite a dangerous technology. I fear,
I may have done some things to accelerate it, which is, I don't know.
So, some of the AI stuﬀ I think it's just obviously useful, like what we're doing with
self-driving, which is some people think is an AGI type problem. I don't think it's
quite an AGI problem, but it certainly requires a very sophisticated neural net,
because the road system is designed for eyes and biological neural nets. So
naturally, the analog to that is cameras with digital neural nets. And the other thing
we found is just, if you actually look at our neural net architecture in the carts, kind of
insane frankly - nets upon nets upon nets upon nets.
