Great. Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today. I am Andrew Charles, I'm TD
Cowen's Restaurant Analyst. In today's session, really needs no introduction.
Starbucks is the largest roaster and retailer of specialty coﬀee in the world with more
than 36,000 stores spanning 80-plus countries.
I'm pleased to be joined by CFO, Rachel Ruggeri and we also in the audience, have
VP and Head of Investor Relations, Tiﬀany Willis. And so, Rachel, thank you so much
for joining us today.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Thank you. Thanks for having me.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
I wanted to start the conversation or talking about your new CEO, who has been on
the job now for 70 days following a six-month apprenticeship with Howard. You guys
laid out the Reinvention plan at the September Investor Meeting. And so, really
curious about which parts of the plan is he leading most into whereas his focused
been the most in the last 70 days or so.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Sure. So, as Laxman comes in and he has taken a look at the Reinvention plan, and I
would say he's expanded it. And so, we're focused on ﬁve areas which really focus
on elevating the brand, which means running great stores, which is really the
foundation of the Reinvention plan. In addition to that, it's continuing to drive our
leadership position in digital and continuing to ﬁnd ways to scale by bringing in
more new and relevant experiences for customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Rachel RuggeriIn addition to that, it's becoming more global, both for our brand and our business. I
think there's sometimes a misunderstanding that all about our growth is China and
it's really our International segment. That's a big driver of our long-term growth
algorithm. So even our markets outside of China. And so, it's becoming more global
in terms of our brand and our business, as well as our focus on reducing waste and
improving overall productivity and eﬃciency, not just from a ﬁnancial standpoint, but
also because it creates a better experience for partners and customers.
And then ﬁnally, it's all about reinvigorating the culture. And I think, all of those
together is how we're thinking about moving forward and continuing to evolve the
company while we continue to elevate the brand.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Excellent. So let's start digging your business domestically. So ﬁrst on digital, where
you guys are really amongst the most sophisticated, most advanced in the industry.
You were encouraged by a record number of 31 million active rewards members that
continues to drive record percentage tender. Two years ago, you made reference to
ultimately reaching 50 million Starbucks Rewards members. And so, I'm really
curious about what are the key unlocks to get to this point and do you see potential
upside beyond 50 million members, just given the program's success in recent
years.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Yeah. Well, we're incredibly pleased with our digital program. We consider we're
leading in this space. It's a competitive advantage for us and to give you a
perspective while we're pleased with the 31 -- close to $31 million, 90-day active
members we had in the quarter, today, we have about one in every 10 US adults is
the Starbucks Rewards members. So that's a good statistic, but I see a lot of
opportunity in that.
And so when we think about how do you further that opportunity, believe it or not,
one big opportunity for us is to continue the awareness. There's still a huge
opportunity just in terms of awareness and having always-on marketing. There is an
opportunity to continue to improve the perceived value of the program and while
continuing to make it easier to sign-up.
And so, some of the things we've done more recently with MOP for example is we've
changed some of the practices, so that it makes it easier to order. And we know that
customization and convenience are key attributes to MOP. And our MOP customers
and that increases (inaudible). We've recently launched our rewards together. So our
program with Delta. So it allows Delta Rewards members and Starbucks Rewards
members to continue to earn through the diﬀerent loyalty programs and that creates
a perceived value and actually a real value for our customers.
And then even Odyssey, you hear a lot about Odyssey and we're one of the few
companies that's been able to integrate NFTs with a leading loyalty program andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Andrew Charlesthere's beneﬁts to customers like the journeys and the abilities to buy the paid NFTs,
but really what it does for us is it be able to create a digital community. And so, it
allows us to be able to create that opportunity to connect even outside the four walls
of our stores. So it's a true third place digitally. So those are the ways that we
continue to ﬁnd value and we believe that will help us to capture an even share of
wallet in the future.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Excellent. The long-term reinvention plan that you laid out in September is very
exciting elements around automation via equipment upgrades. And I know this
about 12 pieces of equipment that are coming in, that will ﬁt like a jigsaw puzzle. And
so, not to go through each 12 of them. But when I guess, I'm curious about just at a
high level, if we zoom out, can you remind us of kind of a timeline around when you
anticipate the key amount of legwork will be done with reinvention -- around the
equipment upgrades. And when you anticipate the investments will wane whilst the
beneﬁts presumably drive operating leverage. So I know, we talked before about
15% to 20% operating EPS growth from '23 through '25, is the right way to think
about that you'll see kind of a ramping if you will, kind of as that work unfolds.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
I think the way to think about it is, our Reinvention plan is sort of always ongoing.
When you think about the idea is to elevate the brand by running great stores, we're
always going to be having to work on. How do we run great stores? And currently,
what we're focused on as part of reinvention is the stability of the operating
environment that's through the right staﬃng and the right scheduling and the right
hours for partners and the right training coupled with optimizing our production
environment. And that's where the equipment comes in. And so equipment is critical
to be able to make the production environment less complex and to be able to
unlock capacity, but it has to be supported with the stability of the environment.
And so, what we've been doing is investing. As you know, what we saw more
recently as those investments start to amplify. So we started to hit the beneﬁts and
we start to see the ampliﬁcation. We saw that in the most recent quarter where our
business in North America grew at 17%. We're able to expand margin 200 basis
points, even though we're continuing to invest.
And so, that idea of driving strong performance, it unlocks the capital that we need
to continue to invest in our stores, our partners and our customers and will support
durable growth. So that's the way we think about these investments and these
investment rollouts. And in particular to the equipment, Siren System which is very
complicated. It's the biggest overhaul we've ever had in our production engine, ever
know exactly where to look and looking at Andrew and I look at...
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
You're doing great.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Across. But, it's the ﬁrst time we've overhauled our production environment in over
50 years and it's got a lot of complications, and since that, it's multiple pieces of
equipment, it's multiple small wears and it takes a signiﬁcant amount of training for
our partners, it takes a signiﬁcant amount of focus on repairs and maintenance. But
it's a signiﬁcant unlock. The Siren System both the food side and the beverage side,
it's a signiﬁcant unlock in terms of really optimizing our production environment,
which will support the long-term growth that we've talked about.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Yeah. In Siren System yesterday, I know, US at a group meeting, you talked about
how less than 10% of the system will have Siren System in 2023. Roughly we'll get to
-- roughly 50%. I'm sorry, less than 10% by 2024, mostly through new stores, some
retroﬁts, then obviously the big retroﬁts begin kind of in 2025. We get to roughly
50% by the end of 2025.
So, I think, how do you balance if you will, the speed that this is the right solution, it's
a great unlock for the partner, a great unlock for the guests in terms of -- in terms of
the speed-of-service beneﬁts you're going to get with the fact that being gentle
around operations and this could be disruptive. So wanted to be more deliberate
about that. So, if you could talk about kind of how you marry[ph] the art and science
around that.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Yeah, and I would say ﬁrst and foremost is, we would expect maybe less than 40% by
the year 2025. And the reason for that is, it's largely rolled out through new stores, as
well as renovations. And so, the thought around that is, you are able to leverage the
cost in a new store because the new stores have such strong returns and we're able
to be even more targeted around where is the best place to open new stores. So
you're able to put that investment and still drive the business even though you're
investing signiﬁcantly.
And around renovations, it's the ability to take that renovation which was planned for
a certain amount of downtime. And then you're able to further expand the return on
that renovation by driving this system that's going to signiﬁcantly grow sales, as well
as overall proﬁtability. But it's the pacing and sequencing, that's really important
because it is such a big unlock, but it's also can be quite disruptive because the
amount of change management involved.
And so we're ensuring that we're coupling moves like Siren System with a lot of
other moves around creating a more stable environment, having the very best
operational practices and standards, having the very best partners and stores, and
ensuring they get the hours they need and the schedules they need and the
combination of all of that allows us to continue to invest over the long-term, while we
continue to drive revenue and earnings. I mean, create this more durable growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Rachel Ruggeri{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Very good. One of the keystones of the September Investor Meeting was long-term
guidance for 7% to 9% US same-store sales in excess of the roughly 4% to 5% prior
guidance pre-COVID. So can you talk about kind of your conﬁdence now in
achieving that over the long-term versus the guidance that was issued nine months
ago?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Yeah. Well, certainly you become more conﬁdent every month that goes by and
every quarter that goes by. But when I think about that 7% to 9% in the US for this
ﬁscal year, big driver of that is the pricing moves that we took last year, which are
annualizing. So that gives us more conﬁdence that that's an annualization of tickets.
But in addition to that, we're continuing to see growth in customization, we're seeing
-- continuing to see to growth in mix, some more cold beverages and that helps
drive the comp. In addition to that, we have the growth in the digital program. And
our increased number of Rewards members when members joined the program,
their frequency increases and so, too does the ticket. And when they actually joined
MOP, frequency increases even further. So all of that helps us drive more tickets and
transactions, the combination of all of that which gives us the conﬁdence in the
comp range.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Got you. Two more questions in the US. It's important to separate Starbucks' check
growth. In recent years, that's largely a function of mix growth from all the stuﬀ -- all
the work you've done really help premiumized the brand, ice beverages, digital and
food attachment rather than price which you guys have been very deliberate with
this well.
So, I guess my question is that if we were to see a softening restaurant industry sales
environment, where would you expect to tactically lean in to help preserve traﬃc
without degrading the brand and all the work you've done on premiumizing?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Yeah. The fact that we have a leading digital program is really an advantage for us
and we have the opportunity to continue to evolve that as I shared earlier around
creating new and relevant experiences for customers. And when we think about the
very best marketing vehicle we have today, it's the digital program and it's our
connection with our Rewards members.
So if we were to see the business soften in some way or the pressures that come with
some of the headwinds in the current environment right now, one lever that we can
always pull is continuing to be able to speak directly to those customers. We can
market directly to them, we can create experiences that are more meaningful andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Rachel Ruggerirelevant. And that allows us to continue to keep the brand elevated, while we focus
on particular targeted revenue growth.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Excellent. I want to switch gears to China, which I recognize as one international
market you have, but I would categorize it as your most important one market that
could be bigger than the US one day. And so, in the most recent quarter, the China
business certainly came back faster than expected improving in March to a very
impressive up 30% comps.
And so, while China is in an early stage of recovery and you're about to lap some
various compares, you forecast that the pace of upcoming China improvement is
expected to be more modest and this was obviously before the most recent COVID
way over the last two weeks of the countries suﬀering through right now. Can you
just expand on kind of the thoughts you had around the earnings, the philosophy
around the kind of what you were guiding to with China? You did the comments
reﬂect kind of one month of slowing improvement in April or perhaps I can just take
a more kind of conservative outlook because of China's non-linear performance of
the last three years, amid what was obviously the time unknown but what we're
seeing today to be a COVID wave.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
I'd start by just saying, we're incredibly pleased with the performance we saw in Q2
in China. And that was driven by a sundry of diﬀerent factors, but really it points to
the fact that we have a market-leading portfolio. We have an increasing omnichannel
capability and we have a leadership position as it relates to coﬀee in a very strong
brand. We continue to be the number one choice in terms of away-from-home
coﬀee.
And we have a leadership position in terms of frequency and visitation. All of that
supports strong growth for us, puts us in a position of strength as we think about the
growth that's to come. But I think, as it relates to recovery which we are even though
we're in a great position to recover, we are dependent on consumer behaviors and
behaviors normalizing. We saw that in every single market, US went through a period
of recovery. We're seeing even beneﬁts today in our license business as we continue
to see recovery. And so, China goes through -- is going to go through that as well as
we're seeing.
So when we spoke in the quarter about the moderation, it wasn't relative to comp.
We actually expect our comp will improve in the back half of the year, particularly as
we lap Q3 prior year where we had the mobility restrictions. And so, we expect our
Q3 comp to be higher of course than what we saw even in March. And the back-half
of the year comp will have to be stronger, to be able to hit that low to mid-single-
digit comp that I guided for a full-year basis. The moderation was relative to average
weekly sales.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Andrew Charles
Rachel RuggeriSo we saw our average weekly sales in the market in Q1 to Q2 grow by near 20%. We
expect that they'll continue to grow in Q3 and Q4 as the business recovers. But just
not at 20%. So maybe something less. It could be 10, it could be 13, but it's not going
to be 20 in terms of our expectations, but it's still growing, which I think is the key
message.
The point that I also want to make though, that sometimes gets lost in a lot of this
recovery is that China in terms of a comp weighted on international. It's typically
about 70%. And because of the mobility restrictions last year, our revenue for China
last year was about 46% of International's total company-operated revenue last year,
which is a proxy for what comp leading would be this year. So that means the Q3
comp this year is closer to a weighting of about 46%. We're previously and
historically at 60% to 70%.
So that's something that's unique about the quarter as we think about the lap. That is
in a comment on any subsequent quarters or any quarters in the future that's really
relative to Q3.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Got you. Just arithmetic, I got you. Okay. And then looking ahead, how does the
impact of increased -- China coﬀee competition factor into the slope of the sales to
around as long-term guidance for 4% to 6%. Obviously when you have a business
that is high returns, yes, you have a mode obviously around digital, but obviously,
anyone start a coﬀee shop in China of course, how do -- has that factor into your
long-term guidance.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Well, deﬁnitely the market in China has changed over the past couple of years and
the specialty coﬀee market has grown. And what's good about that is, we're in a
great position because we're in a position of strength. But you see an increasing
consumption around coﬀee, so coﬀee consumption is increasing. And so, that's a
good position for us.
And when we think about what that means for us over the long-term, where we've
continued to focus and where we strengthened as a business, we believe puts us in a
position of strength even with all of the competition. So, we've continued to open
stores all through COVID. And that gives us a market-leading portfolio that allows us
to not only capture new occasions but brings in new customers.
In addition to that, we have this increasing omnichannel capability, which is really
new in the past, I'd say, two to three years. So prior to COVID, our digital was about
15% of our business collectively. We were closer to 47% last quarter. And so that's
growth in delivery, that's growth in MOP, that helps drive a morning occasion and the
new daypart for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Andrew Charles
Rachel RuggeriAnd we also have this ability now from an omnichannel capability to leverage social
media as a way to bring customers into our stores. So that's a signiﬁcant, I'd say new
driver for us and creates new channels of convenience, that will help support growth
in the future and lends well to that 4% to 6% comp we've talked about.
In addition to that, we have a very strong brand as I talked about just a minute ago.
And that's the reason why we see such great loyalty from our customers and that was
evidenced in the fact that even in the last quarter, we saw our 90-day active
members near record high. And they were about 68% of tenders. So we have
strength in that loyalty program that we have, as well as a coﬀee leadership.
And one of the things I'd say about China that's also unique is we have an incredible
partner base. So we have low turnover, we have high engagement and we really
have incredible partners. And when you put the combination of all of that together, it
gives us conﬁdence that we'll be able to recover this business, but more importantly,
it will continue to be a strong driver of our growth in the future.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Super. China of course carries tremendous operating leverage in the model, just
given it's 100% company-operated. You mentioned the business will unlikely get
back through pre-COVID margin levels on a percentage basis, just given the material
level of growth in low-margin delivery. So I guess what I'm curious about the
opportunities to oﬀset that margin drag, just given the company historically didn't
really emphasize China margins if you will. I mean, are you exploring supply chain
enhancements, expanding in lower-tier cities where wages and rents are lower, or
just other opportunities really leading to your scale a bit more?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
I would say, we're always looking at opportunities to further our margin expansion.
But when you think about the market in China when we talk about the fact that, we
don't expect to see our margins return to pre-COVID levels, that's really because of
the mix-shift towards digital. Delivery is still a strong margin business for us, but it
has a lower percentage than an in-store experience.
But what's important about delivery and speciﬁcally, digital, is that allows us to drive
more revenue and subsequently more proﬁt. So even though we will see a lower
margin per set, we'll still see greater revenue and greater proﬁt. And that's what
drives the higher comps that we spoke about just a moment ago.
What I will point to though is our International segment. We expect, we can get back
to pre-COVID levels from a margin percentage in our International segment. And
what's important about that is that realize on the recovery in China, but it also speaks
to the growth that we have in our international markets outside of China.
What we point to is the fact that outside of China, we have incredible revenue
headroom. We have partners that are really willing and able to invest with us. WeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Andrew Charles
Rachel Ruggeri
Andrew Charles
Rachel Ruggerihave strong unit economics and we're increasing our digital capability. And so that
allows our International segment to continue to grow even outside of China. So you
coupled that with the recovery of China and we expect that our margins in this
segment will return to pre-COVID levels, sort of time.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
It's very helpful. Thank you. Just last question for me on China. As you know, can you
talk about what you're observing with the unit economics for the newest class of
China openings? Typically, China sales items open at low volumes and then ramp.
Have there been any aberrations with the newest class of openings, sales volumes
that's slope of sales growth if you will in year-one and year two.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Now we actually have been incredibly impressed with the performance of our new
stores even all the way through COVID, which is why we continue to open. When you
step back, it's really about the unit economics that you can drive. It isn't about store
count. And so the fact that we've been able to see the strong unit economics has
given us the conﬁdence to continue to open stores. And that's why we continue to
open all the way through COVID and even in this last quarter, we doubled openings.
So that we ended the quarter with over 6,200 stores across 244 cities. We see that as
a competitive advantage for us in many of diﬀerent ways. Again, because it brings in
new customers and it creates new occasions.
And so because of that, we still see 2:1 investment. Currently, we also see a strong
payback. And so we'll continue to open stores as long as those unit economics
prevail. And as they do, we'll continue to get to that 9,000 stores that we talked
about by 2025.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Very good. Keeping the development, you highlighted also at 2:1 sales investment
ratio for the US stores, as well as in China translated 50% cash-on-cash returns. And
so, what was kind of interesting is the breadth of the diﬀerent type of openings,
diﬀerent store formats that you have in the US going forward. And so, can you help
us kind of rank the unit economics between your three US store formats of
traditional drive-thru, drive-thru primary call-it kind of the other formats, if you will.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Let's start with, our portfolio today we have over 9,300 stores in US. And I'm focusing
on company operated only, not including license into this. And we have about 70%
of our stores today are drive-thru, about 29% are cafe and then we have about 1%
that are pickup. And of course, the strongest economics are in our drive-thru.
But it's important to be able to have stores that meet customers for diﬀerent
occasions and diﬀerent reasons. And so, pickup is a perfect example of that. ItFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 14Andrew Charles
Rachel Ruggeri
Andrew Charlesdoesn't have the unit economics that are quite that of the drive-thru, but it meets the
customer need and it helps with overall demand. And so, when we think about our
opportunity in the future, it's how do we leverage our portfolio to unlock, keep and
build capacity, but also in a way that best meets the customer needs and demands.
And so that's going to be diﬀerent versions of drive-thru stores, it's going to be
delivery-only stores, as well as diﬀerent versions of pickup stores. So, a lot of
diﬀerent what I'd call store designs and types to be able to meet the increasing
demand that we see.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Yeah. You kind of tackle my next question, I'm kind of curious on more the new-store
format that you're exploring. So, delivery only is interesting, digital only. Doubling
drive-thrus, I think there'll be kind of key opportunity for you. I know sometimes you
see partners with iPads, you're taking orders, but maybe that's an opportunity as well
for you guys. AI voice ordering to drive-thru something the conference we've been
exploring a lot as well. Do either of those sound something like -- something of that
service could pursue?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Yes, we're currently in test. We have as you talked about our purpose-built designs.
And really what that's about is to be able to elevate the experience by creating
stores that not only unlock productivity, but they best meet the type of demand.
So when we talk about a delivery-only store as an example. When you look at a store
today, it has, you can go to a store that has all the channels and has a drive-thru, it
has MOP, it has delivery, it has an in-store experience, that can be complex. And it
sometimes doesn't create the best experience for our customer and it's certainly
challenging for partners.
And so when we talk about a delivery-only store, we see a path towards that and the
future's delivery is becoming a more-and-more meaningful part of our business. And
so, we look at delivery-only as a way to take the complexity out of the existing stores
and it creates a better experience for both the partner and the customer.
Drive-thrus, we look at like a drive-thru only model where you might have a lane that
services drive-thru and a lane that services MOP as an example, that's for a very
highly virtual type of customer. It may not be right for a customer like me who likes
to walk into the store, but it's ways to be able to use the store designed to elevate
the experience for the customer. And also at the same time, taking into account what
it means for the partner.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Very good. Couple of questions I just wanted to ask you. At the Investor Meeting,
you guys issued 2023 through 2025 annual EPS growth of 15% to 20%. (inaudible)
the Investor Meeting was that this is going to ramp in '23 through '25 with 15%FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Rachel Ruggeriindicated for 2023. And so, I guess, China has kind of rebounded back in
September, obviously zero COVID was in-full eﬀect. It is not today. But China has
moved out of COVID with obviously some near-term noise. But just more of an
opportunity with zero COVID going away. We talk about the tremendous momentum
in the US business. Was there anything that would lead this anticipated '23 through
'25 ramp in EPS growth to dematerialize?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
To dematerialize?
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Yeah, dematerialize, not coming to fruition.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Yeah. What would I say is, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in our North
America business. So that was evidenced in the last quarter where we've been on
this journey of investing and part of the reinvention for a little bit now. And this last
quarter was really a good testament to the fact that our strategies are working and
so we have a lot of opportunity ahead. And so, we're encouraged by what we see in
our North American business.
Clearly, China we've talked about the strength of China and the competitive
advantage we have but there is a dependency on recovery. And so, it's hard to know
exactly how the consumer behaviors will normalize. We see a business in
International outside of China today, that is beneﬁting from a diﬀerent customer
behavior than what we saw pre-COVID.
As an example, Japan and UK. We talked about in our last earnings update. Japan
and UK are at double-digit comps for the eight consecutive quarter. That is new
relative to COVID because we've been able to open more drive-thrus. We've been
able to open in more suburban areas. And so, we've seen the customer behavior
shift and we've been able to meet that. So that's created more opportunities and
strengthened our International business outside of China.
So, I think with China, it really depends on where the recovery will come and how
soon that it comes. But I think when I look across all of those areas and opportunities,
and then you look at our channels business, right. And our ability to continue to be
able to amplify the brand and grow through basically, they have seasonal moment
opportunities in grocery stores, we have opportunities with new ﬂavors and
innovation in RTD. I just look at that universe and you always have to be mindful of
the fact that there's going to be headwinds to come, but I feel pretty conﬁdent that
we're on the right path with even those ﬁve strategic areas that I spoke about that
Laxman is helping us focus on, that I think will create that business resiliency, that will
help support the long-term growth over-time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Excellent. Okay. So, good to hear that it's still kind of on pace, obviously keeping an
eye on China. But it sounds like obviously, the slope is still there and still something
that obviously you intend to execute on. So, that's very helpful.
Rachel, we talked a little bit about this, I want to put a ﬁnal point on it. But the 2022
Investor Meeting, probably the biggest diﬀerence from the 2020 meeting is that
Starbucks seems to want to keep the company on markets other than the US and
China. And so, what's driving that decision is naturally, it's easier to streamline your
focus on fewer company-owned markets rather than more. Is it the strength in
international markets that you guys have seen over the last two years or so, that gives
you conﬁdence?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
I think that's exactly it's what I spoke about it. Since COVID, we've seen strength in
some of our markets like Japan and UK and our other international markets outside
of China, that didn't exist in exactly the same way pre-COVID. And so what it's given
us line of sight to is, there's a lot of growth opportunity and growth potential.
But what I'd say is, we just want to have ﬂexibility in terms of how we consider our
ownership decisions and we'll continually always assess that. And we may make
moves overtime that our contract or maybe they do go to licensed, maybe we do but
I think the ﬂexibility of being able to assess our ownership structure is important as
we think about how we grow in the future.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Yeah. And just on that, so totally get Japan obviously is a very big and proﬁtable
market for you guys. But if I think about some of your low to no-growth markets that
you are seeing obviously an improvement in same-store sales, but the runway for
growth perhaps isn't as lucrative as some of the other markets. I'm thinking of the
UK, I'm thinking of Canada, that have historically underperformed. What would you
need to see for those markets to potentially license? I mean, obviously, we're going
to start with having a great partner, but what other factors should we consider for
that?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
It deﬁnitely comes down to, ﬁrst and foremost, you have to have a great partner and
the right partner. And part of being the right partner is that you -- you align with the
values of the company, that you align with the growth objectives that we have. And
so, those are some aspects. We've been very successful in a lot of our markets
internationally. We have very strong partnerships. And those partners have worked
well with Starbucks. They understand our values, they support our values, they run in
a very similar manner in great operators and that's helped our growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-06

Rachel RuggeriAnd so I think it really comes down to that as to be able to ﬁnd, but then you also
have to make sure that the business is strong enough to be able to be attractive as
well. And so, we've seen that growth more recently in some of these markets. But it's
consistency that really drives that over time.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Yeah. My last question in a minute and a half that we have left. US competition, we've
seen, if I go back six, seven years ago was more about the third-wave artisanal craft
coﬀee shops that were coming up. Today in 2023, it's more on the drive-thru based
coﬀee shops, very much focused on specializing in iced beverage. And so, just given
your strategy focused on drive-thru and iced beverages, do you worry about the
more competitive environment going forward?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
I think competition is always important because it keeps you sharp. And so,
competition is, it also shows that there is opportunity. And so we look at that
opportunity and we try to focus on what is our competitive advantage. And for us,
we believe the competitive advantage wholeheartedly is the experiences that we can
create in whichever way a customer comes to us.
So whether it be through the drive-thru, whether it'd be through digital, whether it's
through an import experience delivery, it's creating the very best experience. And
whether it be through products, whether it be through convenience, all of those
diﬀerent opportunities are the way that we set ourselves apart. And we're on a
journey, we've got -- we've gotten right for a very long time, but we have to continue
to evolve. And I think, we've shown that our reinvention plan help support that and
we have a great opportunity in the future. So, I'm actually encouraged. Laxman uses
a phrase that says we have limitless opportunity and I truly believe that even after all
these years.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Super. That's all the time we have. Rachel, Tiﬀany, thank you guys so much.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
