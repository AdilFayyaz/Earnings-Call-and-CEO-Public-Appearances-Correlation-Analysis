Hi, everyone. Thanks for tuning in today. 2020 has been an incredibly challenging
year for so many reasons. And we hope you and your families are doing okay. Given
what's going on today, Google's Northstar of being helpful to people feels more
important than ever. There are a lot of things weighing heavily on people's minds
right now, and not everyone has access to some of the usual outlets that bring us
comfort and relief. Things like connecting with family and friends, traveling, or even
simply going to the movies has been challenging.
So today, we want to bring a few of the things we've been working on across Google
that we hope will bring a little joy, entertainment and connection in the people's
lives. Today, you will hear from our team about how our devices and Services play a
unique role in the delivery of Google's helpfulness. Shalini and Isabelle will tell you
how the new Google TV and Chromecast will change the way people search for and
organize content on their TVs.
Mark, with the help of special guest, Mark Ronson, will explain how we've designed
our new smart speaker to ﬁll your entire home with music on demand from
streaming services like YouTube for a fraction of what the whole home audio systems
would normally cost. And Maya, Shenaz, and Soniya will share how we're putting the
G in 5G on our two new Pixel phones built on Android. They're not just faster, but
more helpful and aﬀordable so that more people can experience this next chapter of
mobile technology.
These latest products and services bring together the best of Google's AI, software,
and hardware to create helpful experiences built around you, your needs, and your
wants. And where all you need to do is say Hey, Google or tap a button to get helpFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-30

For many families, TV is the heart of entertainment in the home. I remember growing
up in India, I always looked forward to Sunday evening when my family would come
together to watch TV. It's usually a Bollywood movie. There was only one channel. It
was called Doordarshan and literally the only thing that was on at that time. Now
there is so much content to choose from whether it's movies, shows, Live TV,
YouTube and it's across hundreds of content providers. It can actually take longer to
choose something to watch than to watch the content itself. Building on everything
we've learned from Android TV, today I am really excited to introduce Google TV.
(Video Presentation)
Google makes it so easy for anyone to enter something they are looking for and ﬁnd
results right away. That's the same experience we want to recreate on Google TV, a
whole new approach, whose aim is to deliver an entertaining and personal
experience with recommendations and a discovery paradigm made just for you. For
example, I'm a huge fan of dramas. I would usually look within all my diﬀerent apps
to ﬁgure out what should I watch.
But with Google TV, I'll see a row of tailored recommendations from across all my
favorite streaming subscriptions, all in one place making it way faster to ﬁnd
something to watch. How many times has it happened to you that someone tells you
about a great movie to watch or a great show to watch and you're on the street and
you want to remember the name, but you've forgotten it by the time you've gotten
home. It happens to me all the time.
Another great feature that we brought to Google TV is a watchlist, which gives you
one easy place to bookmark movies and shows that you want to save for later. You
can even add to your watchlist from your phone or your laptop and it will be waiting
for you on your TV when you get home. With YouTube TV fully integrated, you need
never miss live events. You can record from your phone, as well as get unlimited DVR
functionality.
You can also play music from your favorite services. And in ambient mode, turn your
TV into your large digital photo frame showing all the favorite pictures you've taken.
It even works with your Nest cameras and doorbells. We will be bringing the Google
TV experience to many more streaming devices in the Android TV ecosystem. Today
Google TV is making its debut on the all-new Chromecast.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-30

Mark SpatesTo me the incredible part about Chromecast that we were able to make old TVs new
TVs. So something that was antiquated all of a sudden became smart. Millions of
people around the world use it every day to cast their favorite movies, shows, and
music. The new Chromecast with Google TV builds on everything that people love
about Chromecast and it's the perfect complement to Google TV. And the biggest
news here is the addition of a remote to help you navigate with either your ﬁnger or
your voice.
So my favorite button is the Assistant button and that's why we even made it a fun
pop color. And with the Assistant button, it's so easy, you just press it and you ask it
what you want and it just magically shows up even when you say something like play
The Great British Baking Show on Netﬂix.
Remotes can often feel bulky and boxy with too many buttons. And for me, anything
you bring into your home should feel like it's a part of your life and your personality
even remotes. The new Chromecast remote has a ﬂoating stance that invites you to
pick it up and it comes in three distinct colors that live naturally in their surroundings:
snow, sky and sunrise.
We wanted to make the remote as delightful as a bowl of candy. We also have
dedicated buttons for today's most popular streaming services like Netﬂix and
YouTube to give even quicker access to the content that you love.
There is so much wonderful content out there and we want to help you ﬁnd it easily.
Think of Google TV, as your personal entertainment content curator. And the new
Chromecast with Google TV is available today for just $49.99 in the US and it's
coming to more countries by the end of this year. It's time for you to get cozy on the
couch and let Google help you ﬁnd what you're looking for.

Hello. I'm Mark Spates and I'm the Product Lead for Smart Speakers at Google. The
original Google Home provided users with great sound. And for the ﬁrst time,
handsfree help from the Google Assistant. Well, we learned a lot since that journey.
And one thing that was very clear is that people love music. Today we're introducing
a new product to our family. Meet Nest Audio. Our goal was to create the very best
smart speaker for listening to music for only $99.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-30

Mark RonsonWhat's really great with Nest Audio as well as Nest Mini is that they all work together
seamlessly. One that could easily connect with other Nest speakers and displays and
it could be the center of your whole home audio system. We spoke to sound
engineers, musicians, and audio specialists on our own team. They told us that there
are three key things that you have to get right in an awesome smart speaker: more
bass, more volume, and maintaining that natural clear sound.
Nest Audio delivers 50% more bass, 75% more volume than the original Google
Home. We introduce a 19-millimeter tweeter for consistent high-frequency coverage
in clear vocals and added a 75-millimeter mid-woofer that really brings that bass. As
a result, Nest Audio delivers fuller, clearer, and more natural sound. And this really
starts to take the music listening experience to the next level. So you're probably
wondering how are we going to demonstrate sound quality virtually. We invited our
friend, Mark Ronson, to give us his opinion.
How are you doing?
I would love for you to test out Nest Audio on one of your favorite songs And see if it
really brings it to life.
Well, I wouldn't mind hearing something that I made because I'm familiar With it so
that I can really, like, hear the speaker and enjoy it for what it is. Hey, Google, play
Valerie by Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse.
All right, Valerie feat Amy Winehouse. Version revisited by Mark Ronson. Playing on
YouTube Music.

You can't, like, not smile and listen to that song.
So Mark, what do you think?
When you're listening on a good speaker you can get the sense of the space, you
know the drum is a little bit to the left, the piano in the center and it has like a very
warm sound to it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-30

Mark SpatesWhat's unique about sound is it's personal. It's very subjective the way that I like to
listen to one song and versus the way that you like to hear it.
I love to put my ear up next to the speaker because I've been doing that since I was
three years old. Like this the whole time, like, planting myself down next to the
speakers, kind of, just want to get lost in it. So I want to feel the sound like whether
the speaker is this big, this big, I just want to feel the sound. I came from an era
where you had to have two speakers and a turntable going to listen to music. And if
you wanted to listen to music in the kitchen and you had to turn it up really loud in
the living room and then, that doesn't go down so well with the neighbors.
We end up having a lot more dance parties at home. Either Lil Baby or Bossa nova is
my dish music.
I like that combo that's -- you're a bad boy.
It's the same thing, either you're really chill, right, or you need a little bit of energy. I
love that not only you are an artist and your passion about music, but I think your
creativity goes far beyond that. When you're in your processing, you're creating, how
does the actual artist play into the way that you produce the music for them?
You're just always trying to make everything tailormade perfectly to that artist. So if
you're in the studio, it doesn't matter if it's Amy Winehouse or Ghostface Killah or...
Every time you say Ghostface Killah, it makes me smile because I can just think, like,
so many great songs.
I'm just always looking for that great vocal or that performance that sort of makes
you feel it here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-30

Shenaz ZackWe wanted to make sure that we started to design it so that people really heard what
the artist wanted them to hear. It's important when they come out of the speaker that
they sound the way that I intended them. The other thing that I would love to hear
your thought about is the design.
I am such a sucker for anything covered in fabric like this. It's kind of simple and
classic and elegant.
It's actually recycled material and it uses the same type of sustainable covering that
we use on our other speakers. Well Mark, thanks so much for joining us. We would
love to have you play one more song before you head out.

Last year, we launched the Pixel 3a, an aﬀordable phone with a really awesome
camera. And this year, we launched the Pixel 4a and it's selling even faster than the
3a. And today we're introducing the 5G version, Pixel 4a 5G. With Pixel 4a 5G, you
get the best of 4a as a 5G experience. It has a larger edge-to-edge OLED display
and a more powerful battery. The Pixel a series has always been about making the
best of our technology as aﬀordable as possible. And with 5G gaining momentum,
we wanted to make this new technology available at an aﬀordable price.
The Pixel 4a 5G starts at only $499. We know that some people also want more with
their phone. So we're introducing the new Pixel 5, which brings together the best of
Google's 5G experiences with water resistance, eight gigabytes of RAM and wireless
and reverse wireless charging. So you can use that with your Pixel stand or to charge
your Pixel buds on the go.
In addition to the hardware, what really makes the Pixel phones incredible is the
software. 5G makes many of the great experiences we deliver faster, but peopleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-30

download a movie in just seconds now. And we are also optimizing video streaming
quality in both photos and YouTube for 5G speeds. But then with Wi-Fi features like
smart downloads on 5G, your YouTube Music playlists are proactively downloaded.
So even when you don't have connectivity, your entertainment continues seamlessly.
5G and Google Duo can make connecting with friends and family more engaging
and entertaining, not only can you connect with anyone on any phone, you can now
share your screen and watch videos together, especially now being apart from
friends and family. It's great to be able to share fun moments while on a video call
like men's haircut tutorials hoping this video tutorials can help me cut my husband's
hair better and my son gets the conﬁdence for his mom to let him cut his hair.
Pixel 5G and Stadia combined to create an instantaneous gaming experience.
Today's biggest games ready wherever you are. Play in all your favorite places at
home or on the go. No more waiting for game downloads or updates. Pick up your
Pixel and play instantly.
Some people think that to get all the beneﬁts of 5G at an aﬀordable price, there
needs to be a compromise on some of our core features like camera, but that's not
true. Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G share the same front and rear camera system, and it's
our best one yet.
Starting with the hardware, we've put a new ultra wide lens in the back and each year
plus has received a serious upgrade mixing Google novel techniques with traditional
HDR techniques like exposure bracketing to help you take even clearer, sharper
photos.
The new ultra wide lens on the back let's you capture more of the scene in both your
photos and videos whether you're capturing a breathtaking landscape or a family
get together, the ultra wide lens ensures you get it all. Users love taking photos with
beautiful background blurs, but this is challenging to do in super low light
conditions. So we've added Night Sight to our portrait mode for those evening
strolls or backyard s'mores, this combination allows the subject in the foreground to
stand out even in low light.
The funny thing is backyard s'mores is our use case. So my kids love making s'mores
we have not been able to keep this year. And so we've been doing them in the
backyard camping outside and making s'mores. We have not been able to camp this
year, and so we've been doing them in the backyard camping outside and making
s'mores on our gas ﬁreplace, and we're able to take portrait shots of them with the
background blurred with the ﬁre just adding oranges to that background, and then
popping with their s'more on their stick. It's pretty exciting.
We improved portrait mode with a new feature we call Portrait Light. We know you
can't always get good lighting. That's why with Portrait Light you can illuminate yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-30

Maya Lewisportraits even when your backlit against a beautiful sunset or the harsh shadow on
your face from the bright sun above you. Because we use AI to solve this problem,
you can even apply this lighting eﬀect in the newly redesigned Google Photos Editor
to a portrait you took ﬁve years ago.
One other thing we heard from our users is how much they want to be able to
capture beautiful videos. To that end, we've added three new stabilization modes:
locked, active and cinematic pan. We also noticed that a lot of top YouTube videos
for videography are tutorials on exactly this. So we studied the best tips from
YouTube, as well as from Hollywood directors to create Cinematic Pan.
Cinematic Pan let's you make the everyday look like a moving. It creates sweeping
dramatic Hollywood aﬀects through stabilizing and slowing down the motion by 2X.
And we are also launching Extreme Battery Saver that let's you decide what essential
apps, you want to keep on while everything else gets paused. It helps you increase
your battery life for up to 48 hours when you need it the most. With these phones,
you get three years of Android OS and security updates.
And the Titan M Chip helps to keep your operating system, passwords and
transaction safe. They've been tested against real world threats to keep everything
from your texts, to your pictures secure on your phone. Of all of these features, my
favorite feature is Hold For Me. Honestly, I really don't like listening to elevator music
or being put on hold for an hour. I don't think anybody does. Luckily, our new feature
Hold For Me builds on the smarts of Duplex and Call Screen to help save you time.
Google Assistant will wait on hold for you and alert you when someone comes on
the line and is ready to speak to you.
So we know when people buy phones, they really want their phone to last a long
time. And they want to make sure that their phones stays up-to-date and has the
latest and greatest and newest features. So with Pixel, we have Feature Drops that do
exactly that, and they are always bringing the latest and newest technology back to
your existing Pixel as soon as they're ready. For example, Extreme Battery Saver and
Hold For Me are going to be coming to older generation Pixels very soon.
And we think this is great from both a user, kind of value perspective, as well as from
a sustainability perspective of being able to hold on to and use your phone for
longer. And for those of you, who will be purchasing one of our new 5G phones, you
will be getting even more three months of Stadia Pro, YouTube Premium, a 100
gigabytes of storage with Google One and Play Pass and Play Points all on us. We're
really looking forward to you experiencing these new 5G phones and how helpful
they can be for yourselves. They bring together the best of Google software, new 5G
experiences that go beyond speed, and the latest and computational photographyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-09-30
