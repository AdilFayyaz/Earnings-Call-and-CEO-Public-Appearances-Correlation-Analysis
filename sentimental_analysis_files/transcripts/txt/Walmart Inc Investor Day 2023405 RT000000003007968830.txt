{BIO 17692025 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. I'm Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President of Investor
relations at Walmart. And as many of you know, it's a custom to start meetings at
Walmart with the to Walmart cheer, so thank you for joining in on that this morning.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Good morning. I was wanting to speed those robots up that cheer was a little slow.
Good morning, and thanks for being here again. Thanks for yesterday and last night,
it was fantastic.
As I mentioned yesterday, the three headlines to take away from our meeting today
are ﬁrst growth. We will continue to grow, because we can serve customers and
members, however they want to shop. Omni-channel is the winning approach. We
have a unique position and opportunity given our capabilities and proximity to
customers.
Second margin, we will improve our operating margin through a combination of
productivity improvement and our mix of businesses. And third return, we will
improve our return on investment through that operating margin improvement and
by being disciplined with capital.
I'll use the description of Walmart that I shared last night to talk about all three
points. Let me start with our people. Nothing happens that is an accomplished by
our associates. Today's Walmart is about 2.1 million people. We are united by our
purpose values and culture. We're running stores, clubs, and e-commerce
businesses in 20 countries. We have sourcing associates living in an additional 13
countries, and we're leveraging skill sets and insight from all over the world. We have
a broad and diverse team that brings a variety of expertise.
It starts with our associates at the front lines serving customers and members in our
stores, club, supply chain, and technology areas. As you know, we've made
important investments in their wages, beneﬁts, and incentives as well as their
educational opportunities over the years. Big picture, our reward system is designed
to create a ladder of opportunity. We want to build careers, not just jobs. Retail jobs
have always had higher turnover than in most industries and that's still true. And if
someone wants to join us temporarily as many did during the pandemic, that's okay,
but our goal is to keep and develop people.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 49In the U.S. about 75% of our store club and supply chain management started in their
careers as hourly associates. We invest in more than just wages, healthcare coverage
for U.S. associates starts at $33 per pay period. We provide up to $20,000 in support
for adoption and or service surrogacy, a birth mom received up to 22 weeks of paid
leave. As it relates to education opportunities in addition to our own internal
academies live better you enables our associates to choose from 75 programs and
areas like business management and data analytics from 25 education providers
including Purdue University, Morehouse College, and Oregon State University.
A 105,000 our associates have taken advantage of that since 2018. We pay for 100%
of the tuition, books, fees, and taxes. And associates have saved an estimated $333
million in tuition costs. We believe, our combination of wages and beneﬁts have us
well-positioned to achieve our growth and proﬁtability objectives. We will adjust as
the market changes, but our current position including our investment in education
have us in the right range.
We have all kinds of jobs, we have over 25,000 technology associates. We have a
large number of data scientist, product managers, and designers shaping our
customer member experience. 46% of our global management team and 36% of our
global oﬃcers are women, 29% of our U.S. oﬃcers are people of color, and we're
leveraging talent from all over the world. Our country President in Canada grew up
in Argentina, our leader in Mexico is Brazilian, and you may notice this morning, that
our team brings with them experience from all over the globe. We've got a strong,
deep and diverse leadership team. Being people led is about purpose, values,
culture, opportunity, and belonging. It's our people that make the diﬀerence. Our
culture, our humanity is what diﬀerentiates us.
Since we covered technology last night let's jump to being an omni-channel retailer.
I'm going to spend a bit of time here. The whole statement is about service to our
customers and members. We don't exist, if we don't serve them well. Across our
markets, they can come to a physical store such as a supercenter, a neighborhood
market or a discount, hyper like Bodega Aurrera or Sam's Club. They can take their
phone and shop anywhere, anytime they want, they can pick up an order or they can
have it delivered. And some markets, they can have it delivered all the way into the
refrigerator.
We have now scaled those capabilities and are well-positioned for future growth. As
it relates to our objective of sustained growth of 4% and are retained markets, we've
grown revenue at 6% these past ﬁve years and 8% over the last three years as recent
tailwinds kick that number up. In the three years before the pandemic, we grew
between 3.1% and 3.6%. We know there will be variance from quarter-to-quarter and
year-to-year, but regardless of the headwinds and tailwinds, we believe we are now
positioned as a total company to grow at about 4% over time going forward. That
growth will be enabled by our strength and physical retail and our expanding digital
relationship fueled by pickup and delivery.
We'll build on that digital relationship with our ﬁrst and third party e-commerce
assortment and general merchandise in particular. We're leveraging our advantages,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 49while strengthening our position, where we have room to win market share in areas
like e-commerce, apparel, and hardlines. We'll do that by growing our assortment,
improving our app design, and focusing on customer and member MPS. We're now
in a phase that is less about scaling store pickup and delivery e-commerce
assortment and e-commerce FC square footage, and more about execution and
operating margin improvement.
Sorting out which part of an order comes from a store or club, which part comes
from an FC and how they work together to enable a delightful customer experience
requires a supply chain that is connected from a data and software point of view.
John illustrated this yesterday afternoon and you saw a piece of it in the DC. We're
now able to fulﬁll customer needs with a ﬂexible connected omni-channel network
enabled by data. Membership is the customers' preferred way to pay for delivery
and it creates a lot of opportunity for us, it deepens engagement, helps enable
personalization, and enables us to oﬀer more services to our members. Bringing this
all together to unlock a new phase of growth requires putting the customer member
ﬁrst and then working backwards to optimize the math, the ﬁnancials.
We're doing this today and we see the improvements in eﬃciency and margin. We
see the opportunity to accelerate that progress with investments and supply chain
automation, which includes data software and robotics will improve item location,
item location accuracy in stock levels, unit economic costs, and delivery speed. The
combination of sales growth productivity improvements and business mix changes
will enable us to grow proﬁtability faster than sales. E-commerce starts with an
owned inventory ﬁrst party assortment. Our contribution proﬁt and ﬁrst-party e-
commerce merchandise calculated as gross proﬁt less variable costs has been
improving due to mix with apparel and home being a larger percentage of the total.
The addition of third-party assortment through the marketplace increases selection
for customers and strengthens our business model. The combination of marketplace
fees, advertising income, fulﬁllment services, and data monetization diversiﬁes our
income streams and helps us drive incremental proﬁt growth. Combined our
physical footprint from stores, clubs, and our supply chain with new services and
better technology, and you get the leading omni-channel retailer globally.
More than ever, we're taking advantage of beneﬁts across segments as a total
company in the areas of talent, knowledge transfer, enterprise services like sourcing
and technology including back oﬃce software solutions, this is not just a U.S. brick-
and-mortar business. We've built a set of mutually reinforcing businesses that drive
growth and engagement from customers and members.
Our ﬁve year plan calls for us to grow proﬁtability faster than sales. We know where
our price gaps need to be and we'll manage them as we grow proﬁt faster than sales
through productivity and business mix. There's a release to capital investments, it's
exciting that we have so many places to invest in our business and earn a strong
return. Around the world, we will invest in remodels, and we'll open some new stores
and clubs here in the U.S. as we've continued to do internationally in particularFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 49across Mexico and Central America. We will build out a last mile ﬂeet of vehicles
here in the U.S. and will leverage our spark driver delivery platform.
The bigger and newer news, the supply chain automation investments have
attractive returns individually and in total. Think of these as automated storage and
retrieval systems in four forms. There's one type and partner for our ambient centers
like you saw yesterday. There's one for perishable food, there's one for e-commerce
FCs, and there's one for market fulﬁllment centers or MFCs. Please come and join us
in Bentonville in June for shareholders and we'll show you an MFC and share our
latest thinking on story models.
As a relates to the automated storage and retrieval systems, we've taken enough
time to prove them out, it wasn't easy. Teams of engineers and operators put in years
of work on the software kept continuously improving the hardware and assembled
new and existing data sets to make it all happen. And we're getting faster at
converting. The ﬁrst DC took about 12 months to complete, the most recent one six
months. We'll keep improving in all those ways and we'll keep making those assets
meet or beat our ﬁnancial and operational expectations as we grow. This isn't a leap
of faith, it's a methodical building of our next-generation supply chain.
All of it comes together to help us deliver our purpose, we are dedicated to helping
people save money and live better. Our strategy is simple, it's to bring this purpose
to life for our customers and members. We're convinced that value consistent
everyday low prices, earn trust. Customers don't have to worry that they'll see a
lower price on an item they purchased the next day or the next week, we aren't
playing a game with them. And at the same time by reducing the volatility of high
low sales activity we avoid promotional markdowns and extra labor and other costs
that come along with inventory surges.
We enable our merchants and suppliers to focus their energy on innovation that will
result in better prices and better products for our customers and members. They can
spend time on availability new items, improved packaging, more sustainable
products rather than on advertising markdowns and moving sale inventory around
the store, it's a trust-building everyday low-cost approach. The combination of stores
and clubs with pickup and delivery enables us to save people more time.
The shopping experience, especially as it place to convenience is how we've driven
so much growth in recent years. And as we learn how to pay how to save people
even more time, it'll propel our growth in the future. We're encouraged that our
recent survey results show a strong score on price and an improved score on
convenience that's almost as high as our score for value. When it comes to our
opportunity to serve with healthcare will build on our pharmacy, OTC, optical, and
hearing businesses along with Walmart health centers, where we're learning the
right set of services.
With ﬁnancial services, we've oﬀered products to customers for many years. And
we're excited about the opportunity across markets to digitize those and provide theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Page 6 of 49John David Raineyright suite of services at their ﬁngertips. Our primary focus is and will always be on
retail we're merchants, but we've grown large and successful service businesses over
the years and they're complementary.
In summary, we will grow our top line, improve our margin and improve our return
on investment that's reﬂected in our ﬁve-year plan. We think growing a company of
this size in the 4% range over time and growing proﬁt fashioned and sales is
achievable and that's what we're setting out to do. The strategy we've been working
on for years has put us into a position to see more beneﬁts for shareholders. We're
really excited about it and feel blessed to be part of this company.
Thank you for your time. Please welcome, John David.
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Doug is giving you a sense of our ambition to shape
and lead the future of scaled omni-channel retailing. Now, I'm going to share with
you how that translates into our ﬁnancial objectives and our investment priorities.
We have the building blocks in place to deﬁne the next chapter of retail and expect
to do so, while driving strong growth in shareholder returns. As you experience
yesterday at our DC and you'll experience later today in our stores, we're investing in
ways that strengthen our existing business, our people, and our unparalleled
network of stores, clubs and fulﬁllment centers. But we're also investing in our future
growth, our e-commerce platform, and the high-value initiatives that are made
possible, because of it. Together, these create an unrivalled global, retail ecosystem
that has signiﬁcant competitive advantages, and we believe will drive improved
margins in cash ﬂows.
Let's start by looking back, over the last ﬁve years, the business has delivered 6%
sales growth and 3% operating income growth. And at our last Investor Day in
February of 2021, we outlined a plan to achieve 4% sales growth on average with
greater than 4% operating income growth. Since that time, our compounded annual
growth and sales and operating income has been 8.2% and 4.8% respectively.
Higher inﬂation as Doug noted has been a partial driver of our top line, while at the
same time pressuring the mix of our business putting pressure on the bottom line.
What's not obvious though and this delta between sales and operating income over
the last ﬁve years is the intentional reinvestment in critical areas of our business,
these were investments to strengthen our competitive position. To help quantify this
roughly one-third of this gap can be explained by our investments and e-commerce
and technologies that are now powering growth and our omni-channel ecosystem.
The remaining two-thirds of the delta reﬂects investments in wages to support our
people and prices to solidify our EDLP approach, linking directly to our position of
being people led and our purpose to help customers save money on everyday
essentials.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 49Retail has changed a lot in the last ﬁve to ten years and the change over the next ﬁve
to ten years is likely to be just a signiﬁcant. Customers are demonstrating preference
for multi-channel oﬀerings, convenience, value, and selection. And up to this point
for most, it's proving challenging to provide all of these things at attractive
economics. What's important to understand is this. The investments we've made in
people, price, e-commerce, and the high-value technology capabilities are why we
are at an inﬂection point today. The beneﬁt of any technology platform is being able
to scale it at a lower marginal cost.
The investments in our supply chain coupled with the retail ecosystem are we've
created or what we believe will allow us to realize more attractive returns through
operating and ﬁxed cost leverage. When we reﬂect on where we are today, we
believe that approximately 4% sales growth and growing operating income at a
faster rate are still the appropriate targets for us for the next three to ﬁve years. The
investments, we've made have positioned us well in standard generate steady and
sustained growth at higher margins. In fact, we think the opportunity for operating
income growth over the next three to ﬁve years could be better than what we've
outlined.
Looking ahead, the building blocks of our ﬁnancial model are to drive organic sales
growth through our omni-channel business model, diversify our earning streams
through improved category and business mix, and scale proven high-return
investments that drive operating leverage and improve incremental margins.
Underline our ﬁnancial targets is a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which
includes growing our dividend, opportunistic share repurchases, and investment in
our supply chain and automation providing improved unit economics.
So let's start with sales growth. Our omni-channel model is resonating with
customers seeking out Walmart online and in-stores, curbside, and via delivery and
we're growing mindshare for our convenience, what's nearly matches our mind
share for price and appeals to customers regardless of their income level. Our
primary growth goal in all of our markets is to drive ﬁrst place wallet share across
categories. Our multi-year growth outlook assumes that all three business segments
contribute to enterprise growth. Walmart U.S. is building an ecosystem of value
around its core, which is just getting stronger.
Sam's has great momentum and we expect sustained mid single-digit growth from
new clubs and membership growth. And our international segment is positioned to
grow at an even faster rate with enterprise growing in the enterprise with high single
digit growth compounded growth with all major markets contributing, most notably
Mexico and India.
Next is category mix, we've made signiﬁcant progress in our food and consumables
business, consistently growing our share, and deepening customer trust. We want to
do the same thing with general merchandise by investing in our in-store and online
experience, while inﬂation is still an issue in category mixed pressures are expected
to persist this year, we're focused on improving shop ability curation and clarity
across choice intensive areas, such as apparel and home and more tightlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 49connecting our stores and online experiences. We think that we're set up the win
more share of general merchandise demand this category mixed normalizes.
Our global merchandise strategy reﬂects a combination of ﬁrst party and third party
items and we view marketplace is a key driver across our markets. To grow our
marketplace business, we're focused on high quality items and sellers, monetizing
fulﬁllment services, and activating sellers to use our advertising platform. Our
marketplace experience for both sellers and shoppers is earning us a position of
being more desirable for many more brands, and you'll hear more about that from
John and Judith today.
The next driver of our ﬁnancial objectives is business mix. Many of the eﬀorts to
change our business mix were underway pre-pandemic, but the eﬀects of COVID
cost, and supply chain disruptions and inﬂation this year have clouded the ability to
see our progress. But these underlying drivers of business mix are graduating from
cost to beneﬁt with accelerated payback supporting our view of faster proﬁt growth
going forward. I'll unpack these business mix drivers a bit further, starting with our
store network.
We're investing and our stores in clubs for Walmart U.S. I hope many of you have
had a chance to visit a remodeled Walmart supercenter to see the enhancements,
we made to the shopping experience. Our customers are telling us they want more
value and more inspiration more often across channels. We want to evolve our
position among consumer mindshare from utility, so think price and convenience to
engagement and loyalty. Sam's Club has grown 43% over the last three years, our
clubs have been refreshed and modernized and you'll see this today as you walk
through a nearby club.
Sam's is an item business in our merchants continue to strengthen the oﬀering
across categories. Based on momentum, we're seeing signiﬁcantly stronger club
volumes and rising awareness and preference, especially among Gen Z and
Millennials. This gives us conﬁdence, as we look at opening 30 new clubs in the
years ahead. And our investments, in our International portfolio, will continue to be
concentrated in areas of outsized growth, Walmex continues to continues to deliver
steady gains based upon portfolio of distinct formats and expanded services.
India represents a signiﬁcant growth opportunity with strong demographics and we
have a uniquely local approach to each. China is more digital today than any other
market, where we operate and it gives us direct insight into how markets like the U.S.
could look in future years. Each market place a critical role in the reshaped portfolio,
and we're excited by the growth prospects for the international segment. But today
there is a blurring between the physical and the digital worlds, this place to our
advantage.
We fully believe the future of retail is omni and we like our position with more than
10,500 stores and unmatched proximity to customers in our major omni-channel
markets. When we talk about last mile at Walmart U.S. we really mean it. 90% of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 49U.S. population lives within a 10 mile drive of one of our 4,700 stores. Said diﬀerently
delivery drivers need to only drive 10 miles or less to reach 90% of the U.S.
population. Today, in our Walmart store, you'll see how we're activating pickup and
delivery at scale emphasizing customer experience and deepening loyalty.
As evidence of this, our pickup and delivery business has grown at an over 40%
compounded growth rate over the last three years. And last year, we executed more
than 200 million curbside pickups and fulﬁlled more than 600 million online orders.
Across our U.S. network, online pickup and delivery customers shop more frequently
across all channels including in store, and they spend a $1,000 more per year than
with Walmart than a traditional customer. And online pickup and delivery is proving
to be a key source of signups for Walmart plus with nearly 50% of members coming
from this channel.
We pursued an aggressive digital growth strategy over the last ﬁve years. E-comm
now accounts for $82 billion or 14% of our net sales and this compares to $25 billion
or 5% just ﬁve years ago. In the run rate and monthly volume -- recent monthly
volume is even higher growing year-over-year in the high teens, putting this on a
path to reach a $100 billion in the very near-term. Importantly, we are already seen a
directional change in our digital margins as we leverage our stores to fulﬁll, activate
the local delivery networks, and scale-up high-margin value streams such as
advertising data, memberships, and marketplace.
What's important to understand about this business is that we don't have to squint
our eyes or cross our ﬁngers to imagine proﬁtability in this channel. And Walmart.
U.S. today we have a positive contribution proﬁt in our e-comm business, and we
expect nearly 200 basis points of additional improvement in the coming year as a
result of the investments that we've made. Sam's has a proﬁtable e-comm business
today, and Flipkart has a positive contribution margin which continues to expand
supported by a healthy category mix and they're fast-growing ads business.
And in China, where we have a roughly 50% e-comm penetration predominantly
fulﬁlled from stores and clubs, we already have a proﬁtable e-comm business. By
incorporating omni strategies and our connected ecosystem of value drivers, we see
the potential to have enterprise-level e-commerce proﬁtability in the next few years.
I talked earlier about the investments, we've made that have helped us with proﬁts.
These investments have funded and are now scaling a portfolio of highly attractive
growth initiatives that reinforce our core retail model and will directly reshape e-
commerce and enterprise proﬁt trajectory. This set of initiatives drives stronger
returns, and includes sophisticated advertising gateways, insight which data portals
for both suppliers and sellers and next-gen loyalty and membership pillars for
customers in many markets.
We've made choices to orient our focus towards growth initiatives with higher
structural margins and higher sustained returns that also fortify our core. This group
of high-value initiatives, high-margin initiatives is advancing from startup to scale andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 49seeing meaningful increases in contribution margins. Collectively, these initiatives
generate margins, that are appreciably higher than our existing business. And we
expect to begin will positively inﬂuence operating proﬁt growth relative to sales this
year and accelerate in future years.
To this point, we've talked about how our investments are reshaping our proﬁt
outlook, you might be asking what about reinvestment and people and price. We are
a people led business and we fully believe in a future, where people are at the
center of how we diﬀerentiate our value proposition. We're winning customer
mindshare for price and convenience and we aspire to win for service and
experience as well.
Retaining talent and establishing career opportunities for our associates remains a
central objective for our growth ambitions. We believe over time, the number of
associates will grow, but at a slower pace than in the past as we compliment people
growth with technology and automation. We're conﬁdent we can make the
investments needed to remain competitive in the tight labor market while also
growing our proﬁtability. As people are paired with technologies that improve their
eﬃciency and productivity, we realized improved unit economics and more satisﬁed
associates.
On price, we've invested in our price to reinforce our EDLP position. We will
continue to advocate for customers and reduce prices, when possible. We're
comfortable with our current price gaps to the market is something we monitor very
closely, and we're conﬁdent in our ability to win share by maintaining the price gaps,
we've established. Customers across income cohorts, and especially Jim met, Gen Z,
and Millennials are increasingly choosing to purchase quality aﬀordable brands that
we own including members market, Sam's, and great value at Walmart.
Private brands, private brands now account for more than 20% of our sales at
Walmart and over 30% is Sam's Club. And at Walmex private brand penetration
reached 15% last year, wherein departments such as home private brands are
growing four and a half times faster than branded products.
Now let's change our focus for a second let's talk about capital. We previously stated
that we expect our CapEx to be at 2.5% to 3% of sales and this year's CapEx to be
ﬂat to slightly up from last year, which would be at the upper end of that range. That
is still the right way to think about our business over the next few years. This is what I
want you to understand.
We view capital allocation is every dollar having to compete for the best return. And
we view our capital expenditures through the lens of return on investment. The
investments, we've made over the last few years and things like store level
technologies and supply chain automation are yielding returns in excess of what we
originally contemplated. Further scaling precisely these types of investments is what
will allow us to realize a proﬁt inﬂection. In the next ﬁve years nearly 90% of ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 49CapEx will be in these high return areas, like e-comm, supply chain, and store
investments.
Our capital structure and our cash ﬂow generation are a competitive advantage and
we're allocating capital responsibly with a bias towards organic growth and
improving margins. We're going to be very return focused, we want our return on
investment to go up every year, and we believe in our planning horizon, that can
meaningfully improve.
Underpinning these growth drivers is a focus on improving unit economics. As you
observed yesterday, we're building a scaled system of supply chain capabilities, that
requires a combination of data, software, and robotics. The investments in
automation are already far exceeding our productivity targets in some cases 30%
better, as we're able to better ﬂow inventory at lower cost with less manual labor. By
the end of ﬁscal year '26, so in three years, we expect that approximately 65% of our
stores will be serviced by automation. And we estimate approximately 55% of our
fulﬁllment center volume will move through automated facilities and unit cost
averages could improve by approximately 20%.
Importantly, as you'll see during a store visit today, this automation has been
designed with a human centered view improving how merchandise arrives at stores.
Our targeted 4% compounded growth implies that over the next ﬁve years, we will
add more than $130 billion of sales on top of our $600 billion base today.
Automation enables us to improve our throughput at lower cost and to change our
associates work in new and better ways. Most notably, it allows us to reallocate labor
hours, closer to the customer to improve both the customer and associate
experience.
Let me take a moment to translate these objectives and a simple ﬁnancial outcomes,
core sales growth, measurable business mix shift, and a lower SG&A ratio will be the
key sources of proﬁt advancement over the next several years. We expect to achieve
sales growth in the midterm in the 4% range in some years, it may be more in others
it may be less, but on average we expect it to be around 4%.
We're improving our category mix and expect gross margins to meet or exceed prior
peak as economic recovery in future years supports a more normalized category mix
and automation drives eﬃciencies and improving unit economics. We expect the
beneﬁts to business mix to be most notable in the pace of gross proﬁt improvement
in a level of operating leverage. Many of the ﬁxed costs needed to execute our
higher margin streams are in place and our marginal cost to grow is lower.
I've given you a lot to think about today. To summarize, we like our position. We like
our position, because we see revenue growth across a diversiﬁed set of drivers,
improved category mix, and increasingly accretive business mix coupled with
improved unit economics. This is all fueled by supply chain investments with
attractive payback cycles.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 12 of 49Kathryn McLayWe expect operating income to grow faster than selves, but as you've heard we have
drivers that could push that growth to levels twice that. Our management team is
motivated and incentivized to execute and we're focusing on fewer more
concentrated initiatives that reinforce our competitive advantages and can change
the proﬁt trajectory of our company.
Now, we'll bring up our segment leaders to connect our vision and ﬁnancial
objectives to their strategies and priorities Kath McLay, CEO of Sam's Club will start
followed by Judith McKenna, CEO of Walmart International; and John Furner, CEO
of Walmart U.S. will close the session, then we'll all be back up to take your

Thank you. Kath?
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Well, good morning. I'm excited to share with you today a little bit about Sam's. I
don't know that in my entire career, I've ever had such a compelling story to share.
So, it's a great opportunity to kind of unpack what's been happening at Sam's, it's
been driving this growth. This Friday, it's our 40th birthday and this last chapter has
been a real chapter on growth and April 7th 1983, Sam Walton opened our ﬁrst club
in Midwest City, Oklahoma and we have come such a long way since then.
In FY '23, Sam's Club U.S. had a record sales of $84 billion across 600 clubs in the
U.S. and Puerto Rico and online. As John David said over the just past three years,
our net sales have increased 43% and we've been on this streak of 12 consecutive
quarters of double-digit comp growth. We continue to set record highs for
membership with strong renewals including our tenured renewal rate, which is in the
low-90s, which is in line with industry standard.
Our membership has grown nearly 30% over the past three years and we're
]attracting an unprecedented number of millennials and GenZs. We've actually
added so many members, it's like we've added clubs without actually having to build
the physical clubs and we've grown channel share without expanding our physical
footprint.
So as we turn 40, Sam's Club is growing and we're doing it with the attention to
detail of an experienced retailer. We are clear on our value proposition and we're
disciplined in the way that we execute it. Over the last few years, we've invested in
wages, prices and our ﬂeet standards. Every week key leaders meet together in our
trade meeting and analyze the important basics of our business like club standards,
right down to the gloss on the ﬂoor of each club.
Price leadership, including a daily basket of 150 items directly comparable to our
competition. Membership feedback on products that they love as well as ones that
they don't. And convenience on indicators such as NPS and metric performance on
delivery speed and completeness of orders. You see, when you get the details right,
the growth follows.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 13 of 49So looking back at FY '23, we entered the year with momentum and we didn't slow
down. Sam's Club delivered strong results with comp sales up nearly 11%, we saw
strength in both transaction and ticket, and e-commerce performed well up 22%,
and it's growing in a way that's proﬁt positive. As members continue to take
advantage of our convenience has like curbside, ship to home, Scan & Go, and now,
Scan & Go Cafe.
Our membership income rose by 8.6% and we like the strength of our higher-tier
plus membership. Despite reporting a modest year-over-year decline in operating
margins due to markdown supply chain and LIFO, we rebalance our inventory to
enter this current ﬁscal year in a strong and healthy position. So as I noted earlier,
Sam's Clubs been on a roll. Our three-year compound annual growth rate is 12.8%,
and again, that's without building clubs until now.
Because of that strong top line and the membership roll results over the last couple
of years, we want to oﬀer that Sam's Club experience to more people in new
markets, so we're expanding our physical footprint. In January this year, we
announced plans to open at least 30 new clubs with the ﬁrst open next year right
here in Florida. We also plan to invest in and modernize our supply chain will add
new distribution and fulﬁllment centers across the country, including ﬁve this year,
one of our ﬁrst locations will be in Atlanta.
I'm excited about the strategic growth investments and have conﬁdence in the
returns will see from our investments in clubs, DCs and FCs. So it's worth asking how
do we get here? Well, let me walk you through our strategy. Sam's Club is an item
driven business, we oﬀered a limited number of great items at disruptive prices. It is
a really simple and eﬀective formula, and it powers our growth. We want to beat the
competition on quality, we want to meet them on assortment, we want to lead on
price and we want to diﬀerentiate on convenience.
So last year to better explain our strategy and how it all comes together, we
introduced our Sam's Club ﬂywheel. So, if you see that slice the top, that's build a
member obsessed culture, and that I would say is the key to our future growth. Our
ﬂywheel starts with the member and it ﬂows from there. If we build a member
obsessed culture, we can't help but design and curate items and services that our
members love. And if they love our items we can't help but buy deep and provide
low prices.
And if we have great items at disruptive prices and we open up multiple channels for
our members to shop then we can't help but drive our membership and revenue. So
then, we can invest more into our associates, who then in turn take better care of our
members reinforcing that member obsessed culture. Our ﬂywheel is a reﬂection of
our priorities as a business and the evolution of our strategy as we compete and
grow.
I'm especially proud of the way that we've lifted the bar on quality. Our merchants
have done a great job, and we believe, it's our time to actually lead. We're seeingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 14 of 49great progress on quality, when it comes to our private brand Member's Mark. It's
now a multi-billion dollar business representing more than 30% of our sales
excluding fuel. And if we were a standalone company, it would rank in the top half of
the Fortune 500 list, just Member's Mark brand alone.
Last year, we relaunch Member's Mark as a more sustainable purpose-driven brand.
We say that it's made with the member and the planet in mind. In other words, we
want to sell the highest quality items that are also sustainably made. It's part of our
overall eﬀort to be a regenerative they are regenerative company. So let's take a
look.
(Audio-Video-Presentation)
I think, Member's Mark may be unique among private brands and that is actually
made with our members as well as for them. So, we have this group about 40,000
members, we call it my members, my community. And they actually inﬂuence the
design and ﬂavors of the items that make their ways to the club. So, I'll give you an
example. Our private brand chocolate covered almonds originally rated below four
stars with members and that for us is not good enough.
So, product developers took a member's feedback and we started over from scratch.
They developed a new formula and they shipped it and international brand to the
almond lovers in our Member's Mark community, and they tried both and the new
formula now outperforms a national brand. The star rating for this item is now 4.7 out
of 5 and sales are reﬂecting that change. I think, you have some of those almonds on
the table in front of you. I hope you enjoy them.
Another Member's Mark category, where we've made great progress as well as
apparel. Apparel sales of our private brand have increased more than 30% year-
over-year, and we've seen substantial growth in that promoter scores for overall
apparel sales from our members. So, they're telling us that they like what we're
oﬀering and what they're buying. Member's Mark is our number one seller in
apparel as members are responding to this improve quality as well as trend
relevance. We will also continue to continuing to invest in brand partners that are
members loved.
In the past year, we've had a national brand, like Lands' End, Christian Siriano and
Vince Camuto and members are responding. Total apparel sales have increased by
nearly 12% year-over-year even as we've reduced SKUs to make it easier to shop as
well as to stock. We've had more apparel sales than ever with few brands because
we had the right brands. So, I don't think it's a coincidence that as we've added new
brands to apparel relaunched and improved the overall quality of our private brand
and focused on conveniences, like Scan & Go, curbside and delivery they were
actually attracting a much younger demographic.
I mentioned those digitally savvy, Gen Z and millennials earlier. Well, over the past
two years, Millennials and Gen Z have grown the fastest with our member baseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 15 of 49increasing at some 65% and 120% respectively. And not only are those cohorts
growing, but combined they have the highest growth rate and sales. They are more
likely to have joined us organically, and they have the highest digital engagement
with us, including the use of Scan & Go technology.
So just to dive in on Scan & Go a little, overall more than one in four of our members
now shop in the club with our digital apps Scan & Go. The NPS on Scan & Go is 90,
which is phenomenally high. Members, who use it are more likely to renew because
it just delights them.
Let me show you how all of this ﬁts back into our ﬂywheel and feeds our momentum
for more gross. So by designing and curating items members love in this case
apparel and providing easy access digital conveniences like Scan & Go, we attract
members like our Gen Z and Millennial cohort. These cohorts provide good
examples of the digital relationships we developing with our members. These
relationships generate data, data that Sam's Club uses to enhance the value of our
membership. Because of data, we know our members better than ever that allows us
to lean into personalization and rich performance tracking, and this leads to lucrative
relationships with our third parties.
An example of this is our recently launched digital advertising platform, which we
call MAP, which stands for member access platform. It's growing fast and has a high
operating margin, and we're excited about MAP's ability to enhance our members
experience while also contributing to proﬁtability. Because of our rich ﬁrst-party
data, we can track the return on digital ads via member shopping behavior for both
online as well as in club, and I think that's a ﬁrst for the industry.
So it's our ﬂywheel has spun faster, we've invested back into the business to fuel
further growth. We've enhanced the look and feel of the entire ﬂeet of clubs making
them brighter, easier for members to navigate, and more colorful both our members
and our associates love it. We've invested in technology to help us better serve our
members and enable our associates.
Our inventory scrubber, which you can see on the screen takes 22 million pictures a
day automating some 35% of inventory management tasks. As we've rolled out new
technology, we've made jobs more eﬃcient that's enabled us to create new jobs,
while keeping our head count nearly ﬂat, as a result, we've been able to invest in
wages. Our average wage rate, including incentives is $19 an hour. To underscore
that over the past three years, we've increased our top-line by 43% we've kept our
headcount nearly ﬂat, and that's allowed us to invest back into our associates.
And I'm really proud of the way that we've invested in them. We've developed work
schedules that ﬁt their lives. We've created career ladders that open doors for them,
and we're fostering a safe and welcoming work environment. Like the rest of
Walmart, we are people led tech power business that saves people, time and money.
But I also think Sam's Club is diﬀerent in important ways, especially when it comes to
the warehouse membership business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 16 of 49Judith McKennaWe've developed unique relationships with our members and suppliers that should
result in continued growth and market share. So, I want to close with ﬁve ways that I
think Sam's Club stands out to generate growth, operating margin, and returns. One,
members love our value proposition of quality items, disruptive prices, and
convenience. We want to make that value proposition available to even more
members, so we're growing our physical footprint as we continue to grow e-
commerce.
Two, we work with and for members to design the quality items they want by
soliciting their feedback during product development and design. We're highly
conﬁdent of success, when we go to market. Three, we're attracting younger
members, who have a more digital relationship with us across all channels. Fourth,
our e-commerce business is growing in a way that is proﬁt positive, we're using our
physical footprint to optimize our digital approach.
And lastly, we're using our data to work diﬀerently with our suppliers and see
opportunity for growth with our member access platform. And we have insights on
how our members shop and our supplies love it. Our conﬁdence about the future at
Sam's Club is greater than ever as we continue to attract the next generation of
digitally savvy members, who trust us to be a partner in their lives. We're building a
strong relationship with our members that they can't ﬁnd anywhere else and seeing
a path to being number one in the growing club channel.
Thank you for your time and interest in Sam's Club, I'd now like to invite Judith
McKenna to the stage.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Thank you, Kath, and happy birthday to Sam's Club, the cake last night was fantastic
for anybody that got to a chance to try that. Good morning, everybody. It is a real
pleasure to be here. As you've been hearing our company is well-positioned for
growth, margin improvement, and to strengthen our return on investment. Our
international markets outside of the U.S. will contribute to all of these.
In that context, what I'd like to do is tell you a little bit about the role that Walmart
International plays for the company overall and the opportunities that being a global
business creates. Today, we're already the world's largest international omni-channel
retailer, and we provide a source of long-term and sustainable growth for Walmart.
We have a path to grow to approximately $200 billion in GMV over the next ﬁve
years. And at the same time, we will more than double our proﬁts. We also expect
our digital penetration to more than double during that timeframe.
Now this is the ﬁrst time we've talked about our ambition, but it's really important.
Because without understanding that there is a real temptation to see the complexity
rather than the signiﬁcant opportunity, which Walmart international brings. Over the
last few years, we spent time radically re-architecting the portfolio. We've made
some really bold changes, which give us conﬁdence in our future and the results canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 17 of 49already be seen with our 9% sales growth, and 9% proﬁt growth last year, which
followed strong numbers the year before.
Back in 2018, our sales were $120 billion, which then was about the same as GMV. We
divested of our businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Japan, and our largest business at the
time, which was as during the UK. In round numbers, they accounted for a
production of about $40 billion of sales. But in parallel, we invested into a majority
stake in the Flipkart group in India. Today, we've already made up a signiﬁcant
proportion of those sales.
So, what was the rationale for the moves? And our strategy is really simple, its strong
local businesses powered by Walmart and we use that as our North Star, to assess
where we could operate most eﬀectively. Now it was clear that all of our businesses
would need to become digital and omni-channel, and that required investment. But
we knew that if we made choices, we could make those investments needed in those
businesses that showed the highest growth and return potentials in the long-term.
So, we made a deliberate choice to focus our footprint and to focus our resources
and our talent, where it mattered most.
We now operate seven businesses across 19 countries, Canada, Chile, China,
Walmex, Masssmart, Flipkart, and PhonePe in India. Excluding the U.S., these provide
access to 40% of the world's population as well as more than half of global GDP
growth outside of the U.S. over the next 10 years that means we above meaningful
scale concentrated in the right places. Our 500,000 amazing associates around the
world set $18 million customers each week. We operate 5,200 stores, but 96% of ﬁrm
are in three primary formats Walmarts, Sam's, and Bodega format in Latin America.
And built on that foundation, we have e-commerce platforms in every market.
Today, we already have 21% of sales digitally, and we plan to double that number
over the next ﬁve years, and usually head from John David, I tried to business is
already almost 50-50 today. This omni-channel breadth is unparalleled, because that
gives us access to customers across generations and income levels. We've got really
big ambitions, but as my boss, my old boss Greg Faran used to say, you get one
point for talking about it and nine points for actually doing it. So what are we doing?
We're bringing our purpose of saving people money, so they can live better to life
and we're doing that through that strategy, strong local businesses powered by
Walmart.
But what does that actually mean? Well each of our businesses is relevant to and
tailored for the customers and communities we serve and each is anchored in value,
access, and trust. And that core is ampliﬁed by their ability to leverage the unique
beneﬁts of being part of Walmart. Simply put that means, we're common where we
can be but only diﬀerent where we need to be. And one of the most important ways
we're common and maximize leverage is that we have shared strategic priorities
across international and in fact across Walmart. Being market-leading in omni-
channel, building scaled global marketplaces, and growing complementary and
reinforcing new businesses and income streams, when those three priorities are
combined into an ecosystem, they actually become even more eﬀective.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 18 of 49So let me take a minute and maybe give you an example of these using Mexico and
India to talk about it. A Walmex business is listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange
and operates more than 3,700 stores across Mexico and Central America. By the end
of this year, our sales will have doubled since 2014, and since then that business has
delivered a TSR of a 162%. As of yesterday, it had a market cap of $70 billion. Walmex
is a remarkable business, it's dedicated to ﬁnding solutions for their customers, but
at the same time accelerating growth and returns.
In Mexico, speciﬁcally we're providing access to goods and services for the country's
130 million people half of whom are under 30. And we're building an ecosystem that
connects customers to the beneﬁts of the digital economy across stores and online.
Just as in the U.S. the proximity of our stores to the population is high and today,
we're already the leading omni-channel retailer in the country in fact in the region.
We're building on omni-channel oﬀer from stores with a ﬁrst-party extended
assortment and a growing marketplace seller community including very that might
sound familiar it should.
We're using the same playbook as the U.S. and we're scaling it fast. In addition,
though, we have a digital wallet called Cashi. And we recently received approval to
purchase a small Mexican FinTech company, which will help us on our journey to
become open loop. One of things, I love about Cashi and why it's tailored
speciﬁcally for Mexico is that you can use it even without a bank account.
We also have a mobile and telecoms business called Bite that today has 8 million
total users and oﬀers cheaper mobile data for customers right across Mexico. And
we recently launched a health membership program to provide ﬁrst contact
healthcare for less than $2 a month. And our Walmart connect business there is
growing into being one of the biggest media companies in Mexico. But much of the
work that Mexico is doing is built on a common capabilities technology such as the
Cashi e-commerce platform, Walmart fulﬁllment services, and the marketplace
global seller platform, common processes such as maximizing store pick eﬃciency
are optimizing store layouts.
And of course, product including thank you to Sam's Club, because we have items in
Mexico that come from Sam's Club in the U.S. Guilherme, our CEO in Mexico, who
was previously CEO of our Brazil business, and his team recently hosted an Investor
Day. I think they summed up well Walmex. They said our ecosystem will generate
mutually reinforcing beneﬁts for our customers. We're not just creating new
businesses, we're creating an ecosystem, which is bigger and more valuable than the
sum of the parts, and I ﬁnd that really compelling.
But let me turn now to India. In India, we have digital businesses, but just as in
Mexico, we serve people throughout the country, where and how they want through
the nationwide networks that Flipkart and PhonePe have built. Both platforms are
anchored in scaled world-class technology solutions that are built for India. And
increasingly we're seeing opportunities to leverage that technology, whether it's the
Flipkart, our tech platform in Chile, the PhonePe fraud detection system, which willFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 19 of 49use and adopt for Cashi in Mexico and Flipkart supporting Massmart in Africa to
build its marketplace platform.
The leadership position that each of these businesses has means that we're even
more conﬁdent today than when we very ﬁrst invested into them. The scale of the
addressable market in India is signiﬁcant, 1.4 billion people with a median age of 28,
and it's forecast to be the world's third-largest economy by 2030. It's estimated that
nearly 700 million people there are already online, but only about a third of them
have ever made an e-commerce purchase.
Today, Flipkart is the e-commerce market leader, it is truly customer centric with a
deep engineering capability, and a DNA of solving problems for the Indian
customer. It's a really powerful example of how marketplaces and new businesses
combine to create customers, who can get value, access, and trust. Flipkart's core
commerce platform continues to scale, its winning ﬁrst time e-commerce customers
from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and beyond.
It's app is opened 2.4 billion times each month. And we recently added online
healthcare travel to provide even more access for people in a more trusted
environment. But at the heart of Flipkart is eKart, this was developed to solve the
unique logistical challenges for e-commerce in India. It is a pan-India supply chain
network, which includes 35,000 kirana partners, think of small mom-and-pop shops,
who can help provide last mile delivery capabilities closest to the customer.
It also provides low-cost fulﬁllment services for sellers, and it recently began to use
its network to provide logistics to third parties. It's Flipkart continues to scale, the
business model is strengthened, including its fast tag, fast-growing ad tech business.
The business now has a positive contribution margin that is continuing to expand.
But we're pleased particularly with the progress that they're making to become
operating income positive. PhonePe continues this theme of access, value, and trust.
They are building on their massive core payments platform the rails, which now link
450 million users to 36 million merchants, and generate over 45 million transactions
a day.
In the year, after we invested in TPV, which is total payments value was around $70
billion. This February on an annualized basis, it hit the remarkable number of $1
trillion. Payments are driving revenue growth and we're building on that with an
increasing range and depth of ﬁnancial services for both customers and merchants.
For auto insurance, we're already the second largest digital provider in India, and
we've recently launched a fast-growing gateway for merchants, it's a powerful
business model. And we announced in January, a funding loan for PhonePe with
blue chip investors, which valued that business at $12 billion.
We're conﬁdent in and really proud of both businesses giving their growing ﬁnancial
strength of the fair respective cost, we have clear path to proﬁtability for both and at
the right time to IPOs. But I've only talked about two of our markets, but it is also
important to note that by 2027 a third of our proﬁt will come from outside these two.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 20 of 49John FurnerWe really like the markets that we're in today, and each of our businesses has a
unique and important position in our portfolio.
So ﬁnally that brings me to leverage, this is one of the areas and most frequently
asked about. Our strength in Walmart international is that we're not a one format or
one platform retailer. We deliberately operating local businesses speciﬁcally tailored
for the customer ﬂexible in their approach, which are strengthened by the global
leverage that we've been able to create in recent years.
We think of leverage in four dimensions technology, knowledge transfer, talent, and
services. I've referenced examples of the ﬁrst three as I've talked, but let me brieﬂy
share one more regarding services and that's our global sourcing capabilities. As
John David and Doug shared our company will grow improve operating margins
and improve returns. Not only is Walmart international driving helping drive all of
these, but our sourcing business is a sweet spot that hits all three.
We recently began restructuring the Walmart forcing organization to better serve all
of our customers around the world with Walmart U.S. has its largest customer. But to
give you a sense of the scale of this business, think of the equivalent to a top ﬁve
global CPG company. We're truly leveraging, the volumes and speciﬁcations and
product across a wide range of categories in an eﬃcient and regenerative way. Think
of it like bikes to barbecues to bananas. Today, they collaboratively source for over
300,000 unique items providing value access and trust for customers everywhere,
and at the same time, strengthening communities through sustainable job creation.
So in summary, I'll leave you with a couple of points. The restructured portfolio is
working. We're focused where it matters to drive growth margin and returns. Our
ambition is simple to reach GMV of $200 billion and more than double our proﬁts
over ﬁve years. We've developed a blueprint for how to ﬁx successfully run in
international retailer. Our businesses are relevant to the customers and communities
they serve, but they have common foundations, they have what makes Walmart,
Walmart and they have the huge beneﬁt of global leverage.
So that approach and that our results to-date, give us the conﬁdence that can
achieve the compelling ﬁnancial ambitions that we've set out. But I will say that none
of this would be possible without the brilliant teams around the world, who make all
of this happen. So I'm going to end with a huge thank you to each of them for
making a diﬀerence.
Thank you. John, over to you.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Alright. Thank you, Judith. Great message. Well I'm excited to be back in front of you
again to talk about the U.S. business and a lots happened since we had a meeting
like this, just a few years ago. And I'm going to start right where Judith closed and
talk about how proud I am of the team just about. I guess, two or three weeks ago,
we had around 7,000 our leaders together in Orlando not too far from here and weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 21 of 49put up this number of $79 billion in growth. And it's a pretty special number, because
that's our growth just over the three years.
But because we're in Orlando, we put in perspective, and I just told the team
basically what you just did is you grew an entire Disney over that period, and we did
it with the same kind of stores and they've really one new distribution center. So
really just want to say hats oﬀ the entire team for what they did. And it's been unique
period and we had things like tailwind, we've had inﬂations, but the team really
deserve the credit for what they did. And I was also really, really proud last year of
the reaction the teams had to the inventory challenges.
Now ﬁrst the team identiﬁed what was happening quickly, they stayed positive every
week, we go to stores and they just would have the smile on their face and we're
going to work through it. But the team worked through 100,000-plus containers of
inventory over the ﬁrst half of the year and they got us into a really good place, and
I'm really proud of them for what they did. But it's not all just a coincidence that
these things happened and the growth happened, despite the challenges and
everything happened in three years. We took some major steps to become an omni-
channel organization.
And that began in 2020 really in the middle of the year, we made the decision to
pull our e-commerce team and our store team together and to one team. And since
that time there have been just dozens of changes, like we talked about one app and
moving to the Glass platform, launching Walmart Plus and there's just a whole list of
things that you can see here. But we have one team that is leading everything from
operations to stores to e-commerce all together. And we have one team led by our
Chief Operating Oﬃcer, Chris Nicholas, who is here, who leads what we call the end-
to-end organization.
And that would include everything from production to delivery to the customer
across the chain that includes our supply chain, including our imports, our
distribution centers, our fulﬁllment centers, stores last mile, even into the customers
home with Walmart and home. And we've always said the end of the chair, the
customers number one, customer comes ﬁrst. But I want you to know that we're
really working that way across the organization today.
So I want to talk about our priorities, our priorities for more growth. And the most
fundamental way we do that is we win in retail that's who we are. At our core, we're
merchants. We've been merchants for a long time that hasn't changed for over 60
years. So ultimately like you've heard this morning, we went with merchandise, we
went with value. And will continue to work to build more ﬂexible options for our
customers, even something like Walmart Connect that you've heard about this
morning. The reason we have Walmart Connect is to connect merchants again to
connect our suppliers, our sellers to customers, and we can do that while improving
mix.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 22 of 49And on the fundamentals of merchandising, I'm really, really pleased at the progress
you'll see that in the store this afternoon, but quality is improving that includes the
store, includes online we have strong price gaps that we're proud of. And recently,
I've been much more pleased with the in stock levels that we're seeing all around
the country and that's great to see the recovery from the last couple years. Our store
managers are much better position today to be merchants and merchandiser facility,
they're much better shape on inventory.
And so, about our momentum and food and consumables and we are going to
continue to work to soften the eﬀects of inﬂation for our customers. We'll continue to
lean into everyday low prices will lean into our robot program and we've invested in
customer oﬀers just this last six months or so and Thanksgiving and Christmas to
have those meals at the same price as last year and we're going to do the same
thing for Easter right now.
And we're pleased with our progress, when it comes to self manufacturing and
production, we have plants in both the dairy department and the meat department.
And it's played an important role particularly the last few years and maintaining
supply across the country. At one number, I think is really exciting is we have today
22 owned brands, private brands 22 brands that are over a $1 billion in sales, and just
eight of them alone are in the food and consumable areas. So really big number of
brands they're growing, there's a brand called life in the pet department, which is
accessories and apparel, pet meds, and it just is the latest to hit a $1 billion.
And then in areas like beauty, we have new brands like the hair lab and relab, our
revolution and pet and beauty both are important categories, because their
categories, where customers are looking for more options like pet costumes or other
things that we've seen trend up in the last couple of years, but the teams continue to
make a lot of progress in merchandising.
And then, we've talked about as you know, a large part of our growth recently has
come from high-end customers and those are customers, who have come to us for
food or consumables during the pandemic or during times of inﬂation. And that's
something that's happened previously, when there are other dips in the economy or
changes, people came to us for value. But we haven't always been able to hold on to
those customers. But this time, I'm really conﬁdent, it can be diﬀerent, because we
oﬀer so many more solutions in terms of ﬂexibility, what omni source solutions.
So having these options, the ﬂexible options paired with great product and great
price and great value give us conﬁdence in our ability to retain these customer
groups. So we're also making progress on the omni options. An improvements in the
store with remodels, we've been growing our curbside capacity, our NPS, our wait
times have improved pretty signiﬁcantly and they're also improving for our delivery
business. And that is has led us to success with our most powerful recent tool which
is Walmart plus and we see retention rates improving. We also see higher
engagement from customers and higher frequency from those who join the Walmart
Plus program.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Page 23 of 49Now the average member you heard this earlier spends quite a bit more than a non-
member. So, it's an important part of the puzzle, we're solving going forward for the
long-term. And I've also had that the newer customers, like our existing customers,
they love the focus on regeneration and sustainability. We have a micro cycle built
for better, where you'll see a showcase of products that are ENERGY STAR Certiﬁed,
Rainforest Alliance Certiﬁed, or certiﬁed by the better (inaudible) initiative, and those
are important categories as well.
So John David mentioned, we're really focused on growing our general
merchandise categories and it's important. It's important both for mix, but it's also
important to help us retain those new customers. They come to us for everyday, low
price, and grocery and consumables, but when they see the latest apparel oﬀering in
stores and online or patio furniture or tools there. A lot of great categories there, that
can help them rethink Walmart, and rethink that then this in a way that they'll stay
with us. And we are going to continue to invest in our private brands all across GM
like free assembly and scoop.
And our apparel strategy, it's really about three things. It's about the elevated
brands, it's about national brands, and it's about staying focused on opening price
points. And it's really important that we do that because it helps us reach a wide
variety of customers. And then general merchandise is also placed where we are
ﬁghting inﬂation. Our on TV brand is now priced 29% less than a year ago and it's
now the number two units seller in the United States. And then for Easter, we have
over 100 items that are less than a dollar. So that really helps customers build an
Easter basket at a great price.
So another one, I'm really excited about is our remodel program. And if you've been
in our ﬂagship stores in the New York metro area would have seen some of the
changes and those include the great brand shops that are a front. We have digital
displays, we have mannequins with wider aisles and we have updated ﬁxtures. The
customer feedback has just been fantastic, and we are really encouraged by the
early results we're seeing out of the real model program.
Now in the media last couple days or if you've been online you probably have
gotten a chance to see our new or we launched home page. The page itself looks
great, it brings the best of the entire assortment together, a lot more color, it's
vibrant. And we've always said you should be able to walk into Walmart store until
what season it is. And I think, you'll see that happen exactly the same way, on the
homepage now. So, really love the way this is turning out. And then you heard a bit
this morning about the marketplace. 3P is a really important part of the overall
portfolio. And some of the numbers I think that are interesting is our e-commerce
selection.
We're now over 400 million SKUs online so signiﬁcant growth near ago and 200
million of those are in apparel and over 60 million of those are in home. And then
we've seen our seller account just this year, increase 50% over the year before. And
when it comes to sellers, they're important services that we oﬀer, that help them be
more successful seller at Walmart. Now one is 175% growth in the number of sellers,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 24 of 49who using Walmart fulﬁllment services and over 100% growth and the number of
sellers who are using Walmart Connect. So that's a big win for us, it's a big win for
our customers and it's big win for the seller.
Additionally, we are increasingly becoming a destination for products that are made,
grown or assembled in the United States. And those products represent about two-
thirds of our products spend. And just a couple years ago, two years ago, we
decided to spend an additional $350 billion on product made growners on the U.S.
over 10 years. So we're happy with the goal, but not only do customers care about
this goal, it's good business as the last few years have shown.
And then this item here is our new Ozark Trails bicycle. It's a great item I saw it at our
meeting we had just a couple weeks ago but it's a 39% price gap to the market, and
then you can see that it's assembled here in the United States. So there's just a few
ways that we're going to continue to focus on winning a GM. And when it comes to
inventory, I just want to add a bit more, because it's been a hot topic the last year, so
it is key to winning in retail.
So ﬁrst we feel good about our inventory position in total, you heard that in our latest
quarterly results. Overall I would tell you that the supply chain is clear, the supply
chain is current, and looking at what's left, we still have some pockets of apparel, we
have some clearances stores we're going to work through, but that's all accounted
for in our plan. So we're in much better shape than we were a year ago. And the
impact of that is store managers are now in the position, where they can
merchandise our store, we can lean in the top line that more autonomy and
autonomy with things like store level markdowns and we're becoming more eﬃcient.
So when you talk about people, it's exciting not only to look at the growth, but also
what it means for the individuals on our team and distribution centers, and stores,
and fulﬁllment centers. And when you look across the United States over the last ﬁve
years, we've increased the percentage of our full-time associate base to 68%, and
we've increased the average hourly wage about 30%, so over $17.50 per hour.
We promoted an average of 195,000 associate each of those years, and we've
achieved an enrollment and live better university of 100,000 people, which is really
exciting. And I'm excited about the tools, the digital tools, the way of working. Apps
like me at Walmart and 1 million handheld devices that we've distributed to our
associates has helped them migrate, so much of the work they used to do in the
back room with paper and sitting at terminals out to the sales ﬂoor, where the real
value is at in those are things like setting modulars, working at side counters,
working inventory management, it's all in their hand.
And then later today, when you're in the store, we will show you a program called
this pick that uses computer vision, and augmented reality to help associates map
their inventory, track their inventory, work your inventory exceptions. One of the
tools, we've talked about to you a couple times called out Sam, which allows
searches has to get questions answered on the ﬂoor on a range of topics. We've hadFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 25 of 49over 2.3 billion questions answered by a CM just in the last couple of years. So really
great uptake and over 80% of our team are now clocking in on their handheld
device, when they come to work.
So, the third priority I want to talk about, which we've covered the last day or so is
the next generation supply chain the network. And as we talked about yesterday, we
are now able to fulﬁll customer needs with a ﬂexible omni-channel network that's
connected and enabled by data and automation. It's a huge step change for us, and
I know you've heard the threat of data the last couple days and it's really a big
enabler like.
For years, we've been serving customers with three separate networks. These supply
chains that were great at what they did operating all in parallel. We now have one
network and it's a allowed us to consolidate inventory much earlier in the supply
chain and deconsolidate as late as possible many times that's at the customer's
home.
And a key part of the strategy is automation you saw that yesterday. And if you ask us
why automate the answer is, it helps our customers, it helps our associates and it
helps our business. Automation helps our customers with better accuracy, availability
and speed. Automation helps our associates it results in less manual labor. And over
time we've said, we will believe that we all have the same number of associates
possibly even more, but will have a larger business. And there will be new roles that
are emerge that are more technical better designed to serve customers and they'll
pay more.
And then ﬁnally automation helps our business, it increases productivity and it
reinforces everyday low cost. And the key nodes in this network are the store
network they are the stores and for years, we've said and you heard it again today,
that we have inventory positioned within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. And
that's important, because we know customers want speed, and we also know that
the last mile cost more than the middle mile and the little the middle mile is more
costly than the ﬁrst mile.
So having 4,700 points of distribution shortens the last mile lowers delivery time and
it lowers cost. So we're becoming more competitive on picking and fulﬁlling and
stores, delivery some stores are growing. The FCs are creating more density. We're
delivering more doorsteps garages and as I said many times at or into the customers
home.
So in the future all of that will become more automated driven by data and software.
And one great example, this is the market fulﬁllment center, which is a fulﬁllment
center that's attached to a store location. We have a few of those in place now we
have more on the way. And once we have our software integrated with the solution
repurchase, the hardware solution will put even more on the ground.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Page 26 of 49Mohan Akella
John Furner
Mohan AkellaSo in several stores, we've already created the space for the market fulﬁllment center
either using existing space or adding on to the store. And until we have the
automation in place, we've decided that we'd set up a bridge solution, which we call
a manual FC, MFC. And this is where the associates do all the picking, but it's in a
special place away from the sales for. So we've got one of these in Grapevine, Texas
and I've been there, I think three or four times now, where we've added this, but it's
exciting to see what what's happened there. So take a look at the video and I'll tell
you a bit more about it.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
That's store, I'd be heard of the video. It's fulﬁlling almost three times the online
orders of an average store and a 99% ﬁll rate is outstanding. It's really great to see
the innovation, and you heard also the traﬃc on the weekend. So shifting a lot of the
work from the sales ﬂoor the MFC It just improves accuracy and speed but it gives
more room back to in store shoppers on the weekend. So this will be even better,
when we get the automation in place. And again, if you come to see us in June you'll
see some of that. As a result of this, though, we did create a new lead called the MFC
lead and Lynn, who saw in the video. We got to promote her in front of all of her
peers, all 7,000 of those just a few weeks ago to the ﬁrst-ever MFC lead. So, really
exciting for her, really setting for people.
So I'm going to stop there and I want to bring up the two members of the Indian
team to share a bit more. First Mohan Akella, Mohan leads a team called the
Centroid, which focuses on supply chain strategy, and automation and then Pratibha
come on up -- Pratibha Rajashekhar, she leads our automation team.
Welcome. Thanks for coming.
Thank you.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
So Mohan, maybe start with you. We'll talk about a few things here this morning. But,
we've said throughout the last couple days that data and technology are the things
that tie this work together. And you've been talking about this vision of what you
wanted to do for several years, and now it's all come together, so let's hear about it.
Absolutely. So, we are very excited about leveraging data and technology and
software and how it's accelerating our supply chain both digitally and physically. We
are rethinking our data architecture, we are rewriting the algorithms inside of
planning and execution engines with an omni-channel customer in mind and a
connected and ﬂexible network.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 27 of 49John FurnerNow, that means better product availability and reduce costs for our customers. The
smart engines that we are creating can orchestrate the ﬂow of product from
suppliers, anywhere in the world to the store shelves and to customers homes. The
impact of high productivity availability and reduce costs for our customers is
immense.
The foundational piece of this transformation is our ability to anticipate customer
demand. Our forecasting engines are looking at customer demand at a ﬁner grain
than ever before across all demand types it's grocery, ambient, in-home, go local et
cetera. In the picture here, you will see half-mile hexagons, which we call pixels,
which is the level at which we are predicting customer demand across all channels.
Our forecasting engines will also have the capability to continuously update as they
receive better signals from our stores, from our associates, from our customers as
well.
And then a dynamic inventory, placement and replenishment engines will then use
this is forecast to deploy millions of items in the right quantity at the right location
across our stores, our fulﬁllment centers and our distribution centers, to support this
demand and maximize product availability. John here again in data and technology
play a very critical role in evaluating billions of trade-oﬀs to ensure inventories
optimally placed and ensure that our customers always have access to items at a
great price and convenience. We then leverage our suite of last mile engines to
design customized service areas in towns and cities across the U.S. with the right
fulﬁllment and delivery capabilities to reach more customers, while reducing the cost
per delivery.
The picture here shows three stores in the Dallas market and their service areas, you
will see that they are a combination of pixels. You also see that this service areas
stores are not just uniform circles, but that was our traditional approach. Now, we use
digital simulation tools to assign the right pixel to a store to fully service the
customer demand, while balancing capacity and costs.
Finally, our routing engines are focused on designing smart routes that can combine
multiple order types. Grocery, ambient, in-home, go local, and even e-commerce
packages coming from a fulﬁllment centers in the same trip to build density and
further reduce our cost to serve. John is you can see we are taking a customer
centric approach to designing our supply chain and providing better omni-channel
experience. How we deploy inventory? How we better understand customer
demand? And how we design and deliver through a last mile with the ultimate goal
of helping a customers save money and live better.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
And these optimization models can be used for supply chain, so we talked about
ﬂexible and being dynamic, these models enable that they also work for other
things, like advertising and understand where demand can come from the signal. So
it's really great work, and great to see this come together pretty, but you're relatively
new in this role. But we want the company long time including the relaunch ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Page 28 of 49Prathibha Rajashekharmembers market Sam's which is fantastic. The automation is an enabler of all this
and the way that we are using the understanding demand, optimizing, and then
deciding where to deploy comes to life through automation, so tell us about that.
Yeah. John like you said, I have the responsibility for leading the innovation and
automation team for Walmart U.S. which means my team is responsible for
designing, developing, and deploying automation across our network. But when we
think about automation, we don't use automation for the sake of automating. We are
being very intentional in why, where, and how we deploy automation. Yesterday, you
all saw an example of automation that we are deploying in our ambient distribution
centers. We are a number of you asked me about other types of automation, and I
will show you a few examples today.
So ﬁrst, let's start with an automated fulﬁllment center like this one that just opened
recently in Joliet Illinois. These automated FCs are setting an entirely new precedent
for the speed of fulﬁllment. The massive automated storage and retrieval system that
you see here is designed to hold tens of millions of SKUs, which is double the
storage capacity compared to a traditional FC. What I'm most proud of is when
customers orders are ready to be fulﬁlled, our associates no longer have to work
long distances, instead they stand at an ergonomically designed workstation that is
designed for their comfort and products come to them.
By designing automation with our people in mind, we've surpassed our associate
net promoter score in these facilities. Actually, customers also feel that beneﬁt.
Because these new FCs can double the number of orders, we are able to fulﬁll in a
day, which means package has arrived at customers doorstep faster than ever
before.
Now, let's take another look at the automated perishable distribution center. These
state-of-the-art DCs are just remarkable. Their primary purpose is ﬁrst, to receive
perishable merchandise from our suppliers. Second, store the cases and pallets of
merchandise in an automated storage system that is nearly 80 feet tall. And third,
retrieve them, when a store order is ready to be assembled.
One of my favorite parts of this process is watching, how our algorithms go to work
to assemble cases and create this perfect pallet. The speed and eﬃciency of this
operation results in us being able to fulﬁll more than 2x more product compared to a
traditional perishable distribution center. And our associates love working here,
because we are evolving their most physically demanding jobs in the traditional,
sorry, traditional DCs, which is our case order ﬁllers into tech-powered jobs, like
operators and technicians.
Third, John, as you mentioned, we are also going to add automated market
fulﬁllment centers to stores, which will increase our digital capacity. Automated
MFCs, our fulﬁllment centers that are built in the back room of a store. There are a
few unique things about the way our MFC solution is engineered like the proprietaryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

John Furner
A - Stephanie W issinkdesign of the system. Here the bots are the only moving part of the entire operation,
which makes it a more capitally eﬃcient solution. They navigate a dense storage
system that holds tens of thousands of items in totes and the inventory is separate
from the store inventory.
Why is this important, you may ask, because it reduces substitutions and last-minute
out of stocks for our customers. When customers place their pickup and delivery
orders, the totes are retrieved from the storage system and then brought to an
associate to assemble the digital orders at work stations. Adding both manual and
automated MFCs is only going to get us to expand our digital capacity as we
continue to lean on our stores as forward-deployed fulﬁllment centers. They are
really going to help us deliver the perfect order that delights our customers every
single time.
So as you can see, we are not taking a one-size-ﬁts-all approach, when it comes to
automation. We are looking at our facilities and designing unique solutions that
match the needs of our customers, our associates, and the business. And John, what
I'm really excited about and encouraged by is that we are doing this with the best
engineering and tech talent, who are customizing our hardware and software
combinations, and tailoring the solutions to best meet our omni-channel operations,
and make sure that we are creating a competitive advantage.

It's great. Thanks to both of you for coming up. Thanks a lot.
Thanks for having me.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
So, you can hear and see what we said earlier that we're creating a ﬂexible omni-
channel network that is enabled by data and technology all throughout. So, I'll just
conclude by showing the same -- showing you the same priorities that you saw
yesterday, growth, margin, returns. We're investing in growth and merchandising, e-
commerce, and supply chain. And our mix is changing with retail, John David, and
our newer businesses, we talked about like Walmart Connect and data, and the
investments in supply chain will enable stronger returns.

Let's start with you.
{BIO 1507344 <GO>}
All right. Thanks. Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. I have two questions. First, thanks for
the update on the history but then also going forward the 4%. What inﬂation number
do you assume in the top line and that 4% as you're thinking out for the next few
years? And then my follow-up was on competition.
Could you give us your inﬂation number ﬁrst, Greg, so we know.
{BIO 1507344 <GO>}
It was at 3% this year.
3%.
{BIO 1507344 <GO>}
By the end of the year.
How is that compared to what you're thinking?
Pretty close. We're -- Greg, we're assuming that this year is going to be somewhat
anomalous, still feeling the eﬀects of higher prices last year. But hopefully, as we get
to next year and then certainly beyond that, we get to a more normalized inﬂationary
environment, not just inﬂationary but overall economic growth as well.
One of the reasons why we issued guidance in the way we did is because there's
volatility in that number, of course, by category, by country, by timing. So, the team
went through this year more than we would do in a typical year and looked at by
category, by month, what are we up against? What do we think it's going to look like
this year? We know we'll be wrong, but we think we're directionally in the right
space. And we'll have to tell you after it's over with how it all worked out.

couple 100 million square feet of fulﬁllment center capacity and their margins got
crushed as they went through that. Now that they're focused on getting those
margins back, how do you view Amazon with roughly the same GMV as you now

A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerYes. We learned from Sam Walton to pay attention to what competitors are doing
well. And certainly, Amazon has done a lot of diﬀerent things well as have our other
key competitors, but most of our focus is on what we can control, our customers and
how we get better. So as you could hear yesterday and today, we're working on what
does that customer and member experience look like in store, in club, for pickup, for
delivery? And how do we just keep getting better at what we're doing?
And it's a full-time job ﬁguring out how to put all the pieces that we have together in
a way that delivered that customer member experience and also improve economics
as we go. And it required us to put data together, put software together, work
diﬀerently to maximize that. So that's where our focus is.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Hi. Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs. Thanks for the meeting today. I wanted to ask
about the upside John David that you had mentioned from the operating income
dollar growth. I think you said it could be 2x versus what you outlined today. First of
all, do I have that right? And second, what accelerates reﬂexes to get to that high-
end level?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes. Well, let me start with what we don't control, and that's the economy. Certainly,
we don't envision that the economy that we're in today is going to be something that
persists for the three to ﬁve year planning horizon that we have. So, assuming we get
back to more normalized growth, I think that underpins this forecast, but you
appreciate, with any set of initiatives that a company has, there's a range of
outcomes that can happen that depend upon how customers respond to that, how
well we execute as a team. And so when you look at the various initiatives and
they're all diﬀerent. The upside represents us doing at the higher end of that range
and then the lower end of that is more in line with what we talked about in terms of
the just outgrowing sales at 4%.
It's truly been a unique set of years when you look back to 2020, 2021 with the
pandemic emphasis and then what happened with inﬂation in this year that we just
ﬁnished. And so, when I look at what occurred, the four and greater than four
objective, it still feels like it was a reasonable thing to put in place. It still feels
reasonable today. And I think some of you get really focused on the relationship of
those two numbers.
So, we kind of joked around the six and three number for the last ﬁve years. And
could we -- if we could choose, would we have changed that to ﬁve and 5.5? Or
none of us want to give up on growth. We want growth in units and dollars to be as
much as possible as we serve customers and members better. But we recognize that,
that operating income percentage does need to ﬁnd its way to a higher level. WeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 32 of 49A - Stephanie W issink
Q - Michael Kessler
A - Unidentiﬁed Speakerjust don't want to do that at the sake of raising prices or anything that's detrimental
to the business in the short or long-term.
So I think the key is, how do we put the productivity enhancements in place? And
how do we change the actual business model with these other income streams that
are very complementary to make that a sustainable change. And the pace at which
we do that is the key. And there's a lot to execute.
And we showed you yesterday, this distribution center and we've shared that we've
been working on it for six years. Executing that is not easy. The work on data
software and the physical aspects, not easy. And it's not like we just snap our ﬁngers
and open the second center, the third center, and the fourth center, or it's plug-and-
play. It's work.
So there's an execution aspect of what we've got to get done over the next few years
that will reveal that outcome. We're conﬁdent in our plan and our ability to do it, but
there are a lot of moving parts to actually deliver it. So it's a little hard to call the
timing. I think we'll have to earn it as we go and update you quarter-to-quarter.
{BIO 17692025 <GO>}
We're distributing the questions by section. So let's go to Michael next.
{BIO 20335943 <GO>}
Hey, guys. This is Michael Kessler from Morgan Stanley, asking on behalf of Mike
Dough[ph] and Simeon Gutman. Thank you, guys. So ﬁrst, maybe to follow up on
operating margin expansion, balancing that with growing EBIT dollars. That's a big
debate among many retailers. How do you think about that balance? And the fact
that you expect margin expansion, I guess, does that mean that you don't see as
many opportunities to reinvest to grow the dollars? Or it's about the balancing act
there?
Yes. Well, with the ﬁrst part of your question, we actually look at a suite of metrics,
and that's why we frame this in the way that we did where it's not just growth, it's
expanding margins and higher return on investment. And so, the -- to the extent that
we get stronger sales growth, we're going to see the EBIT dollars follow that margin
expansion as well. So it's kind of how we think about that.
In terms of some of the investments that we made, like, I think, it's important to
understand that a lot of these things are in place today to where we'll be allowed to
actually grow at a much more attractive incremental margin, lower unit cost in terms
of what, IBO retro service and are realizing a lot of the ﬁxed cost leverage that we
have in the business. We'll continue to see that going forward. And as we scale some
of the investments that we've made in supply chain automation and even some of
the technology investments, we'll see that improved more as we go through our
planning horizon. But a lot of that is in place today to help us realize those more
attractive incremental margins.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

the next few years. Can you just contextualize a little bit how much -- how close we
are today to that versus how much progress you've made in the last few years? And
any gating factors as far as why you may not get there as fast as you think?
Sure. Let me take that. First, important to recognize that scale matters in each one of
these operations, whether its e-commerce as a channel to standalone through
fulﬁllment centers or the e-commerce business that moves through stores. And so,
with John David said that's very important is, contributed proﬁt rates are improving
and the mix of business is improving at the same time and we really look at those in
parallel.
So, contributed proﬁt rates, which would be, what you sell a product for, the cost of
it, labor, marketing, other variable costs that are attached to it. As that becomes
positive and grows, then you can see the path to being able to leverage your ﬁxed
cost to point of break-even and proﬁtability. The second piece of it, which is second
for a reason, because these should be additive to customer experiences, are the
businesses that result -- they exists because of the result of the growing e-commerce
business which is the advertising business data and other services that are margin
accretive.
So the two of those put together, both in parallel or improving, and we can see the
path to proﬁtability, but we do those in parallel. So each week has -- at our trade
meeting, I have a trade meeting, and we go through the economics, unit economics
of what customers buy, how we ﬁll it, and the P&L associated with it. And then
separately, ensuring that we have additive customer experiences, we work on these
other businesses that are ready for mix.
{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Thank you. Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. So my ﬁrst question is gross margin
versus SG&A. The old productivity and loop was invested in price, suppress gross
margin, leverage OpEx, ﬂat operating margin. A lot of what you're talking about is
are good factors for the gross margin. So if you're okay with where price comps are
in the market, why couldn't gross margin expand over time?
We actually expect for it to increase. I noted that in my comments, but it's improving
because of the change in the business mix of our company as these areas that John
just referred to, things like fulﬁllment services, marketplace, all these other areas that
are higher margin, advertise as an example. As those contribute more, we'll see
gross margin go up. It's not going to go up, as Doug mentioned, because we're
going to raise prices over time. That's not the method to do that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerAt the same point in time, as I noted in my slides, we see an opportunity for SG&A
leverage as a lot of these ﬁxed investments or these ﬁxed costs are in place that
allow us to grow without continuing to add this overhead or additional expenses
around that, the unit metrics around this are much more attractive than they were a
few years ago.
{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Then as a follow-up, can you talk about what you're seeing from the US consumer
side, there's been some news about the low-end may be seeing some more
pressure, snap headwinds. Obviously, you've seen trade down into the Walmart US
from the income consumer. So, how do you think about the consumer today and
what are you hearing in your surveys? Thank you.
Yes. Similar to what we've talked about the last couple quarters, certainly,
appreciative of the number of customers who have traded into the brand. We
welcome those customers. And a lot of growth is happening with the pickup and
delivery business from stores in addition other channels. So, -- and I'm conﬁdent and
excited about our ability to retain customers that we've been growing because of
the options and ﬂexibility we oﬀer.
Like we've talked about last couple of quarters, there has been some trade between
brand and private brands. There have been trading down, trading over within
protein categories and other things, and mix remains a concern on the business side
for us. It's on the customer side, of course, we're completely focused on customers --
serving customers ﬂexibly any way they want to be served and we would always take
strength over weakness in the economy. But we're positioned well and we have a
food business that's proﬁtable and growing, and we'll manage mix carefully as we
move throughout the year.
{BIO 20842326 <GO>}
Hi. Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank. Just wanted to touch on what you talked
about earlier in terms of the new revenue streams as part of the longer-term
opportunity for Walmart. Can you expand on that a little bit? I think there was a slide
that said $3 billion in contribution, including membership since FY '20. Where can
these realistically grow? And to what degree do they play into the 4% top-line
growth and to improving the longer-term ROIC? Thank you.
You want me to take that? So, yes, you can tell from that slide that, that's obviously a
fast-growing, but a much more signiﬁcant part of our business today. And
fundamentally, that's sort of underlines this thesis around the business mix change.
You've got these smaller parts of our business that are higher margin but growing at
a much faster rate. And so, the simple math is that, that suggests that our margin
should go up.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Page 35 of 49A - Stephanie W issink
Q - Paul Lejuez
A - Unidentiﬁed SpeakerWe think there's signiﬁcant opportunity and a lot of this, but it's sort of two-fold. One
is the apples-to-apples comparison of the transaction where the pure unit economics
are more attractive somewhat because of like what you saw yesterday and the
investment in our supply chain. We're able to do this at more attractive rates.
But at the same point in time, there's a growth opportunity there. And things like
delivering to customers as you have more growth in your network, you're delivering
more packages to a colder stake, you've got density and there are improvements in
the economics around that. We think that the value proposition to customers is very
compelling and we're leaning into the areas following what we hear from customers.
And so we think there's a big opportunity there.
And this, to John's point, sort of it's an ecosystem of value drivers. The more sellers
we have on the marketplace, the more assortment that we have, the more eyeballs
that are coming to our marketplace, more eyeballs coming to our marketplace, more
advertisers want to spend dollars, all of this works together. And we think that we've
got a strong foundation to help grow this.

Let's go to Paul right next to you, Kri.
{BIO 6299659 <GO>}
Thanks. Paul Lejuez with Citi Group. It's been a unique period of inﬂation for
everybody, for the industry. I'm curious, what you guys have learned about your
consumer about your competitive landscape, your competitors, how they behaved
during this period? And how that might inﬂuence your future decisions about how to
price goods as we maybe see disinﬂation eventually perhaps deﬂation? And then
just secondly, you gave a gross margin GMV for the international business goal, I
think it was a ﬁve year goal, I believe that $200 billion. Anything that you can share in
terms of the detail of what your US GMV goal is over that same period? Thanks.
Yes. Why don't we take the inﬂation question ﬁrst? John, you and Kath and others,
and Judith can jump in here. What goes through my mind is the business is uniquely
diversiﬁed in an important way. We can protect opening price points and help serve
customers that need us most. And I think that showed up big time on the
Thanksgiving basket where we held prices that resonated, people needed it, they
wanted it, they appreciated it.
And as higher income customers come to us whether that's in Walmart or Sams
Club, our opportunity to do good, better and best merchandising is a fantastic
opportunity. We can put fashion apparel out under the Scoop brand or the free
assembly brand and it -- everybody, the response to that in those income levels. I
think the apparel business in Sam's Club that Kath told you about is another
example. So, one thing I love about this business is how ﬂexible it is.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Page 36 of 49A - Kathryn McLayYou can be a merchant with opening price points, you can be a merchant with better
goods, you can do that in stores, you can do that in clubs, you can do that online.
And so, we're portfolio managers. Portfolio managers as it relates to the
merchandise assortment portfolio managers, as it relates to the channel, et cetera.
And so, what I've seen our team do and what I'm seeing them do now is to learn how
to do good, better, best merchandising even more eﬀectively.
And I think that unlocks an opportunity for us from an e-commerce point of view, that
is signiﬁcant and the in-store in-club experience needs to cause people to realize
they can go to walmart.com or samsclub.com and ﬁnd just about anything they're
looking for, nicer brands, nicer product, without us walking away from the
foundational opening price point business, which is so important to us.
Yes. And the everyday low-price philosophy we've talked about a lot for a long time.
And I agree with your statement in your question that this has been a pretty unique
period. And I would include probably the last three and a half years in that period.
And we decided in 2020 that we were going to stick to our philosophy. And we're
going to continue to price as low as we possibly could for the customer.
And because we weren't high-low, there wasn't a large decision, whether we in
promotions or continue the promotional environment we're in. So we want to be the
lowest price in a trusted way on a basket of goods over time. And we did that
through the three years. We took a long view of customer value and earning
customer trust because of pricing. And while we said, and two ways to describe it,
comfortable, proud of the price gaps we have, we will always put those at the top of
the list as things to solve for, because if we don't serve customers well, then all the
investments and all the other initiatives in the background.
What really matters long-term? We have to be great at serving customers and
earning their trust each and every day on a basket of goods from the digital app, all
the way to a physical store, where someone is shopping. You've got to be great for
them all the time there. So, I think this long-term but consistency, really matters. I
don't know if you want to add anything, Kath?
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
I think people are just highly attuned to value. So, we've been looking at what are
those national brands that are willing to partner with us to go after unit growth. And
where they don't want to play, where do we use our private brand to be able to play
that role.
But I think people are attracted to where they can get value in the marketplace. I
keep thinking back to, do you remember we had a quarter we were just almost on
the line of making the double-digit comp? And our protein merchant was out in the
market and look at this great deal on crab legs. And so, we oﬀered all the value to
the member and the sales on that one item was enough to be able to push us across
the line to get double-digit comps that quarter.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Page 37 of 49A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Q - Scott Mushkin

A - John David RaineyAnd it shows the power of value that people are going after and the power of an
item. And if you can show that value to the member then, I think they can see the
value in the warehouse model and they can see the value in being able to get a
great quality item at a disruptive price.
Good for everybody, but the crabs. So I want crab legs.
You also asked about the (inaudible), just real quickly. There are a couple cross
currents in the quarter for us. You mentioned Snap. And so, that's a net negative for
us. But I think it's important to note that a lot of that is recaptured through under
other tender types. Oﬀsetting that someone is, you've got an increase in social
security beneﬁts with cost-of-living adjustment, which is a beneﬁt to us.
And then taxes also represents something that has an impact in the quarter. Earlier in
the quarter, we were seeing taxes or tax refunds higher year-over-year. During the
last probably ﬁve or six weeks, we've seen that decline. I think net through the
quarter, it's actually down year-over-year. So, those are some cross-currents that have
aﬀected our business. But when you take all of that together, it's the quarter still
shaping up as we expected.
And as it relates to US GMV or enterprise GMV, we debate from time to time whether
that's a metric we should share and when we should share it. I don't think we've got
an update on that now, but it's on our mind.
{BIO 7138867 <GO>}
Hi. Thanks. Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. I want to push back a little bit or kind of
poke it a little bit at the US growth rate that you guys are projecting. It seems like it
would be down below the 4% for the enterprise given the growth rates at the other
divisions. So, when we look at it, we look at nominal growth in the US pre-pandemic.
It would be suggestive that you could do better than that, especially with what we've
been seeing here today and what we've been researching. So why not set the bar a
little bit higher?
Yes. John.

our presence, online is fantastic. I had a chance to walk on the ﬂagship stores
together before we started to expand it. We're really excited about, not only the
customer presentation, but the brands and the way they came together, the early
results are good.
And you know me, so I'm a merchant and I'm focused on the top-line and items and
prices and brands, and we start every day with growth. And long-term, growth over
time leads to the bill -- our ability to leverage all the infrastructure and costs and
other things. Robbie, three-plus years ago, you asked me a question about pick up
and when we have a capacity that we'd hit soon and the team has just done an
amazing job at ﬁnding new ways to expand capacity, grow pick-up, you saw the
manual MFC, CMFC.
So, each was exciting week. Every time we innovate, we open up more space for
more innovation. The forklift you saw yesterday wasn't even an idea until we opened
up innovation, we had space. So we'll continue, Scott, pressing forward. Doug, I
know my expectation whatever I say should be higher. And we'll keep pushing it

{BIO 7138867 <GO>}
So my follow-up is on price. You guys, again, gaining a lot of market share, a lot of
initiatives to gain eﬃciencies. How do you balance going after market share vis-a-vis
proﬁts maybe?
Yes. It's always a balance. There's always the balance of top-line and what we see
from customers and that's where we start every week on Monday. We start talking
about the customer experience. We start with MPS, and we work our way down to
how the ﬁnancials of the business are working. So it's always about customers and
top-line, one. Second, the price gap, we'll never take for granted. The markets
dynamic, it's always going to continue to move and over 60 years. And for the next
50, 60, 70, 100, whatever we can do, we're going to ensure that those gaps are in
place.
Second, we think about our associates. We want to give our associates the best
possible tools we can to be able to make them more productive and extend their
careers. And there was an associate named Allen in the facility yesterday, who was
about 25 years in loading and unloading trucks. He was thinking of resigning, and
he's now become a robot tech. He's a bot tech. He's changing batteries and wheelsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Q - Chuck Grom
A - John Furnerand chips, and he's telling us, he's got another 20 years to go. So that balance is
important.
And then the third, of course, are the returns. And we've got to deliver returns and
grow top-line and the bottom line faster than that, John David as we said, over time.
So it's always a balance of three, but we would always start with what's the customer
value and ensuring that we are serving customers and delivering the way that we
should.
When I think about market share, price is just one of the levers to grow market share.
And it's not the one that I would focus on in this moment for us ﬁrst, because of
where we're already positioned. It's more about apparel product quality, being on
time as it relates to fashion and in-store presentation. It's growing the ﬁrst and third-
party assortment, especially the third-party assortment online. It's executing a pickup
order and delivery order perfectly. That's the way to grow share and earn share, and
price is a component of it.
But those other things are what's going to drive sustainable share growth for us. And
it's just been a diﬃcult three years, with the pandemic and the out of stocks. And
then what happened last year and with all the other changes internally, I think we've
just got opportunities to improve as it relates to being great merchants and
executing those things. And that's where I expect share growth to come from. And I
think it's a similar story beyond just Walmart US.

{BIO 3937478 <GO>}
All right. Thanks very much. Chuck Grom from the Gordon Haskett. Great
presentation and great to see you guys. A question for John just on the remodel
programs. Wondering if you could expand on the pace of the number of remodels
you think you can do, the lift you might expect to see? And then for Kath on Sams
Club. Personalization, you're really pioneering on that front. Can you speak to the
upside there?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. Sure. So, ﬁrst part of the question, we're really excited about what we call the
ﬂagship remodel. We launched the ﬁrst in Elm Springs, Arkansas just over a year and
a half ago. And early results are fantastic. It's one store. So we wanted to get that out
and see what happen. A number of those have been implemented in the New York,
New Jersey area. We have others all across the country.
And probably the number is around 300 in the year we're in of that prototype. So, a
lot of comps that has come together and the process leading to it, the innovations
that you see in the store, many of those happened in diﬀerent parts of the country.
And when we saw that those were working, then we brought them to the single store
to see how they all work together and the results were very encouraging from notFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

then the ﬁnancial results.
That led to the decision to an expansion, about 25 of which are in the Northeast and
then around 300 this year. The remodel program in total is larger than that. So we'll
roughly in this year on a pace of touching all stores, so within about seven years, the
300 will make it to the program that you saw. So we'll have more to talk about results
later as we get more on the street.
{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
On personalization, I would say there's three areas that we work on, and we've got
more maturity in the ﬁrst part. The ﬁrst part is looking at personalization and
membership -- a member's journey. And so, if I know that a member is with us as a
club member, but they're not Plus or they're not on auto-renew or they don't use
Scan & Go, then we incentivize them along that journey until we get them to be a
Plus member, who's using Scan & Go and on order renew and that use a credit card,
because that is the most loyal and stickiest relationship we can have with them.
We've got quite a mature model as we go through that and diﬀerent techniques of
being able to engage diﬀerent cohorts that are in diﬀerent maturity through that
model. The second area that we look at is personalization from a, what we call a
persona or a cohort. So I have this group of members that all enjoy shopping in
fresh, but these group that I like them, but they don't in produce speciﬁcally.
And so, how do we incentivize them? Whether it's just through prompts, whether it's
through telling them inside information, our least preference is to give them it's like
ﬁnancial incentives, but that's also available to us. We've got the personas build out
to look at kind of how do we start to behave people -- have people behave with us in
a more stickier cross-category relationship. So it's a second area.
And the third area is, just how do we personalize the look and feel of the website for
each individual member based on what their shopping purchase history has looked
like? So, I would say, there is a lot of upside into it, two and three, that we haven't
explored yet. I think we feel good about where we are in one, but two and three
speciﬁcally have value for us in our digital ads business and our relationship with our
suppliers. While we build out the tech, we haven't necessarily got to maturity in the
ways of working. So, for me, that's like some unexplored upside for us that we
haven't really kind of really got to maturity.

Q - Bob S. Drbul{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Sure. I'll just note, I think we're nine questions in before we got a CapEx question. So
I would have missed the over-under on that, Kelly. So, a couple things to note about
CapEx. One is, as I talked about earlier, we were very return focused. We want our
ROI to go up every year. And importantly, a lot of the CapEx that we're spending on
these projects, like you witnessed yesterday, we've got experience with them, we
actually know what some of the returns are.
So in that sense, this is kind of analogous to two decades ago when we had the
supercenter that was a proven model with known returns, and then we scaled that
out. That's kind of what we're doing right now with supply chain. The other thing I'll
note, which I think is important is that, it's actually pretty remarkable and unique to
be a 60-year-old company and have this kind of organic investment opportunity that
can drive these types of improved returns.
That's why I said, capital for us is a competitive advantage. There's not a lot of
companies that can go do what we're doing. And so as you look at CapEx over the
planning horizon, we expect it to be at this level for the next few years. But
importantly, whether it's higher than that or less than that, we're very focused on
making ROI as an enterprise go up each year.
{BIO 16685675 <GO>}
Thank you. Can I ask one more on high-margin initiatives? With respect to
advertising, what's really diﬀerent about Walmart's advertising business? What
diﬀerentiates it? Or is it 3P and those 400 million sellers? Is it the size of your grocery
business and the leverage there? Just what really stands out versus peers?
It's really a combination of all three. The food business is extremely interesting for
customers and suppliers and the e-commerce business is also interesting for
suppliers and sellers. And then something Kath said, which congrats the Sams team
for their performance us being ahead is the ability to close the loop from
advertisements that have been viewed by a customer in closing the loop, not only
online, but to an in-store purchase.
So the more of -- in our case, the more members become digital and we are able to
communicate with them in two ways, then the greater ability to close the loop like
that for advertisers. And Sams, of course, has the wonderful advantage of having
membership numbers attached to every transaction, every member. So, I think that's
really the path. And then, at Walmart, it's the same, plus then the marketplace
opportunity.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speakeroverall business? And then, the second question just on last mile, with a lot of the
supply chain initiatives, there's a lot of talk moving it closer and closer. Can you talk a
lot -- talk more about last-mile delivery costs and what you're seeing driver
availability and just proﬁtability with that piece of the business?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. I'm John. Before you comment on Walmart+, I think, Bob, I would just remind
everybody that everything you asked about, applies, I think, Judith, to Mexico,
maybe India and other places. This business model that's changing that includes
these components, stores and clubs, plus all the e-com stuﬀ, plus advertising, plus
last-mile, all of that is happening everywhere.
So, one of the things that we think about when we release our quarterly results, for
example, is, how was it best to communicate to you all about what's happening in
the segments and what's happening across. And in my experience, we're closer to
being a true global enterprise with synergies across than we've ever been. We grew
with international acquisitions, picked up diﬀerent brand names, picked up in some
cases diﬀerent formats, diﬀerent systems, and the work that's happened as of late is
causing us to be able to work across and get leverage and speed in a diﬀerent way
than we used to.
So, I just want to tune your ears as we have future conversations when you ask about
an ad business, what goes through my mind is the world not just Walmart US, or
membership, which is playing a role in international markets too. I think these
components are going to obviously play out everywhere.
And Walmart+?
Yes. It's an important part of the overall oﬀer. We've said that and we'll just reiterate
that. And some of the things that are really exciting. Number 1 is the amount of times
a member spends with us and then the annual spend is signiﬁcantly higher than
other channels. Consistent growth in the numbers since we launched in October '20.
What we moved to most recently that I think is really helpful and also very
challenging for the team is measuring what we refer to a couple times a day, which is
called perfect orders. And perfect orders mean no substitutions, exactly what the
customer ordered and on time, not early, not late, but on time. And during the
pandemic, many of the things that we did, we launched delivery to get people what
they needed as soon as we could. In some cases, that was early. And that actually is a
hindrance to NPS which I'll talk about. And as the last few weeks, we're seeing the
highest NPS levels, with Walmart+ members that we've seen.
So what we've really been focused on is trying to be the best we possibly can for
members. We've always said, for the entire organization, we want to be the best, not
the biggest. The best can lead you there. So we're focused on the best and serving
members, how that all relates than to the last-mile, the last-mile delivery is a largeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Q - Peter Benedict
A - John David Raineypercentage of our deliveries from stores or the Walmart+ members, but that's not
the total. And then there are deliveries from fulﬁllment centers.
And think of this chart we showed yesterday with the three supply chain, the
ambient, the perishable, and fulﬁllment. Being able to bring more of those deliveries
together so that they come from a delivery station, which is also a store in a van
creates a situation where costs we can see going down pretty dramatically. So your
most expensive dealer from store is a single grocery order, a single grocery order
with GM comes down, and then home order with grocery and GMO pulled together
brings the variable cost down.
So, when John David mentioned driving through a cul-de-sac and having more
deliveries, that's really the goal. So building density and frequency of delivery is what
bends the marginal cost, which leads back to one of the original questions, e-
commerce proﬁtability. That's how it contributed proﬁt rates continue to climb on the
operational metric of the e-commerce.
I'm still concerned that, that metric, should we share it? Would punch above its
weight whatever the number is. And I don't want that to happen. So, the day one,
number we give you for membership across markets. You'll evaluate that upon on
how you feel about it. Then the next quarter, you'll ask where it is an exporter you'll
ask where it is. And we would rather you focus on comp sales and stores, what's
going on with pickup, are we winning with delivery.
This can be a very successful company without membership, except that
membership is the best way to play for -- to pay for delivery from a customer point of
view. And so, as they become members to pay for that delivery, that opens up
opportunities for us to do more. But in the big scheme of the company, it's important
and we like the behavior we see from people when they become members, but it
just needs to be taken into a context. And that's why we're sensitive to it.

Okay. Peter, and then Karen, and then Rupesh.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Thank you. I'll be quick. So, Peter Benedict with Baird. A question on ROI. So, if we
look at the business a decade ago, it was around 17%. I think two years ago, you were
around 15%. Last year wasn't great for obvious reasons. This year, you'll probably
land somewhere around 14%. So, John David, the question is, how do we think about
the next three years to ﬁve years, you said you're targeting kind of annualized
improvement in ROI. What's a reasonable target as you think about maybe and then
stretch goals just trying to kind of put a ﬁner point on that?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Instead of giving you a number, Peter, let me tell you more about the trajectory. This
year, we'll see a pretty marginal increase. Nothing to really get too excited about, butFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

Page 44 of 49Q - Karen Short
A - Unidentiﬁed Speakerwe do want it to go up. As we look at our ﬁve-year plan, there's a more notable
increase the following year.
Then again, as a lot of these investments are in place, we talked a little bit yesterday
just about the pace of rollout and some of the automation that you saw in our DC, as
that has more skill than the last three years, the ﬁve-year plan, you see more notable
increases. And so, we want to get up to the highest ROI than we've ever had. A lot of
that depends upon our ability to execute. It depends upon assumptions around
consumers responding to the oﬀering that we have. But we believe that we've got a
plan in place that, as I said, can meaningfully improve our ROI over the next few
years.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Hi. Karen Short, Credit Suisse. Good to see you all. So, I have two questions for you.
The ﬁrst is, as we look at alternative proﬁt and with the context of greater than 4%
total operating proﬁt growth, you could envision a scenario, where operating proﬁt x
alternative starts with even decline just within like depending on what you think the
growth rates are. So, I'm wondering what you would say to that in terms of operating
proﬁt x alternative. And then just philosophically, with respect to earnings, obviously,
you've given guidance and it's somewhat conservative I suppose for this year, but
what is your philosophy on actually ﬂowing through upside or reinvesting?
Do you want to take that?
Yes. Just on the tail end, I think we're more focused on ﬂow through right now than
we've been. The slide that John David showed where we've made investments on
price wages, e-commerce, and technology. We feel like those investments needed to
happen to serve customers well. They had an income statement impact.
I got asked yesterday on the bus, is there a pivot to more of a CapEx investment
cycle than an income statement come statement investment cycle? The answer was
yes. There's a phase here we're moving into that looks more like capital primarily
driven by their remodels and automation. And so I think that's important context to
as you think about how do we view ﬂow-through, I look at the operating income
percentage of the company and how we've done over the last few years and the
choices we made and feel like things are in place now to be able to make that pivot.
And so, our mindset has shifted.
And I think that builds to the other part of your question. If you strip out some of
these initiatives that we have that are higher margin, higher growth and just, we'll call
it core retail, this is why I have the slide at the beginning to show the delta between
sales and operating income. We will continue to invest in our associates. We'll
continue to invest in price, but that is more business as normal going forward versus
what you may argue was a little bit of ketchup historically. And so, we feel like we're
in a much better place as we think about our core retail business going forward
where margins can keep up with sales.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

I want to just say as well on that one. You do need to think about these as being part
of what we do. And I think there is a danger of separating it all out because it's
completely driven by each part of it and increasingly, in our business, it's becoming
harder and harder to ﬁgure out which piece ﬂows into which piece of it. So, I just
encourage you to think about it in a whole as well because that's the way we look at
the business. And as John said, you can't -- without the retail, you wouldn't have
these streams, but they actually help bring people to the site because we have great
adverts from our sellers who get to show their products as well. So just to think about
as you think about what that model looks like.
It's a really good point, Judith. And Karen, we had debates like what we disclose
around e-commerce because it's harder and harder to actually bifurcate what is
something happening online versus happening in a brick-and-mortar store because
those lines are blurring so much. And you're right, Judith, it's an ecosystem. It really
is.
They're blurring because they're complementary. And I think we've done a good line
as it relates to what we do and what we don't do. You can imagine the debates we
have about what businesses are we in, what do we resource, what's the prioritization.
But I think we're clear on what the priorities are and what we're doing is all
interrelated. And that's a good thing for the customer as well as for the business
model.
{BIO 22151706 <GO>}
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Rupesh Parikh, Oppenheimer. So two
questions. The ﬁrst on working capital. So, it is going to be lower than it was pre-
pandemic. Just want to get a sense if you see any working capital opportunities,
whether an inventory turnover or on deleverage. And then second, at Text to Shop
talk last week, I know Judith was there as well. A lot of discussions there in AI and
ChatGPT. So just want to get a sense of, if you see any new use cases in that area?
And how aggressive Walmart is investing in AI rebound?
Maybe I'll take the working capital piece, and then Judith and Suresh probably as
well can cover the second part of the question. You're exactly right, Rupesh. When
we look internally at our plans for the year and we look at our working capital metrics
and really the suite of them, we recognize that compared to what we've done
historically, we've got a pretty good opportunity. And it's something that we're very
focused on.
We want to be able to use the cash that we have or use our balance sheet as
eﬃciently as possible. And I think a lot of things probably changed for good reason
during the pandemic, where maybe certain payment standards were relaxed orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

done historically.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Yes. I'll take the AI stuﬀ. So, lot of excitement about ChatGPT, generative AI. It
deﬁnitely, presents a pretty signiﬁcant advance in computing, but we have actually
been using ML, including large language models for quite some time within
everything that we do. The demand forecasting slide that Mohan put up with those
hexagons, that's driven by our own ML models.
Personalization that we have talked about quite a bit, that's all using ML.
Substitutions, we actually built our own ML model which actually has been
recognized outside in terms of how we serve our customers. So, ML on top of the
data that we collect has been an integral part of the digital transformation right from
the beginning. Speciﬁcally, with respect to large language model, we've actually
been using GPT-3.0 which is the open-source version for quite some time to actually
drive the text to shop that you saw in the video last time. It's also being used for
answering customer questions, Chile uses it. Mexico uses it.
So it's deeply embedded in everything that we do for GPT-4.0 and all the new things
that are coming out. Llamas come out. We are actively working, both with OpenAI
and with all the open source initiators, with Microsoft, to actually take the latest
developments and integrate that into our systems. If it beneﬁts our customers, if it
makes our associates more eﬃcient and more productive, and if we can draw better
insights about our business, we will use it and we have been doing it right from the
beginning and we'll just continue to accelerate that.
You actually got a chance to see some of the AI yesterday in our supply chain.
Devagina[ph] was talking about this. But even when the robots are going to retrieve
packages, when one slows down, that's not optimal. And we're learning from that
constantly, so that we can constantly route those at the same speed. And so that's an
example of that in practice that you saw yesterday.

Hey. Thanks. Ed Yruma from Piper Sandler. You call out the opportunities in India and
Mexico, you omitted China. Was kind of curious if there have been any changes to
the market and the role of the market longer-term? And then second for Suresh. You
talked about addressing the tech deﬁcit. Are there any places that you think Walmart
is a leading in tech today or areas you ﬂag to lead? Thanks.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 47 of 49A - Suresh KumarMaybe I'll start with China. There is a limited amount of time to talk about which
markets. So, it's about Mexico and India, because there's been a lot of change within
those. Our China team and the China market has seen huge amounts of change over
the last couple of years. As everybody knows and through the COVID period and
then opening up at the beginning of this year was quite dramatic in the change that
we saw.
The move that they've had two 50-50 of online and oﬄine with this total store-pick
model has probably been the biggest change that we've seen pre-pandemic. That
was levels with less than 10% penetration. Like that is a huge shift in a really short
period of time. We've continued to see, just like the club channel here that our Sams
Clubs are doing well. They appeal to a higher demographic within China. At hypers
as well, I think traﬃc beginning to turn towards them.
I do think the Chinese consumer has been under real pressure, but I think that we're
seeing some better signs of consumer conﬁdence improving. And just like in the rest
of the world, people are thinking about where do they want to shop. They're going
to still shop online. It's still really sticky. However, we are seeing people wanting to
come into stores, particularly for occasions. So, Chinese New Year, we saw the build-
up to it in Q4 and we're starting to see -- we saw through Q1 real strength in that as
well, particularly on more premium products as people wanted to celebrate and
open up.
So, still think there is a lot of runway in China. The last couple of years have given our
business there a bit of a chance to re-evaluate to really think about what's important
for customers and how do we build oﬀ the core of it. But we'll continue to open
Sams Club and you might see us open the hypermarket there as well, but the online
strategy is really important.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Yes. And in terms of technology, there are many diﬀerent areas where we are not
only doing world-class technology, but I would say that we are very unique. Let's
start with the omni, right? So we are the only retailer at scale where we can
understand customers, both online-oﬄine. And so we have a lot more insights about
what our customers do.
That allows us to be able to better tune our models, to be able to better -- to be able
to close the loop in better ways, the whole closing the loop. As far as advertising is
concerned, that's industry-leading. Nobody else has -- is doing it the same way that
we are able to do. What you saw in supply chain, which is connecting multiple
diﬀerent supply chains together, that requires deep technology. I don't think
anybody else has the capability to be able to do that.
We are actually also investing very deep in the technology stack as well. We have got
a hybrid cloud that combines sort of the best stuﬀ. Public cloud with our partners,
with our own private cloud investments and we are tying it to the edge as well. This
is something that's pretty groundbreaking, nobody else has been able to do that. So,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-04-05

All right. I think we're up on time. Doug, I'm going to turn it over to you to close out
the session this morning.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yes. Let me start with gratitude. A number of you have followed us for a long time
and you know us well and we appreciate that. Thanks for paying attention to our
business. We were excited to have this time with you the last couple of days to show
you the distribution center and look forward to showing you the store and club. I
hope you get the sense that we've got, which is we're leaning forward run our front
foot. We've got great opportunities and we're positioned to take advantage of them
across the business in lots of diﬀerent ways.
I think that the purpose that we talked about last night is important. It's timeless. It
motivates us. Our values and culture are clear. And our strategy is clear. And we're
really focused right now on execution. Like let's just get some of this stuﬀ done. And
it's happening. It's moving.
And what the team has done during these last three years to move forward on the
strategy while managing all the short-term things that came our way is really
impressive to me. We have a fantastic leadership team, many of which are
represented here, but a bunch aren't. And we've got a great set of associates making
this stuﬀ happen. So we're excited about this year and excited about these next few
years, and we'll visit more when we go to the store and club in just a little bit. Thank
you all.
