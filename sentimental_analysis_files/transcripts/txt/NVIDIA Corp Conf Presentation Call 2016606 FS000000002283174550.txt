{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
Good afternoon and welcome to the Stifel 2016 Technology, Internet and Media
Conference. My name is Kevin Cassidy. I'm one of the semiconductor analysts at
Stifel. And it's my pleasure to introduce NVIDIA's Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Colette
Kress.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
And we're going to just start with our basic format of getting a company overview of
NVIDIA for people who haven't heard of NVIDIA and just the general competitive
advantage in the market and your growth opportunities. Then, after that, I'll open it
up to the ﬂoor for questions or I'll continue on with my own set of questions.
So, ﬁrst, Colette, thank you again for being here.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you for hosting us. So, let me kind of get started about NVIDIA and
what makes up NVIDIA. NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing and it's been
through quite a bit of a transformation over the last several years.
We started out as a focus on one of the key applications of use for a GPU, being
gaming and for graphics. And we've now moved into four unique market specialized
platforms, the ﬁrst one being still for PC gaming; the second, pro visualization; the
third, datacenter; and the fourth, automotive. And I'll kind of break down each of our
goals within those four markets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 11But the goal in terms of our strategy is the exact same existing technology under
each four of those markets. The (01:44) technology being the GPU, the GPU either
used for overall graphics capability or used for overall compute capacity as a
coprocessor in many of these cases.
So, ﬁrst on the gaming, the gaming business still represents probably more than
50% of our business. It has been growing quite strongly over the last couple of years
with a long-term CAGR over the last couple of years of more than 30%. Really being
inﬂuenced by a host of things in the market.
The overall expansion of PC gaming as the higher production value games over the
last couple years needing the overall performance of the GPU, the overall expansion
of gaming industry as it moved into eSports, moved into multiplayer strategy games
and just the overall social platform that is now associated with PC gaming and
focusing online.
And then thirdly, we have seen the growth in terms of number of gamers coming on
board as broadband access has actually expanded worldwide and those are coming
more online to do the entertainment for PC gaming.
We just recently came out, with about a month ago, two new gaming cards for high-
end gamers. Our 1080s and our 1070s and those have started shipping some of our
Founders Editions on our Pascal architecture and folks were extremely excited, both
reviewers and overall gamers in terms of what these cards will bring. This is the era
of probably future virtual reality and the use of also GPU to enable a lot of the high-
end performance that is necessary for the virtual reality.
We consider virtual reality should essentially be a bonus on top of our platform and
another reason to get into the overall PC gaming market. We can take the overall
gaming market and move to our enterprise side and our enterprise workstation
where we have our GPUs under our Quadro brand for professional visualization. So,
essentially, all of the key design in the world and the key work stations and high-end
work stations, we are also a leader in that position with our overall GPUs.
Our third business, move to the datacenter. You know our datacenter business for
the last several years has been focused on high-performance computing. And the
overall supercomputing world, where high-end mathematical computations and the
parallel processor that the GPU brings in terms of improving the overall speed of the
workload on many, many cases. We are number one, use of acceleration in the
supercomputing. But what has been very, very focused over the last couple of years
is the new emergence of deep learning and the deep learning framework for
artiﬁcial intelligence.
So, deep learning framework is a new way to think about artiﬁcial intelligence from
what we have seen in the last 20 years, within the use of deep neural nets, and the
use of signiﬁcant amount of data being applied to the overall computer to actually
train it and get it to understand and produce key algorithms.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 11Q - Kevin E. CassidySo this has been a big focus of us over the last couple years in terms talking about
the emergence (5:14) in the ﬁeld. We've been working with tremendous amount of
hyper-scale providers around the globe. Have they've also been researching this in
higher-end research institutions that have fell into the hyper scales. And this is a big
part of what is driving our overall growth in datacenter.
Out third piece in datacenter is our overall cloud and cloud virtualization. This is
essentially a one-to-many type of position where the GPU is located in the cloud and
you're able to stream down to diﬀerent applications or diﬀerent use cases where the
GPU is necessary. This can be used in, essentially all of the streaming, gaming
situations or otherwise where the user interface is important in terms of the ideal
graphics for the underlying application.
Our fourth market is actually automotive and it usually follows right after what we talk
about in terms of the datacenter because it is really a focus of our long-term strategy
on autonomous driving. In autonomous driving, we've looked at the approach of
exactly what we learned in the datacenter and what we understood as using deep
neural net to actually train the overall, underlying compute function within the car for
self-driving cars of the future.
So we've put together a platform, a platform that we call DRIVE PX that we
announced back at CES. And we are working with more than 80 diﬀerent car
manufacturers, Tier 1, start-ups, focused on autonomous driving a net (6:49) central
compute. So, central compute is about centralizing all the work around the car from
cameras to lidar to radar and all the diﬀerent types of sensors into a central compute
and a set of algorithms that can drive the cars of the future. We'll probably see a car
with the overall platform on the roads in probably the next 12 months based on our
autonomous driving platform.
So, those are our four businesses. Our results, just ﬁnishing our ﬁrst quarter of the
ﬁscal year, grew more than 13% year-on-year. We also reached record levels in terms
of gross margins in ﬁrst quarter and managing to keep our overall OpEx within a
good investment level and producing proﬁtability growth of more than 40% or more
than 470 basis points year-over-year.
We continue to stay focused on these four markets. They have large TAMs in front of
them for us to go and deliver. And the great thing about it is the same uniﬁed
technology, same architecture under each one of those, okay. So, that's a pretty high-
level approach to our business right there. Let me know if you have any other
questions.
Q&A
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
Yeah. Sure, Colette. So, that's – I would say NVIDIA is in the sweet spot of all the hot
topics in technology today, your PC gaming, your virtual reality tied into that. And IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-06

Q - Kevin E. Cassidy
A - Colette M. Kressnoticed you did say future virtual reality, but you're not saying that it's happening
right now?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. I think virtual reality is not yet what we'll call good enough. I think it's in the
initial phases of what we're going to see in the future. And it's a situation where the
technology has ﬁnally reached a position where it is a good experience for the user
with the overall performance of the GPU matched together with a set of headsets.
You now have a great position.
It is likely the future of next-generation gaming and we have surrounded in many,
many aspects, not just from delivering the overall performance of what we can do
from a GPU, but also working with our content developers that are building content
for virtual reality to assure that the software that comes to virtual reality, we can
actually better ourselves as well with our understanding of the use of the GPU. So, it
will continue to improve. We're excited versus what we see right now. A lot of people
are engaged on it, but we know there's many years to come in terms of virtual reality.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And also the – your move into the datacenter, I will add that with all this
great growth you've had and high gross margins, your stock has doubled in the past
year. Is that about right?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
It's about right. Yes.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
And, but – that you're now getting adoption in the datacenter, can you talk about
that? What was your competitive advantage? How did you get there?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So the GPU and the datacenter, a lot of our focus, for example, as you've seen
us over the last couple of years, has been discussing deep learning. We actually
used two GTC conferences, for us to discuss the ﬁeld of deep learning and a lot of its
use cases. The GPU is just extremely well positioned for overall deep learning. Its
position as being a tremendous performance and capable of also great power
eﬃciency, but also the key thing about it is its overall programmability. So, those
three things mirrored (10:37) together in a ﬁeld of what they were looking for in
terms of building algorithms and building training algorithms for these applications
has been very key.
We've been continuing to grow that with our work with hyper scales, the beginnings
of other industries and enterprises over the last six months. And you'll see that all
come together. So it's a position of increased breadth of the overall customers that
we're working with, but also the depthness within those customers in terms of the
projects that they are rolling out.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-06

A - Colette M. Kress{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
Good. Can you talk about the competitive landscape?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, competitive in deep learning. There's diﬀerent form factors to complete
accelerated computing. Accelerated computing has been a driver a lot of the
supercomputing era. We tend to hold the majority of that share in the
supercomputing world. But in the deep learning, they're really working on an
improvement in their overall TCO, improvement in terms of how the speed of the
training and the training of the data can take place. So, there hasn't been a
signiﬁcant amount of competitors really working on that level of performance.
There's other diﬀerent forms of accelerated in terms of custom ASICs or what you
may see in terms of FPGAs or others. But the use of a GPU has generally been one of
the leader types of technologies that have been in use for deep learning.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
Okay. And just maybe we take a step back into PC gaming and talk about the
competitive landscape there. You've introduced the new architecture and there are
reports from John Petty Research and Mercury Research says keep track of market
share, that's units, so.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
That they track. And can we talk about the diﬀerence between what you're doing in
PC gaming versus what some of those market share numbers might show?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So the market share partners that we see out in the market, what they can see
is relationship of the number of GPUs that are sold in the market with the
denominator essentially being the number of PCs on that piece. So, we do
participate in what we'll refer to as a mainstream PC or a general purpose PC that is
sold.
The price points on those types of GPUs are probably double digits type of range
and their proﬁtabilities are probably even lower. That's where there is a signiﬁcant
volume (13:23). As you think about the size of the overall PC market in total 200
million to 300 million PCs a year, many of them not customized for apps that require
super high-end graphics. Now, when you think about that we still have a signiﬁcant
hold of the overall share of the market even in those factors. But what we
concentrate on is the market that we are focused on is gaming.
Now, gaming is a subset of the overall PC market and the majority or the lion's share
of what we sell into PC gaming market that is not necessarily a PC that is sold. What IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 11Q - Kevin E. Cassidy

Q - Kevin E. Cassidymean by that is, generally, a PC is owned. These are usually self-built types of PCs,
and they are just improving the overall components as the overall gamers whose
wish (14:11) in terms of in the add-in card market. So the majority of our revenue in
the gaming is in the add-in card market.
When you break down that market for gaming, we have a large lineup of diﬀerent
cards for gamers. We tend to want to provide a gaming card for every type of gamer
that may be out there, ranging from $100 GPU up to $1,000 GPU. We launched a
new set that is geared more towards the higher end of the gaming market. We see
the production value of games continuing to get better.
We continue to feed that market with better performing products, and our current
performance of the Pascal architecture is one of the best performance increases
from a prior architecture that we've actually had. So that part of the market, we've
been in a leadership position for quite some time and a signiﬁcant lion's share of the
overall PC market because of that.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
Yeah, okay. And with that, the Pascal, you're – also you've changed the architecture
and you're going to a diﬀerent process mode. In the past, that's resulted in lower
gross margins, for the ﬁrst couple of quarters for NVIDIA. Can you say why it's
diﬀerent this time?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, at the time that we looked at – over the last ﬁve years, we had been on the 28-
nanometer for some time. So, we've continued to improve the performance even at
28-nanometer. We felt this is the time to move to a new node with 16-nanometer. So
with that combination of a new architecture and a node change you've seen the
substantial improvement of performance.
But you're talking about a new process. With the new process on day one, there's
something diﬀerent than what you realize on whatever date or ﬁve years of the last
type of node. If not, anything diﬀerent than any of our other product transitions that
we've gone through and we master the bring down of our current architecture as
well as the bring up of our next architecture about as smoothly as we can.
And again, at this stage in terms of what we've seen, we feel very conﬁdent that
again the experts that we have within the company will manage through that well
and we still have an opportunity for gross margin and gross margin focus as we go
forward.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
Okay. And you had mentioned that the PC gaming market is growing at 30% CAGR,
your growth within. What about going forward, I guess do you expect the same type
of growth rates going forward?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 11A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Kevin E. Cassidy
A - Colette M. Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, the overall PC gaming market, there's a couple outside ﬁrms that have focused
on trying to look at the overall money within PC market going forward. A lot of them
look in terms of the high-single digits, double-digit types of growth rates going
forward. Some of those are the same numbers that we have seen historically and
we've been able to grow a little bit faster or maybe a little bit more faster than the
overall market as a whole.
Again, we're very pleased of the excitement around our Pascal architecture, the
opportunity for Maxwell users to move to the new Pascal architecture, and then also
to realize the gains that are coming out there. We don't have a long-term look, what
people look at is about double digits in terms of the total market, and we'll see how
we perform.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
Okay. Maybe – we didn't spend much time on automotive. You talked about what
you're doing for the self-driving car. What's your revenue today in automotive, and
where does that mostly driven for (18:20)?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So, we had another record level in terms of automotive with our Q1 results, and
it grew more than 40% year-over-year. We ﬁnished last year in the plus $300 million,
almost $350 million range for automotive. You're correct, the majority of that is our
infotainment systems. Our infotainment systems where we focus on premium
infotainment in a premium lineup of cars where we have digital dashboards or
digital cockpit in many diﬀerent types of those high-end models going forward.
We continue to focus on new models, new model wins on that premium side, and
that's a focus on our business of the 10 million cars that are on the road, as well as
the additional models that we'll have going forward. Our long-term focus and
strategy really takes those relationships that we had built with the automotive, and
understanding one of the more exciting and challenging areas which is focused on
autonomous driving, and the strategy that's going to be necessary to build that out.
In our discussions in terms of working with the automotive, they understood the
need for a signiﬁcant amount of compute capacity for autonomous driving going
forward. For many years, they were focused on man-years-written algorithms that
would write scenario by scenario on how to drive a car or essentially some of the
ADAS work on how to signal to the driver or how to stop the car. But when we
showed them some techniques focused on deep learning, focused on using those
types of techniques for autonomous driving, we were actually able to cut the time
down signiﬁcantly on the time that was able to build those overall algorithms. So,
focused on a platform that they can continue to bring the algorithms that they have,
continue to write on our DriveWorks developer platform as well for that center
computing platform going forward is our strategy as we go forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-06

Okay. Yeah, I'll open up to audience. Any questions? I guess not. We'll continue on.
So, also, I remember a time when 40% gross margins was almost unthinkable for
GPUs more than 10 years ago. But now, you're hitting record-high gross margins.
Can you talk about what the components are for your gross margin expansion that
you've had?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, our focus on gross margin has really been about delivering the value
that is incorporated not only in the GPU or the underlying chip architecture, but the
value that we deliver in the development platform across each of these four markets.
We have a signiﬁcant amount of software work, building that development platform,
developer tools, developer libraries for each one of those markets that would be
considered GameWorks, DesignWorks, and we've talked about what we do for
automotive as well as what we do in CUDA and CUDA DNN that we do for
datacenter. These additional development platforms, is what helps the adoption of
that full platform within the markets that we're looking after. That improves the
overall value of what we're delivering. That enables us to maintain our overall pricing
and the gross margin improvements that you've seen over the years. But it's still
going to be our focus in terms of increasing the value that we deliver inside each
one of those platforms, and therefore, also increasing gross margins hopefully as we
go into the future.
We have a set of growth markets that have higher gross margins than the company
average. If they continue to grow faster than the company average, there's an
opportunity as well for additional gross margin. We just can't play through that mix
perfectly to see where that's going to land.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
I see. Yes?
Gaming and speciﬁcally eSports is starting to get a lot of, what I guess, perhaps
attention. Maybe just sort of go through with how you think about the opportunity
there and how NVIDIA thinks about the opportunity there. How big can this really
be? Or is this just evolving sports phenomenon sort of like a ﬂash in the pan (23:12)?
I'm going to repeat it for the webcast. The question is around eSports and how big
can this get to be? We've seen pictures of full stadiums with watching gamers play
against each other.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So, eSports is a key base of the gaming community. I think it's a key part of the
overall social platform that has brought more and more to the overall PC gaming
industry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Q - Kevin E. Cassidy
A - Colette M. KressIt's brought folks online, brought them together. It brings the friends together. It
brings the peers together in that type of scenario. They see the equipment that the
professionals are using. They see what their friends are using in terms of equipment
as well, which continues to drive more purchases both of better games for them to
play, as well as the underlying performance of the GPU.
We'll continue to work to provide more performance and a continuous ecosystem
around eSports or the overall social platform. So, just as we have in the other parts of
our portfolio with our overall GPU for gaming, we have an ecosystem of working with
game developers, working with the actual gamer and assuring the downloads of the
games that they're doing, the conﬁguration, the drivers that they need to play their
favorite games is a simpliﬁed, easy process and making count on the brand of
NVIDIA to assure that, that experience is great. So, we continue to work the whole
ecosystem from the game to the actual experience in terms of what they're playing
in terms of games.
The work with the gaming developers is to help them on features. Years ahead of the
games actually coming true to life, we've been working with them to master the
overall graphics that they may want to put in terms of those games. So, eSports has
continued the social platform, continued the expansion of the overall market just as
the expansion of better games and a better GPU has done.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
Anything else from the audience? Yes? In the back, Chris (25:41)?
Can you just talk about the potential for the enterprise market (25:45-25:57)?
The question was what's the potential for the enterprise market which I would say
ties in to VMware and Citrix virtualization of a GPU?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So, there is a couple areas where we focus on the enterprise. In ﬁrst piece,
when looking at our workstation business and the overall design ﬁeld, there's a
couple diﬀerent areas. When you think about design as we go forward, design in
terms of the time for rendering and the time that it takes in the full design process
from what they see in a drawing to what they see from a prototype. If we can
improve that process with the libraries of materials, the overall ability to prototype on
your screen, it's a great overall feature for the overall design community. You can
also see the application of virtual reality in terms of the enterprise.
You've seen a lot of things start to come out in terms of automotive showrooms
instead of actually stocking the overall cars, you can go into a virtual reality
experience with a high-end workstation and feel the next car that you may purchase
in terms of VR (27:12). It's very popular also in terms within the medical ﬁeld. How do
you train overall surgeons? And train surgeons in terms of a virtual reality experience
can also be the future of what we see in terms of virtual reality and not just on
gaming, but in the enterprise.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-06-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 11Q - Kevin E. Cassidy
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Kevin E. CassidyBut our focus in terms of expanding the collaboration of design in enterprise is also
a very huge focus.
So, when you think about anything that is designed, it's rarely that it happens in one
room or one development group. It's often shared by development groups that are
located all over the world. Sharing those diﬀerent designs across the world through
a cloud experience has made it much easier in terms of the time to, overall,
complete that.
You could actually complete the design of the building, do the actual structure here
in the State of California but do the HVAC for the landscaping through another part
of the world such as India and share those designs, overall, together. That's some of
the basis in terms of our virtualized experience.
It's also very important where people want to keep the overall computing
capabilities in the datacenter and that is only streamed down in a VDI experience so
that the application is running in the cloud. Our use with the enterprises has been a
huge focus in terms of our virtualization as well.
And then thirdly, as we think about what we've done in terms of deep learning, with
the hyperscale then in the datacenter, there is absolutely a focus of how this applies
and is applicable to our overall enterprises as well. When you think about the
signiﬁcant amount of data that many enterprises are looking for the data analytics,
the deep data work on a lot of the big datacenters is a huge focus of ours as well. So
we're in those initial stages of working with the enterprises on that part as well.
{BIO 15420688 <GO>}
And one thing left. I think all investors are having a problem with, and this isn't just
NVIDIA but anyone that's selling into the cloud or into these hyperscale datacenters.
How do we gauge how big these markets are? We don't know, it's all greenﬁeld, I
guess and some of your cards are rather expensive relative to your chip price. How
would you recommend investors try to model out your cloud business?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Whether it be our datacenter business or the work with the datacenter with a lot of
the cloud providers and the hyperscales, we're really looking at new computing
models as we go forward. The use of acceleration will likely get to be a larger
percentage of the compute environment in the datacenter and also probably for the
enterprise. It is important that people see the speed in terms of how fast people
have moved to other options for improving the throughput out of their datacenter
using acceleration techniques.
Now, how big will that get or how fast will it move? I think that's hard. I think we're in
the initial innings of what we're going to see in terms of that movement in the
computing model, but it's an exciting time to think about acceleration.
