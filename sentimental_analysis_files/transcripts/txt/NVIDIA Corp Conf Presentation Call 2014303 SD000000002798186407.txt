{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay. Welcome, everybody, to the NVIDIA presentation. I'm Hans. I cover
semiconductors. Chris Evenden is here with us, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
We're going to have a ﬁreside chat and feel free to ask questions. And there's going
to be a breakout afterwards at the -- is it the (Caraba)? Is it (Corova)? (Cordoba).
Okay, there you go.
Okay, Chris, welcome. So let's start. You're a graphics company. You're changing. Or,
at least historically, you've been a graphics company. Can you give us an update on
what's happening in your core GPU business. And why has it been so resilient in a
PC markets that's been kind of weak over the past couple of years?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Okay. So fundamentally, we're a visual computing company. And the product we
make, as you say, is a graphics processing unit. And then we have a couple of ways
of making money out of that technology. And one of them is by building the GPU
itself and selling it through a number of markets. And I think the one you're referring
to is the GeForce market, which is the consumer graphics market.
And I think the best way to think -- and that one's been surprising to a lot of
(inaudible) year or so, because (inaudible) it's doing really well. (inaudible) the PC
market, (inaudible). The two markets we compete in are (inaudible) OEM and
gaming. And the gaming market is actually very healthy. PC gaming is doing very
well. We estimate the market's growing around 10% a year. And so, we're growing
within that. I think we've gained a little bit share year on year.
In contrast, the OEM market, which is tied to mainstream consumer and notebook,
largely, is a weak market. And, obviously, that's in decline. But the strength of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

Hans Mosesmanngaming market is such that it outweighs that.
So we've shown quite a lot of strength in the last 12 months.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay. Then to -- is that working? Is everybody -- can everybody hear? So --
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
I'll just shout.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Well why don't you use this? So staying on topic of GPU, how does the game
console -- there's a series of new game consoles that have come out. How does that
impact or potentially impact your GeForce business?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Sure. So intuitively, you'd think there'd be an impact on the GeForce through a share
of wallet argument, right? There's only so much money that a consumer can spend
on gaming. And PC gamers, typically, have one or more consoles. They game on a
lot of devices.
However, we haven't seen that. I mean, we had a really, really strong Q4. So if it had
impacted our Q4, our Q4 would have been wonderful without it. So I don't -- we
don't appear to be seeing any weakness due to the new consoles launching.
What are the reasons for that? There are a lot of good games coming out on PCs
now. And that looks like a pattern that seems to be set to continue. And one of the
interesting things about the new consoles is they are, architecturally speaking, they
are essentially PCs. And although on the gaming PC scale, they're sort of right at the
bottom end of the gaming PC. But they're there now. And I think that makes it a lot
easier -- by easier, I mean cheaper -- for software developers, game developers, to
port their games across to PCs from console. And that means that we should see
more games available more quickly on PCs, which is good for gaming, because
people don't buy GPUs because they want to buy a GPU, they buy a GPU because
they want to play a game and experience the game better, high resolution, more
special eﬀects, whatever, what-have-you.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay. So staying on the GPU side of things, you've recently disclosed over the past
year that you're thinking of licensing some of this technology. How does that work?
What's the timing? Who would the customers be. And so on?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

So the -- there's two ways to license technology. There's the licensing the graphics
core and taking -- and providing something of value to customers. And they're also
enforcing your IP, IP rights, your intellectual property rights, as well.
And so, really, we're focused on the former. We would use the latter if it came to that.
But we're much more focused on licensing our core to people. So that would be
people building SOCs of their own in the phone market, conceivably, or even inside
other markets. So for example, in smart TVs. Smart TV is an interesting market that
obviously uses the sort of -- has a need for the sort of technology we can provide.
But whenever we've looked at that market, we haven't been able to make a ﬁnancial
case of building a chip speciﬁcally for that market.
However, if you were to go to a TV manufacturer who's already building their own
chip and say, here's the world's best GPU, video encoder, all the other blocks we
have, then that would conceivably be a market there. So phone manufacturers and
other adjacent businesses.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
And the timing?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Timing for that -- we're having conversations with people now. There's nothing to
report until there's something to report is the challenge I have there. So it's not
something I can say 78% complete. It's --
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Why not?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Why not, says Hans. Last time I ever do a ﬁreside chat.

Chris Evenden
Hans MosesmannOkay.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So it's just diﬃcult to -- until you've actually signed the deal, you haven't got a signed
deal, I think is it in a nutshell.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay. It sets up the next question that I get a lot from investors, that you have an
arrangement with Intel, a cross-licensing agreement. It's the second of such
agreements. And it ends in 2016-2017. And the concern with investors is that the $60
million or so that you get per quarter from Intel, net, will go away. It goes to zero.
Can you explain what the puts and takes are of a potential new agreement. And why
would it happen or why would it not?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So that's right. So we have a licensing agreement that was originally signed in 2004.
And then updated in 2010, 2009. And it runs through to March 2017. And it covers
our patents through that March 2017 in perpetuity. So Intel has the rights to those
patents in perpetuity, as, by the way, do we. We have the rights to Intel's patents
through that period in perpetuity, as well, which is an important point.
Now. So that means as of April 1st, 2017, there's nothing for us to -- Intel has the rights
to all our patents. But that's a situation that starts rectifying itself fairly quickly,
because we ﬁle around 500 to 1,000 patents every year. And so, we'll have to see
what we think is the right strategic approach to take towards whether we want to
renew that agreement, how we want to renew it, what we think the value is going
forwards.
The bear case is that there's zero probability of us renewing that agreement with
Intel and there's 100% probability that no one else will sign any sort of licensing
agreement with us in the meantime. And I think the truth isn't that black and white.
And the truth is going to be somewhere between that. So somewhere there will be
more licensing revenue between now and then.
And as we get closer, we'll be able to report-- as we actually sign deals, we'll be able
to report that. And as we get closer to the March 2017, then, yes, we'll be able to talk
more about Intel and where that goes.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
All right. So before you go to Tegra, the exciting stuﬀ, any questions from the
audience?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

(technical diﬃculty).
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
So to repeat the question, you've recently stabilized pricing or raised prices?
Yes. They're supposed to be going down. And they haven't.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Okay, yes.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Interesting statement there that prices are supposed to be going down. I mean, one
of the beautiful things about the GPU market is the prices are not going down. And I
would say in the last 12 months prices have actually gone up. And that's largely a mix
thing, because, as I mentioned, gaming is strong and OEM is weak. And so, the
blended ASP is actually going up. But within -- even within the gaming, the ASP is at
least ﬂat. I'd have to look at the data to be sure. But I think it's at least ﬂat.
So absolutely, we have a strong competitive position. AMD has just launched their
range of new cards. And we launched a couple of new ones. And we've re-jigged
our lineup. But we're about to start launching our new set. We just launched our ﬁrst
Maxwell generation architecture, as well.
So we feel pretty good about the competitive position. If you look back at the market
share numbers for the last three years, we've been somewhere between 58% and
66% market share for that entire time. So it's moved around a bit. But it's been
relatively stable. So I would expect that to continue.
One caution around market share numbers, though, is that it is a unit share number.
And so it's not a dollar share number. And so, that means it's dominated by high-
volume, low-ASP, low-gross-margin-percentage OEM sales. And so, you can see a
fairly signiﬁcant shift in % market share, unit market share, without actually seeing
much change at all in revenue. And, of course, even less change in proﬁt share.
And in fact, there was one quarter last year where our unit share went down,
according to the Mercury numbers. But our dollar share clearly went up as we
continued to perform very well at the high end.

Page 6 of 15A - Chris Evenden
Q - Hans Mosesmann
A - Chris EvendenAny questions? All right. So let's go to Tegra. So Tegra is -- your average tech analyst
will have mixed emotions about Tegra in terms of Tegra 1, Tegra 2, Tegra 3, some
lofty goals and how there's a more reasonable goals. Now you've been able to
incorporate a modem functionality into some new Tegras here, the Icera modem.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Give me an update on where you are with Tegra. And is it more than just tablets,
going to smartphones, or are deemphasizing smartphones and you'll be going into
other areas, automotive, for example? So give us a rundown.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
You stole my thunder there. So Tegra is all about the intersection between visual
computing and Android. So the basic strategy is that we believe the Android is on
the verge of becoming ubiquitous. And wherever visual computing, wherever that
visual experience matters in Android, that's where we believe that we can be
successful with Tegra.
So that might be high-end smart phones, super phones. It might be tablets,
automotive, set-top boxes or gaming devices, a la Apple TV, that sort of product.
So where we are right now, we've just launched our new Tegra chip, which we call
Tegra K1. And this is the ﬁrst chip that we've launched that has a PC-class GPU in it.
And so, you're worried about power consumption when I say that. The power
consumption ﬁts within the envelope of a smartphone. But we have all the functions
you'd expect from a PC graphics chip, OpenGL 4.4, DirectX 11. And so on. And we
also have the CUDA programmable cores, as well. So general purpose compute on a
GPU.
And so, what that enables is, for example, with regards to gaming, the Unreal Engine
4 has been ported across to our new chip. And so that means that it makes it --
Unreal Engine is middleware for games. So it makes it -- it's essentially a
programming language for games. So you write the game on top of the Unreal
Engine. And so it makes it very, very easy, trivial almost, to port a game from one
platform to another if they're running on Unreal Engine on both. And I think Unreal
Engine is probably the most popular AAA-- game engine for AAA titles. So Gears of
War, for example, was written on a previous version of Unreal Engine.
So the demos we actually used at CES to show oﬀ Tegra, Tegra K1, one of them ran--
one of them was written for PS4. And one of them was written for PC. But we just
ported them straight across because they were both written for the Unreal Engine on
both of those platforms.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

A - Chris EvendenThe other thing we showed at CES was the 64-bit version of Tegra K1. So I think we're
the ﬁrst company -- I think, still, the only company -- that has demonstrated Android
running on a 64-bit chip so far. So you'll see devices based on that in the back half of
this year. You'll see devices based on the 32-bit version of Tegra K1 in the ﬁrst half of
this year.
At Mobile World Congress last week, we showed Tegra 4i, two Tegra 4i phones. So
these are -- 4i is the integrated application processor plus baseband. So you'll see it.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
LTE baseband.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Multi-mode LTE, yes. So 2G, 3G, 4G, LTE. So that's really where we are.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
So when you're taking about the -- going up into the PC space, running games, what
you're saying is that on Android you'll be able to play PC games and compete
basically with Ultrabook-class Intel or AMD-based platforms?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So yes. So "compete" is a strong word. I don't know if we'll actually compete. But
you'll certainly be able to build Android or Chrome devices that have as much
computing and graphics power as those devices. So the Tegra K1, we think, is more
powerful than the Xbox 360 or the PS3. So last generation consoles.
So you'll be able to have a gaming experience, a user experience, of that level of
quality. And I don't think we've got any benchmarks that compare it directly to
current integrated platforms. So I shouldn't comment on that. But I suspect that the
GPU we have is more powerful than most of the integrated platforms that are
available on the x86 side of the fence today.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
And going back to Tegra or the Tegra 4i. So, what's the strategy there? You're seeing
a number of new players such as MediaTek and Marvell and Broadcom and even
Intel want to joint this LTE modem integrated SOC party that has been the sole kind
of party for Qualcomm for the past couple of years. And you're just another guy.
What's the diﬀerentiation? What's the strategy?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
The diﬀerentiation has to come back to the visual experience. So gaming or visual
computing in general. You're right in that there's a lot of talk about LTE modems. But
I think that's really an artifact of the fact that there's only one player in modems at the
moment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 15Q - Hans Mosesmann
A - Chris EvendenAnd so, two years hence, there'll be a bunch of people with perfectly competent LTE
modems. We'll be one of them, obviously. And at that point, you won't think twice
about the modem. We won't be having lots of conversations about the mode,
because any more than we have conversations about the WiFi chip in your PC, right?
It'll be just another piece of equipment.
And so, there'll be some modems that are better than other modems. But they'll be,
probably good enough. It'll probably be very diﬃcult for the average consumer, if
downright impossible, for the average consumer to diﬀerentiate between modems.
And at that point, the conversation goes back to application processors. And what
can you do to change the user experience. And we think that with our combination
of graphics technology. And the software, the ecosystem, that we've built around it,
then we can diﬀerentiate ourselves and give consumers a diﬀerentiated experience,
whereas someone who's relying on a modem, solely a modem, won't be able to
diﬀerentiate that way, because the modems will be all pretty good.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
So any questions on Tegra for Chris? All right. So I'll move to Quadro, which is a
workstation, professional solutions business. And Tesla, which is high-performance
computer for supercomputers. And that portion of your business is 20%-plus of
sales. It has very, very high gross margins, very sticky. Can you tell us or explain
layman's terms how that business transitions to GRID? What is GRID? And the Street
is trying to ﬁgure out how big is it, when. And all that kind of stuﬀ. So GRID.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So I don't know that it'll transition to GRID. I think GRID is separate.
So Quadro is graphics, professional graphics. So principally CAD workstations. But
also all the special eﬀects Oscars, all those were composed on Quadro video
editing, that sort of thing, professional users.
Tesla is something diﬀerent. It's using the same GPU. But with -- but not for graphics.
But for compute. So you're actually performing mathematical calculations on it. So --
and a number of applications map very well to that, parallelize very well. So weather
simulations might be one. The Black-Scholes equation, modeling derivatives, is
another one, actually, that maps very well for that.
And GRID is putting the GPU in the cloud and making the graphics performance
available over the network. So the graphics is running remotely.
And so, these are the three diﬀerent businesses. So if we want to talk about where
they're -- let's just talk about GRID. So GRID -- the main focus right now -- there's a
number of ways you can monetize that technology. Once you've managed to
virtualize a GPU and put it on the network, there's a number of ways to make money
out of that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

Q - Hans MosesmannGaming we're looking at -- we have a 6,000-person beta for streaming gaming
running in Northern California right now.
But the main focus today is improving the user experience for Citrix and VMware
users. So we can -- we can do two -- by adding a GPU to the virtual desktop
infrastructure that's used by Citrix and VMware, we can both improve the user
experience for the average user. And also enable new applications, 3D applications,
that weren't previously supported by Citrix, by XenDesktop or by VMware.
And today we are at the stage where we have hundreds of trials worldwide of that
running. And the number of trials is increasing rapidly. It's up, I think, 40% Q-on-Q.
But we're not at the point yet where I can talk about revenues, because it's enterprise
IT. The purchase cycle is two years. We've been doing this for around six months.
So by the end of this year, I would expect us to have a better idea of the conversion
rate of those trials. And of the average deal size, which is not data that exists yet.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
But by the end of this year, I would start -- I would expect to start to see some of
those convert into production systems.

What's the TAM, roughly speaking?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
TAM questions are always challenging, right, because you have to look at (inaudible).
It's in the billions, we believe. So we'll probably have another look at this at our
Analyst Day, which is -- I'll get our plug for the Analyst Day out -- March 25th. So only
three weeks away, three weeks tomorrow.
But in the billions is what I'd say. But it's -- at the moment, we're single-digit million in
revenue. So we're somewhere away from that.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Chris EvendenCan you repeat the question?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So I was asked, then, about the potential for software licensing as part of
the GRID business. So that would be a fairly way, a fairly typical business model for
the enterprise IT market. And, truth be told, we will be updating the software
regularly to stay up to date with the latest applications that these enterprise users
will be running.
So absolutely, that's a possibility. It's -- we're -- it's too early to discuss exactly the
business model for that. Obviously, we're in discussions with potential customers
right now as they run through their trials.
And quite happily, our new CFO actually has that background. So if there's anyone
who can help us ﬁgure out the right business model for that market, it's her.
I had a question about share buyback. Can you give us an update on that, or would
you wait until your Analyst Day to do that?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So I was just asked about share buyback. So where we are, last year we returned $1
billion to shareholders. This year we said we'd return $1 billion again. About $160
million of that is dividends, roughly, assuming it stays at the current levels. So that
leaves $840 million for share repurchases. We announced a $500 million ASR in
February.
(inaudible).
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So that's actually an ASR that's executing. So the authorization is north of $1 billion. I
forget exactly. I think it's about $1.3 billion.
But the $500 million is executing. And that runs through to June. And so, we think --
and we think an ASR is how we did the last major buyback. And it feels like it's the
right way to go. I mean, we all that companies are terrible at deciding when to buy
their stock. So if you spread the risk over a period of time through an ASR, you
actually get a discount to the volume-weighted average price over that time.
And you get 60% of the shares up front. So in theory, everyone wins. We win
because we get to take the risk out of the equation. Investors win because a lot of
the shares are taken oﬀ the table up front. And whoever executes the ASR assumes
they can generate proﬁt through the trades.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

Another question.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Yes.
If you're going to license your (inaudible) technology to board manufacturers. So
they can use (inaudible), were they, then -- what will your competitive advantage
(inaudible)?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So that's -- so, the question is, if I can reinterpret the question, is, if you start licensing
your GPU technology, then doesn't that compete with Tegra, essentially, right? That's
what you're saying?
So I don't think so, oddly enough. And the reason for that is because it's an
ideological decision about whether to build your own chip or not. Or maybe a more
ﬂattering way to put it, it's a strategic choice that a company makes.
And they make that choice based on -- I don't know the -- I have no special
knowledge of the matter. But I imagine Apple didn't decide -- they didn't sit around
the table and look at the detailed strategic choices. They -- the idea probably sprung
fully-formed from Steve Job's head that they had to build a chip and they had to
control that aspect of it, for example. Right?
So in a way, actually, licensing our technology opens up a market, because there'll
still be emergent semiconductor market that you have to compete for. And there'll
be a market that you can compete for. So if I can use an example without implying
one thing or the other about whether we're in there or not, if you look at Samsung,
for example, they both have their own chip. And they have -- and they buy chips
from companies like ourselves.
So I don't think they're going to change either of those two strategies. That's their
way forward.
Before we started licensing our technology, the only way we could compete for
Samsung business is through Tegra. So that will be some percentage of their
devices, not all of their devices. Now, with the licensing technology, we can compete
with all of their devices.
So like I said, that example is for illustration purposes only. But it gives you an idea of
how we think of the whole market -- the market as a whole.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

Yes. And OEMs that have made that decision include Intel, Apple, Samsung, just to
give you a sense that they've made that decision to make their own SOCs. And they
license graphics technology from ARM or Imagination, right?
So any questions on Tegra, before I go into another topic? Okay.
So Chris, Moore's Law slowing down. You're using TSMC. There's a transition going
on at TSMC to kind of go to FinFET. So we're going from 28-nanometer to 20-
nanometer to 16-nanometer FinFET. The road -- Intel's now oﬀering foundry services.
So lots of issues going on there. How committed are you to TSMC? Would you
consider going to Intel, now that Intel has basically said, we'll talk to anybody,
including competitors?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
So TSMC is the best at what they do is the short answer of that. We -- we'd be fools
not to think about looking at other suppliers. And we do. And we send -- we send
test chips through other foundries every now and again. And if we ﬁnd a point at
which the technology and the business terms are right, then I think we would put a
chip or more through other foundries.
But the reality is that, to date, TSMC is extremely good at what it does. And there isn't
anyone that can match it. So right now we're committed.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
Anything I left out? I think I left out automotive. I'm going to go to that. Was there
anything speciﬁc that you think we should --?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
Well we didn't talk about Tesla. I'm excited about Tesla.
{BIO 1522582 <GO>}
All right, let's talk about Tesla.
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
I like to talk about Tesla. Tesla's an interesting business. So Tesla is using a GPU. But
for compute. And it was frustrating as an IR guy, because there was clearly so much
excitement around Tesla. And you'd see so many really interesting applications for it.
But it stuck at sort of $25 million a quarter for a couple years, actually.
And it's recently burst out of that limit. And I think there's a couple -- there's two
reasons for that. I think one is that there are enough codes supported now. So theseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

like Cray, IBM, NEC, Supermicro, to take it to market.
So whereas a year and a half ago, to sell Tesla into a company we would actually
have to go into that company. We'd have to evangelize parallel programming
through this company. We'd have to help them with their code porting. And then
we'd make the sale.
Now you can conceive of a situation where a researcher at a drug company is
looking into protein interactions, say, he knows that his molecular dynamics code is
accelerated by Tesla. He knows that IBM sells a Tesla server. So he can just phone up
his IBM salesman and get one delivered on Friday.
So that -- so, the business can now scale. And so, that's what we're now seeing. The
business has scaled. It grew 37% year on year last year. And there's reasons for more
optimism, because now we're looking at additional markets like consumer Internet --
big data analytics for consumer Internet companies. And that's proving to be quite a
rich seam to mine, as well.
So that's -- so, Tesla is still a relatively small part of revenues. But as you hinted
earlier, it's extremely proﬁtable. So a lot of that falls to the bottom line. And I think
people underestimate the impact on EPS of that business.

Ted?
Just a quick one. Have you seen any uptick on the hyperscale Web 2.0 companies
adopting Tesla?

So Amazon uses Tesla at AWS. It's a fairly focused application right now. But there
are other companies, like I say, other consumer Internet companies that are making
some pretty interesting use of Tesla, on both a smaller and a larger scale.
So there are a bunch of examples. I was just about to steal some of them from the
Analyst Day. But I won't. There's a bunch there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-03-03

Okay, we have about a minute. How is it that a graphics company gets into a very
sticky relationship with a European car company or series of car companies, when
you have incumbents that have been doing that for decades?
{BIO 18934997 <GO>}
That's really interesting, actually. And I think it's the growth -- I keep going back to
visual computing, like a PR automaton. But it is visual computing. And as you look at
what makes a diﬀerence to the car experience now, it is the quality of the net. We got
in originally for nav and DVD playback. But the quality of that varies a lot.
I was in Barcelona last week. And the cabs there are all Priuses. And so, they have
one version of a digital dashboard. And I was actually -- I was lucky enough to drive a
friend's Tesla Motors car a couple of weeks ago. And that has another version of a
digital dashboard. But the quality of those pixels is quite startlingly diﬀerent.
And if the Tesla had the Honda dashboard, you couldn't dream of charging
$100,000 for it, right? And that -- and increasingly, your experience with the car is
metered through the in-car electronics. So the quality of the graphics, the speed of
update on the nav, the resolution of the displays, the realism of the dials -- because
increasingly you're seeing all-digital cockpits now, no more physical needles and
dials.
That's one element. And the other element that's going to be really interesting going
forward is just as a GPU is good at taking data and turning it into an image, a GPU is
also very good at taking an image and pulling data out of it. So doing image
recognition, for example.
And that's going to be very important as these car companies move towards ADAS,
advanced driver automation systems. So we have a -- we can show you Tegra K1
taking a real-time video feed from the front of a car, recognizing where the white
lines are, even reading road signs, speed limit signs at the side of the road, ﬁguring
out how far in front the car is. And so, as the car companies move towards ADAS
systems, which they all are doing, then this will be very powerful for us.
And Audi did announce they were using Tegra K1 in their ADAS system. And they've
shown some really interesting demos, for example, of a car that can -- that manages
itself in stop-start traﬃc. So it moves up to the car in front and stops, moves up to the
car in front and stops, keeps pulling forward. And also stays between the white lines.
And so it just steers for you, as well.
And features like that Audi thinks are going to be in cars before the end of the
decade. And that's really, again, where the power of a GPU, a real, quote, real GPU,
can really help us.
