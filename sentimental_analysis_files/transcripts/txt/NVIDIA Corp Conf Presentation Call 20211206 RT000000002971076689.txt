{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm Tim Arcuri. I'm the semiconductor and semi
equipment analyst here at UBS. And I'm very happy to have NVIDIA with us in this
next slot. We have Colette Kress, who is the CFO, and I'm going to have Simona read
the safe harbor beforehand, and then we can launch in this with some questions.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you, Tim, for hosting us. As a reminder, this presentation contains forward-
looking statements and investors are advised to read our reports ﬁled with the SEC
for information related to risks and uncertainties facing our business.

(Question And Answer)
Perfect. Thank you, Simona.
So Colette, I'm just going to ask you questions in a sort of a grouping ﬁrst on the
gaming business, and then we can talk about data center and then I want to talk
about your autos business, and then I have a few other categories of questions as
well.
So, let's just start with gaming. And I guess, the ﬁrst question is that, obviously,
demand has been very strong, revenue is up 2x since launching Ampere, you're still
growing mid-30s year-over-year based upon your guidance. The question I always
get is, how sustainable is this through calendar '22? And maybe you can ﬁrst sort ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06

Q - Tim Arcuritalk about that. But also, more importantly, walk us through the growth drivers for
that business as we head into next year.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So, a great set of questions. And ﬁrst, again, thank you so much for hosting us.
We look forward to speaking with everybody and being able to answer all of your
questions about NVIDIA.
When you think about our gaming business, remember our gaming business has
been with us from the very, very beginning. Our gaming growth has continued to
evolve over the decades. Gaming is now a broad entertainment sport and inﬂuences
many diﬀerent types of participants. It has been an important piece of adding ray
tracing, it's been essentially a game changer for the industry. But we've also seen a
large rise of notebooks, notebook gaming, high-end types of notebooks. These
inﬂuence a thin and light type of conﬁguration that also allows you to do great
gaming, but allows you to do that gaming, no matter where you are in mobile to take
your gaming experience with you.
Additionally, we have seen many additional types of users in gaming. This has been
an area where we have seen creatives, we've seen broadcasters and we see many
diﬀerent types of students in the stem population focusing on diﬀerent
conﬁgurations, using ray trace cards or just using also their infrastructure for gaming.
Now when we think about going forward and we're looking right now at the holiday
season that's in front of us, I think that's the most important and closest to us at this
time. And we're excited to continue to provide our gaming cards to the market for
the holiday in the western world as well as we turn the corner into the new calendar
year.
But it's early to speculate in terms of demand trends as we go forward into the next
year. But we do believe demand is strong. We believe, right now, the channel
inventories are very lean. We believe we still have a great opportunity in front of us
to continue to upgrade gamers to that Ampere architecture as well as ray tracing.
More and more we see that decoupling from gaming. What we see is all these
additional types of opportunities to use the high-end cards and using GeForce to do
so. The company as a whole will take the appropriate work to continue to procure
more supply, because right now we have situations where that demand exceeds our
overall supply. We've been able to grow quite well during this year, each quarter
sequentially growing and we do continue to plan to do that for Q4. So, we believe
we'll be in a better situation in terms of supply when we look at the second half of
next year.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for that, Colette. Can we just talk also about crypto for a moment? I
know it's a very diﬃcult question for you to answer, because you really don't know
how much, if any, is being bought by the miners. But sort of what feedback are you
getting from the channel? Do you -- can you just sort of maybe give us some
anecdotes about feedback from channel that convinces you that crypto is not a big
factor or makes you worry that maybe it is? And maybe just the potential for theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06

Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kressminers to be ﬂashing the old ﬁrmware onto the RTX cards, because I still hear about
some of that happening, but it's sort of hard to really determine how widespread
that is.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, NVIDIA developed a strategy. NVIDIA developed a strategy for lite hash rate
types of cards to be coupled with our CMP products, our crypto mining processor
products to help steer more of our supply, more of our gaming cards towards
gamers, and also to provide those CMP processing cards to our crypto miners.
You're correct; it's diﬃcult for us to determine how much maybe crypto mining. But
our low rash -- lite hash rate cards only work with our game-ready drivers. Our game-
ready drivers that we poster back in May when we announced the lite hash rate card
and beyond.
Our lite hash rate cards are also here to target Ethereum. Ethereum is the most
popular card that, excuse me, crypto that we see using GPUs. We've heard of reports
of software that can be partially improved by the performance of the lite hash rate
card GPUs, but it's not able to fully restore. And we understand it would not be
eﬀective for those hash rate strategy as an eﬀective way to reduce the value of these
cards to miners and steer that supply to gamers. It's been diﬃcult for the miners to
buy Ampere GPUs in large quantities. Our CMP is targeted at large Ethereum
installations, and for reasons we discussed, we are seeing Ethereum 2.0. And some
of the government policies that are out there that has aﬀected our overall desire for
CMP out there. We'll continue to watch this overall carefully. We believe that our
strategy can be successful in doing the best to really produce these GeForce cards
for our overall gamers.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Yes. I think maybe just to your point, I think the thing that people often miss when
they hear about that is that you can improve the performance may be of lite hash
cards, but you're not going to get it up to where it would be. You're not going to get
it all the way back up to full performance. So, thanks for that.
And then I guess maybe can we just talk about the trajectory of the supply-demand
balance. Obviously, if you look at the pricing in the channel, it's still well above MSRP,
which tells you that the channel is still very tight, to your point not a lot of inventory.
Can you talk about sort of the trajectory of sort of where you see supply-demand
imbalance through 2022? Do you think that you're getting enough supply now? I do
want to talk about your purchase commitments. But part of that obviously is for
gaming, probably not a huge piece, at least part of it is. So, just talk about supply-
demand imbalance and sort of how do you see that manifesting itself throughout
the year?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So, when we have looked each in quarter, we're trying to make a good
understanding of what we're seeing out in the channel, what those levels are in the
channel, and how we can continue to procure more and more supply to meet that
need. That's an ecosystem piece of work when we think about how to improve ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 14Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kressoverall supply. We have to think not only of the supply that we procure to create the
overall cards that we would want to put into the channel, but we also have to think
about our add-in card partners, our OEMs, which are also integral in terms of getting
(Technical Diﬃculty) of gamers. That takes us working not only in procuring inventory
now in the next couple of quarters. But as you've seen us, we are also now procuring
longer term. Longer term can be more than a year, and you've also seen a snow
enter into agreement that will take us out many years in terms of long-term capacity
needs.
We believe the ecosystem as a whole needs better understanding of what do we
think the possibility will be in the future to help them build out this capacity. So,
that's where our work is today. We'll have to wait until we ﬁnish the holiday season to
see how that inventory in the channel is looking through the holidays. And we'll get
back to seeing when do we feel we'll be able to really get to a stabilization point of
supply and demand.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
And is the thing that you're monitoring for that, Colette, is it the same thing that the
rest of us are looking at, you're just sort of looking at these sites and you're looking
at the secondary market pricing versus MSRP? Is that what your team is doing to sort
of ascertain when you get to supply-demand balance?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We are looking mostly at our AIC distributors and how they are working on creating
that for the channel. That's the best that we can do is manage that part of the
channel. The second hand cards, it is going to be a case that from time-to-time that
maybe there, particularly when things are in short supply. There is an opportunity to
potentially do the resale on that. The overall pricing that we see in that market is not
something that we can control. We can control in terms of the price that we sell our
cards to the AICs or to the OEMs, but then the market essentially deﬁnes that or the
channel market determines those price that we see out there. We'd love to bring that
back down. We believe bringing that down really takes just providing a reasonable
amount of supply in the market versus the lien amounts that we have today.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
I guess Colette just last thing in gaming before I move over to data centers. Is there
any way to determine how much of your growth, say, from when you introduce
Ampere, how much of the growth -- obviously, revenue is up about 2x, is there any
way to think about how much of that is mix versus how much of that is pricing?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Well, we have been providing GeForce cards into the market for decades, looking
historically, over the years in terms of that compounded growth rates. We have seen
the -- both factors of increase in terms of units from either upgrades and/or new
gamers coming onboard to purchase as well as an increase in average ASPs. That
average ASPs is a reﬂection of people buying up the stock and buying some of our
higher end cards. So, this has consistently been over time to both be importantFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 14Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kressdrivers and even today when we look at this time with Ampere, it is consistently
driven both by units and ASPs.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
I think just -- sorry, maybe just one more question on gaming. I think you recently
gave us that 20% of the base has upgraded. And I think when you sort of think about
what that number means, at least when we've looked at it, historically about half of
the base seems to upgrade to the new generation card. So if drew that curve out,
this sort of asymptote is out in the 50% range roughly. So, A, is that fair, and B, would
you kind of in that light characterize a 20% upgrade rate as indicative of, hey, weren't
like not even halfway there yet in terms of what the upgrade opportunity is?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So, what we had announced was we believe looking at our installed base, about 25%
of the installed base has upgraded to either the Ampere architecture or is
participating in ray tracing cards. We look at that and look at the strong growth that
ray tracing has inﬂuenced on our installed base, but additionally, we also look at the
opportunity in front of us. But there is still a great opportunity of nearly 75% that still
have that opportunity to get to ray tracing. Whether they do that with Ampere or in
the future, it is a great milestone for us to keep focus on.
What this really means is people are looking now to beneﬁt from their existing cards
for installed base, very common that our installed base will include multiple diﬀerent
architectures over the generations. So, we will have those focused on Pascal, those
focused on Turing, and then now focusing even on Ampere. When you think about
the upgrade opportunity of our installed base of two generations of architecture, it is
a great power for them to think about that upgrade. Now, all we have to do is
continue to build up the cards to meet that overall demand that we think is out there.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you for that.
Let's shift over to data center. First, I want to ask a question on the networking and
then we can talk about core compute. So, just on the networking side, obviously, you
said the demand exceeds supply. It sounds like the constraints are worse on the
networking side given the substrate issues and whatnot and that's a pretty consistent
message from others too. But it sounds like maybe you did between $550 million
and $600 million, again that's my number not yours, in networking in the data center
segment last quarter. But the question is, can you sort of help us quantify how much
demand there was? In other words were you several hundred million dollars short of
demand, because obviously also you said that that's -- that demand still exceeds
supply even in January. So, maybe can you help us quantify the number or maybe
when do you think you can start to ship to that demand level?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Within our Q3, the networking demand was much, much stronger than our
supply that was available in Q3. And we probably expect something similar as weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 14Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kressmove into Q4. The company as a whole continues to work that supply situation and
hope to improve it by the second half of next year. Nothing really diﬀerent in terms
of networking as we have focused on many of the supply challenges. It's not
necessarily any one thing. When you have to think about the complexity of our
products, when you have to think about the complexity of the ecosystem. You really
have to work from beginning of the builder all the way to the ecosystem that are the
end construction of our products and getting that to market. So, it is really a focus of
the whole company. We've done a tremendous job given how strong the demand
has been to improve the situation. And we do believe we can really get this to a
strong position by the second half of next year.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Great. Maybe just moving over to core compute, you're growing over 60% year-
over-year again in ﬁscal '22 and it looks like we can grow another 50%. I mean you're
not guiding to ﬁscal '23 core compute, but it looks pretty reasonable that that
business can grow in the 50% next year. I mean, obviously, Ampere is really hitting
the beginnings of the product cycle. But again, a similar questions what I asked you
in gaming, is there any way to characterize how much of the growth you're seeing on
the compute side is units versus pricing? I get that question a lot, and frankly, I don't
know to really how to answer it.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. When you look at our data center business, our data center business can be
broken down primarily by the diﬀerent types of customers that we have. We have
been a big part of the overall hyperscale growth and the hyperscale customers still
represent about 50% of our overall revenue today. The other half of it is selling to
enterprises through OEMs and/or ODMs.
So, what this means is over the years, we have expanded both breadth and depth in
terms of what we're able to sell. Our hyperscale is not only a building for their
internal workloads or workloads that are needed in terms for monetization of the
data that they have coming through their networks, all focused on AI and
acceleration, but they also set up cloud instances. The cloud instance is a really
important area for enterprises to begin their work of moving workﬂows to
acceleration and taking advantage of how AI can really help the businesses.
We have great momentum also on inferencing. If you remember, several years ago,
we were still in the early stages of inferencing and now we have the ability not only
to provide inferencing-speciﬁc platforms and cards, but we also have with the A100
to really be dual allowing them to partake in training and inferencing. But
inferencing has been an important driver of the revenue and it likely outgrew the
data center of revenue as a whole in terms of the growth that we're seeing in
inferencing.
So, our sales, when you break this out by whether or not it is a price point or unit, I
think that's a really tough way to look at it, because we're here to supply to our
overall customers, any diﬀerent version that they want. If they want a full end-to-end
system or if they just want the card and they want to choose the type of system, weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kresscan enable each and every single one of those. We can even provide it to them in
the cloud, provide that on-premise, and types of hybrids of world. So, there's so
many diﬀerent conﬁgurations that probably not the easiest way to discuss the
business based on ASP and units.
We will continue to focus on trying to be a data center scale type of provider. What
we mean by that is, we now have the ability not only to focus on GPU acceleration,
but overall acceleration of the data center as a whole. We've incorporated work from
systems, but also focusing on the three diﬀerent components that may be there,
whether that be the CPU in the future, the GPU as well as our current DPU in the ﬁeld
as well.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Got it. Can I just ask about enterprise? People talk about cloud and I think people
get the drivers in cloud more, because it's just frankly you can see the big seven
hyperscalers and you can look at their CapEx trends. It's just a more visible
underlying growth trend. But in enterprise, you've been doing very well with a few
milestones, the availability of the software stack for AI enterprise, the VMware
partnership and the expansion of LaunchPad and DGX running the whole stack. So,
can you talk about that maybe sort of what some of the milestones are there in
enterprise? And do you think that the growth on that side can keep up with the
cloud such that the mix is still roughly 50/50?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So, our enterprise strategy is to democratize AI and make it mainstream type of
workload. In order to do that, we enabled with NVIDIA AI enterprise, which is a
software suite that contains those tools that they need to both develop and deploy
AI. This allows that to be supported and maintained in the ways that enterprise
require. Enterprise is really important for them to have the software capability, the
service capability so that they can continue to run these on their mainstream servers
and run side-by-side instead of siloing these types of workloads or infrastructures.
This has also been an important part in terms of our work with partnering with
VMware, for example, to help drive both DPU adoption as well as data centers
increasingly becoming multi-tenant and implement, for example, a zero trust
security. These are important parts on how enterprise thinks about deploying the
acceleration in AI on their mission critical types of jobs that they may have. We've
also launched something to be referred to as LaunchPad, which is an on-ramp to
NVIDIA AI. When you want to think about it is it's a try before you buy for enterprises.
We are continuing to serve these diﬀerent options to ease the adoption, to ease the
learning through many diﬀerent ways, whether the infrastructure is fully complete
with a system software stack, so for them to continue to work on the application and
stitching that together, that's one way or if they wanted to start with a base piece of
infrastructure and build as they go, we will enable all of those.
We have DGXs, for example, base command for development of AI or we have Edge
workloads that we engage with EGX running deployed AI or managed by a ﬂeet
command. So, many diﬀerent types of software oﬀerings, all of them are tending toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 14Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kressbe on the NVIDIA-certiﬁed OEM systems, ODM systems or cloud oﬀerings. In the
future, I believe, we think the growth of all diﬀerent types of AI workloads, whether
they be training, whether that be inferencing, whether that be edge computing can
all be great sizes. The enterprise is an important area of focus. We already know it
being 50% as a standalone. We know that the cloud participants are also enterprises,
so our growth and what I think in terms of the future, the enterprises would be very
important part.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Got it. Thank you. So I want to ask about DPU and timing on BlueField-3, you did
mention BlueField. I know in the past you said that the SAM for BlueField in 2024 is
ultimately the entire server TAM. But I mean you can get some really big numbers by
taking the server TAM and you multiply by $1,000 ASP. So, have you provided any
sort of insight in terms of how to think about what your ultimate share of that SAM
might be? And like is that the right way to even think about what the SAM is just to
take the entire server TAM and just multiplied by $1,000 ASP?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The discussion about a DPU for the data centers has become such an important
topic and enterprises hyperscalers continue to focus on this zero-trust, a place to
stage data, to encrypt data for multi-tenant environments to have been and safely
already be there. We have been not only talking about our current availability of
BlueField, but also our future generations will continue to improve. We have many
customers trial and working to qualify the DPU in terms of now as well as in the
future. So, we'll continue to see this to be an important area of a data center as a
whole, and we'll probably just see this ramp in terms of revenues next year.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Got it. And then maybe just the last thing on data center before we kind of go on to
autos. But Jensen has said last calls, again, about whether it's really realistic that all
servers will ship with an accelerator, and obviously we're still below 10%. And he
thinks that ultimately the penetration will get to 100%. But I guess the question is,
how does your Arm road map help you get there? Can you talk about how the sort
of interplay between the what you're doing on the accelerator side and your Grace
road map helps you kind of get there?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. The way you want to think about the discussion about your long-term will every
server likely have acceleration in AI, can that be a GPU? We believe in this. We
believe that long term this will be how data centers are driven. But it's not a one for
one. As many times, we have multiple diﬀerent types of solutions inside of a server.
Again, multiple GPUs, we can have many diﬀerent types of conﬁgurations that
support that.
So, as we think about the opportunity in front of us and where we are right now, we
think we are in still the single digits in terms of that type of penetration. But the more
and more that we are seeing at-scale types of deployment, so many diﬀerentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Q - Tim Arcuri
A - Colette M. Kressindustries looking at AI solutions and now having readily available software that gets
them -- gets up to them. We believe we will continue to be able to penetrate not
only the enterprises, but future work that we're doing in terms of the hyperscales as
they dug out larger and larger models and new workloads. New workloads that
focus on conversational AI, recommender types of models as well. These are
important things as well as what we see in terms of Omniverse in the future.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Great. Thank you for that. I do want to ask you about Omniverse, but I want to ﬁrst
talk about autos. So obviously, you have a huge pipeline, you have $8 billion pipeline
and you've said that most of that is parked out into the back half of the decade. So,
that's not -- so that's clear. But I mean, obviously, the Mercedes, partnership that's
going to start to manifest itself, probably, I would think in 2024, certainly in 2025.
You have a number of other partnerships. You've done very, very well, with a lot of
the Chinese start-ups as well. So, I guess. Can you talk about the timing for
Mercedes, number one? And then and then number two, if you look at how the
market is valuing some hardware-only vendors I mean ADAS, the market is putting a
very high multiple on some of the hardware-only vendors. And there seems to be
this debate as to whether the Tier 1s, who want to control the software stack or the
degree to which they're willing to basically hand the keys over to you. So, can you
also talk about that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. Diﬀerent questions there, but an important area for us. We've been working on
autonomous driving and really led the way helping folks understand the complexity
of autonomous driving in terms of the compute that's needed and the solution of AI
to really help the deployment of autonomous across a lot of diﬀerent types of
vehicles. So, we have discussed an autonomous pipeline going forward of $8 billion
out to 2027 and this includes our design win that we have today across the
transportation industry. I think it's important to understand, there's a many diﬀerent
types of industries in that pipeline. First, it is our established OEMs, it is Mercedes,
Hyundai, Volvo, several others. It also includes electric vehicles, neighborhood
electric vehicle types of companies, Nio, Xpeng, Li Auto, several others.
Trucking is also an important area of safety for autonomous driving. And then we
can't forget robotaxis. Robotaxi start-ups that have been across the world are also
included in our pipeline. We see there to start to be a reﬂection of a revenue growth
associated with this pipeline probably starting in the second half of next year and a
larger round as maternal corner to calendar year '23. Our Mercedes deal is
important part and a healthy part of that pipeline. And this is an ability for us to not
only sell a hardware, but also participate in the software and the software
monetization that Daimler will have and will split it with us. We think this is a very
important deal.
I know many people have been focused on such a unique way to work together with
an OEM and how we share the beneﬁts from that kind of deal. We're excited to be
working with Daimler and many of these others across the world. We have a full
stack, an end-to-end type of solution that can be hardware, that can be hardwareFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06

complete the overall software. Daimler is probably one of our stronger relationships
that we have here, a quite a long ﬂeet to work with. But again, we're working on
software with many of these diﬀerent suppliers.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Great. Thank you for that. I mean it seems that as Orin starts to ramp and ship in
calendar '22 that, that's really going to be a catalyst to start to open up the backlog;
would you agree with that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The Orin architecture is expected to start shipping in 2022 calendar. We have
discussed on Orin architecture a while back and it is now coming to live. The Orin
SoC features 17 billion diﬀerent trends -- and is delivering probably 7x the
performance of the prior generation in Xavier. Orin will support not only
autonomous vehicles, but it's also there for embedded platforms including robotics.
The interest in Orin is very high. Orin-related design wins comprise probably a good
amount of our autonomous design winning pipelines. And these wins are broad-
based, everything from the OEMs, trucking robotics all very exciting terms of Orin. It
will be in part in terms of continuing the development work that they are doing to
build these platforms for production, but we look forward to shipping out next year.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Got it. This is probably a good question to sort of pivot to a question that I'm getting
from investor. There's a lot of things, this is just one piece this Mercedes partnership,
it's just one piece of an eﬀort for you to move more revenue to recurring models.
There's the VMware partnership, more directly licensing software, obviously,
Omniverse as well. So, just from a very, very high level, can you sort of outline the
strategy for recurring revenue and software-like business models, particularly in
gaming and in AI. Thank you.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
When we think about software at NVIDIA, software is not new to us. We've been
talking about it probably for 10 to 15 years. Just the onset and building of CUDA had
really delivered probably a very inﬂuential software package to folks, but not
necessarily for separate monetization, could have been our development platform
across all of our GPUs has been essential. But we have added a signiﬁcant amount to
all of our software today and now we may oﬀer in terms of separately. Why oﬀer it
separately, why monetize it separately, this is important to enterprises. Important to
enterprises that they know that their mission-critical applications in work has a
service component to it, that's something that they can count on in terms of both
continued innovation, support to fuel the work that they are doing in AI. So, we're
here to assist them with that.
We will continue to provide a lot of diﬀerent software in our application, in our
overall stacks of infrastructure as well, but focus in key areas, where we can monetize
this separately. Infrastructure as a whole across the company, whether that be withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06

A - Colette M. Kressgaming, data center, professional visualization is still a very meaningful part of our
revenue monetization. And now this addition software separately can be really
helpful to us in the years to come, but we're still in the early days of monetizing it
separately.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Yes. I mean GeForce now is part of that. I saw that the announcement from EA that
they would go with you a couple months ago, seemed like a pretty big deal. I mean,
it's pretty simple math to take several tens of millions of users at $10 a month or
some nominal number and you can get a pretty big number even given how large
the company is today. So, can you just talk about that as well?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
GeForce NOW is another great opportunity of providing optionality to the building
out of cloud gaming. GeForce NOW, we have not only our own infrastructures with
(inaudible) and a service on top of that. We've been working with partners across the
world to include it with other types of software packages that they have and building
out their infrastructure to enable that. And we will work with many diﬀerent providers
out there to assure that, yes, we get to expand gaming to as many gamers as we can.
This is a great opportunity for those that have not been able to reach gaming,
whether the price points of an individual device for gaming or just using a diﬀerent
type of package such as a MAG that will allow them the availability to many of the PC
types of games that are out there. So, GeForce NOW, many diﬀerent ways to procure
it, make it available to the gamers and we'll continue down that strategy to just try
and inﬂuence more and more gamers in the world.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Yes, that's all obviously part of moving more revenue to current models. And just in
that vein, if we can talk about Omniverse for a bit. And we can talk about Omniverse
for more than just a bit. But I guess you sort of laid out three -- sort of three
monetization areas or three verticals that you can attack. I guess the ﬁrst one that
you've talked about clearly is -- are the creatives and the engineering and the CAD,
the design people, there's 40 million of those and you sort of talked about that as
the most realizable near-term opportunity. But then there's also the digital twin stuﬀ
and there's also the intelligent agent stuﬀ with avatars and those are very, very big
TAMs as well. So, can you just talk -- a part of the success of Omniverse is getting the
CAE vendors on board with that -- with a platform, because you're trying to push it
as a standard. So, can you talk about the push-pull between, do they see you as a
competitor? Do your customers see you as a competitor? So, just kind of talk about
the evolution of Omniverse.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So let's start with what is Omniverse to us. Omniverse is our hardware and
software platform here at NVIDIA that we will be able to introduce 3D design
collaboration for building out virtual world and building out digital twins. Building
out virtual world and distributed collaboration will be investment across many
diﬀerent types of companies at all diﬀerent levels. We stand to beneﬁt in this caseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06

A - Colette M. Kressfrom not only our computing and graphics technology both for infrastructure and
software, but as a whole working on delivering an end-to-end solution to help the
industry.
Now when we think about the TAM and we think about the TAM in front of us, we're
still in the early days in terms of outlining that, but you are correct, there's a lot of
diﬀerent collaborative designers out there that we can target. 40 million designers,
we think, are available now. Those 40 million designers will be working on stitching
together what they do today in their collaborative productivity applications and
moving that from a 2D world to a 3D world. We could license, for example, to each
one of those users $1,000 by user per year to start building out those 3D
environment. So, that's one form of monetization that we can do. We refer to that as
Omniverse enterprise in terms of purchasing that seat, per user, per year and it is, in
general, availability today.
Additionally, we have the opportunity of creating digital bots, creating these for
customer support, calls centers, car assistance. This is a large opportunity in front of
us that we see improvement. This could also be taking our Omniverse avatar, for
example, and pricing it approximately $1,000 per avatar per year. This is also in beta
and will be available soon.
So, the software revenue not only is the one piece of Omniverse. This has a multiplier
when you think about the systems, the infrastructure and chip revenue that will also
be necessary. Your designers would likely need high-end workstations in order to do
their design work. Additionally, building out these complex large models for a 3D or
virtual environment or new data center level type of infrastructure to inﬂuence that as
well.
So, building metaverses, it's already started from content creators to cloud gaming
infrastructures. Enterprises will continue to start the work in building digital twins as
well. We look at this TAM opportunity to be in the buildings. We'll continue to reﬁne
it in the next couple of months, but a contribution from both are software and
hardware.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
And can you just talked about the relationship you have with your customers and
your partners. I mean part of the success of this platform is getting the CAE vendors
on board with partnering with you and you don't have any of your own CAE
capability. I guess, is that a piece that you view you do you need that? That's not
necessarily been the ammo in the past. But do you feel like maybe you do need to
have your own CAE capability for the platform to be really successful, at least for the
lowest-hanging fruit, which are these 40 million engineering and just -- people?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, when you look at our ability to engage with enterprises of so many diﬀerent
industries. We will continue to follow the path that we have done. The ﬁrst thing was
working with OEMs and ODMs on all of the diﬀerent types of infrastructures that are
being built for these industries. We continue to ﬁne-tune those certiﬁed systems soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-06

Q - Tim Arcurithat they can support all these diﬀerent industries that might be out there. We've
begun working with ﬁnancial institutions on what they need, manufacturers, e-tail,
retail, the list goes on. Omniverse yet now another example of an important
infrastructure that we have now connected all of the partners and the ecosystem. We
look at the current existing software applications of these designers work with, we're
here to connect with those software applications, Omniverse, taking the exact same
work that they are doing and just moving it to 3D.
That overall path to get to the enterprises by understanding each of the industry's
ecosystem, software partners, infrastructure programs is how we'll go to market here.
So, it's not exactly incremental, it is more of the same as we build out of both our
software and engagement with these partners.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
And then I guess also how have your cloud customers, they all have -- they all want
to build the metaverse to each of them means a diﬀerent thing, obviously, but they
also want to build their own platforms as well. So, how do you view that tension
between big cloud customers also with what you're trying to do with Omniverse?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Our approach to accelerate a computing and AI solutions has always been agnostic.
We will work with just about everybody in the market as we can in assisting them. We
have software application speciﬁc to certain industries. We also help with the
hyperscales as they may be working on certain frameworks, certain large models to
stitch that together, to make it optimized and more eﬃcient for them. We have, for
example, right now more than 150 software development kits available for all of
these markets. We support them all. We support all the diﬀerent types of hardware
providers that may be there as well, whether they be a CPU hardware provider,
storage, memory, these are all important things that are ﬁne tuning. I think our
support from the very beginning has been supporting the world of acceleration and
AI; and whatever we can do to put that together, we will do.
{BIO 3824613 <GO>}
Yes, thanks for that. I just mentioned that because certainly in cloud gaming, the
issue there was not so much whether the technology was ready, it was more just
whether the gaming interest -- put their titles in the cloud and things like that. So, it
was more of a sort of a behavioral thing. So, I -- it seems like that's the hurdle that
you sort of have to get over now. So, anyway, really, really appreciate the time. And
thank you very much, Colette.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
