Jen, thanks very much and it's a pleasure to be here today with you folks. In the
introductory part of our webinar, I'm going to be addressing this question of how the
hard discounters make money and a lot of that will focus on the tangibles, but I wantFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15

Page 2 of 19to focus on the human components as well. Employee engagement is critically
important in the success of these types of businesses and then they do well. And
they focus on hiring quality people. One little known fact is that out the ﬁrst 50 store
managers that already hired here in the United States, most of them were graduates
of Cornell University, and they were compensated at 20% over the average starting
salary.
So from the beginning, that this human side of it has been important. It's not that
easy to understand how they make money because quite frankly, it's not the
standard business model, just put this catchphrase in here from the door to the ﬂoor
and back at the store and more pausing for just a second on the ﬂoor, it turns out
that almost all these stores, for example, have stone tiles, the guaranteed strength,
low maintenance and a smooth ride is a product from the back of the truck to the
shelf.
And what was interesting was, a number of years ago, all the deferred on the
purchase of Franklin stores, a heavy discounter in Australia because this Franklin
stores would not support the ﬂoors that already needed to put in. So the detail is
important in these kinds of operations. Well here it is on one page, here is how they
do it, here is how they make money. And just looking at our graphic, it starts with
knowing how to shock people with price, because they're shocking people with
price and they certainly do that well is what generates the traﬃc. That along with that
traﬃc, they've got the support of stronger product proﬁts and lower costs and
together, those are the things that combine to give them the ability to make, not
simply money but actually a very adequate return on their money.
So let's delve into each of those aspects directly. First, looking at the impact of lower
cost of goods on strong product proﬁt. What's happening here is that the retailer is
actually exerting a fair amount of inﬂuence on how the product is produced. And as
a consequence, what the product costs, that's enormous and it's very diﬀerent from
the way, our current retail model works in grocery, where the call it channel captain is
the manufacturer, is a brand manufacturer who typically speciﬁes these things. This is
enabled basically because of the emphasis on own label.
Second aspect of the strong product proﬁts has to do with the extensive product mix
involved. The product mix starts with multi-brands, which allow the hard discounters
to price to value, getting some additional pennies of proﬁt in there and that's really
highlighted in the premium brand segment of their oﬀer, which has in high -- sort of
intrinsically high penny proﬁtability.
Probably the most important driver, however of strong product proﬁts is the way they
handle the extensive oﬀer of general merchandise. They devote a lot of space to
general merchandise, the general merchandise typically carries a higher price point,
up to $30 is not unusual or those are a lot of 10, 12 and 15s in there, but the real trick
is in any high eﬃciency retailers, they turn these inventories fast, very fast and so, it
turns out to be a signiﬁcant contributor of gross proﬁt dollars.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 19Just a ﬁnal touch on strong product proﬁts. There are two other things that the hard
discounters do that set them apart. Number one, they've successfully broken the
connection between low price and low quality. When you go in there, you expect
low price and high quality. And secondly, they very cleverly use small packages to
increase the aﬀordability of premium products. These products still carry a high
penny margin and our premium products. So, what they've eﬀectively done is take
some of these premium products that would not be aﬀordable in their standard size
and that it reduced them in a limited size. So, those are the strong product proﬁt
contributors. Now let's take a look at the low cost operations ﬁrst variable costs.
And the variable costs are basically reduced by three factors. Number one, the
relatively high labor productivity and the entire store is designed to generate high
labor productivity from the display ready cases to the gravity feed in a lot of the
coolers and freezers. And something that isn't noticed very ready, but the next time
you go into our new stores, take a look and that is -- that there are multiple SKUs or
multiple diﬀerent items in the same shipping case, which actually is a tremendous
productivity for the warehousing and distribution function.
Minimal supply expenses are another characteristic of low variable cost, you have to
bring your own bags and that supplies can be 1% of the sales or more in a typical
supermarket and they use various devices to control the costs relative to cards those
losing them with a quarter deposit in the case of all the -- and controlling them on
the parking lot, which is sort of an energy or a insurance savings. And then lastly,
these stores are highly energy eﬃcient, the newer ones are all populated with LED
displays and all of the refrigerated zones are either covered or handled with doors.
In terms of the low cost for ﬁxed costs, these are leveraged by a couple of areas and
it's really facility costs being leveraged by a high sales per square foot. And that
leverage is enabled because of the limited nature of the assortment, 2,000 to 3,000
and so maybe 3,200 items, compared to 10 times that in a supermarket. And then
inventory, that basic investment in the inventory, does limit choice in the category,
but it also concentrates the volume in a particular category and a smaller number of
SKUs. So if you're in a typical supermarket, you may, for example, a peanut butter
have 30 items to choose from, there you are going to have four or ﬁve, but the same
volume that would go to 30 now, it goes to four or ﬁve and as a consequence, the
inventory turns much more quickly.
Looking to the future, there seems to be little question that hard discounter
economics and business models have evolved and we can expect them to continue
to evolve. The main focus here is driving sales without losing eﬃciency, that's a
delicate balance, it's not that easy to do. As a shopper in these stories, I've seen
increases in idle stock, not a lot but some. Certainly that wouldn't have happened a
decade ago. As well as an occasional pricing error, again not a lot, but it can happen.
So I think what's really going to happen here is that the rest of the grocery business
will be inﬂuenced by this new business model and it will continue evolve, so stay
tuned.
And that's it from me on how these stores make money.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15

Great. Well, thank you so much. We're going to turn things over now to Tim Barrett
and he's going to talk us through some of his perspectives from Euromonitor.
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Thanks, Jen for having me. Thanks, Bill for the wonderful informative intro into how
discounters actually make money and essentially how they work. And thank you all
for joining us today. Today what I'll be doing, at least from my brief intro before we
get into the round table component, is that, add a little bit of context to the
discussion. Now that we know how discounters work, we're going to take a look at
where they are growing? Why have they grown in the ﬁrst place? Who is primarily
responsible for this growth and a little bit about what you can do about it. If you are a
retailer, we are going to compete against them or you maybe partner or work with
the same retailers.
And before we get right into that, I'm just going to kind of tell you a little bit about
my company and where the data is coming from. In order to set this context, I'm
going to be looking at a lot of data and it comes from us, Euromonitor International.
Our biggest strength is easily our global coverage, in any countries with analysts on
the ground and each of them gathering the data, through their own networks in
addition and to kind of our top down regional hubs also doing a bunch of analysis
and work across countries.
So let's get into it. The ﬁrst question I want to kind of address is, where is this
happening and the idea here is to look at discounter sales and the lot of the
countries where they're growing the quickest. The countries are selected, which we'll
be looking out throughout the presentation are largely developed. There are some
discounter countries, that are pretty large and the developing countries like Poland.
Those countries are a little bit unique and don't deal with some -- they deal with
some kind of unique competitors unlike all the (inaudible). So we are kind of limiting
it to developed nations here.
And also for your reference, when you see the data played out in this presentation, I
will be using US dollars typically always held for 2016. So, inﬂation is taken out in the
picture with exchange rates also ﬁxed for 2016, because as you all know that dollar
has been getting pretty crazy. So if we take a look at discounter sales by country, we
will see that the US is not only kind of reached into the top here, but it's going to
grow really quickly. What this does leave out is one country which we'll be covering
later on which is Germany, the home of the discounters. I had actually take them out
of this chart, because they skew all the rest of the bottom ones to a place where you
can't read them. Germany, for those who are curious has about 73 billion to 80
billion in sales throughout this very same time period.
But sales alone aren't a good indicator of the true potential of the market. We need
to look at the share of total grocery sales from all discounters and when I say total
grocery, I mean independent to mom and pops in addition to major chain ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 19supermarkets, hypermarkets et cetera. And we'll see kind of in a historic contrast, in
USA which had quite a bit of sales, including a large kind of spike moving into the
forecast period. We see that actually fairly low penetration right here. The presence
of Walmart and a bunch of other retailers in highly competitive and a lack of really
aggressive expansion before this year has caused them to really not have a ton of
share here. Compared to other places, you'll see the -- easily the largest rising one is
the UK and the dark blue, but most notable is also Denmark and Germany, where
discounters have been active for 40 years or so. They also indicate kind of -- and
maybe a relative feeling, what might possibly the discounters, where -- in all these
countries, what could their share possibly be? If we take a look at where they have
been operating the longest and where they have been successful, we see deﬁnitely a
feeling on where that share could get to. And it's pretty substantial.
I'm sorry. So not only we know where they're happening, we want to know a little bit
why it's been happening that we've got three main reasons. The ﬁrst is that
recessionary spending habits are still in place. Here we're taking a look at growth
median [ph] household income, both in the last ﬁve years and ﬁve years before that.
The orange bar represents kind of when the recession happened and we see a lot of
ﬂat, sometimes negative growth with the exception of Australia. And then we take
from fast forward into the next ﬁve years and we see that while there is some growth
on an annual basis, it's super low and in some cases, even -- then Australia is at least
lower than it was during the global recession.
So not only there are psychological holdovers for not having any income growth, but
there are real economic impacts on that, that have not really moved the needle very
much, and because of that, people are looking for price and who can be good at
providing on price, but somebody that isn't, that is eﬃcient and Bill talked a lot
about this, so I won't stay too long on this side, but will just notice that taking unit
prices of discounters and the countries that we're covering right now and we'll see
that the ﬁrst two orange and dark blue bars represent sales per growth, sales per
square meter and sales per outlet, both pretty healthy and then that light blue is
square meters per outlet. So your stores -- stores space and your store sizes and
we'll see those are just typically much lower oftentimes in your ﬂat growth in the past
ﬁve years. So discounters can grow sales without having to grow their stores which is
not always the easiest thing to do, especially in the US.
And then ﬁnally, we have the fact that prices isn't the only thing that matters, quality
still matters and so I think the best comparison here is to compare discounters
versus the dollar stores or ﬁxed price stores to be more general. Here on the right,
we see this is a comparison of all the countries we've been taking a look at.
Discounter growth versus ﬁxed price store growth and while there is some
ﬂuctuation between the two, we'll see that largely discounters are doing a lot better
than dollar stores and they're competitive with the cost -- the fees. Discounters are
able to bring in high-quality private labels that are notable to people, unlike the kind
of more low quality fare that often times is associated with dollar stores. And it shows
in the sales and the growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 19So that is why discounters have grown then now we're going to take a quick look at
who are the global leaders and if you're here, you -- there is a good chance to
probably know that it's Aldi and Lidl. They are the two big dogs that are moving into
the US space here and they have been wreaking havoc in the UK and are based out
of Germany for many years now. We see -- I want to just kind of put them in context
of the rest of the space. While they are almost half of total discounter sales in 2016,
there are still decent amount companies, but none of them really gets anywhere
close to the share that they can get.
And what this means is that Aldi and Lidl are the big dogs, there maybe room for
competition, especially if there is a lot more room for penetration rates of the
discount model to increase. But we do want to take a little bit of a closer look at the
both Aldi and Lidl, because they are the most important players in the space and
almost deﬁnitely will be in the future. So we're just going to take a quick at the
countries that they operate, most importantly and it looks like we've got a little bit of
the formatting thing here, so I apologize for that.
It's a lot of Western Europe essentially, that last one they are below 5% I believe is
the US. And it's basically Western Europe. They have a few Eastern Europe and
Australia is also present here which is diﬀerent than Lidl, which I just talked you
through it. But we see that in the countries where they are bigger, they do have a
signiﬁcant share of value sales. But the main point here is that Western Europe and a
couple of other developed countries like Australia and the US are fairly is -- or where
they play and they have that kind of developed nation expertise.
Lidl is a little diﬀerent. They actually while they do play in some of the same places
like the UK and they are moving into the US, that's not -- that hasn't historically been
their focus. Their focus as you can see is more Eastern Europe. This includes brands
that aren't necessarily the legal banners but owned by the same company Schwartz
and you can see that they have a little bit more expertise in moving into developing
countries, countries where they typically are able to gain greater share because they
can come into a country where this model really appeals and there is less high
caliber proposition and they can steal a lot more share out of these countries. And
that doesn't mean they're not playing in the UK and under developed countries as
we all know. UK I believe it's at about 5% share, but it's just -- their focus has
historically been developing countries.
And so that's what's happening and that's too is kind of make leaving the charge. I
just want to go through a little bit and provide some data backed anecdotes on what
you can do about it. And the ﬁrst kind of share here -- slide here is just sort of kind of
a cautionary tale and what happens when you don't do anything. And that happened
in the UK, it's pretty well known that the discounters caught everybody there on the
layers [ph] when the recession hit and then all the middle market players have been
struggling to catch up sense. We can see that in the top four shares, which are the
actual top four players in the UK grocery space and we see all of them pretty much
losing share, Sainsbury's is mostly ﬂat, thanks to kind of a more service based
positioning, but everybody else not doing too hot.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 19Jennifer Bartashus
Tim Barrett
Jennifer BartashusAnd then we look at the next kind of -- next up of the topic, and we see Aldi and Lidl
really doing very well for themselves, as doing the most share. John Lewis, the only
actual supermarket, that's been able to kind of grow and has been doing so on the
back of high quality goods, the good sag into our ﬁrst kind of competitive strategy,
which is creating a competitive merchandizing mix.
And under -- the German market is the best market to look at for this, that -- as the
discounters have been operating there for years now. Edeka is the largest
supermarket there and is now the largest actual grocer as of 2008. They've been
able to surmount their competition by actually oﬀering the same types of low quality
or -- sorry high quality low price private label ranges, but they also put these
alongside higher quality goods and services like bakeries, delis et cetera that you
would expect out of a supermarket. So they have everything that discount shoppers
want, but they also have everything that may be more selective shoppers want and
are able to get more people on the stores to do that.
Another good way to focus is to create a more eﬃcient store format. We see here
Walmart's sales growth in the past ﬁve years by format, both of the blue ones
represent their merchandisers, which are the regular Walmarts with no food, are --
with a little bit of packaged food but no fresh food. And then hypermarkets would
sell [ph] kind of everything, hypermarkets have seen positive sales growth, which is
why you see them kind of little bit higher. They're just about as suﬃcient on a sales
per square meter basis, which is the ex-access [ph] and they are notable - -notably
larger as -- that when we look at the bubbles.
The supermarkets, their Neighborhood Expresses are actually notably better both in
eﬃciency and sales growth even though that's because they're coming from a
smaller base they've been able to do this by focusing on smaller goods or smaller
and more popular goods like fresh food and they are able to get into the cities by
having those smart format, which has always been a big thing for Walmart. And then
our ﬁnal example here is just to create more scale, this is what happening in the US,
notably in the past 10 years as we see a lot of competitors merging, a lot of high
proﬁle mergers and able to gain more bargaining power with everybody in the
supply chain including the brands, which is very important.

please do so at the right of your screen. And we're going to move now into a
conversation and to a discussion about some of the trends that we've mentioned soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 19Bill Bishop
Tim Barrett
Jennifer Bartashus
Tim Barrettfar. So let's talk about the seriousness of the threat that the hard discount poses to
the food retail industry. Why did these retailers pose a threat? Who is most at risk?
And why is now the time to take the discounters seriously. Bill, do you want weigh in?
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
Sure, let me start with that. Why are they a threat. I think that the answer is you could
tell that from my opening remarks that the hard discount business model is
inherently more eﬃcient than the massive supermarket model that we've lived with
for 50 years. So they basically deliver products at a lower cost and consequently
lower price. In the light of some of the demographics that Tim shared with us, you
can ﬁnd -- you can understand why that's compelling. Who is at risk, the
undiﬀerentiated store that is the stores that are basically shop because they're
convenience -- that's the -- they're convenient, that's the only reason to go there. As
well as those stores that appeal primarily on low price, but can't match the prices of
the hard discounters.
So that means a lot of the sort of the softer discounters would be vulnerable and
then that why now? I think if we step back and look all these and a lot of major
markets and they're as is well recognized involved in a major revitalization of their
stores triggered by the concern for Lidl. So they're busy disrupting quite a few
stores. Lidl has come to town with stores that are bigger than most of what they run
around the world, 38,000 square feet, that's close to a typical supermarket and so
the experience that both of these stores are oﬀering frankly is getting closer to the
US customers experience shopping supermarkets. So it's like a supermarket but with
a lot lower price.
Tim would you want to add on that?
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah, that's a great answer, not a ton to add. I guess as if Bill covered most of the
supply side kind of arguments, I'll just cover the demand and sort of what people are
really looking for and obviously, it's they're claiming for ways to stretch their dollars
still. And discounters are oﬀering that next to their ﬁnely tuned private label. That
doesn't really sacriﬁce the quality that people used to expect out of store brands and
they're starting to realize that maybe paying for all the name brands isn't always
worth it and that they don't have to sacriﬁce on quality for a lower price and because
discounters can oﬀer more for less. They're going to -- they've been doing well and
they are going to keep doing well as they expand even more aggressively.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Alright, great and let's see, a next question could the hard discounters achieve the
same sort of penetration levels that we -- in the US that we've seen in Europe? So
why don't you start this oﬀ with that.
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 19Bill Bishop
Jennifer BartashusYeah, this is a great question. Lot of nuance here and I think the main reason for that
is Europe doesn't have Walmart and Walmart is such a low price leader in the US. It's
got such a lock down on certain towns, certain -- like whole kind of counties, in some
parts of the nation that, they really got a competitive mode around them in some of
these areas and they've got such a scale here that they've got the ability to compete
on price a little bit better than a lot of the European discounters. Also -- we also have
grocers here that are not actually -- that are ﬁghting back already. There is the high
proﬁle -- or not -- that the slightly high proﬁle, if you follow the Kroger case where
they've been suing Lidl for some of the names of their private label brands. Well, that
seems to be more a delay tactic than anything else that shows that the grocers here
are willing to put up a ﬁght. They have a lot of scale as of recent years and they are
expanding into more private label and kind of a greater range of store brands and
higher quality brands. So the competition here is a lot tighter. So I don't think we'll
necessarily see the penetration get to as high as that is in Europe. That being said,
discounters do eat at the edges, and they are becoming a lot closer to what US
consumers expect out of the store, but with lower prices like Bill just talked about. So
I imagine they still have a great amount of share to get to, because they're only at
about 3% nowadays. They could easily get up to 10, I think. But we'll see, it will be
interesting no matter what. That will deﬁnitely grow.
Bill what do you think?
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
Well, I have a lot of respect for all the numbers that you've got and your experience,
but I'm coming at it a little diﬀerently. I am seeing the hard discounters actually grow
share thoroughly signiﬁcantly more in the US than you're expecting. Mainly there is
an interaction at two things here, one is the low price which we ﬂog pretty strongly.
The other is frankly something that it's been hard for me to appreciate and I think
hard for many people on the call to appreciate and that is that there are millions and
millions of US households who have experienced no income growth or even
negative income growth over the last x-number of years and these folks may or may
not be buying paycheck to paycheck, the low grocery prices appeal to a signiﬁcant
fraction of those.
Kind of interpreting slightly on the response side was huge sensitivity, I do not think
that Walmart will be able to compete long-term on a price basis with the hard
discounters. They will be very successful, but not because they compete with the
hard discounters. So, I'm willing to suggest and Tim, will have to meet on this
sometime in a couple of years, but the share of hard discounters could actually
approach 20% sometime in the future here in the US, given the demographics and
the nature of our competition, but the time will tell.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
All right. And I guess, so I would throw out to both of you, what are the strengths and
weaknesses of Aldi and Lidl? And can you summarize some of the changes that
they've done in order to compete in the US environment and how that format
threatens grocers? Bill, do you want to grab that one?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15

Tim Barrett{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
Sure. On the strengths and weaknesses, strengths, low prices and shoppable,
smaller shoppable stores, a lot of people like that small size. Weaknesses, limited
access to advertised brands. There is no question that, that holds some back. And
there is a requirement for heavier customer participation, particularly in the checkout
process. I think you asked a little bit about changes they were making as well. I think
the -- this is where semantics can get very diﬃcult. Hard discounters are hard
discounters, but they are oﬀering around -- they are oﬀering a softer shopping
experience in the case of both Aldi and Lidl. And I think that's what is making them
closer to the US supermarket shopping experience. But I guess Tim has got some
additional thoughts on this as well.
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah, I would say that -- I would have started oﬀ with -- especially if you'd have asked
me a few years ago, stores just aren't quite as nice. But that is something they're
actively working on. So I think that only be a weakness for so long as they move kind
of a little bit to the softer discount model. I think another weakness that is also
temporary, is just the fact that the brand and the model -- the brands and the models
are still largely unfamiliar to shoppers. They got to be a little bit more aggressive with
our advertising and making sure people know about maybe kind of the lack of
personnel and how the stores organized and what you might expect to ﬁnd. So just a
familiarization, will take a little bit of time, but I also think that, that's more of a short-
term weakness than anything else. And you cover kind of the main weakness. I think
one other also minor but interesting strength is that a lot of these while they focus on
grocery, they have a really cool non-foods sections that rotate real quickly.
I mean you talked about turnover and these things move in a -- of sometimes weekly
basis and but there are always really good deals and I often hear when people talk
about them in a way that evokes someone like T.J. Maxx ask kind of appeal where
there's is a treasure hunting vibe. We never really know what's going to be in there. I
know I've gone in the stores one day and they've got lawn care equipment and then
on the next day, they had a really cheap LCD TV and some kitchenwares. So all that
stuﬀ moves really quickly and kind of creates an interesting competitive advantage.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
All right. So let's talk a little bit about quality perception. So the quality perception of
private label brands and the adoption of the multi-tiered oﬀerings has really
changed consumer acceptance of these products. What does this mean for hard
discount growth and the opportunity here in the US? Tim, do you want to think -- you
want to give any thoughts?
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
I'll do, Jen. I think the usage of private label for them is huge, particularly now, that
they are really striking on the iron hot here. Store brand Stigma is a fraction of what itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15

Bill Bishopused to be and I think a big thing we can attribute this to is the kind of move towards
fantasy brands. For those that are unaware fantasy brands are -- they are private
labels just like a store brand but they're called something else. A good example is
like Nice! at Walgreens are the farms [ph] they target where their private labels and
all the -- there are store brands in other names. And sometimes people don't even
know they're buying a private label and then they buy it and then they realize it's
actually pretty good and then they keep on buying it whether or not they learn that
it's from the store itself. And Aldi and Lidl have been doing this for decades. And
they're able to get past kind of -- this is helping move us past the store brand stigma
and now that people have been buying these and realizing that the odds are pretty
or -- that the goods are pretty at quality -- high quality. They continuing to buy them
more as private level penetration increases and just kind of are going to ride that
wave to greater share and a greater growth in the US.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Bill, did you have any thoughts on that?
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
I think Tim has set it on. I totally agree.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
All right. So what about national brands? So what sort of role do the national brands
play and are there longer term ramiﬁcations on national brands and their
manufacturers as a result of the growth in hard discount. Bill, what do you think?
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
Well, in terms of the role they play today, it's pretty interesting and of course we had
the chance really to have studied Aldi more than Lidl. But in the case of Aldi, they
have been included to ﬁll unique needs product niches that really were very diﬃcult
to satisfy otherwise and might prompt a customer to go to another store to buy the
brand. So they're ﬁlling unique needs. They also provide a really nice role in terms of
illustrating the price advantage as the hard discounter. We've seen one question
come through here on soft drinks. And in the case of soft drinks, again I'm going to
concentrate on Aldi because we see more about it.
There seems to be an exclusive arrangement from a brand point of view between
Coca Cola and Aldi and they're probably are if Coca Cola has 50 diﬀerent items in
packages in their red and black and white labels, there maybe three or four max in
the Aldi store, all at a decent price but not a great savings that all making the private
label looks extremely attractive. Now, longer term, we believe that consumer-centric
orientation as a retailer and for your own label private label or fantasy label are -- is
going to take considerable share more than it has so far, more than private label has
so far from name brands, and the eﬀect of this will be to undermine the nature of the
business relationship between the national or name brands and the traditional
grocers. And as I said relationship, that ﬁnancial relationship is undermined. Frankly,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15

Tim Barrettboth will become less inﬂuences in the market, at least that's where we see it right
now. Tim?
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah, that's a -- that's pretty great. You mentioned soft drinks. I think there is a really
good anecdote that I believe -- along with you Bill that private label still has a great
deal of share to gain. But there are a few rockstar brands and particular categories
that may be able to weather this storm. And in fact, actually make the kind of
partnership with discounters a little bit more complicated. Soft drinks is one of those.
There is actually a good anecdote from Europe where Lidl actually de-listed Coke
products in the middle of a price war in order to get their prices lower and were
actually forced due to customer reaction to bring Coke back. Probably not at as
good of terms as they would have liked after shortly de-listing them.
So it is possible to be a little bit more independent on a few brands. I think the focus
of the world are one, you know Gatorade, I know is pretty -- pretty prominent in
some of these stores as well. Certain candies, as well hold a great deal of brand
strength and if they're able to get into non-food home care, we know Tide is often
extremely diﬃcult to unseat in any capacity, if you don't have Tide, you're going to
have a tough time selling laundry detergent. So while they're going to eat quite a bit
of share from the many, many brands that are out there, there will be a few brands
that will have the bargaining power needed to maybe get into the stores as they
expand a little bit, stay in the stores.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
All right, so with all of this, on your -- all of this context, how do retailers create a
winning strategy against the hard discounts threat? Now what can the Krogers, the
Walmarts, the Albertsons, Ahold Delhaize in US, what can they do? Tim do you have
any thoughts?
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah. I'll kind of reiterate because I think it's worth repeating the three main points
that I talked about at the end of my presentation. The ﬁrst is creating a competitive
and comprehensive merchandising mix. You need private labels that can compete
on cost and quality with discounters, but as a supermarket or hypermarket you can
use your extra space and scale to also provide value-added services and products
that are of higher quality, in a more premium level and you can even provide
services like Walmart is looking to roll out Click and Collect a lot more aggressively
this year and in the future. And that's something that discounters are just going to
have hard time doing. And then you can diﬀerentiate yourself, because like Bill said,
you can't beat them at their own game. You're going to have a tough time
competing on price alone and doing so like some of the discounters or some of the
supermarkets in the UK have been doing, just won't work.
The other two points are focusing on eﬃcient models, smaller store formats, not only
are more shoppable and make you focus on goods that have a lot higher turnover.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15

Bill BishopBut they also let you get into better areas and more urban areas, where we know a
lot of the growth was coming out of these days. And then ﬁnally creating scale
oftentimes through mergers and acquisition can really improve your bargain power
with everybody else that you're working within the supply chain.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
And Bill do you have any thought?
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
Just a couple to build on this. I think the traditional retailers need as Tim suggests to
avoid directly competing with the hard discounters in some respects, the poor
ﬁnancial performance of at least some of the UK chains, I think were attributable to --
was attributable to sort of self-inﬂicted wounds in terms of maybe losing control of
their pricing as they compete at simultaneously with both the hard discounters and
the challenge of eCommerce, both coming out and at the same time.
So the trick I think is to maintain control of your pricing while accomplishing some of
the goals we're talking about. The other point and it's been raised in a question here
is whether a retail -- how a traditional retailer can put together the product mix, that
will give them the prices that the discounters like, I love the way you said that Tim
and everything else that the non-discount customers are looking for. Tim, you
pointed out that that's true for Edeka and actually it's true for the hypermarkets in
Finland as well. So we do have examples of where people have used a mix, and
that's really another way of saying how they keep control to their business model. So
just a slight build on what Tim had.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Wonderful and I guess so, since already on this on this topic a little bit, what about
other small format stores? So we saw some of the data that stores are kind of
shrinking in size or that they're growing in popularity and that a lot of the chain --
larger chain operators are either running some of these smaller stores or
experimenting with them. How does those concepts compete with the hard
discount? Bill, do you just want to continue with your thoughts there?
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
Yeah, I'd be happy to. So I think the small store format for the most part, won't
compete directly. It's a little like this complementary competition instead consumers
will use the small formats to the kind of round out their needs, so they go to Sprouts
for produce and Earth Fare to natural and organic products. The dollar stores and
the drug stores however are both going to need to make signiﬁcant changes in their
assortment and pricing to be able to operate successfully in markets where there is a
growing and active presence of hard discounters. That said, convenient stores are
probably going to stay the course, they're on an immediate consumption orientation
and doing very well, thanks very much. So there will be a split decision relative to the
small stores kind of dividing out. I think along those lines, Tim?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15

Bill Bishop{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah, I don't really have a thing to add to that. I think Bill covered it pretty well.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Okay, great. And so are there any retailers right now who are trying to do this
themselves and have they had any success in trying? Tim, any thoughts?
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean there are a few, discount type experiments that have been going on,
some of them still exist, some that have been sold. I don't think there is anything
particularly notable because nobody has been really able to compete with them
directly in a manner that makes us feel like they might be in the game for one of the
leading discounters in the US in the future. That being said, I think we are seeing
kind of more small format experiments that take a diﬀerent tack and have more of a
competitive diﬀerentiation. I think a good example there, well, a big one, of course is
Walmart's Neighborhood Express that's their supermarket, Ahold and Wal [ph] it's
not particularly innovative, it is growing at a pretty high clip in areas where you don't
see a ton of Walmarts. And another more innovative small format, I think is Ahold
Delhaize's Be Fresh, which is very small, not -- it's only in the Boston area still, but it's
the kind of store that is focused on eCommerce, focused on delivery, focused on
trying to draw dollars from city-dwelling millennials that want to take out and the
delivery that the convenience that they are kind of often known for. And the whole
thing is kind of themed around that purpose, along with fresh food. So taking I think
competition will come less from grocers, creating their own discounters and maybe
more from creating their own interest in maybe smaller format experiments.
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
You know I see something similar happening because it's done hard to replicate the
model we've described. We see Kroger has a small eﬀort going with their Ruler
Stores and the only example that I can think of that has survived all of these many
years is the no-frill hard discounters operated in Canada by Loblaws. They were
created, I'm going to say back in the early 80s and have become a signiﬁcant player
in the Canadian market. So if one is looking for a hard discounter operated by a
traditional retailer, that might be a place to look.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Wondewrful. Thank you. And then we can not address everything else that's going
on, it's a big theme in food retail. So what is the potential for hard discounters to
become even bigger disruptors by joining the online evolution, whether it's through
Click and Collect delivery or partnerships with Instacart or things like that? What do
you think Bill?
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 15 of 19Tim Barrett
Jennifer BartashusWell, I think I have to admit, I was surprised as yesterday's announcement was
Instacart's pilot partnership with Aldi but I also think it makes huge sands. We know
that both Aldi and Lidl have fairly signiﬁcant online grocery operations in other parts
of the world and they sell wine and related products as well, sort of looking to the
periphery Amazon has signaled the need for a physical presence to accelerate their
growth was Amazon Go and now the purchase of Whole Foods, so I think it's entirely
possible that we will see even more mergers to move in this direction. I wouldn't
publish it as a headline yet. But Amazon buying Save-A-Lot is not inconceivable,
where the two will converge. Ultimately, all of the research we do shows us that
almost every household wants to go both ways on this. They what some online
shopping opportunities and they deﬁnitely want the low prices they can score at the
hard discounters. So I think this convergence is going to be inevitable and probably
faster than what we might think. Tim?
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks Bill. And this is kind of funny because for those listening, we've been
talking about this as we prep for this webinar and I've historically been pretty bearish
on discounters getting into the online space outside of -- maybe a few of the higher
margin things that they've done elsewhere like selling wine over the Internet. It's
because the model is so tight and eﬃcient already and they have got other
problems like making their stores nicer and making sure that people know what they
are and who they are and what they do.
In the US, that I always thought online wasn't going to really be a focus. They don't
have the money for it, they don't have the personnel. I mean the whole point of the
model itself is that, just as many people working in the stores you need and as we
know, creating online grocery opportunities outside of that typically involves more
investment in personnel and that's going to raise prices and that's just not part of the
discounter game plan. So I've always been pretty bearish on it -- but then yesterday
it rolls around and we see all of these high profounders of them partnering with
Instacart and that kind of throws my whole world view skew a little bit.
I think this is what makes the most sense for them because they're partnering with a
company and they are able to oﬄoad a lot of the cost as online grocery, in that
manner and it give Aldi a really good kind of high-proﬁle partner, another high
proﬁle partner or Instacart gets them [ph] that. So they may be moving into some
things a little bit faster than I've thought. I still don't think they're going to be running
out their own services like, that -- Walmart is doing with its Drive Thrus or Kroger with
its ClickList. But if they can ﬁnd some partners that are willing to make a deal with
them, at the -- when the price is right, which from our eﬀorts from talking to brands is
when you talk to discounters and started work with discounters, the price always has
to be right. So I think yeah, people like Instacart, maybe other hyper local delivery
company is to work with them, then we may see it a little bit faster than I even
thought.

Bill BishopAll right. And a question for both of you is have -- do we have any idea at this point
how successful Lidl has been in terms of sales in the US, or what to expect?
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
Tim, you can take the lead on that.
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah, I can jump in on that one. I have heard within the industry estimates of around
10 million in a store for 2017, which would put them this, they get to where they need
to be at or around almost a little bit a less than 500 million for 2017, which would be
substantial because that's actually about what a little bit less than what Kroger's Ruler
Foods is predicted to do this year as well. So that was -- that kind of shows you a little
bit how traditional grocers in US struggle to compete on this model.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
And I guess as a follow up to that. Oh, sorry, go ahead Bill, please.
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
I was just going to say 10 million a store is a big number if your store is still in this
under 40,000 square foot range in terms of sales per square foot. And Tim has a lot
of sales per meter and so forth data, we ﬁnd a very strong correlation between sales
per whatever it is, square foot or square meter and proﬁtability. So getting to the 10
million I have to say that's quite successful from a ﬁnancial point of view.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Thank you Bill and just as a kind of a follow along to that, do you see that they have
the ability to really sort of run at a loss for a little while at Lidl until they hit a certain
threshold for their store base in the US and do you have any thoughts on what sort
of store base they may be able to achieve in the next year or two? Do either of you
have any thoughts on that?
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}
Well, both the hard discounters are investing. One of the amazing things to me
about Aldi over of the 40 years, they were in the United States is that probably 25 of
those 40 years at least, their growth was ﬁnanced almost completely by organic
proﬁtability. Obviously, recently there's been a tremendous infusion of debt and I
think that makes huge ﬁnancial sense and it's going to be a while before Lidl who
has built oﬃces and TCs [ph] and so forth, so are going to be able to have the scaleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15

Bill Bishopto cover those overhead costs. I think I'm going to defer to Tim however in terms of
the kind of the projected growth is probably a lot closer than I'm to that.
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah, I've got some pretty quality projections here for actual store counts. In 2017, we
have seen 3,500 actual hard discount outlets, here in the US and as they're
continuing to pick up expansion in the next ﬁve years, so by 2022, we actually expect
that to increase to a little bit over 5,000. And to put that in perspective, that's an
increase of 1500 over the next ﬁve years, whereas over the last ﬁve years have seen
an increase of only about 500. So that ties into, we were seeing organic growth
largely and it was pretty slow, but now, the game is on and the expansion has picked
up at a notable pace, which is partially fueled by that like those I've been talking
about.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you very much. Tim, this one might be a little bit more
for you. Among the US conventional grocers, is there anyone who is similar to Edeka
in Germany, which has been able to thrive even with Aldi and Lidl in the mix? Do you
know anything about the German players or is that something you can comment on?
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, the question is who -- who has been able to compete in the US much
like Edeka has and I don't know, I mean one of the discounts -- I mean, all these --
really the ﬁrst thing you got to look at and their main base of operations has been
that west and I don't know if we have anybody quite like Edeka, Mariano's kind of
brings to mind and they really do come in within pretty decent brands and a lot of
value-added services and things like Oyster Bars et cetera that everybody really
loves. But I don't know if they are as strong on the private label with the Brownies
brands. But I would say Kroger, I was actually just about to say Kroger good, good,
good job. They don't compete quite as directly and you see them -- you see this
because they're starting to be more aggressive when it comes Lidl moving into their
territory, although they do have some things like in Indiana with Kroger. So I would
say that the most applicable kind of equivalent to Edeka would probably be Kroger,
because they have the more high tier private label, but they also have a lot of the
value-added services like Kroger's ClickList which is their Click and Collect and even
their Harris-Teeter banners which are of a little bit higher quality.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
All right. Wonderful. And we have one last question as we wrap it up for today. Has
the average discount shopper changed overtime meaning, have we seen there a
change in who it is that's actually going into these hard discount stores? Bill, do you
have any idea?
{BIO 19198031 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-08-15
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 18 of 19Jennifer Bartashus
Tim Barrett
Jennifer Bartashus
Bill BishopYeah, the research that we do tells us that they have deﬁnitely changed. There's been
a common interest regardless of demographics and satisfaction derived from buying
groceries inexpensively, getting at good price. But and even 20 years ago, you see
that at parking lot of a novelties store in many areas of the United States and see the
full range of automobiles from luxury down to clunkers.
So I think what's happened is more middle Americans have experienced the
advantage, the price advantage and are probably shopping and will continue to
shop the hard discounters on a ﬁll in basis, which is consistent with the way
customers are shopping today used to be just a couple three stores max, now it's
ﬁve or six and it's easy to see how the population of shoppers will expand into the
middle income as the hard discounters become part of their kind of portfolio of
store choice.
So it's combination of what -- the changing shopping patterns, multiple stores and a
broader cross-section of middle-income America. I want to come back to this notion
of income not raising, I -- depending on how you look at the US income numbers, it's
harder to see or easier to see. But there is at least half and it's probably approaching
60% of the population, who is really stressed from an economic point of view, not all,
but some fraction of those folks are going to ﬁnd these stores attractive. So the
customers are changing, because quite frankly, the demand base in the United
States is diﬀerent. We didn't have this problem 10 years ago, or even ﬁve years ago.
And I would deﬁne it as a social problem. And the only other thing I would add is I
think Meijers and Grand Rapids, Michigan is another one to think about as, as you
compare with Edeka.
{BIO 1827328 <GO>}
Thank you. Tim did you have anything else you wanted to add in on that?
{BIO 20763677 <GO>}
No, really no. I think when Bill is right, he's right and I think he's been.
