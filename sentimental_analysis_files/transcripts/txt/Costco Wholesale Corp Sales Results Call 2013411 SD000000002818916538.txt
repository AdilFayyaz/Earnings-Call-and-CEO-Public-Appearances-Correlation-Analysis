Monday, March 4 and ended on Sunday, April 7.
For comparable sales results, this ﬁve-week period is compared to the same ﬁve-
week period last year, speciﬁcally Monday, March 5 through Sunday, April 8.

ﬁscal year-to-date reporting periods were as follows. In the US, the ﬁve weeks was at
plus 5%, 31 weeks plus 6%; international, the ﬁve weeks was at plus 2%, 31 weeks
plus 6%. For the total Company, ﬁve weeks was at plus 4%. And the 31 weeks was at
plus 6%.
Changes in both gasoline prices year over year and FX had a negative impact on the
comparable sales for the ﬁve-week March reporting period. Conversely, gasoline
and FX still had a positive impact on the 31-week reporting period.
Excluding these eﬀects, comparable sales were as follows. In the US, the ﬁve weeks
was at plus 6%, 31 weeks plus 5%; international, ﬁve weeks was at plus 5%, 31 weeks
plus 5%; and for the total Company, ﬁve weeks plus 6%. And 31 weeks plus 5%.
In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights for the
month of March was as follows. On a regional and country basis, the US regions with
the strongest results were Texas, Southeast, San Diego and the Northwest. On an
international basis, in local currencies we saw the strongest results in Canada,
Mexico and Australia.
When we do our merchandise highlights, the following comparable sales results by
category exclude the negative eﬀective of foreign exchange. Food & Sundries'
comparable sales for the month were in the mid single-digit range. Within Food &
Sundries, the departments with the strongest results were cooler, liquor, deli and
sundries. We experienced a slight amount of inﬂation in Food & Sundries compared
to last year.
Comp sales results for Hardlines were up mid single digits. Better performing
departments were hardware, consumer electronics, automotive. And health and
beauty.
Softlines experienced positive comp sales results in the high single-digit range.
Better performing departments within Softlines include small appliances, jewelry and
domestics, all with double-digit comp increases.
Fresh Foods experienced positive comp results in the mid to high single-digit range
for the month. Produce and service deli experienced the strongest results. Fresh
Foods was slightly deﬂationary for the month.
Within the Ancillary businesses, hearing aids, photo lab and optical showed the best
sales results. For gasoline, the average selling price per gallon was $3.71 this year,
compared to $3.93 last year. Overall gasoline price deﬂation had a negative impact
approximately minus 0.75% on March comp sales. Comp gallons continued to be up
year over year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-11

Page 3 of 3Weakening foreign currencies year over year, relative to the US dollar, resulted in a
detriment to our reporting March comp sales of a little more than minus 0.75%. Total
international comps for the ﬁve-week period came in at plus 5% in local currency.
But resulted in a reported comp of plus 2% when converted to the US dollar.
The average transaction decrease year over year in March -- I'm sorry, the average
transaction decreased year over year in March by approximately minus 1%, which
included the minus 1.5% negative impact from foreign exchange and gasoline price
deﬂation. Without these impacts, the average transaction would have been positive.
Comparable traﬃc frequency was up a little over plus 5%. Cannibalization for the
month of March had a negative impact to total Company comparable sales of a little
over minus (0.5%). Much of the cannibalization is stemming from recent openings in
Asia.
Looking ahead, April sales will include 28 selling days for both years. The reporting
period will end on Sunday, May 5 and will be compared to the four weeks ended
Sunday, May 6 last year. We plan to announce April sales on Thursday, May 9, 2013.
