Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining. I think we've saved many of the best presenters
for last.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
So Rajesh Jha, from Microsoft, we're really excited to have you with us today. He
joined Microsoft in 1990. Actually, shortly after that, I became a Microsoft developer
and that's how I got into this business. So not exactly the same path. But thank you to
Microsoft for helping out early on. You report directly to Satya.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
I do.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Running the Oﬃce business. A really important role and big business. Maybe just tell
us a little bit about to kickoﬀ. And before I start, I have to wear my IR hat, which -- just
in terms of forward-looking statements Microsoft may make, you need to look at the
SEC ﬁlings and the website for potential disclosures. If you need any of those
disclosures, Microsoft's representatives here in the front row. They'll hand those out
to you. So just in terms of the disclosures.

Q - Brent Thill
A - Rajesh JhaSo with that, maybe just tell us a little bit about your journey from 1990 to now.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Sure. I mean how much time do we have? I mean I came Microsoft straight out of
school, like you said, Brent, in 1990. I thought I was going to be there a couple of
years.
But it was great to actually be there these early days when -- I mean the vision was
incredibly bold; to democratize computing and put a computer on every desk and
every home. That was not as obvious as it seems today. I know we forgot to say
computer in every pocket. But you get the idea. It was about democratizing
computing.
And I've been in and around Oﬃce; so, working on product to really
communications, collaboration, cloud services. And actually, speciﬁcally the clouds
services for more than a decade. The last ﬁve years, I've been working on and
leading the Oﬃce 365 eﬀort for Microsoft, which brought together all the diﬀerent
teams in Oﬃce. But also Azure and the Windows guys.
Then, in my new role, as the Executive Vice President for Oﬃce Product Group, I'll
lead all things Oﬃce; the product, services, experiences.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Oﬃce is a big banner for many things.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
It is.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Can you just help us unpack what's in that Oﬃce box?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Sure. Yes, sure. I mean I think the heart of Oﬃce is what people perceive as the
product that runs on their desktops today; Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook,
OneNote. But you know now Oﬃce, of course, exists on all the platforms, whether it
be iOS, Android, Mac, Web.
But Oﬃce is more than just the client experiences or user experiences. We've got a
bunch of services or back-end servers for services, cloud-hosted. And these are
Exchange providing enterprise mail and calendaring, Yammer providing enterprise
social. You've got SharePoint doing portals and team collaboration, Skype that does
conferencing and meetings and voice. Then we've added Microsoft Teams.
So the best way to think about Oﬃce is it's all experiences, end to end, that run on all
the devices and delivered either on-prem or in the cloud. And the thing that we'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 16Q - Brent Thill
A - Rajesh Jha
Q - Brent Thill
A - Rajesh Jhadone now is expanded Oﬃce even more into areas like security and analytics and
voice and so on. So it's a lot of things, like you said.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
There's been a lot of changes just in terms of the product. There's also been a lot of
change, at least from our perception, in the culture. And with Satya coming in now
and running, can you just talk about how things have changed and what you've felt,
maybe over the last couple years, as he's taken the head leadership role?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes, sure. I mean I think Satya did a really good job when he came into his role. He
ﬁrst spent some time building deep conviction about our unique mission and our
sensibility. Because you've got to start there and then ﬁgure out the culture that gets
you towards that mission.
And so, I think we have a bold mission today; empowering every individual, every
organization, to achieve more to get to their best potential. So you start with that
clarity then you ﬁgure out; what are the ambitions? So what are our strategic thrusts
that get us there?
And so, from a culture perspective, I would say perhaps the biggest impact was
bringing the mindset, a learning mindset or a growth mindset, where it's about
being humble, it's about being open-minded, about it's being intellectually curious,
trying stuﬀ, not being afraid to fail, learn quickly from failure. That was a pretty big
shift. It seems really an obvious thing for us to do. But it was a pretty big shift that he
brought to the table. Then, brought a much sharper perspective on customer
obsession, being connected to the customer.
Then, I would say under his leadership, the third aspect I would add is, probably
more than ever before, working as One Microsoft. So building on each other and
getting the eﬃciencies from that. And as you guys know, things, the business models
change so quickly, technology changes so quickly that you've got to have a resilient
culture. And so, I do feel pretty good about where we are today.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
When you think about this big move that you've had to the cloud, tell us about this
journey. Tell us about kind of where you think you are, what's ahead. There's
obviously a hybrid world that you guys are still envisioning. But how do we think
about the balance between the cloud and the on-prem world?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Well I mean, for many years now, we have been all-in on the cloud. And for a bunch
of diﬀerent reasons; the rate of innovation. Now you have Microsoft investing in
upgrade, migration, deployment and you take the friction away from customers to
get to your newest stuﬀ. So the rate of innovation. The ability to provide the best user
experiences because your customers all lit up today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Q - Brent Thill
A - Rajesh JhaThe ability of democratizing the availability for product. So SMBs, small and medium
businesses, where I described Oﬃce as being so many things, it's super hard for a
small business to go put all of that together. And with the cloud delivery you make
that possible for them to actually to get to the same experiences that a big
enterprise might get to. So there's a lot of stuﬀ that is amazing about the cloud and
we are all-in.
But the reality is customers are going to have diﬀerent constraints on how fast they
can move to a cloud. We have some customers that say, '"Hey I would like this
regulated entity inside my organization to stay on-prem and everybody else can
move to the cloud.'" So they think about hybrid, set up some more on a user basis or
a department basis or a site oﬃce basis. There are other customers that say, '"You
know, great. Let's get calendaring and mail and conferencing delivered from the
cloud. But I want to keep my portals on-prem.'" So the Oﬃce 365 will let you do
hybrid that way too.
So I mean, look, if you're in the business of serving enterprises, you know one size
doesn't ﬁt all. So we want to provide the best possible stuﬀ in the cloud. But we have
and we fully support hybrid conﬁgurations both in Oﬃce 365 and Azure. And so, we
continue to build on-premise versions of our product. The reality is our cloud
versions are getting progressively richer and richer. And so, the gap does exist. But
we are servicing our on-prem customers as well.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Back to your one size doesn't ﬁt all. You've also taken diﬀerent SKUs in Oﬃce and
given basic low-level features. I subscribe to Oﬃce 365 for $9.99, I believe, or $10
roughly a month. I don't have the enterprise E5 SKU, which I think brings the price
point up to $35 per user per month with a lot of new feature sets. Can you just talk
about how you think about the go to market in terms of the availability? And I think
E5 is relatively new. How is that doing?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. No. It's a great question. So with Oﬃce 365 we have, I would say, a very, very
competitive product with e-communication, collaboration, security, infrastructure for
all our customers. And for enterprises, we call that E1. And it is our best set of
experiences. We think that's an area we'll continue to add value all the time. So like
we recently launched Microsoft Teams and that's available in E1. So we are
committed to our E1 customers, our broadest tank.
But one of the great things that we've seen happen with our business is how
customers have opted in, into our premium SKUs. E3 has been in the market for a
few years now. And if you take a look at all our premium SKUs, I think our SKU mix
today, premium SKU mix, is upward of 60%. And so, they see the value in E3.
And what do we have in E3 that's not in E1? Well we've got the Oﬃce client. In E1 you
get the web client so you bring your own client. In E3 you get always up-to-date
cloud-updated Oﬃce client on all the end points. You get security compliance
features.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16

A - Rajesh JhaThen, E5 is something that we are very excited about too. It's still early in E5. Our
customers are trialing it. And we've seen early interest in all the three key pillars of
E5, which is advanced security and compliance, advanced analytics. And voice. And
there are lots of capabilities in voice.
So that's how we've set up our SKUs commercially. You could by a given workload.
But most of our customers tend to get the entire suite. They may start with a
workload. But they get the entire suite and then we have them -- we add value to our
premium tiers.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
The role of AI has been a popular topic in the Valley and at this conference.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
And when you start to think about all the diﬀerent applications that you're powering,
kind of knowing which the other is doing, what's the role of AI in your initiative going
forward?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
It's huge. I mean, look, the ﬁrst thing, when people tell you they deliver AI, the ﬁrst
thing you've got to wonder is; do they have unique data, do they have unique
signals?
In Oﬃce, we have billions and billions of data points. As our users interact with our
products, they are signaling us. When I share a document with you, Brent, that's a
signal. If I email -- if somebody sends me an email and I dwell seven or eight minutes
on that email versus my typical minute or two, that's a signal. And all these signals
and all the data, what we do with Oﬃce 365 is we treat them as the customers' data
and customers' signals.
So then what do we do? Now, we've got lots and lots, billions of endpoints of data
and signals. Then, we bring in machine learning and AI techniques and natural
language processing to give back to the end user or the customer unique insights.
Let me give you a couple examples. Let's say you're editing a document in Word.
And you're preparing a report and then you think, '"Maybe I want to reuse a chart
from a report I had seen somewhere in my work group.'" And you didn't quite
remember who had shared this with you. But you want to reuse one of those charts.
So what we have today as a feature now in Oﬃce 365 is called Word Tap. So you're
literally one tap onto the ribbon and we use the AI technique to bring all the relevant
documents that you've seen in the past that may be interesting to the content that
you're writing now. And we auto-bring those things into your right pane. You canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16

Q - Brent Thill
A - Rajesh Jhascroll in the right pane. You can tap on the chart that you see and, boom, it's in your
Word document. And so, instead of going, leaving Word, going and doing a search,
trying to ﬁlter your search, trying to remember who sent you that thing, the AI signals
brings it back into Word.
And I can give you lots and lots of examples of these things. So I think with AI we are
helping the users get time back, get value back, whether in terms of eﬃciency or
automating their tasks.
But I'm also excited about AI from the IT's perspective. A place that we use AI now in
Oﬃce 365 is what I call the security graph. Again, we see tons and tons of malware
thrown at our customers. And I see that in Oﬃce. My colleagues see that in Directory
and Azure. We see that in Windows. We triangulate all of these signals and then we
overlay that in giving our customers, the IT guys, the insights into what the threats
are, who are the most targeted users, which devices may have been compromised,
suggesting protections.
So when you have lots of data and lots of signals, then you have the opportunity to
use ML in AI to give value back to the users and customers. Really excited about
what we are doing here. And we've got a bunch of ideas here.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
You've scared a lot of business intelligence users with your Power BI bundle and that
into some of the broader solutions. So when you think about the standalone BI
players doing what you're doing, can you talk about the role of Power BI?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. I mean I think there's lots of interesting work happening in this area of analytics
in the industry. And I mean our vision of Power BI is data science, everybody should
be a data scientist. We want to democratize what it means to analyze data, to ﬁlter it,
to draw insights.
And so, Power BI is, in many ways you should think about it as the next logical step
from Excel. I mean you do a lot of analysis in Excel. With Power BI you can do rich
dashboarding and you can bind that to the Oﬃce data. You can bind that to line of
business data. And the spirit of our investments in analytics is time back, money
back, value back to end users, democratize data science.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Any stats you can give us just in terms of that initiative? You've been, I think, over the
last have been pushing it pretty hard. Are there any other kind of broad data points
that you have to kind of support what's happening with Power BI adoption?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
I mean Power BI, today, is a part of E5. And we are still early with E5. It's just over I
would say a few months -- maybe been a year in the market. So we are very pleasedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16

Page 7 of 16Q - Brent Thill
A - Rajesh Jha
Q - Brent Thillwith the, like I said, there are three key vision pillars for E5. One is around advanced
security and compliance. The other is around analytics. And the third one is around
voice.
And each of these three pillars are resonating with our customers. I would say
probably security is the one that we've seen the most early adoption. But I'm really
pleased with the customer feedback and the opportunity, the market opportunity
that each of these three pillars are representing for us today.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Well we've been watching kind of the formation of Dynamics for quite some time
with some acquisitions and organic build. And it seems like a really exciting business.
It sounds like you're spending a lot more time on that business and doubling down.
Can you talk about the relationship between Oﬃce 365 and the Dynamics family?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. I mean it's a lot, lots of -- and we are excited about Dynamics 365. Then, to your
question about how do they build on each other. If you are in the context of a
Dynamics application you still want to be using the product, really, tools that you're
used to.
So in Dynamics, you can embed Excel. You can bind to SharePoint. Right inside of
the Dynamics experience you're getting Oﬃce experiences. Or you can be in Oﬃce
and have those things reach out to Dynamics data.
Another thing that we've done, which I think is going to be -- it's going to be super
beneﬁcial to our users and customers, is a common notion of collaboration. So what
we have done in Azure Active Directory, we have plumbed in the notion of a group.
All of us work in the context of diﬀerent groups. Nobody today in modern society
works alone. You always work in the context of groups. And so, we've plumbed that
at the lowest layer in Active Directory.
And now, if I have a group for my direct reports or I have a group for a product
launch or I have a group dedicated to a given customer, whether you're in Dynamics,
whether you're in Outlook, whether you're in Yammer, whether you're in Word, the
same group name space shows. So when I go to OneDrive, I can quickly ﬁlter all the
documents that are related to that group. When I go to Dynamics, I can still see my
entire context ﬁltered to the group.
So some of the work that we are doing across Dynamics and Oﬃce is at a pretty
deep layer. But I think it's foundational in how experience might change. And some
of it is where we make the experience just super well integrated across the two.

There has been a lot of questions from investors. Have you been able to truly take
the value of that asset and make it as valuable as you could? Can you walk through
your ultimate vision for Skype?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, actually, if you think about our economic engine with Oﬃce 365, I would
say our core workloads today are enterprise messaging and calendaring with
Exchange and Outlook. We've got, of course, the productivity suite, Oﬃce. And
SharePoint for storage and portals.
And Skype is a big one for us. I mean, today, with E5 especially, what you get with
Skype is you get a single experience that spans voice, video, conferencing,
application sharing, presence. And if you look at some of the innovation that has
come out recently where you've seen where, today it's an Oﬃce 365 feature, which is
you can do a Skype broadcast so you can broadcast something out of Skype to your
entire organization. But we are going to do transcriptions, a natural language
transcription, translation for diﬀerent languages.
And so, I'm actually quite pleased with the rate of innovation and adoption that we
have had with Skype and how deeply it is integrated into our Oﬃce go to market.

Page 9 of 16A - Rajesh Jhaout there.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
That's a great question, Brent. I would ﬁrst say communication and collaboration is a
basic human need. All modern productivity, all economic activity starts with people
working together.
But then you start to think about; how do people work together? And there is no one
size ﬁts all. If you are an account team that's trying to connect to a bunch of
customers and a select set of people inside of your company that's one set of
interaction models. If you're a CEO and you're trying to reach your employees and
get their feedback, that's another kind of collaboration communication pattern. If
you're a bunch of folks getting together, high-energy, trying to launch a product, a
bunch of developers writing code.
So with Oﬃce 365, what we want to do is we want give you the complete toolkit for
collaboration. And we believe that -- I talked about the notion of groups that was
being plumbed at a common level. And so, we want to recognize that people collect
together in groups. Some groups are open. Some groups are closed. Some groups
are super large. Some are more private.
And so, we have a common notion of groups and whether you're collaborating
through mail, you are sharing calendar or a notebook, whether you have a set of
documents you're sharing, we've got a common plumbing. Yammer understands the
themes of the groups. It lets you connect across your network in an open way. Then,
with SharePoint we have the ability to go and have an internet portal.
With Teams, what we are doing is we are adding to that toolkit of collaboration with
a common fabric. And the Team eﬀort is focused on a bunch of people, bringing a
bunch of people together, the content together, the applications that they're
working together.
Look, what's diﬀerentiated -- I mean, look, Slack has done amazing work and HipChat
has been around a long time and it has a loyal following. But what we are doing with
Teams is actually building out the collaboration toolkit in Oﬃce 365. And it beneﬁts
from Oﬃce. Day one, it's going to be in 18 languages in 180 countries. Day one, it is
going to be compliant. And we've got ISO, CGS, HIPAA data, we've got full
compliance.
But most of all, from an end user perspective, it brings the tools right into that
experience. When you're in the Teams experience, you can pin a SharePoint page,
you can pin in an Excel document. We have 150 diﬀerent integrations that are
possible including Hootsuite and Zendesk and Asana and many others.
And so, overall, I mean just the framing is it's not about Microsoft Teams alone. It's
about making Oﬃce 365 the best collaboration toolkit. And for our customers whoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16

their teams may be collaborating to have the full toolkit there.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
OneNote is a great product. Maybe it hasn't had the same level of light on it. There's
a lot of Evernote groupies. How do you get the Evernote groupies to get to
OneNote?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. Let me just start pushing that a little bit. Look, Oﬃce has got 1 billion users. It's
hard to compare something like OneNote or something like Delve with something
like Word or Outlook with 1 billion, 0.5 billion users.
But OneNote is actually -- I mean we are seeing great adoption of OneNote in all
segments. I mean let me just take ED, for example. I mean if you see the level of
inking support in OneNote where you can do math problems. It auto recognizes
formulas. We allow teachers now to auto-provision a notebook for every classroom.
And so, they are bringing OneNote into their organization and actually introducing
the rest of their organization to full Oﬃce 365.
You think about the Surface Hub, our new -- not so new anymore -- but our
collaboration on big screen interfaces. OneNote is here a whiteboard application in
there. And in terms of the migration from Evernote, we released a toolkit sometime
earlier this year or maybe late last year and a lot of our users that actually taken
advantage of that to move over their digital memories forward into OneNote.
OneNote is a pretty key ﬁller of Oﬃce today, the Oﬃce line business.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
This probably ties more into the Dynamics business. But Adobe was here earlier and
talked about the partnership with moving their infrastructure to your back end and
that you think about those. You've been marketing automation in terms of you
helping users use them. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what's happening with
Adobe and that partnership?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. Let me just make a broader point of partnerships. I mean, look, we always start
with, all of these discussions, we always start with a couple of things. I mean obvious
things. First is; what's the best thing for our mutual customers? And the second thing
is; is there a better together opportunity for us to go build out an experience better
for both the partners? And with Adobe, that was obvious, an obvious case for us to
go do that.
Another one I would point to is Red Hat. What we have done with Red Hat is we have
allowed our enterprise customers and given them more choice in how they do
hybrid environments. And what is really cool is now Microsoft and Red Hat got
together and we give our customers a completely uniﬁed support experience. TheyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16

Red Hat.
In the same vein I can talk about the stuﬀ that we've done with DocuSign or SAP;
Salesforce.com. Salesforce is well-integrated into our product. So I think I would take
a broader look at partnerships.
Actually, just to build on that a little bit, Brent, I would say, with Oﬃce especially, we
have a renewed commitment over the last three, four years to have modern
extensibility. Oﬃce was always extensible. But we have added modern extensibility.
We allow partners to plug in their experiences through our new add-in interfaces.
We have REST APIs for Microsoft Graph that let them connect to Oﬃce 365. And so, I
mean it's a place where you should expect us to continue to do more.

There's a handful questions and there's a common theme around LinkedIn. I know
this hasn't closed so you can't probably say too much. But it's pretty powerful when
you think about the things you guys could do together and the impact to the Oﬃce
family.
And I look at the impact to my Outlook application, as an example, of someone
leaves a job perhaps get to populate the data where someone changed and their
phone number and their email. You're not saying this. I'm saying this.
I mean love this kind of an interview where you're asking the question and
answering that too. But I guess just one example. But maybe just your perspective on
where you think that will have the biggest impact to your franchise.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. Look, I'm very excited about LinkedIn. But I really can't say a lot. I mean I'm
happy to come back once it's closed as we have to let the process play out and be
respectful of the process. But I'm very excited about what we could do.

Page 12 of 16Yes. I'm not sure I did a good job explaining the tiering in Oﬃce all up. Say, your
customer moves to a cloud. Let's say they start with mail and calendar. What that
does is it generates a lot of their data and their content into our cloud. And if we do
a good job serving their needs and we build conﬁdence with them, they may end up
moving something like SharePoint or Skype into the cloud with us. That generates
more data that we are the custodians of for them in the cloud.
The next thing our customers want to do is they want to do things like e-discovery to
put a legal hold or they want to protect the data. They want to do analytics on the
data. And that is what leads them into E3. We do some basic level of data leakage
protection and conditional lapses [ph]. And of course, operational security is just
built into our Oﬃce 365. But you want the advanced analytics. You want the
advanced security, well, that's what gets them into E3. Then, there is stuﬀ like
advanced threat protection or voice or Power BI that gets them to E5.
So I guess what I'm saying is the more usage we have and the more users we have,
the more data we have. The more data we have, the more right we earn to give them
premium value as a part of E3 or E5. So that's the basic thesis of how we are adding
E5 value.
And like I said, with E5, we have three thrusts. We have security and compliance and
we're really excited about the set of stuﬀ that we have been able to bring to our
customers there.
Then we have Power BI and something we call MyAnalytics on the analytics side. So
if you, for example, I don't know if you guys have seen this capability. But in Oﬃce, if
you're an E5 user, what you'd be able to see, one of the insights; who are you losing
touch with? So we auto-suggest that to you. If you sent out a piece of email -- How
many of you have sent out a piece of emails to, let's say, more than 30, 40 people?
Many of you? Wouldn't you want to know how many times that got read and what
was the read rate on those things?
And we do this in a super -- we're respectful of privacy. So if it's less than ﬁve people,
we won't give you that insight. But let's say you send it to 20, 30 people, you'd be
able to see the read rate. How many replies and forwards are there on your mail? So
these are the kind of analytics and insights. That's the second pillar.
And the third one, let me talk a little bit about voice in Oﬃce 365 E5. We have lots of
voice capabilities that we are excited about. The ﬁrst thing we do is -- we had
conferencing in E3 in Oﬃce. But the conferencing we had, our customers, you could
do voice conferencing completely based out of the cloud. But your customers would
have to bring their own PSTN conferencing in. And now, that is built in into E5. So
one-stop shop for all your conferencing needs.
Another one that we are doing is PBX systems. Complicated to manage.
Complicated to update. Can now be run completely into the cloud. So that's the
other proposition of voice in E5. A third one is, now Microsoft will actually give youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16

voice, those are the three components of that value.

And when you say give you a phone number --
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
You can get a phone number from Microsoft. In E5, if you do PSTN calling, that's a
feature that we have.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Pretty compelling. This is a good question. The role of the ﬁle system. Say you launch
-- I did this with my new Windows 10 machine and launched it, log in, now, all of a
sudden, OneDrive pops up and has all the authentications saved. Can you talk a little
bit about that and the importance of OneDrive and where that's headed?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. I mean so one thing we haven't done a lot is we haven't talked about Oﬃce 365
consumer business. We are quite happy with our consumer business. We have 24
million subscribers today for Oﬃce 365 on the consumer space. And the value that
our users get there is they get a terabyte of storage in OneDrive. And OneDrive is a
great integration, as you just mentioned, back into the core devices.
Then, you get on always up-to-date client. All the AI features I talked about start to
show only for subscribers. AI features are the kinds of things that we can't easily do
for our on-prem customers. And so, that's under the diﬀerentiations for us to actually
put more value into our cloud.
So I think about OneDrive as a core part of the value proposition for an Oﬃce user. If
you're a consumer you get a terabyte of storage and up-to-date client as a part of
the 365 consumer subscription.
If you're in the enterprise you get OneDrive for business. That has all the compliance
capability reliability -- not reliability but geo distribution so you're multinational and
you can choose some set of users OneDrive to be in Europe, some set of users
OneDrive to be in North America. So those are the capabilities we oﬀer in OneDrive
in the commercial space.

There have been several questions around security and speciﬁcally around email
security and what you're doing there, given that many of these breaches do happen
via email.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16

Page 14 of 16Q - Brent ThillYes. No, email is -- it's the universal communication dial tone. And so, there's always
a risk of abuse through email. So one feature that's really resonating for us in E5
today is something called advanced threat protection. And the idea of advanced
threat protection is actually quite simple, which is; look, Oﬃce 365 will protect you
against malware. Of course, that is part of E1.
But there are a lot of threats that are zero day that the malware signatures are not
updated for. Or people will send you a bad link. But the link wasn't bad when you
got it. The link turns bad later, after the fact. So after the malware has worked
through it, they will go and hack the website and then if you click on the link that's
when you get phished.
So what the advanced threat protection does is it basically detonates -- you know, I
use the word detonate in kind of a symbolic way -- every attachment and every link
in a virtual machine to try and see that there is nothing malicious.
But the other thing that we only we can uniquely do -- Now, ATT is available in the
market as another oﬀering from a couple of other vendors. But what is something we
can uniquely do? Today, the problem with advanced threat protection is if I send you
a phishing mail, Brent, your mail is probably going to be delayed ﬁve minutes,
sometimes seven minutes because a detonation takes time.
What with Oﬃce 365 we can do is we'll give you the mail right away. And if you're
reading a bunch of mail and you could read the mail right away. If you click on the
attachment, the attachment, if you click the attachment before we have been able to
detonate and test it, it will say '"this is being scanned'". And if the mail with the
attachment was the third thing you were looking at, chances are we've ﬁnished
detonating it and we've gone and updated your inbox. Your message in your inbox
now has the attachment too. So we call this instant delivery. So we deliver it right
away. We detonate on the background. Then we update and we write your inbox as
soon as we got it. This is the kind of integration of security.
Why are we in the security business in Oﬃce 365? Because we have your data. We
have your experiences.
Let me give you another example. Threat protection. It's easy for IT to tell all of us,
'"Hi. you shouldn't do this. You shouldn't do that.'" But we, because we have the
Oﬃce surface area, if I'm in Outlook and I'm sending a mail and I'm forwarding an
attachment to somebody who's not in my organization, Outlook can detect those
business rules and, right there, tell you, '"Hi. this is not what your IT wants. Do you
still want to send this anyway? You'll be audited.'" Those are the kinds of things we
can do. So there are lots and lots of examples of security value that we've added in
Oﬃce at all tiers; E1, E3. And E5.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Then, I guess there's a number of questions because likes to the potential
partnership, better opportunity to work closely with the third-party security vendors
like Proofpoint, Mimecast. Now, how is that relationship working?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16

Well mail is -- if you're a customer and if you have some other security vendor that
you want to ﬁlter your mail, you could do that. You can point your MX record to that
other vendor and then have that mail be routed after the vendor is ﬁnished and then
get it routed Oﬃce 365. So that kind of integration is already possible.
What is not easily doable, of course, is the things like I talked about like the instant
delivery where because you have to be in operationally closed where the detonation
is happening and where the mail is being delivered has to be physically closed in
the given data center. Those are the kinds of things that I think we can uniquely do.
But basic level of integration with other vendors is totally possible today through just
routing the MX record.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
There's a question around statistics around Dynamics CRM attaching to broader
Oﬃce 365's sale.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. I don't have that oﬀ the top of my head. That's a good follow-up for us.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Okay. And the question around subscription versus product. How should we think
about this going forward with 365?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Oh, you mean cloud versus on-premise? Yes. It's a really good question. So let me
just give you some anecdotal data ﬁrst.
About four years ago, I would say -- yes, maybe four years ago, I was talking to bunch
of CIOs and they were thinking about moving to the cloud. And their biggest
feedback to me was, '"Well I can't move to the cloud because you don't have feature
X, Y, or Z in the cloud and I get it on-prem.'"
Today, the discussion is entirely diﬀerent. Today, they look at things like Microsoft
Teams. They took a look at Delve. They took a look at the AI, the threat intelligence
graph. And one of that accrues to them if they're not in the cloud.
So today, the cloud is so clearly better in terms of complete solution. It's not that we -
- like I said, we are committed to our customers to serve them on-prem and allow
hybrid. It is just that there is a bunch of AI and ML stuﬀ that's incredibly hard. AI and
ML require a lot of compute and a lot of access to the data, lots and lots of signals.
It's super hard to lift that cloud infrastructure and move on-prem.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-16

issue is '"Hi. could you now bring some of that cloud value to me on-prem?'" And we
point to a hybrid conﬁguration for that.
