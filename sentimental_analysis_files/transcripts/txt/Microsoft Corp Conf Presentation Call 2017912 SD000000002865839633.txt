Presentation
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. Let's get started. I'm Karl Keirstead, on the
Deutsche Bank software team. We are delighted to have Microsoft keynote for the
2nd year in a row at DB's tech conference. And delighted to have Rajesh Jha, who
heads up the entire Oﬃce business for Microsoft be our lunch keynote. Thank you.
So much.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
It's great to be here, Karl.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
I promised to read a little message before we start. Before we begin, Microsoft may
make some forward-looking statements. I wish you would during this presentation
and you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings, for the risk factors relating to their business.
And that's true whether you're here in person or listening on the web. So with that,
we have a lot to talk about.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
I thought maybe I would start with a question that's actually not speciﬁc to the Oﬃce
business. But Microsoft at large. As everybody here knows. And knows acutely, if
you've been holding the shares from the '20s up to the mid-'70s, it's been an
amazing, amazing run for Microsoft in the last couple of years. And sometimes it's
hard for us on the outside to appreciate the change going on in Microsoft since
Satya came aboard. But I know your clients ask you about it. So maybe you could
share, as an insider, I think you've been at Microsoft for what, 27 years, something
like that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12

Q - Karl Emil Keirstead{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
What your observations are about the organization and the energy, level since Satya
came aboard? It feels like a pronounced change. But we'd love to hear your views.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Yes, sure. I mean, like you mentioned, Karl. I came to Microsoft straight out of school
many, many years ago. We won't count exactly how many. But the thing, of course,
any -- it always comes down to having a clear strategy and executing to that strategy
but you just can't overstate the importance of culture. And Satya has been, has been
very clear about the culture that he wants to see at Microsoft and he's driven that by
personal example. You all have seen the work from Carole Dweck on growth
mindset. On the whole, I mean, it may seem superﬁcial. But he really tries to live it.
He tries to get his senior leadership team to live it. And the idea here is that you're
always learning. You don't start from a presumption of knowing what's right. And that
is now for me, it is, I would say, a large part of the organization. The other thing that
Satya has really driven is a strong sense of accountability on the engineering teams
where just holding us accountable, where revenue is often a trailing indicator of the
work you do. And having the engineering team take more direct accountability for
driving user satisfaction and usage growth. And as long as you're working and
executing clearly to the strategy, then the right business is also going to happen.
Also the way we executed the senior leadership team, I probably don't see Satya
one-on-one very often. I mean he's always available, should I need to. But we get
together at senior leadership team every Friday, most every Friday. And so the idea
is all the hard conversations are done in the open. It's done as a team. And it's done
with the mindset that we are always trying to learn and trying to get better. And it is,
again, very easy to underestimate the impact of something like that. But it's really
borne great results. Our employees are satisﬁed. And people are focused on their
work and I feel that we are pulling as one, one leadership team.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
And it certainly feels to me on the outside that Microsoft is starting to attract some
fresh, top-tier talent, not that you -- that process stopped. But when I check with
recruiters about where top-tier engineers, top-tier data scientists are going,
Microsoft is making that list again.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Now it's great to see. I mean, we've always been able to attract talent. But now if I
take a look at the diversity of talent that we are able to bring in, folks from diﬀerent
open-source frameworks, folks in productivity, on data, on AI. We feel great about
the talent at Microsoft and also the talent that already exists and harnessing that in a
more productive way.

Q - Karl Emil Keirstead
A - Rajesh JhaYes. Good. So maybe let's turn to a couple of the big drivers going on in the tech
space today. I know everybody in the audience is following in and 2 that certainly are
popping up a lot, over the last several years are cloud. And more recently, AI and
Machine Learning.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
So the cloud journey is a key part of the unit you're running.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Because the transition of the traditional Oﬃce business to a cloud-hosted Oﬃce 365
one might be the single biggest thing going on inside Microsoft for a lot of
observers. And maybe, before diving into exactly that transition, I'd love to ask you,
broadly, about SaaS or cloud adoption? When we look at the results that a lot of your
peers are putting up, whether it's Salesforce or Workday or ServiceNow or, frankly,
even the SaaS units inside Oracle and SAP, it feels like everybody, including
Microsoft, is seeing a stronger adoption curve, just in the last year or so. So as you
talk to clients, Rajesh, what do you think is the catalyst for -- it feels like SaaS
adoption to have picked up as acutely as it has in the last year? What's happening
out there? It's even occurring inside Deutsche Bank, where we're publicly embracing
Salesforce and Workday as well. What do you think is happening at large?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
I'd say, of course in Microsoft we've been all in on the cloud. And not only has it
been good for us, it's been great for our customers because our customers can now
take advantage of our global hyperscale enterprise-grade cloud. But the biggest
payoﬀ for our customers has been the rate of innovation on the cloud is probably in
order of magnitude, if not more, faster. And I mean, with Oﬃce, speciﬁcally, we are
seeing great adoption. I would say, we have now upwards of 100 million active users
in the cloud, commercially. And this is across diﬀerent platforms, more than 90
million iOS and Android oﬃce users. We are seeing increasing usage of our core
workloads, not just exchange in mail, by OneDrive. And SharePoint and Yammer and
Skype. But also our newer workload like Team. And some of the, the SaaS is
movement, how the mix shift from on-premises into the cloud. And with Oﬃce, we
are -- I think, we shared this data a couple of months ago, at the Financial Analyst
Brieﬁng. But for Oﬃce, we are now 50% commercial Oﬃce within the cloud. And we
think by FY '19, we'll have 2/3 of commercial Oﬃce in Oﬃce 365 and exchange will
be north of that 70%. So there is a bit of a mix shift for sure. But also the cloud in
many ways is democratization of -- it's not just economies of scale, which is obvious,
also economies of skills. Today, there are many segments where you take the
sophisticated capabilities that many vendors produce. It's hard for our customers to
go stand those things up. And be able to consume it, even if they ﬁnd the capitalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12

A - Rajesh Jhaoverlay for it. When you deliver it over the cloud, you naturally start out with a very
consume-as-you-go model, a simple model. And so with Oﬃce 365 now, we are
starting to see small businesses that couldn't really run a lot of our capabilities like
Skype Conferencing or OneDrive and SharePoint. They can now actually consume
that. And in emerging markets, we see the same thing. So there are couple of secular
trends, which are economies of scale, economies of skills and, of course, device
proliferation, where the consumption now isn't down to you being on-premises. You
can consume it from any device.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. Those factors certainly feel like they're picking up steam of late.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
And Rajesh, on the second one around, AI in general, we always listen to Satya. On
the stage, he's always talking about these trends. How does the enterprise spend on
AI and Machine Learning, how -- it feels super early stage. But how do you think
those mega trends impact the Oﬃce business? How might a customer apply AI to
Oﬃce, for instance?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Well I think AI is going to be pervasive. It is starting to already be there with Oﬃce.
Every single day, we have tens of billions of signals that come to our cloud, as our
users use Oﬃce. And now all of these signals actually belong to the customer. This
doesn't belong to Microsoft but we are able to take these signals and give value
back to our end users and our customers, who, who do I work with? What
documents do I look at? Who am I going to meet next? What's trending in my work
group or in my organization? What messages are ﬂowing through the system? All of
these are signals. And today, if you take a look at, let me give you a couple of
examples. If you take a look at PowerPoint, we now are at the point where we can
have end users have a digital designer in the cloud, working on their behalf, telling
them the right content. If I'm actually producing some content, it knows what is the
relevant content in the enterprise process that I should be linking or reusing. It helps
me picking the right design template, getting the styles right in Word. In PowerPoint,
again, like, more and more workplaces are diverse and globally co-located. And
PowerPoint, I don't know if you guys have seen some of the recent demos of the
PowerPoint Translator. But I could be talking here. And I have real-time transcription
and translation into one of tens of languages. With Word, it's like you have your
professional editor, in the cloud, working on your behalf making sure your content is
professional, that the tone is gender-neutral, that's geopolitically appropriate. With
Excel, I throw in something like a country label. And I can tell Excel, "Hi. recognize
that as an entity." So if I now go into the cell next to it. And I type GDP. Excel will auto
populate the GDP next to it. It doesn't treat it like a text string anymore. We can tell it
to treat it like entities.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12

A - Rajesh Jha{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
That's neat.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
In Outlook, we have AI that knows who do I work with? Who am I close to,
organizationally? And what should I prioritize or focus on? Am I spending my time
correctly in meetings? If you send me a note, Karl, saying, "Can you send me the
deck from yesterday?", Outlook will soon suggest for you what that deck might be.
You can right-click on it. We'll detect the natural language query. You can right-click
on it and it will suggest the right thing. And if you don't get it right, that's a signal
back to us. And a billionth signal back to us, just so we can get our relevance correct.
And this is not just about end users, AI working for end-user. For IT professionals, we
see signals ﬂowing through our cloud and oﬃce. We see signals ﬂowing through
Windows, Enterprise. We see signals ﬂowing through directory and networks. And so
we're able to triangulate all of these signals. And suggest to the SISO, hey, these
patterns look suspect or maybe you want to turn on to FA for these set of folks, or for
the encryption policy for these set of folks. I mean, I could go on. But I think AI is
going to be incredibly pervasive. Now some of these AI capabilities are going to just
be in the existing products and make them better. Some AI capabilities. So we've got
this thing called -- it's not, it's in early preview right now. Something we called
Workplace Analytics. That, we think is a value-added service that will add to Oﬃce
365. Now, what does Workplace Analytics do? I talked about AI, for end-users, AI for
IT. Workplace Analytics is for people who are decision makers. Leaders for
organizations, HR, sales professional. I'll give you a couple of examples. Last year, I
bought 3 companies. So obviously, what's top of mind for me is "Hi. are these
companies that I acquired, are they getting progressively more integrated, with the
rest of the team?" And the Workplace Analytics, what it does is, it takes a look at the
communication pattern between groups of people, collaboration patterns, meetings
patterns. And sure enough, I found that one of the three was actually starting to drift
further apart. And so it was easy for me to go and get the right processes and
connections in place. One of our customers, early customers who work with
analytics, they discovered that the correlation between their salesperson eﬃciency
was directly correlated to the size of the internal network. Not so much, how much
time they spent with the customer, that matters. But not as much as the size of
internal network. So they did their reorg around that core factor. So AI is going to
permeate, I think, existing experiences, generate new capabilities. It all starts with the
fact that if you have data, if you have high-quality signals, if you're able to iterate on
that quickly, loan and experiment and get the right relevance, then you can create
value back for your users and your customers. And that's why cloud is so much more,
inherently, in a way, they've been on-premises because these models, these AI
models, these Machine Learning models, they have to be iterated, they have to be
personalized, they have to be creative. Nothing's more annoying than having an
assistant getting it wrong for you. Even if they get it wrong 1 out of 3 times, you lose
your trust in that. So the UI has to be done tastefully. And so on. I mean we are very
bullish in what we can do, in terms of generating user value and customer value, with
AI on our existing infrastructural oﬃce. And I think LinkedIn is the other data set. If
you think about the fact we have 0.5 billion people. And people's Rolodexes in
LinkedIn. And who follows whom. And what speech do you click on in your work
context. So yes, AI's going to be big.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12

I'm excited to see how the AI trend aﬀects Microsoft, going forward. So I'll be
watching.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
We're on it, Karl.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Sounds like you are on it. Let's zoom in, maybe at some of the broader themes, of
cloud and AI, zoom in a little bit into Oﬃce.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
So inside Microsoft, this is a roughly $25 billion business. I think if you are a
standalone, you'd probably be a top 5 software company. Growing at 6%, this past
quarter, on the -- at least, on the commercial side. That's a terriﬁc growth rate. So
Rajesh, can you run through what a couple of the key growth drivers are for Oﬃce.
I'm sure you've got some continued seat growth, as ubiquitous as you are. You've
got ARPU growth maybe driven by the transition to some of these newer versions.
What's driving that commercial growth of 6%?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
It's what you said, Karl. I mean it's both seat growth and ARPU growth. But before I
get into that, let me just share what I think is more foundational which is, we are very
anchored in what our mission is with Oﬃce. With Oﬃce, we want to empower every
individual, every organization to succeed. Whether you're in a work context, your
home context, whether you're in school. And we are really grounded, actually,
creating experience with a product that people love and they trust. Want to enable
communication, collaboration, creativity in letting people work anywhere, work on
cross-devices. So when you started a mission like that. And you take a step back on
that. So the ﬁrst thing, I would say is monetization of Oﬃce. If you get people
engaged in your product because they love it, because they trust it, because it does
the right things for you, then you earn the optionality to monetize. Without usage,
without earning the trust and love of end-users, that is not an option. So we start --
we are very grounded. And are rebuilding the right experiences. And so with Oﬃce,
we are going to take advantage of it, not just AI, as I talked about. But also natural
user interface increasingly, mobility patterns. So we stopped to think about Oﬃce,
being relevant in diﬀerent segments. So one of the ARPU drivers for us -- I mean,
letting, actually a seat growth driver, let's -- we have, like I said, about 50% of our
commercial Oﬃce in the cloud with Oﬃce 365. And by FY '19, we think we'll be
about 2/3 of our way there in the customer transition to the cloud. But it's not just a
mix moving to the cloud from on-premises. Oﬃce is an incredibly horizontal product.
So do you think about, what does a small business want from Oﬃce, in terms ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Q - Karl Emil Keirstead
A - Rajesh Jha
Q - Karl Emil Keirsteadproductivity, communication and collaboration. When you go to markets like Kenya
or Indonesia or India, where people's only devices -- these are information workers.
Their devices are going to be phones. What does Oﬃce mean to those users? When
you think about baggage attendants, working in the airlines, the folks who work in a
corporate oﬃce, their needs we understand today. But if you are a worker in a fast
food restaurant, if you're a baggage attendant, baggage handler, if you're a cleaning
staﬀ at a hotel; what does Oﬃce mean to those folks? So as we've started to create
new services, we've launched Microsoft Kaizala in India, we are -- seeing how -- I
mean, the early reception's been good and then we'll launch it in a few more
emerging markets. We've got this frontline SKU in Oﬃce 365. We aimed at the -- not
the information workers. We're thinking about a speciﬁc small business SKU. We're
adding more value there. So we've seen seat growth, because now it's aﬀordable to
these folks. So they don't need capital overlay. But more importantly, they've got the
right product and the right services. So we both see an expansion in seat growth,
overall. And if you remember our analyst brieﬁng from a couple of months ago, the
Oﬃce Commercial seats have grown 8%. So it's not just a movement to the cloud,
the overall base is expanding.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. And that's amazing, just how ubiquitous Oﬃce is, that you're still growing seat
counts about that clip.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Oh, yes I think the -- when you stop to think about all the billion people who are ﬁrst-
line workers or front-line workers, these small businesses who were never able to
aﬀord and run Oﬃce. There's a lot we can do there. Now, in terms of ARPU driver,
the ﬁrst users who moved from on-premises into the cloud for Oﬃce, they wanted
professional-grade e-mail with exchange online and Outlook. But like I said, as they
started to get engaged, as they started to use it, they've started to increasingly opt in
into our hero SKU, which is E3, which has not just messaging and calendaring. But
document storage; modern intranet sites, that work on your phones with SharePoint;
conferencing with Skype; Yammer. We've added Microsoft Teams to the hub for
collaboration. And over the last 2 or three years, it's been great to see the uptake on
our SKU. So customers are now moving to a cloud, not for one workload. But
increasingly for our hero SKU. Then as you know, we've added E5, that has advanced
security and compliance capabilities, that's got phone system in the cloud, that has
business analytics in the cloud. And so the early momentum on E5 has been great.
Now, some of the workloads in E5, we're going to see a longer sales cycle, things
like PBX in the cloud. It's -- there are existing vendor contract that have to be worked
through. But the Advanced Threat Protection, Lockbox, conferencing. These are
super easy for our customers to switch on. And so that drives the ARPU. And the
other thing I would say on ARPU is Microsoft 365 takes the user centricity of Oﬃce
365. And we're thinking about the entire needs of a modern workplace, by bringing
management on cross devices with EMS. And in Windows 10 Enterprise in the
desktop. That's going to be one of the ARPU drivers for us.

Page 8 of 14A - Rajesh Jha
Q - Karl Emil Keirstead
A - Rajesh JhaOkay. And Rajesh, on the transition of 365, you mentioned on the commercial side,
Microsoft is already transitioned roughly 50% of the commercial base in ﬁscal '18. So
how long do you think it might take to get that to 100%? And will it ever get to
100%? And for the customers that are not yet ﬂipped on to Oﬃce 365, what are the
most frequent, sort of, 2 or 3 objections that are keeping them on-prem, that you and
the sales teams are chipping away at slowly and you'll eventually get to. But what are
they? What are those holdups?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Yes, I'd say, like I said, FY '19, we think 2/3 of our Oﬃce base is going to be in the
cloud. For messaging, like Exchange Online Outlook will be 70%, something we've
(backed hard). We are running about a year ahead of where we thought we would
be two years ago. If you go back, I don't know, what we have shared exactly. But
internally, we think we are running about a year ahead on the customers' transition.
Now in terms of, all customers eventually move to cloud. Given our installed base
and the diversity of the regulatory context of these customers' (inaudible) existence,
I think it's a stretch to say all. But we tend -- like 2/3 of the customer. And there's a bit
of a carrot in here, too. If you move to the cloud, you get a much faster rate of
innovation because of the AI and the ML that we can go run and we see signals. In
terms of what gets in the way for customers, I would say regulatory issues for public
sectors, that's important. And so you will see with Microsoft Cloud, we are very, very
intentional about being in the markets that make sense. And we think about it as one
Microsoft Cloud. Azure, Dynamics, Oﬃce, we do business cases together. Should we
go into this country? How much public sector does that unlock? And these things do
make a diﬀerence. When you are a bank, which is global. And as you well know,
you've got certain considerations that we have to work through. But we are chipping
away. We want to serve our customers the best we can. And we think the way is
cloud. It doesn't mean we are going to stop doing on-premises products. The OpEx
investments that we make today on engineering, on billing for the cloud, or billing
for on-premises, they are 90%, 95% shared. So yes, there's an additional test burden.
But we are going to support our customers. Whether they're on-prem or the cloud,
we want to make it really attractive for them to move to the cloud. And we are very
humble about what are their blockers and we're just chipping away.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes. Good. I'm sure you'll get there. Let's talk a little bit about some of the
adjacencies around Oﬃce, where Oﬃce can actually act as an accelerant. So one
that I know is on the topic -- on the minds of everybody, is Azure, where you've had
amazing success at Microsoft. And it feels to me like there's a -- there's synergies
with the transition to Oﬃce 365. You even just mentioned that you internally think of
this as one broader Microsoft cloud, although for reporting purposes, it's quite
separate obviously. But it feels to me like these are self-reinforcing trends. In other
words, customers that make the leap to cloud-deployed Oﬃce are probably more
inclined to use Azure. And I'm sure there's a great cross-sell there. So do you mind
describing those synergies, starting with Azure?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Q - Karl Emil Keirstead
A - Rajesh JhaYes, sure. I mean, ﬁrst, I would say, from an engineering perspective, Scott and I, we
plan together in terms of a data center footprint. Where should we build these data
centers. Where should we build the edges. And the networking investments because
the customers, that is their expectation of us anyway. When they come to the cloud,
they do end up using not the -- if I remember correctly, 90% of our customers today,
90% of Fortune 500 customers use at least one cloud for Microsoft. The interesting
thing is 60% of them use at least 3 clouds for Microsoft. And so if you pause for a
second and if you think about it, look, if you use Oﬃce 365, you're going to want to
protect the directory. You're going to protect the devices and so you use Enterprise
Management Suite, Enterprise Mobility Suite, Yammer. That's exactly what you would
use to protect Azure as well. Dynamics and Oﬃce 365, we have integration, whether
it be on our web launcher how we integrate or whether it'd be in Outlook and, if you
were trying to extend a business process in Dynamics, you would use Power apps
and ﬂow. That's exactly what you would use to extend to Oﬃce 365. You can go into
SharePoint. And you can create a business for oﬃce, workﬂow front end, the Power
Apps, the right to data, back to Dynamics. And these are not things that we are
contriving. These are things that our customers are naturally asking for. As they
started to use Oﬃce 365, we sold the EMS. As they start using Dynamics 365, they
want better integration with Oﬃce. So we do think the reason that 60% of our
Fortune 500 customers use at least 3 clouds for Microsoft is because there's a
natural synergy.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Yes, got it. Then on the -- maybe on the LinkedIn side. I think it was May 16 that you
announced that deal. I don't think it got closed till a while later. But Microsoft has
largely left LinkedIn alone, it feels like. So what is the synergy story that's pending,
Rajesh, that we can look forward to? Either on the go-to-market or product
integration? In what way is 1 plus 1 equals 3 on Oﬃce plus LinkedIn?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Yes. We continue to be very, very excited about our LinkedIn. Our ﬁrst priority, like
you said Karl, is to continue to grow our engagement -- engage users and members
on LinkedIn and engagement there, because I mean, that is a ﬂywheel that we feel
just has a natural momentum. And we want to do what we can to keep that growing.
If you think about LinkedIn and Oﬃce, it's what we talked about during the time of
acquisition. You bring in the LinkedIn identity and proﬁle, together with the Oﬃce
identity and proﬁle. So I know the meetings, the trending documents, the trending --
the people you work with. And LinkedIn has the same context. And how can we
bring that proﬁle from LinkedIn or the identity and experiences together with the
Oﬃce, in Oﬃce and Outlook. Those are things you will be seeing coming out shortly.
If I'm in Microsoft Word and I'm creating a resume, which actually happens a lot, we
can connect directly to the LinkedIn web services and get the trends to the skills and
get that properly to write into Word and actually go a step further. While I'm creating
the resume, why don't I not expose you to the jobs that may be relevant based on
the construct of your resume? Take Dynamics and LinkedIn. We now have the
Dynamics 365 for sales in our GTM and our product integration with our LinkedIn
Sales Navigator. So a sales person can now use LinkedIn, 0.5 billion people, to ﬁnd
the relevant people to sell with or sell through and do the social selling. On
Dynamics that recently we announced the Dynamics 365 for talent, where LinkedInFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12

Oﬃce.

Okay. Look forward to that. And on the organically built products, do you want to talk
for a minute about Teams? That seems a pretty exciting product. You, I think, made
some announcements just this week actually?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Yesterday.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
How big can that be?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Teams can be huge because I do think we were seeing a pretty fundamental shift in
the way the modern workplace is evolving. You take a look at the new generation of
workers, their expectation of why they work and how they work is pretty diﬀerent.
They expect it to be inherently collaborative. And actually, as all of us know, most
material work happens in the context of teamwork. So Oﬃce 365, there are a bunch
of collaboration tools. But Teams, we think, is really the hub for teamwork for
Microsoft. In the last four months, ﬁve months, we've grown from 50,000 customers
using Microsoft Teams to over 125,000 customers. And the growth is just continuing
to increase week-over-week. We continue to innovate and the nice thing about
Microsoft Teams is we've engineered that so that the experience is cloud delivered.
Even the UI's cloud delivered. So the rate of innovation, we think we can keep that
level very high. Over the last few months, we've done mobile meetings. We've
expanded the surface area for Extensibility Microsoft Teams. Yesterday, we
announced perhaps the most frequent requested feature by our customers. Every
customer interaction that I've had, what they want is, ability to have somebody
outside their organization with the right ID policies and controls. But for these guest
workers to be able to collaborate in the documents, be a part of the meeting, be
part of a chat. And now that's all possible, as of yesterday, we started to roll that out.
Now remember, the Microsoft Teams is available to anybody in our hero SKU E3. This
isn't one of the products that we put in our E5 tier because we thought it was so
foundational to the way the workforce is evolving, that we just address that by
putting that in our core SKU.

Got it. That's exciting. On the -- you touched a little bit earlier on the Dynamics side
just to complete the picture of adjacent businesses. I've always felt, frankly, that
Microsoft has a massive opportunity to take on more of the SaaS space or call it the
"business application market". Dynamics is a terriﬁc start but it feels to me like
there's further that Microsoft can go to become a real rival to Oracle and SAP andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12

A - Rajesh Jhathe broader ERP space. Do you share that view that there is a bit of a whitespace
opportunity for Microsoft to grab, whether it's organically built or via acquisitions?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Let me -- as you've seen. And as I mentioned, 60% of our FORTUNE 500 use 3 or
more clouds from us. We want to be really ground in what are we seeing from our
customers? What are, like you said, are our adjacencies? Where do we have natural
strengths? I talked about the billions of signals that come in, into our cloud with
Oﬃce 365. So you take the Oﬀ -- the Microsoft Graph. You take the Dynamics user
interactions, the schemas in Dynamics. You take the Oﬃce as a deep understanding
of people and groups and documents and so on. And we construct a Microsoft
Graph. So that's the source of our core and then we are going to evolve from that.
But the other great addition to our cloud data assets, which I think is our core, is the
LinkedIn Graph. Now Satya's talked about the intelligent cloud and the intelligent
edge. In many ways, Oﬃce is the intelligent edge. But the other important node here
is the intelligent data or the intelligent network. So you take the Microsoft Graph, you
take the LinkedIn graph, that's our intelligent network. So we start from that core.
Now if you take LinkedIn and Dynamics together, that's like a $5 billion business:
70% in the cloud. Dynamics itself is growing 75% year-on-year. So we are very
excited about the Dynamics business. (inaudible) being very ground in what we are
seeing as our natural assets: would be Microsoft Graph and a LinkedIn graph. And
the usage that we see from our customers. We'll go from there. I think the LinkedIn
recruiting in Learning Solutions combined with the Dynamics 365 for talent, I think is
an example of something that you should expect to see from us on bringing these
assets together.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
Makes sense. I'll ask you one ﬁnancial question. I know you're going to look for (Mike
Spencer) to give you a good answer. But I got a feeling you know it. On the gross
margin side, inside Oﬃce 365, you obviously don't disclose what it is. But we try to
back into it. And we feel like at some point in time, Oﬃce 365 gross margins should
be able to get close to the pure play SaaS group. I don't think you're there yet. But
what will it take, beyond just scale for you to get there and can you get the Oﬃce
365 gross margins up to, call it 75%, 80% level. Is that realistic?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Let me answer your question. And not answer your question. But the ﬁrst thing I'd
say is when you take a look at some of these pure SaaS providers, they are more
point solutions. Oﬃce 365, I talked about what our mission is, in terms of
communicate, collaborate, create, analyze. So we are the full suite of services. Not all
these services have the same margin structure. You take something like Skype, which
is a transaction, a meeting. That has a diﬀerent cost proﬁle than something like
inﬁnite storage for documents or mail. Now, of course we want to take Skype there
too, where every meeting, it's a very important artifact, where we probably want to
record it, transcribe it, translate it, give you automatic notes. But you get my point
which is the cost proﬁle, we are such a wide range of services. The cost proﬁle, the
margin proﬁle, for every individual feature is very diﬀerent from each other. So that's
why, I think, you shouldn't really be thinking about Oﬃce 365 as one of these pointFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12

A - Rajesh Jhasolutions. We are a full suite of product (inaudible) needs. That being said, we
absolutely are going to be best-of-class for what we do. There are a few things, of
course, that are margin drivers for us. One is the premium SKU mix. And we've talked
about just what a great journey it's been, for us to take our early customers from a
single workload, which is about messaging and calendaring to an entire E3 suite.
And then we want to get them to E5 capabilities and then we want to get them to
the entire Microsoft 365. So that's basically the levels you should think about of how
we can try the premium mix, which I think is the biggest factor in driving margins.
The other one I would say, from an engineering perspective, we continue to drive
CapEx and OpEx eﬃciency. More recently, we brought in our consumer mail back in.
What used to be Hotmail or outlook.com and Exchange Online together. So we've
taken the ﬁxed costs of the 2 messaging systems and collapsed them together. And
on the operational side, we are starting to see the scale play out for things -- the
ﬁxed costs on things like support and compliance. So I think we like where we are on
the margins and I deﬁnitely think we have room to go, both with trying to bring in
mix and just doing the engineering and the operational rigor.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}

Rajesh, just to close, the next Microsoft event that at least I'll be at, will be the big
Ignite event at the end of September. I know that's not necessarily pure Oﬃce. That's
a much broader conference. But I take it the focus of that event will be just
continuing to drive product innovation. And pushing the cloud adoption. What are
the couple of major themes that you can give us a quick preview on for that big
Ignite event?
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Yes, ﬁrst of all let me just say, we are all very grateful that the hurricane impact was a
little less modest, I mean a little less severe than we thought. But still a pretty
signiﬁcant impact for a lot of folks so our prayers...

The event is in Orlando.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
Yes. So the prayers are with everybody in Florida. But Ignite is the world's largest
event for IT professionals and enterprise developers. A couple of themes that you
should expect to see at Ignite, for us to expand on: artiﬁcial intelligence, of course.
From an infrastructure perspective, productivity perspective, business-application
perspective, hybrid, cloud, how all of these things come together. You should expect
to hear a lot of that and how that experience has evolved in a world where we haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-09-12

hear more about that. The other one is Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is a big deal, not
just for Microsoft but more importantly, for our customers. Microsoft 365, if I could
just take a minute and expand on what it is. And will it just (inaudible) Microsoft 365
is. It's about pivoting on the user's complete needs. So not just the product ready
services that come with Oﬃce. But how do you manage these on diﬀerent devices.
When you are on your desktop, how does Windows 10 Enterprise light up? How do
we innovate all the way from the Silicon, into the operating systems, into the cloud to
run AI and ML models. And bring it back into oﬃce and experience this. How do
these experiences, how you interact with Oﬃce? How does that roam for you from
device to device? Three out of 4 IT prof -- SISOs, they expect to get hacked in the
next year. This is a sobering statistic. It just blew me away. I think about ransomware,
the ever-sophisticated cyber threats and Oﬃce -- with M365 or Microsoft 365, how
do we bring the end-to-end protection on a user basis network directory application,
how do we bring that all together? So enabling the end user to be creative, to be
able to collaborate on any device, while keeping IT and the organization secure. So
you'll see a lot of our M365 there, too.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
I'm excited for that.
{BIO 6218647 <GO>}
So am I.
{BIO 1542979 <GO>}
So thank you. And I don't think anybody would have anticipated, let's say ﬁve years
ago, that Oﬃce would be the kind of growth engine it is for Microsoft. So it's a
fantastic success story and congratulations on that. And thank you very much,
Microsoft, everybody for coming to our event this year.
