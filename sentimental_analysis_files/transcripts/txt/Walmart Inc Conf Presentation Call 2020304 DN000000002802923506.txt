Good morning everybody. Thank you for being here. I'm Bobby Griﬃn, one of the
Consumer Analyst at Raymond James.
This morning, we are very pleased to introduce Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Oﬃcer of Walmart. Also I want to introduce the rest of the team
that's in attendance. We have Chris Nicholas, CFO of Walmart International; Steve
Schmitt, CFO of U.S. eCommerce; Dan Binder, Vice President of Investor Relations;
and Kary Brunner, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
Before we get started, I'll just quickly remind investors that they can ﬁnd Walmart's
full Safe Harbor statement on the Investor Relation website.
And with that, we'll go ahead and begin. So ﬁrst, Brett, thank you for your attendance
and your long support to the conference. We very much appreciate it.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Thank you. It's good to come somewhere warm. Always good timing.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Yeah. So, maybe ﬁrst from an outside perspective, it has been one of most notable
changes over the last three years has been the speed at which Walmart is operating
at now. The company is clearly playing oﬀense today across multiple categories and
geographies. So can you maybe expand upon some of the changes that took place
in organizations that enable that and how to maintain that Walmart culture balance
with the speed that's going on?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

Yeah, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for your interest in Walmart. As the
customer continues to evolve and you look at the evolution over the last ten years,
last ﬁve years, last three years, as a company really you don't have a choice, but to
change and evolve with that. And Walmart has been good at that. If you look over
the years, we've led in that, we went into groceries, we went into the supercenter,
went into international, but we've always I think been pretty much on the front foot of
what's going on.
When it came to eCommerce, to be candid, we said this, we were a little slow to
react to eCommerce and what needed to happen. But as we've evolved, particularly
over the last ﬁve years, I've been with the company 20 years, the ability now to take
the assets that we have which are so valuable around the world, the stores that we
have, almost 12,000 stores globally, and combine that with which -- with what is now
a really large eCommerce business, we think is the winning formula, and being able
to combine that and really be the omnichannel choice for customers. This is what we
want to do.
So, it's taken a lot of diﬀerent things. It's taken a structuring diﬀerently and you see
us bringing together even more the stores business and the eCommerce business
with announcements we've made over the last weeks and years. We're bringing
those together more, but it's taken a change, not a change in culture, but a change
in how we approach the customer to get us to play more oﬀense. But it feels good to
play oﬀence, and that's as you've said, that's what we're doing.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
So it's maybe pivot a little bit to the current environment in 2020, a lot of news going
on. So if you could maybe touch on what you're seeing around inﬂation, commodity
costs, transportation, then maybe the food business? And then, lastly would you
touch on the health of the U.S. consumer, you know you guys just recently reported
your holiday quarter, we'll go into some of that.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. So, I'll start with your questions on inﬂation/deﬂation. We haven't seen a lot in
that area. You have certain categories that inﬂate and deﬂate over various periods of
time. But in whole, not a lot of -- some of that's due to us in the investments that
we've made in pricing over the last several years, we've really been a force of not
having I think inﬂation in the economy, because of the things that we've done.
Certainly I'm looking at reading the same things you are and -- with coronavirus and
certainly we're concerned about associates and customers and making sure we're
doing the right thing there. When you look at kind of the underlying economy, it still
feels good to us and we said that a couple of weeks ago at our Analyst Meeting,
inﬂation is low, interest rates are very low. Wages are good; fuel prices are low. So allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

Brett Biggsof that pretends to being -- having a pretty good economy, particularly here in the
U.S. And so I think overall the consumer feels pretty good.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
So, not surprising there's a lot of focus on -- from investors on online grocery pickup
its contribution to eCommerce. So, I understand we probably want to put pure
numbers around it, but how does the penetration along those grocery pickup
looking at second and third year? What you see out of those stores as the comps to
come?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You're right that we won't put numbers out there. So good call on that one. As we
have stores now into the third year I'm trying -- almost fourth year now under the
very early stores that went into online grocery. We still like what we see, when you
have an evolution of a growth curve that you typically see with anything new, but
those stores could continue to do really well. There's a reason we rolled it out to well
over 3,000 stores and we'll continue to roll that out some this year. But the customer
loves it.
It's one of those things I was going back to even looking at notes of things we talked
about four years ago. We really weren't talking about online grocery at all. This has
gone from something we really weren't doing to something that's a fairly sizable part
of our business today. So we'll continue to lean into online grocery. We like what we
see and the customer loves it.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
What do you see from the store when -- you know the stores still get the lift, does the
region get the lift? Is it a diﬀerent basket size? Maybe also pivot a little when delivery
is kind of more new than the pickup. So what type of lift when delivery is added to it?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. It gets a little tougher to read as you get into second, third year, and we also
have so many new initiatives going on the stores. It is a little bit challenging to read.
We're getting more and more items into the basket and that will be important over
the next year or two years as we get more and more general merchandise into that
basket. The basket overall is more than two times what we see in the store. So
people do stock up when they do this. But as we get -- continue to get more general
merchandise products into the basket, we'll continue to do that.
The margin mix is better in that basket, and we've talked about couple of weeks ago
at our analyst meeting the merger of our blue app or think about our walmart.com
app and our Orange app, the grocery app pulling those together as we will this year
will also help the customer, I think, think about us in a little bit diﬀerent way, make it a
little easier for them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

Brett Biggs{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Yes. So, yes, maybe since we're on eCommerce from a high-level standpoint, you
talked about some of the main drivers to improve the proﬁtability of the business.
You guys have done a great job growing the top line, and you're starting to make
progress on the gross margin, leveraging year-over-year expenses. So maybe talk
about some of the big buckets that could move the needle there?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, it's really everything we've been talking about for the last couple of years that
we needed to see take place to be able to have the losses, as we said they would
this next year, level out or will be down a little bit. So sales line has been good.
We've had really nice growth 35% -- 37% last year, 35% last quarter. So really good
growth there.
And if you kind of worked your way down the P&L from a gross margin perspective,
which is really important, and think about contribution margin, which is the most
important thing to some degree in eCommerce, we brought diﬀerent brands online,
we've added thousands of brands over the last couple of years. It helps with the
margin mix. We're having -- we have a better business in apparel and home than we
had a couple of years ago. So we have -- we're really good and ahead of the
assortment, consumables and food and other things like that. So when you drive the
traﬃc with that, and you can get customers then to buy home and apparel, you mix
up the basket diﬀerently and that helps a lot with the margin mix and eventually with
contribution margin.
Variable cost per order from a fulﬁllment standpoint is getting better. We're starting
to leverage ﬁxed expenses better than we did a couple of years ago that comes with
growth. So when you take all of that, the ability to have fewer losses in that
businesses is happening and it's happening for all the reasons that we thought it
would.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
How does advertising revenue and maybe the mix of 1P, 3P play into one of those
drivers?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. So, the vast majority of our business has been 1P. Marketplace is a growing part
of our business. And what we've announced with Walmart fulﬁllment services, you'll
see 3P become a bigger part of our business. It's important to the customer to have
those tail categories out there. And over time, we'll ﬁnd out what the right balance of
1P, 3P. We'll see what the customer wants, and we'll be ﬂexible with that.
There'll be ways that we will drive revenue diﬀerently. As you mentioned, advertising
revenue will be one of those things. I mean it's another one where we want to ﬁndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

good. We want to make sure when they come to our site that they feel like the items
that we're recommending for them are the items that should be given to them. And
so that that's import.
And -- but we want to ﬁnd it. We don't want the site being cluttered, we don't want
the experience being cluttered, we want to ensure that we're doing the right thing
for the customer. And it's -- like most things, it's a balance.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
So you mentioned Walmart from fulﬁllment services, brand new. We've got a little
strobe light action going on here to really get the mood...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. It's -- yeah, I admit that it's a little distracting, but I'm trying to work through.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Just to liven things up here at the institutional [ph] conference.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I don't know if there was something new at your conference, Bobby, or...
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
We'll get some music coming on in a second.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I left up that thing, and things are all changing. Yeah.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
But you mentioned Walmart from fulﬁllment services, maybe talk about that
development kind of what spurred that? And how to help build the 3P business?
And what those oﬀerings were before?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, it's a new way to serve another type of customer in eﬀect of the sellers that sell
in our marketplace. And so the ability to give them things that are helpful to them.
Logistics is something that's been the backbone of our company for so long. We
know how to move product. And so it's a pretty natural outgrowth of what we do as a
company. And if we can make it easier for sellers and give them an option in aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

looking for options and we think we can be there for them.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
So one of the themes from the recent Investor Day was innovation and our
continued innovation. It seems like a big innovation around the Walmart app
combining the two apps. So maybe can we talk about what's happening there? How
that will -- how the customer will see that transition between the regular Walmart app
and grocery and the time frame for that to happen this year?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, we said it will be this year. We haven't gotten more speciﬁc than that. But again
just how do you make it simpler for customers, having them come in one door, come
in another door, we prefer to just have them coming in one door. So for a while,
you'll still have those two doors, but it will lead to one door, but we don't want that
one door for them to come in, because we think we can help them shop diﬀerently.
We'll be able to mix up the basket, I think, diﬀerently than we're seeing today. So
there'll be beneﬁts to us as a company and to you as shareholders, but also more
importantly to the customer and just, again making it simpler. Everybody today with
as busy they are, they just need simplicity. And we're trying to make sure that we're
doing that better than we used to.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
It will be a slow roll-out into diﬀerent regions, or the two apps will be one -- the other
for a while, how the customer see on their phone?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It will come together pretty much at the same time for everybody, but there'll be
some roll out that I'll just probably not get into right now.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
All right. That works. And we appreciate. So recently there has been a lot of
commentary news about combining the buying teams and online and moving online
closer with the stores, but there's actually been a lot of work done over the last
couple of years. So maybe before we dive into the recent news, maybe take us back,
talk about some of the integrations taking place already, the beneﬁts you're getting
from that integration and some details around that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
The eCommerce group was kept fairly separately -- fairly separate for quite a while.
And the reason was to allow it to grow. We needed that business to grow. When you
have a big business, but it's inside of a really, really big business, the tendency is forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

Robert Griﬃnthe really big business to not give enough attention to the growing business and we
want to make sure that didn't happen, and I think that didn't happen. But now that
we've gotten as large as we have, it makes sense to start bringing some of these
things together.
And we've done it where it makes sense to do so, small things that happen. We
brought together our ﬁnancial group even just recently with the stores and
eCommerce. So you've had some back-end things going on. How we customer
service and some of the things we're starting to come together wouldn't have been
as visible. To the customer, just supply chain was the next one that happened last
year. And I think the beneﬁts of that are important. And it's -- the real beneﬁt comes
from all of us working together to solve the customer problem, not how do I get
products from the DC to the store, the DC to the home. It's how do I get it to the
customer.
And having one group focused on that, I can see the diﬀerence as we have meetings
about supply chain or things. I can see the diﬀerence in how we're thinking about
things. Over time, can you have a supply chain that is power-driven because that's
what's going be to the stores for forever stores and clubs. And then in each has
distribution system, which is diﬀerent, but are there ways to get synergies out of
that? We will be the only ones, candidly, I think that will be able to do that, because
we're the only ones that really have the scale of brick-and-mortar, and e-commerce
to bring that together.
The merchandising announcements recently -- there's some of that going on a little
bit behind the scenes as we've had some categories coming together. But I think this
is a statement to the company now and to our customer and our shareholders that
we are bringing this together in a way that that makes sense. We're going to do it
thoughtfully. There's some categories that will be more quickly than others, but this
is where the company is going, and the structure many times follows the strategy,
and I think that's the path we've taken.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Is the right way to think about it that you know on the core items that are oﬀered
both online and the store, you will have one buying team, and then maybe on the
long tail items that are only online. You saw some unique eCommerce buying team?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, we'll still have that for I think a long time that there'll be some categories that
you won't buy and scale or that are 3P and your helping sellers do that. So yeah, I
think for sure that will happen.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
So, maybe let's pivot to the international segment. And over the last few years,
Walmart International strategy has really involved. I mean today there's certainlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

Page 8 of 13Brett Biggs
Robert Griﬃn
Brett Biggsselect countries you want to be in, win in, have a big presence in, it's some that
you've taken steps to maybe reduce your presence. So, maybe can we talk a little bit
about what the national strategy is today, some of the current initiatives around it
and how you view the world and decide which markets you will be in the wing?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
So we've an international segment and it's a big business. We've talked about a
couple of weeks ago that its ﬁfth largest retailer in the world. We have -- we have a
business in Walmex in Mexico that has a market cap that's roughly similar to target.
The people just forget about the scale of the business, but it's -- I think, it's a beneﬁt
to look at it as a segment, because we do take things and we have learnings from
around the world that we use within that segment. But you really have to look at it
country by country.
And when you look at the businesses we have, we have some incredible business.
Walmex is an incredible business. Canada has been very successful, assets has been
successful over the years. Sorry I'm losing microphone, just a little bit there. So all
that's been I think well documented. We've talked about that. And then there are
smaller markets though where we've had -- we've had really good business, but
they're just smaller markets, but we're going to continue to lean into Walmex which
includes Central America.
We're going to continue to lean into Canada. China has been a great business for us,
particularly Sam's Club, we're having good eCommerce growth in China, and we
made a big bet a couple of years ago in India with Flipkart and PhonePe, but we
really like what we're seeing in that business. I was over there just a few weeks ago,
and really talented team really thoughtful planning processes. They're very focused
on top line, but cash ﬂow as well, just really entrepreneurial, love the team that we
have over at Flipkart and PhonePe.
And then where it doesn't make sense for us to be long-term. You've seen us take
some actions. We've sold our banking assets in Chile and Canada. We sold up most
of our Brazilian business. And so we've made decisions. And as a company, we're
going to continue to make decisions. We're going to lean in in places that you've
been talking to me about online grocery and India and China and Walmex, and
there is times we're going to need to lean out of things, and I think we make those
decisions more quickly than we used to, and in a more disciplined way than we used
to.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Flipkart, obviously, a big bet we were talking about a little bit earlier, but how the
team really has the top line focus but also the cash ﬂow focus, the cost focus that
really is kind of what you see at the core home oﬃce as well. Just maybe highlight a
little how the culture is kind of similar in ways around that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 13Robert Griﬃn
Brett BiggsYeah, it's -- I've been top Flipkart several times. I said I was just there a few weeks
ago. And sometimes as the CFO, you don't know if you're maybe the one getting the
cash ﬂow discussion, and maybe no one else is. And that happen sometimes. But as
I've talked to other people that have gone there, you can tell it's -- just it's part of
how they think, and they really do think top line and bottom line, which is why
despite the growth, we talked about the losses we will have there this year will be
similar to what we saw last year. There's a good discipline, but there is a great
entrepreneurial spirit there, very young company, young culture. They're aggressive.
But as you walk through their strategy and I spent really a whole day with their
diﬀerent teams, walking through their strategies, it's just very, very thoughtful. It's
aggressive. But it's -- we've got to make sure we do this in a smart way, the way that
we think about compliance, as the way they think about compliance. And I really,
really couldn't be happier with the team that we have there.
And there's certainly things we're going to learn from them. And as I said with the
team from PhonePe and what they're doing in India with ﬁnancial services and other
things. There's a lot of things that we can learn from them and not just in ﬁnancial
services, but how they think about the customer is really holistic and they move with
pace which we need as a company as well.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
So maybe let's pivot a little bit to Sam's Club, a lot of changes have happened in
Sam's Club over the last two years around brands, technology. So maybe talk about
where Sam's is today, kind of in that evolution and in some of the big change has
gotten traﬃc moving in the right direction, membership moving in the right
direction.
And then secondly, are we at the point where maybe we could see Sam's Club unit
start to grow again?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. Sam's has been a real -- real success story really, really over the -- my entire
career I spent three years at Sam's. Doug spent time at Sam's. It's one of the best
parts of our business. I love my time there, and they've been a real leader in
technology for us as a company. And so what they've done with Scan & Go, and with
some of things they have been around membership, they're solving customer
problems, they're talking processes that used to take members ten minutes and now
take 30 seconds. They've done a great job with that and John Furner was a big part
of that.
Sam's portfolio in the U.S. and now cap is doing a really nice job there. As far as
units, I think we feel good about the units that we have in place today. It's not to say
we wouldn't open more Sam's Clubs at some point or it's not to say we wouldn't
open more supercenters as well, but we're not opening as many stores as we were
as we're just serving customers in a diﬀerent way. So I think we feel pretty good
about the unit count today and wouldn't anticipate that changing materially over
time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

Okay. So one of our favorite topics, I know yours is the productivity loop and SG&A
leverage we've talked about almost every time we get to together. So maybe can
you talk about where we...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I started smiling when you asked that question. I like that -- I like the productivity
loop, yeah for sure.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Yes, one of the last ones. So maybe talk about where the company is today in the
Walmart productivity loop? And then when we all got together few years ago, you
talked about kind of your expectations? So as a second part, talk about maybe
where it was better than some expectations still got some work to do?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I'm proud of what we've done around SG&A, and I'm proud of how we've
done it. So if you look at what we are now versus three years ago, we've taken the 60
basis points or 70 basis points out of SG&A. Comp sales helped a lot in that
equation. So I'm really pleased with the comp sales we've had and that's helped a
lot. But we made -- we've made nice progress on expenses [ph]. Yeah, I may go to
handheld. This keeps going out. I'm going to turn this oﬀ, and then I'm going to go
to the handheld.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
That's what I talked about. Thank you.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Does that work? All right. Sorry to everybody on the webcast for that rattling around,
but I think this will work better. What I'm most pleased about is that we never lost the
cost culture. I have people say you lost the cost culture. We didn't. We -- expenses
went up for a lot of good reasons, but it wasn't as strong as it needed to be. And
today as we have meetings as I go around the world, I feel that cost culture again.
But I feel in a diﬀerent way.
We were always -- go back to the history, we're always pretty good at cutting
expenses. And anybody can do that and you can say Bobby, you take 10% out, Kary,
you take 10% out. And that's -- it's fairly easy to do that, but it's really short-term and
those costs tend to come back. The way that we're managing expenses today
through innovation, technology, changes in processes, thinking about doing
business diﬀerently, I feel good about the sustainability of what we've seen and
that's why as soon as we get comp sales where they've -- where we've guided toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

Brett Biggsgetting that 20 basis points of leverage each year feels like something that we can
do.
And when you look at the business next year if we hit our numbers would be like
20.6% roughly SG&A versus where we were at almost 21.5% when we peaked. That's
a massive diﬀerence on $500 billion business, and it allows us to be as aggressive as
we feel like we need to be from a gross margin perspective and we can keep
operating margins near where they're at today.
It creates a much diﬀerent set of options for the company, much diﬀerent levers that
we can pull versus our competitors. And it just sets us up diﬀerently. We keep this
progress growing and we get to 20%, less than 20%. This is just a really diﬀerent
business that we can run in particularly if we're doing things in a way that makes it
sustainable, and I think we can.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
And from a competitive standpoint, it puts a lot of pressure, it gives you the great
pricing ability to price.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It does and it's given us the ability over the last several years to invest in things that
we needed to invest in, and whether it's eCommerce or technology or price or
wages for associates, it's just giving us so many options that would have been
tougher had we not done that.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
Maybe let's pivot to Walmart help obviously very still early on recent couple of units
but maybe if we could talk about what the thinking was around that? What the kind
of goal would be to bring the services to the consumer and kind of the broad high-
level type view of that right now?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I got a chance to go to our facility in Dallas, Georgia, which is a little bit
northwest of Atlanta, three, four weeks ago, and was really impressed with what I
saw. It was fun. I mean going in with again somebody who has been with the
company 20 years to see us do something that's -- it's a very tangential to what we
do, but it's serving customers in a really diﬀerent way. And when I think about the
mission to save money, live better, that really encompasses save money live better.
And there is things like healthcare where our scale, we can make a diﬀerence. There
is -- when I go to the clinic and I visited with customers, with patients, with staﬀ, the
doctor, and they are excited about what this is. They're excited by the way that
patients, customers are responding to this because you can go in and get a teethFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

weren't getting that done because they didn't have insurance.
That's cool to be able to do as a company, we're not going to roll out 1,000 of them,
like I saw on Dallas, Georgia still little expensive and there's things that we need to
work on from a business model standpoint. But we will have a few more in the
ground as the year goes along and we're going to learn a ton. But I'm really excited
about what that can mean for customers and I think we're one of the very few
companies that can help.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
What type of response and kind of commentary early on, are you getting from the
providers, the nurses, the doctors, the dentists and...
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. The doctor I visited within Dallas, you could tell loved it. He gets to treat
patients and spend more time with patients not spend as much time doing
paperwork and other things that the doctors don't want to do. That means most
doctors to come doctors to help people and heal people. And you could tell that he
was excited about that. And so it was fun to see, see how he responded in this case
to what we're doing.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
I think we have about two minutes left. So we'll end on ESG. And some big focus
become even a bigger focus, but some investors -- might not realize the work
Walmart has already done around ESG, and kind of the ongoing push. So maybe
highlight some of the initiatives, some of the progress the company has made and
we can wrap up with that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. We're really ahead on ESG, and go back to when -- when lease Scott really
kicked in sustainability in 2005. As a company we were challenged reputationally in
a lot of diﬀerent ways. And this was the way for us to change in some ways how
people thought about us. Now with what's going on with climate change, and again,
the scale that we have, what we've been able to do is fantastic.
If you look at Project Gigaton, which is a project to take a 1 billion metric tons -- I have
to remember every time 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions out of the
environment and suppliers are really on board with us and helping us do this. The
fact that almost 30% of our energy now globally is sustainable energy, renewable
energy, which is pretty amazing given our scale, the fact that in the U.S. 80% of what
we produce as waste doesn't go to a landﬁll anymore and that continues to grow is
pretty amazing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-03-04

Robert GriﬃnSo I'm excited about the things that we're doing. I think we've only gotten started,
and the great thing is, in almost every case, it's good for business. We help the
environment, we save money, we save the customer money, it's a win-win-win. And
so I'm really proud of what we're doing and I think that our customers and our
associates feel good about what we're doing as well.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}

{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. Thanks, Bobby. I appreciate it.
{BIO 18794001 <GO>}
