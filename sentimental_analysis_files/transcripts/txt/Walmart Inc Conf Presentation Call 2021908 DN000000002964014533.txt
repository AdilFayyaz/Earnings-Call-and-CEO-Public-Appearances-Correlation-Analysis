{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Good morning everyone. My name is Karen Short, and I'm the Staples and Hardline
Retail Analyst at Barclays. Today, we are very pleased to once again welcome
Walmart to the Barclays Staples Conference. Not needing any introduction, but with
more than $560 billion in global sales to state the obvious Walmart is one of the
largest global retailers. This point cannot be emphasized enough given how much
momentum they currently have and growth that they have and had with them. But
equally important, the list of actually successful global brands is very short, and
clearly Walmart would be included and would be at the top of this list.
So with us from Walmart, we're pleased to welcome John Furner, Executive Vice
President and CEO of Walmart US. We do also have listening in Dan Binder, Senior
Vice President of Investor Relations and Interim Financial Planning and Analysis; and
Kary Brunner, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Unfortunately, no live Q&A,
hopefully this time next year, we'll be in-person doing this. So, I will just be
conducting the ﬁre side, and there is also a Safe Harbor statement on Walmart's
website, which you can refer to.
So with that, I think we'll open it up to questions. So John, who would have known in
February of 2020 that you would be taking over the range of Walmart US in such a
turbulent time, but obviously, you know as things start to settle then you can ﬁght
back a little bit on the last year and half.
So I guess, I'm going to just start of asking what do you think the greatest
opportunities are for the Walmart US business? And where do you think you're
ahead of the competition today? And what are the biggest areas of opportunity?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
All right. Good question, Karen. Good morning. Thanks for having me. Well, let me
go back to -- I guess, November of '19, when I moved over from leading the Sam's
Club team to Walmart US, probably been a quite a long list of things that I wouldn'tFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 2 of 13Karen Short
John Furnerhave anticipated happening at that time that have happened in the last two years.
And I think the biggest lesson from all of it is the need to be able to be ﬂexible and
ready for a changing consumers, which I think we all knew that going into the
pandemic. It was clear that over time, of course we all know for looking at history
and the future things always tend to change, but the rate of change clearly
accelerated in March of 2020, and beyond at a rate we haven't seen before.
And the best way to describe it is, it feels like we just skipped a few years of
transition as customers became more digital and became more omni in nature in
terms of the way they shopped with, and that helped us in really accelerate. In
bringing the two teams together, we had an eCommerce team, that was base in San
Bruno, California. We had a regional team for stores that was largely based in
Arkansas, and those two have come together. And the way we think about the
customer is understanding where the customer is going, understanding customer
intent, managing that with artiﬁcial intelligence to help them and Walmart match
each other's intend to catalogs. So that we can be more anticipatory.
And going forward, I think the customer changes will continue to accelerate. There is
nothing, I would see today or in the last couple of years, it would suggest we're
going back to where we were or landing in a spot, that's temporary because of how
fast the ships have been. So I think we're all looking forward to what the new normal
may be, and what we are doing actively and aggressively in the business, which I
think is --to answer your questions is where we're well positioned as the businesses
scale with momentum which we're excited about the momentum the fact we're in
5,000 communities with the local presence we've got a capital plan. We talk to our
investors about back in February to expand our capacity to be able to serve
customers more ﬂexibly with automation and fulﬁllment centers, and our store
network.
And then ﬁnally, we are aggressively reshaping our P&L. We've got a core retail
business that is strong and has momentum and then we have other areas that we're
expanding and are exciting to see the progress. Examples, Walmart Connect that
roughly doubled in the last quarter, had the ability to connect buyers, sellers,
suppliers and customers all together is a really great position for us to be in, and that
will enable us to serve customers in the way they want to be served over the next few
years.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
And, when you think about all these other exciting opportunity say Walmart Connect
marketplace, fulﬁllment services, how do you -- I don't know if you can put in, kind of
rank order where you see the greatest opportunity? And where -- how do you see
the growth rate going forward, because I think you've been asked us today like does
the growth rate kind of have to start to plateau or is some -- are some of those going
to meaningfully accelerate going forward and actually be meaningful contributors to
your P&L?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Karen Short
John FurnerYeah. Good question. I know you'd ask that. And it's hard to say, if you would --
which you'd prioritize because they are interdependent. Having a strong
marketplace means more sellers on the platform and more customers, and more
customers and sellers mean more opportunities for advertisers to use the platform
they're building.
So they really all work together and been able to scale all those simultaneously is
really important. So, I think being able to push all these initiatives and parallel is
important. As far as scale, certainly a percentage growth on a big number obviously
results in big dollar share and some of our businesses are large and at scale, but
others are relatively small and being built.
And then within the business units, there are areas like healthcare where we you may
hear us talk about building health business, where we already have a large
healthcare business all across the country, our pharmacies and our professionals that
are serving communities each and every day.
So in some ways we're building on top of the big base, other places, we're building
from something that's much smaller. And then our core retail business than we are
growing on top of a large retail business in the way we think about that is it relativity
based on where the market is. So having trends in things like food and consumables,
where we see units shares -- unit share growing faster than dollar share is a good
thing.
So, we've taken this longer term view of share in the scale business is really
important for us.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Yeah. So speaking of share. Obviously the dollar and the comp doesn't tell the story,
as you said it's about the actual tonnage and the units. By you obviously, picked up a
lot of your momentum this year that may have trailed behind a little bit last year from
a share perspective. So now as we look today, who do you think you're gaining share
back from? And how do you see that playing out going forward into the next several
quarters?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Look, maybe what we do is go back really the last year ﬁrst, and when the shutdown
happen in March of 2020, we did a number of things that solved the top line,
obviously to take care of customers and safety and that included closing stores at
night, with many locations were 24 hours, and we moved all the way from 7 in the
morning to 8:30. We restricted the number of entrances because we were obviously
wanting to make sure we were compliant with things like social distancing. We
closed some of our services like optical and tire.
So, we really narrowed down the oﬀer to the core grocery consumable business
which deﬁnitely slowed us down. And then customers at that time were shopping inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 13Karen Short
John Furnerchannels that they probably hadn't before and many were just moving to whatever is
closest to their home.
So as things have begun to somewhat normalize to where we were, I think we still
have a lot to work through with the Delta variant, the pandemic, and we're going to
continue prioritize safety and customer service. Overall, other things, all this is going
on, the formats that we're closer to home have been where we've seen some of the
sales increases in the second quarter and the ﬁrst quarter.
So, it looks like the momentum in Walmart is picking up as you said, through the ﬁrst
couple of quarters and we're having about where things were in the ﬁrst few
quarters. And also closing the second quarter with inventory levels up 20% over a
year ago, plus a single position going into some really important seasons. We've
great plan to serve the back-to-school season, which is underway now. We've got big
holidays coming and we were positioned well coming out of that quarter to be able
to serve customers going into the back half of the year.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Okay. And actually, so on that note, then the price gaps at least from what we've
seen, have never been wider. This is a grocery comment, but, I guess the question is
how do you communicate the value that is there with Walmart price points relative to
some of the competition, I guess again, this more grocery questions. When
seemingly value still hasn't become that much more important to the consumer
given how much stimulus and dollars there are just ﬂoating around?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah. There are couple of things, they have been important. First, our customer value
proposition, we think about price, assortment, experience and trust. And for 59
years, and the 28 years, I've been a part of the organization, every little price and
having price leadership has always been the core of what we do.
And you know that comments important because as we expand the oﬀer into
adjacent services like healthcare, ﬁnancial services, or we focus on things like
Walmart Connect, Walmart Plus, we won't ever lose focus on the core retail business
and the core retail business is successful because of the relative values that we can
oﬀer versus our competition and the value comes from leverage of things like the
supply chain and ﬁxed costs and all care, and all the things we've talked to you
about over the years.
Those won't change and throughout all of last year, we maintained the pricing levels
at what they were. Certainly saw a number of promotion stop around the market but
we maintained price positions where they are, and in terms of costing and inﬂation
and all the things that could happen to us, we will stay disciplined and our
merchants have such a broad range of categories and the interest in their portfolios
that merchants can mix their own portfolio within their department.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Karen Short
John Furner
Karen ShortWe can mix our categories within our departments. And then building density in the
local markets for delivery and oﬀering delivery-as-a-service like we announced a
couple of weeks ago with GoLocal. And we can do things for other small businesses
and communities and really and make the most out of being local and close to
5,000 communities around the country.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
That's helpful. And then maybe just thinking about inﬂation a little bit, obviously,
that's comes up with every single conversation. Maybe, how do you see inﬂation
today, and I guess I would ask that cost in relative to retail inﬂation versus cost
inﬂation, and I don't know if you could maybe parse that out from a consumable
perspective versus a non-consumable?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. The easiest answer would be the share numbers and the trends you're
seeing in food and consumables where unit shares are growing faster than dollar
shares. So, we think about things like dollar. We refer to it internally as penny proﬁt
versus margin rates. Now, you know the P&L, you see some strength in margin, but
that also includes other income activities like Walmart Connect.
So the core retail margins, we want to maintain price gaps ensure that customers
have a value and they can trust that they'll have the value in a basket of goods when
they either shop from Walmart digitally or they buy a basket of groceries inside the
store. And so as the supply chain pressures continue then of course we're dynamic
we've been chartering vessels, we've been securing containers, we have our own
private ﬂeet here in, inside the country that we can leverage and shortages.
So back to something I said at the beginning since March of 2020, we have been
really focused on building ﬂexibility and been able to -- yeah ensuring that we can
use our supply chain assets, including our stores and fulﬁllment centers dynamically
to serve customer demand.
If we can -- we can understand in turn meet demand then what you can really
depend on the Walmart team has -- they have a lot of capabilities in terms of being
able to optimize costs, which they have been doing for a long time and they're great
at those things. Ultimately supply chain costs are what they are, and they tend to
ﬂow, but growing volume on our base the advantage that it gives back to the
customer is that our ability to leverage ﬁxed costs, create room in the P&L, that can
reinvest in customer proposition.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Okay. And then I guess how are you thinking about, I guess broadly inventory and
then the promotional environment as we are into the back-to-school and then the
holiday season? And I guess, I ask it partly from the supply-demand perspective,
where there probably still will be some shortages on the supply side. So maybe kindFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 13John Furner
Karen Short
John Furnerof leads to me think that the promotional environment will be much more muted
even for more extended period of time into the even '22, possibly? Any thoughts on
that?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. I can't speak for what other retailers will do, but we decided late last year
and early this year is, it was quite obvious that the consumer balance sheet was
strong at that point and we assumed it would remain strong for some time. So we
really took a step back early this year and decided what it would take in terms of
purchasing and what we call open to buy with our merchants to position us well late
in the ﬁrst quarter, second quarter and beyond.
And so we took a more aggressive stance on inventory, which led to then the closing
the second quarter of the inventory levels being up 20%. Throughout the ﬁrst two
quarters, we've had a signiﬁcant presence of our Walmart Rollback program in stores
and online and we'll continue to maintain those kinds of promotional activities. As I
said earlier, one of the things I used to do, when I was a buyer and our merchants
still do today is if you get cost inﬂation coming through, you can actually mitigate it
by taking prices down and higher margin items with rollbacks to mix within
categories.
So, I think important for us is that the relative value gaps are in a position. You
mentioned food, which we're proud of but we work hard in those every day. We
want to meeting relative value gaps. So in any situation whether customer is budget
sensitive or time sensitive they can trust that they'll get a value when transacting with
Walmart.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Okay. And then this came up in the prior meeting, and I think I've been asked it
many times, but you know, provide just kind of how you are now thinking about e-
com proﬁtability broadly, because obviously, your Analyst Day in February 2020, you
had indicated that the loss is on a dollar. And I think the margin basis had peaked,
and then we obviously saw this massive acceleration in e-com which would have
helped the proﬁtability. But can you kind of frame how you're thinking about that
speciﬁcally within the P&L?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah sure can. What we're really doing is thinking about the business in total. In July
of 2020 just four months after we had talked to you in New York, we merged the two
businesses together, and we had our e-com team and our source team come
together and then we changed really from thinking about how we measure things
internally and externally, and in terms of channel businesses to a customer business.
And that led to the work on the customer value proposition and ultimately, we're
trying to do is understand intent in any situation whether it's physical or digital. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 13Karen Short
John Furnerthen the reason that leads you do not having the clarity of reporting of the two
channels is the lines become really blurred after that point. So, I'll give you an
example. This morning, I ordered an express order at 8:36 on the Walmart App, and
at 9:20 you run and heard the dogs barking as the order arrived, which included the
items from the store. The part of the order that I place is also going to come from
fulﬁllment centers which part of its tomorrow and there is another piece that looks
like going to be in the next day.
So, the signal even though it was an e-com order on the app, it was fulﬁlled partially
by the store and fulﬁllment centers, and so there is not a lot of value to spending just
a lot of time trying to break out then internally. So, we're looking at the total
proﬁtability but the important thing is over the next few years is the balance of
proﬁtability that's coming from for margins at retail and then the other items that are
in the P&L like Walmart Connect or data monetization, marketplace.
So we have a number of opportunities that can really mix well together ultimately
what it's all trying to do is make sure we understand customer intent and could we
match our catalog with intent.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Okay. And then actually on that note, there has been some changes, I guess on the
app, and then there has been some consolidation that's happened. Can you talk a
little bit about what still to come? What's already been accomplished? And what's
still to come from an app perspective and a consolidation perspective?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
I can, and I'm glad you asked. A couple of years ago we had two apps, we called one
the orange app because it was orange and it represented grocery shopping, and
then we have the other app, which called the blue app, because it was blue, and it
was our Walmart eCommerce business. And our both worked well and served a
purpose for the time they were there. And but they did create some friction for
customers.
And the analogy, I would compare it to is, if you went all the way back to the late 80s,
early 90s, we had grocery stores, we had GM stores, some of those came together,
we had the Supercenter. And it was really our CEO, David Glass, who scaled the
Supercenter opportunity through the 90s. And so we've been managing something
we call Project Glass, which is the consolidation of the orange and the blue app in
honor of David's legacy and what he did for the company.
And last year, we put both of those apps in one tile. So you'd have one Walmart tile,
but you still had to pick either shopping eCommerce or stores, and up to about last
week we had about 10% of our traﬃc on one single shopping application with
universal search with universal checkout.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Karen Short
John FurnerIt's a great experience, and we are now scaling to traﬃc now and hope to have it in
front of all users by the end of the month. So we're making a lot of progress there,
but that actually is what enables like the transaction I had this morning where I
needed a few things from the store and a few things other places and you search,
you put it all in one basket, and then transact to one time and then the supply chain
team in the background will optimize the best way to give to the customer, meet the
customer promise.
So more to come there, but I'm really excited about the re-platforming. And I say that
because of the customer experience. The customer deserves to be able to in or
anything that they need from Walmart, and we should ﬁgure out how the ﬁlm the
background. We always say to ourselves internally, we never want to show our
customer our old chart and what the blue app and the orange app, as it pretty
clearly showed you, the orange chart which you're dealing with.
So we want to take that visibility away from the customer and be there for anything
that they need from us.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Okay. And then, thinking just about your -- I guess your core customer, and I realize
you mirror kind of the top general population, but I would argue that your core
customers probably not going to be as ﬂushed with cash as we get into 2022, and
would argue that puts Walmart in a very good position.
But you know, and mostly because, I would say the your core customer doesn't tend
to save as much as maybe a higher income demographic would. But how do you
think about the state of your consumers, we get through to the end of this year and
into next year, like from stimulus year-over-year comparison perspective, but also
child tax credit?
And then maybe we could -- we snap into that as well, because the change is
coming along the pipeline on October 1 on that?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah. I think in general, you said it earlier that the overall balance sheet is strong
amongst customers across the country. The way we think about the customer that
maybe at the core or in income, where our brackets aren't as high is more will be
back in the workforce in the next few months and real incomes are a big beneﬁt for
shopping in addition to stimulus.
So I think we're ready to be ﬂexible in any direction. The price gap that you
mentioned earlier could be even more important at that time. So going into that
timeframe having maintained it throughout the last couple of years, but we were
thinking about the entire time to the pandemic is we don't want to do anything, that
would ever erode customer trust, it's taken years to build the trust they have in the
business and many teams before me and my team. So trust was always top of mindFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08

Page 9 of 13Karen Short

Karen Shortand we probably throughout the pandemic we prioritized safety, serving
communities, managing results as we needed to in the building for the future. I think
for the team there was a nice job of balancing those and always focused on trust and
safety at the beginning.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
And, how do you think speciﬁcally about SNAP, because I know the headlines are
25% increase starting October 1, but I don't -- that's not only the reality sequentially
when you're talking about dollars in the pockets of consumers year --on a year-over-
year basis. So, maybe can you just help frame that a little bit.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah. I think you're describing it well. The headline makes it sound higher than it is
because there were other beneﬁts that are running out. So we'll know more at the
end of the quarter, how -- I don't think we're not thinking of it is a 25% increase. We'll
focus on making sure we're in stock and price right and ready for customers. And
then the results reﬂect how well you execute and the values here on the retail.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Okay. And then maybe just an update on, how you're kind of envisioning Walmart
Plus going forward, but then also an update on like 3P versus 1P in general, where
you are inventory levels, where you are on sellers, on marketplace? And how you see
that evolving?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah. I think, back to the point, that have been a dynamic and ﬂexible. Inventory is
positioned well versus the year ago and we continue to add sellers to the platform.
Our Walmart fulﬁllment services oﬀering continues to expand and we're bringing in
a more capacity, and all those answers go back to a decision that we communicated
earlier this year, which is to expand our CapEx program to build more capacity for
eCommerce which ultimately, an eCommerce capacity does include stores because
of the fulﬁllment that happens locally all around the country.
So, the supply chain investments will build capacity for all channels and then have
strong marketplace is important having a number of a large number sellers is
important. Those things together obviously fuel the Connect business which
connects the buyers, the suppliers and sellers together in the platform.
So the Walmart ﬂywheel, as it all comes again there it's mutually, I could say that
mutually reinforcing in a way that's unique to Walmart because of our digital,
national and local presence.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08

Page 10 of 13John Furner
Karen Short
John FurnerAnd then I would be remiss not to bring up the wage increase that was just
announced. So maybe a little background on the decision to make that
announcement. I mean we can all do the math on how that might impact your P&L
from a basis point perspective, but just wanted to see if you could frame that a little
bit.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Sure, sure. Our associates have done an amazing job in the last couple of years,
serving communities. And I've always said if you want to be inspired just view
Walmart stores and talk to a couple of Walmart associates here are in the midst of a
national -- a natural disaster and a truck driver and you will see the backbone of how
the country can run.
I was just in Louisiana, last Wednesday and saw exactly that. It's just amazing to see
the resilience of people and communities how they come together. And like we've
always said, we'll have a competitive proposition for associates. You can get your
college education, working at Walmart it's paid for by Walmart, there are beneﬁts
available, wages are part of it. Digital products, while at the workforce also are part
of it, because it helps with productivity and in many of our stores there are 4.5 acres.
So buying devices that people can use on the sales ﬂoor and being able to get right
to the work is important because it saves a lot of time walking.
And then ultimately with wages we'll be competitive the market. It's a really large
country and wage rates are diﬀerent all across the country and we were really proud
of the third investment we've made in our associates this year, the last year, the last
four months.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Okay. And then maybe just because you did bring it up, but Walmart GoLocal. Can
you maybe just give a little bit of background on what the genesis of that was? And
then, how to kind of trying to frame the fact that like are you worried may be helping
your competitors and some cheaper ﬁrm[ph] or maybe just any color you can give
on that?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah, happy to. It's actually really good example of kind of the deﬁnition of a
platform aggregator. So, we have customers who are shopping at Walmart. We've
built our local business, our local delivery business pretty substantially in the last two
years. Obviously, it accelerated the last year when the pandemic began and our
drivers who are contractors that are working on what we call the Spark platform, and
one of the keys to serving the driver as well as having enough work that they stay
busy and they want to stay in the platform.
So, we have not only the Walmart business is being delivered but that service can be
oﬀered to other retailers, or other stores or other kinds of businesses in the localFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 13Karen Short

John Furnermarket that keeps the drivers busier which that we know it's important to them. And
also lowers the cost of delivery, when you can -- what we would call batch orders
together, so you'd have more than one order in a vehicle.
At times, that can be more than one Walmart order but if you perishables in the car,
then that will limit the number of Walmart orders can go to a single vehicle. So, they
will be able to go to other retailers, other stores and these can be small local
businesses. They can be chains, but ultimately what we're trying to do is make sure
the customer has access as it means they want and provide a beneﬁt to not only in
the Supercenters, for other retailers and markets.
And it's especially important Karen in some of the smaller mid-size markets that
we're in, where some of the large platforms just don't operate or they don't operate
at scale. So, we think it's a unique position for us and having other retailers, where
we are complementary assortments is ultimately great for the customer.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
And actually, can you just remind me have you given the latest number of how many
Spark drivers you have?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Well, it's growing on every day. We haven't communicated the number recently, but
the progress of the platform and what the team are working on, well just say they are
making a lot of progress and the growth within the company was the ﬁrst step, and
then been able to oﬀer this to others which will have more to talk about the near
future was really the second step of this.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
And then, I know part of the ﬂywheel is -- it hasn't really buying that much of you
time recently would be you know healthcare in general and Walmart health centers.
So maybe give us --take us a back and kind of frame how you think about that as an
opportunity? And I don't get the sense that you're trying to de-emphasize it at all.
You just had a lot of things going on.
So, maybe a little color on how you see that evolving? And how you see that actually
I guess, add on to the actual store, how that changes the behavior within the rest of
the store from an attachment perspective, I guess?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah. You said that very well and framed it well. We haven't deemphasized it, there
have just been a number of things happening, it including initiatives and things in
the external environment that we've all been managing like we're really excited
about healthcare, the aspiration it goes back to the founder and the founder got into
healthcare in the late 70s which is turned into an outscale healthcare business thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-08

pharmacists to practice at a much higher range of their license, which has been
really inspiring since vaccinations begin.
We have pharmacists and techs all over the country administering vaccines,
immunizations, some diagnostics in states where it's allowed. So yeah, I think the
future of healthcare like many things, and it could be healthcare or getting your tires
changed or getting a cake ordered, the app and the physical environment being
local all connected together will be a really important way that we'll be able to serve
customer's needs.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Okay. And then maybe just one last one on that. I mean, I did see your Dallas,
Georgia facility. How would some of the more recent openings be diﬀerent maybe
from the earlier one -- like earlier ones that you've open?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah. They are similar in terms of the setup in the ﬂow, and Dallas is the largest
clinics that we opened and what we want to do in the ﬁrst one was open with all
services that we thought were relevant and then learn from there. And this is a
learning journey where we're still have a relatively small number of clinics open
under 30 at this point but as we expand we'll continue to reﬁne the oﬀer. Dallas and
the other sides like (inaudible) and in some of -- are really encouraging in terms of
consumer demand and the number of patients, who were looking for healthcare
solutions that were accessible and aﬀordable and delivered in a quality way.
{BIO 20587902 <GO>}
Okay. Well, I think we are at time now. So, operator I don't know if there is count
down here, or how you want us to end, that it is passed the 11:50 mark. Thank you,
everyone. Thanks for listening, and thank you Walmart for participating. We really
appreciate it. And hope to see by next year.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
I agree.
