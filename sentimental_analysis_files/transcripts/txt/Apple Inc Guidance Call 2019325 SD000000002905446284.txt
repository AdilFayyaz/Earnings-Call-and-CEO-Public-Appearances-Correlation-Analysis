Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to the Steve Jobs
Theater. As you can tell, today's going to be a very diﬀerent kind of event. We've got
some really exciting things to share with you. And we're going to have some fun
along the way. So let's get going.
For decades, Apple has been creating world-class hardware and world-class
software. We've also been creating a growing collection of world-class services. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 2 of 26that is what today is all about.
So what is a service? Well if you look it up in the dictionary, you'll see that a service is
deﬁned as the action of helping or doing work for someone. At Apple, our services
are actively working to help our customers get the most out of their products and to
enrich their lives.
Using iPhone as an example, let's take a look at our services in action. The iPhone
you carry with you with its powerful hardware and powerful software allows you to
capture the very best moments of your life. And our iCloud service helps you easily
share those photos with loved ones and automatically makes your entire photo
library available across all of your devices anytime, anywhere, safe and protected.
This is just one example of the beneﬁts that come from the seamless integration of
hardware, software and services. And this is something that Apple does better than
anyone else. Thank you. Thank you.
Now we have a whole range of services like iCloud, our service which keeps your
contacts, calendar, notes and, as I just showed you, your photos and even your
documents up to date across all of your devices. Siri is the most popular personal
assistant in the world that helps you get things done just by asking. And Apple Maps,
the most used navigation system on iOS by far. Apple Pay is our service that lets you
make secure purchases in stores and apps and on the web. And we oﬀer
communication services like Messages and FaceTime so you can stay connected
with people that you love. We provide services that help you locate your devices
with Find My iPhone or simply know that your kids made it to school on time with
Find My Friends. Then there's Apple Music and podcast and books in the App Store
and Apple News, services that deliver incredible content and experiences directly to
you whenever and wherever you are.
Now most of these services are free while some of them are paid, oﬀering very
valuable content from talented creators, storytellers and artists. We take the same
approach at Apple with our services as we do our products. They have to be easy to
use. They have an uncompromising attention to detail in design and engineering.
They're designed to keep your personal information private and secure. And with
our services, we do even more. They're curated by our expert editors. They're
personalized just for you. And they're designed to be shared with your entire family.
Now today, we're excited to extend our services even further, making them even
more entertaining, more useful and more informative. So let's get started with Apple
News.
When we created Apple News over three years ago, we wanted to provide the best
way to read the news on your iPhone and iPad. And we felt we can make a diﬀerence
in the way that news is experienced and understood, a place where the news would
come from trusted sources and be curated by experts. Now this is a very diﬀerent
approach than others have taken. As Slate pointed out, "By handpicking itsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 26Roger Rosnerpublishers and stories, Apple News prioritizes a news source's reputation and the
value of its content over the propensity of its headlines to garner clicks and likes."
With news being so important to us, it's critical that it be trusted. With over 5 billion
articles read each month, Apple News is now the #1 news app. Unbelievable. In fact,
Apple News has become an essential daily destination for millions of people.
Our editors pick the top stories every day so you can stay on top of important news.
You get a personalized news feed, delivering stories on topics that are most
interesting to you, whether they come from publishers that you regularly read or
from ones that you -- are completely new to you. Now when it comes to major
events, our team of editors curates collections of the best stories from news and
sports, entertainment and so much more.
Probably like many of you, I love the feeling of being at the newsstand with all those
beautiful and thought-provoking magazines covering so many topics. We want them
all. But we might only be able to get 1 or maybe 2. But what if we could have them
all? Well today, we're going to do just that. We're bringing magazines to Apple
News. With amazing design and striking photography, in-depth journalism,
magazines are iconic and a part of our culture. They follow and create the latest
trends in fashion and style. They entertain. They educate us about the world we live
in. They provide insights into science and technology. They go behind the scenes
with exclusive interviews of our favorite artists. They feature the work of some of the
world's best journalists. They cover the world of sport. They bring today's business
innovation and technology into focus. And they tell stories that give us perspective.
All of these magazines come to life in an all-new service that we call Apple News
Plus. This is going to take Apple News to a whole new level. We've made a video
about the power of journalism and its cultural impact. And I'd love to play it for you
now.
(presentation)
Thank you. Thank you. To tell you more about Apple News Plus, I'd like to invite up
Roger Rosner, Vice President of Applications. Roger?
I'm thrilled to tell you about the new service we're bringing to Apple News. Our goal
for Apple News Plus was simple: We wanted to create the best magazine reading
experience ever for a mobile device. Apple News Plus will bring you over 3,000
magazines across all -- I'm sorry, 300 magazines across all sorts of topics like
entertainment, fashion, news and politics. We've got great health magazines and
great lifestyle magazines. We've got magazines for travelers, magazines for foodies,
magazines for gearheads. We've got magazines for just about every passion under
the sun. And Apple News Plus is the only place where you will ﬁnd all these
magazines in a single package. To show it to you, I'd like to invite up Wyatt Mitchell,
Apple's Director of Design for Applications.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25

Thank you, Roger.
Let's take a look at the new Apple News Plus. It all starts with the same great Apple
News free experience. That means it's got top stories, it's got trending stories. And
here are my personalized recommendations in for you. With an Apple News Plus
subscription, the experience gets even better. It means I get the latest magazines.
With this design, we wanted to add the best of the magazine experience into the
app. And that starts with the covers. We wanted to make them even more inviting, an
entrance into another world. So we created the live cover. Check this one out from
National Geographic. It's an amazing aerial view of Sydney, Australia and what looks
like an incredible issue.
So let's take a look. When I tap on the cover, I'm taken to the table of contents where
I can see all the articles in the issue. I can jump to whichever one I'm interested in,
like this. And here, I land on a National Geographic article, beautifully designed and
full of amazing infographics. Apple News Plus makes the experience of diving into
an issue even more fun and exciting. It's really like having National Geographic
designed for my phone. And to get more, I can just tap on the table of contents or I
can browse the issue by simply swiping from article to article like this. I can read full
magazine issues no matter where or when right on my phone.
All right. Let me get back to the Today tab. There are more recommendations of
articles and issues here. But the place to explore all magazines is the News Plus tab.
Here, we wanted to design a home dedicated to everything about enjoying
magazines. I can easily ﬁnd my favorite titles right here in my magazines. There's the
National Geographic I was just looking at. Here's one of my all-time favorites, The
New Yorker. I also see suggestions like Popular Science here based on my interests.
And recent issues are automatically downloaded so I already have them before I
board a ﬂight.
Scrolling down, here's one of our ﬁrst looks. It's the new cover of Rolling Stone
featuring some of the stars of Game of Thrones. Now everything here is curated by
the Apple News editors and personalized, which makes it really easy to discover a
great article or explore a topic, like this group of travel stories recommended for me.
I've been reading a lot about Costa Rica recently. And while I'm not a regular reader
of Marie Claire, I can see the News Plus is recommending their article on traveling
there, which is really smart and really great.
I'll also see featured articles like this one from WIRED Magazine and new issues like
this one from Essence with Issa Rae on the cover. Now along with the cover, I can see
a few articles from the issue, which makes it really easy to browse. Now I'm going to
tap on this cover story because I'm a big fan of her show, Insecure. And here, we
enter another beautifully designed article.
Design plays such a big part of magazines. We really wanted to give the titles their
ability to express their own unique look and feel through their design, typographyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25

Page 5 of 26Roger Rosnerand photography. And this is really a great example of it. This is Essence designed
for the phone. So it looks great here on the phone. Let's take a look at it on the iPad.
I'm going to open up the same article on the iPad. And as you can see, the article
looks fantastic here, too. And nicely adapted to the larger size. And just like on the
phone, I can always tap on the table of contents to navigate to another article.
I'm going to try this beauty story. And here, we have a beautiful photo essay. The
iPad really shows oﬀ great photography like this.
Now if I'm looking for something speciﬁc or just wanting to browse, I can navigate to
the full breadth of the catalog by just tapping here at the top. And here, I have
hundreds and hundreds of magazines. I can ﬁnd my sports, my music, my travel. I
can ﬁnd the entire newsstand that Tim referred to right here on my iPad.
And that's the new Apple News Plus, the best mobile magazine experience ever.
Back to you, Roger.
Thank you, Wyatt.
I think Apple News Plus is awesome. No one has ever made digital magazines as
gorgeous and readable as this. Whether you like to read whole issues cover to cover
or individual articles, Apple News Plus is the best way to read magazines on your
device.
But Apple News Plus is about more than magazines. Apple News Plus also includes
some of the most popular, premium digital subscriptions like the theSkimm. But we
didn't stop there. Apple News Plus also includes the country's largest metropolitan
newspaper and a rising star, the L.A. Times. And I'm super proud to announce that
Apple News Plus also includes one of the world's top newspapers, The Wall Street
Journal. And of course, Apple News Plus is built on a foundation of expert human
curation and industry-leading personalization. So ﬁnding what you're looking for in
that incredible collection of content is as easy as launching Apple News.
When we announced Apple News, we told you we designed it to be private from the
ground up. And that's still true. And it's even more important today. So sometimes
people ask us, how do we recommend the best articles for you without
compromising your privacy? The answer is we download groups of articles from our
servers and then we use on-device intelligence to make recommendations. And that
means we don't know what you read. And in addition to that, we don't allow
advertisers to track you. So what you read about at Apple News will not follow you
across the web.
So Apple News Plus, over 300 great magazines, The Wall Street Journal, the L.A.
Times, those great premium digital subscriptions, there's literally never been an oﬀer
like this before. If you were to subscribe to all of these individually, it would cost youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 26Timothy D. Cookover $8,000 per year. But with Apple News Plus, you pay $9.99 per month. And that's
not just for you. We thought this was so important, we decided to make this available
to your entire family with Family Sharing at no extra charge. Each person in your
family gets full access to that incredible catalog on their own devices with their own
favorites and their own personal recommendations. It's an amazing value.
Apple News Plus is available today. Just download today's updates of iOS and
macOS and launch Apple News. And the ﬁrst month is free. And in addition to
launching in the U.S., I'm happy to say we're also bringing Apple News and Apple
News Plus to Canada in both English and in French. And we're adding over 30 great
Canadian magazines to Apple News Plus along with the top newspaper in Canada,
the Star. And later this year, we'll be bringing Apple News Plus to Australia and we'll
be coming to Europe starting with the U.K.
So that's Apple News Plus, a premium subscription built right into Apple News that
brings you the world's best publications all in one place, built on the principles that
guide all of our services. We are super excited about this. We hope you like it.
Thanks so much. Back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
This is really important to us. We believe in the power of journalism and the impact it
can have on our lives. And we want to make a valuable contribution to the industry
and to society as a whole. We think Apple News Plus is going to be great for
customers and great for publishers.
Now let's talk about Apple Pay. We launched Apple Pay with a vision to replace the
wallet. And people are absolutely loving it. Apple Pay is the simplest, most secure
and private way to pay. And its growth has been literally oﬀ the charts. In fact, we're
on target to surpass 10 billion transactions this year.
This is huge. We're looking forward to a future where all payments are made this
way. Now retail acceptance of Apple Pay has already passed 70% in the United
States. And it's even higher in many other countries like Canada, the United
Kingdom and so many more which broadly accept Apple Pay. In Australia, we've
achieved an amazing 99% acceptance. And we've been adding more and more
countries. And by the end of this year, we expect that Apple Pay will be available in
more than 40 countries.
Apple Pay has also made riding transit easier and more convenient than ever before.
Every day, millions of customers in these cities use their iPhone or their Apple Watch
to go quickly through the turnstiles and get on their way. And I'm excited to tell you
that we're bringing Apple Pay to transit in major cities in the U.S. starting right here
on the West Coast with Portland and rolling out in Chicago and New York City later
this year.
So retail, transit apps, on the web, Apple Pay cash, there's so many ways to use
Apple Pay with its convenience, security and privacy. And it's become the preferredFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 26Jennifer Baileyway to pay for almost anything. But we want to take the Apple Pay experience even
further. And we saw an opportunity to transform another fundamental method of
payment. And that's the credit card.
With the success and momentum of Apple Pay, we have learned a lot about credit
cards. While we all need them, there's some things about the credit card experience
that could be so much better like simplifying applications, eliminating fees, lowering
interest rates, oﬀering clear and compelling rewards. And of course, providing the
security and the privacy that people have come to expect from Apple Pay.
By bringing together our hardware, software and services, we're going to do all of
this and so much more, changing the entire credit card experience. Today, we're
introducing a brand-new service. And we call it Apple Card. Apple Card was created
by Apple and built on principles that we stand for like simplicity and transparency
and privacy. To tell you all about Apple Card, I'm very pleased to invite up Jennifer
Bailey, Vice President of Apple Pay. Jennifer?
{BIO 1751198 <GO>}
With Apple Card, we have completely rethought the credit card. A new kind of card
that takes advantage of everything iPhone oﬀers, is designed for a healthier ﬁnancial
life and sets a new level for privacy and security. Apple Card is designed to take
advantage of the power of the iPhone. This means it can do all sorts of things that no
other credit card can do. For starters, you don't have to wait days to get your card.
Just sign up on your iPhone. And in just minutes, you get your Apple Card and you
can start using it right away.
You can use it worldwide anywhere with Apple Pay, in apps, in stores, on the web.
And your Apple Card will be available across all of your Apple devices. Apple Card is
also always with you because it's in your iPhone in the Wallet app. And the Wallet
app has completely new capabilities so you can see everything you need to know
about your Apple Card like what you spent, how much you spent and when your
payment is due.
We've also made it really easy to get help. With Apple Card, if you have a question,
just text us right from Messages, everything from getting details on a transaction to
letting us know your new address. It's as easy as messaging a friend.
Next, we're taking on an important challenge with Apple Card to help everyone live
a healthier ﬁnancial life. It starts with having a better understanding of your spending
so you can make smarter choices with your money. Many of you looking at your
credit card statements today might recognize transactions that look like this, cryptic
merchant names that are pretty hard to decipher. With Apple Card, we use machine
learning and Apple Maps to transform this mess into names and locations that you'll
recognize. Apple Card also automatically organizes and totals your purchases so you
can see how much you've spent and exactly where you've spent it with Apple Maps.
And you can keep track of your spending by categories like food and drink,
shopping, entertainment and more where each category is represented by its ownFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 26color, like orange for food and drink. And Apple Card also shows you how your
spending is trending week over week or month over month so you can decide in
real-time if you need to or want to change your spending.
Next up, let's talk about rewards. Most rewards programs use points. With points,
you're never quite sure how much they're worth or where or when you can use them.
With Apple Card, we want you to get the most for your money. So every time you
spend with Apple Card, you get cash back and you get it every day. It's my favorite
feature. And we call it Daily Cash. So when you're buying your morning coﬀee,
shopping for groceries and any time you pay using Apple Card, you get Daily Cash,
not a month from now. But every day.
So every day you spend, cash is added to your Apple cash card, which is also in the
Wallet app. And it's cash, like real cash. So you can do anything with it. Use it to pay
down your balance, spend it wherever you use Apple Pay or send it to friends using
Messages. In fact, every time you pay with your iPhone or Apple Watch, you'll get 2%
of the purchase amount in Daily Cash. And for purchases made directly from Apple
like from our Apple retail stores, from our App Store or when you purchase services
like Apple Music or News Plus, you get 3% Daily Cash. And the amount of Daily Cash
that you can receive every day is unlimited. So that's Daily Cash, everyday cash for
you. How great is that?
Another area where we can make a really big impact in improving your ﬁnancial
health is helping you understand how much you owe and if you want to pay it back
over time, how much it will cost you. This is how most cards show your payment
options, with an emphasis on minimum payments, which cost you a fortune in
interest and seem to be designed to keep you in debt. With Apple Card, our goal is
to help you save on interest so we start by making it easy to see a range of payment
options. And because Apple Card calculates interest in real-time, as you select
diﬀerent payment amounts, you can make a more informed payment decision,
understanding the true cost. Another way to save on interest is to pay more often,
say, biweekly or weekly. So we've added the ﬂexibility to schedule more frequent
payments.
And when we thought about a ﬁnancially healthy credit card, all the fees and high
interest rates that most banks charge are just not okay. So Apple Card does not have
any fees. No late fees, no annual fees, no international fees and no over-limit fees. No
fees, even hidden fees.
And our goal with Apple Card is to provide each customer with an interest rate that's
among the lowest in the industry. Even if you miss a payment, we won't charge you a
penalty rate, like most banks do. Our goal is to make it easier for you to pay down
your balance, not harder.
To create a credit card, you need a bank. And to create a credit card as innovative as
Apple Card, we needed a bank that was willing to do things that had never been
done in the industry before. So we partnered with Goldman Sachs as the issuingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 26Timothy D. Cookbank of Apple Card. As a newcomer to consumer ﬁnancial services, Goldman was up
for the challenge of doing something more bold and innovative. We're also excited
to be working with Mastercard who has been a fantastic partner on Apple Pay from
the start. With Mastercard's global payment network, Apple Card will be accepted all
over the world.
We also designed Apple Card to set a new level for privacy and security. Security is
totally integrated throughout the hardware and software. When you get your Apple
Card, a unique per device card number is created and stored safely in the Secure
Element, a special security chip used by Apple Pay. Each payment includes a
onetime dynamic security code, which protects your card number from being used
without your authorization. And every purchase is authenticated with Touch ID or
Face ID. With all of these security features, Apple Card is a more secure way to pay.
And Apple Card is designed with your privacy in mind. We created a unique
architecture for Apple Card where Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you
bought it or how much you paid for it. So features like spend tracking and
categorization all happen using on-device intelligence, not on Apple servers. And for
Apple Card, Goldman Sachs will never share or sell your data to third parties for
marketing or advertising.
So that's Apple Card, designed for iPhone and a healthier ﬁnancial life that sets a
new level for privacy and security. But that's not all. For those rare times when you
happen to be somewhere where Apple Pay is not yet accepted, we've designed
something for that, too. And you know when we design something, we design it to
be the best. And we'd like to show it to you now.
(presentation)
The card is titanium. And your name is laser-etched on it. It's the most beautifully
designed card ever. And your Apple Card is more secure than others. It has no card
number, no CVV, no expiration and no signature. Of course, if you ever need that
information, it's in the Wallet app.
As I noted earlier, you'll receive 3% Daily Cash for purchases made directly from
Apple, 2% daily cash for Apple Pay. And when you make a purchase with this
beautiful titanium Apple Card, you get 1% Daily Cash.
So that's Apple Card. There's never been a credit card like it before. Apple Card will
be coming to the Wallet app in the U.S. this summer. And we think you're going to
love it. Thank you. Back to you, Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Thanks, Jennifer. Great. With our hardware, software and services, we think that
Apple is uniquely positioned to make the most signiﬁcant change in the credit card
experience in 50 years. And we can't wait to get started.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25

Page 10 of 26Ann ThaiNow let's turn our attention to the App Store. Apps have reshaped the way that we
work, connect, learn and play. From day one, the App Store has been a safe and
trusted place for users to discover and download apps. We review every single app
before it goes live. We also have a team of expert editors creating rich editorial
content and curated collections of the best apps. The App Store has become the
essential destination to discover new apps, to learn more about the apps you already
have or just to meet the developers behind them. It's no wonder that the App Store
is now visited by over half a billion people each week.
Now the most popular category on the App Store is games. In fact, iOS has become
the largest gaming platform in the world. We want to make gaming even better. To
tell you more about what we have planned, I'm pleased to bring up Ann Thai, Senior
Product Marketing Manager of the App Store. Ann?
Thanks, Tim. Many games on the App Store are not just hits but also cultural
phenomenons. You know about them regardless of whether you've played them.
They become part of pop culture like the many Fortnite emotes we've seen on the
playing ﬁeld. And to all of this, it's no surprise when there have been over 1 billion
people who have downloaded games from the App Store. The App Store supports a
vibrant gaming community of players of all ages and backgrounds from around the
world with a catalog of nearly 300,000 games. The App Store has both free and
paid games. Free games are either supported by advertising or have in-app
purchases like Clash Royale. These are incredibly popular. And hundreds of millions
of people love playing them.
With paid games, customers pay upfront for the full experience like Monument
Valley 2. These games often have incredible stories and capture your imagination
with their original art and music. They are some of the most critically acclaimed
games ever made. But competing with free is hard. So these games haven't been as
successful for developers and they haven't been as easy to ﬁnd for players. We think
we've come up with a great new way to bring more of these amazing games to more
people than ever before.
We are working with some of the most creative game developers in the world on a
new kind of service designed speciﬁcally for games like these, a service that is giving
them the freedom to do the best work of their lives. We call it Apple Arcade.
Apple Arcade is the world's ﬁrst game subscription service for mobile, desktop and
living room. With Apple Arcade, we have curated a collection of brand-new games
that redeﬁne games. And we're not just curating them, we're backing their
development. And our team is working closely with developers to bring these
games to life. We are really excited about this and so are the creators we're working
with. Let's hear from some of them now.

Page 11 of 26Timothy D. CookThese developers are some of the greatest storytellers and artists in the world. From
immersive AR to groundbreaking multiplayer, they are creating games that have
never been possible before. These games are insanely fun and will appeal to the kid
in all of us. And with Apple Arcade, you'll get to play all of these games. With a
single subscription, you'll get access to over 100 new and exclusive games that will
raise the bar for what's possible in gaming. You won't ﬁnd these games on any other
mobile platform or in any other subscription service.
So how will you get to Apple Arcade? Apple Arcade will be a new area right on the
App Store with its own dedicated tab. Rather than pay upfront for each game, your
subscription will allow you to download and play any Apple Arcade game from the
App Store. And we'll be adding new games all the time. With full access to this
amazing collection of new games you'll have the freedom to try whatever you want,
whenever you want. You'll be able to play Apple Arcade games across iPhone, iPad,
Mac and Apple TV and pick up where you left oﬀ in a game even if you switch
devices. And unlike streaming services, every game will be playable oﬄine so you
can play anywhere regardless of your Internet connection.
All Apple Arcade games will be all you can play so all game features, content and
future updates will be included. There will be no ads and no additional purchases
needed. And parents can manage their kids' access with our screen time features.
Like all our products and services, we've designed Apple Arcade to be a great
experience. The App Store already works hard to protect your privacy. With Apple
Arcade, we're taking it even further. Apple Arcade games cannot collect any data
about you nor track any information about how you play their games without your
consent. Also, Apple Arcade will be curated by our team of expert editors, oﬀer
personalized recommendations and your family will be able to enjoy it for no
additional charge.
We really think you're going to love Apple Arcade, a game subscription service
unlike any other. You'll enjoy over 100 amazing new and exclusive games. And more
games will be added all the time.
So who's ready to see more of these incredible games? Here's a sneak peek of some

experiences, from the ﬁrst TV shows that you could download right to your iPod to
the best-in-class cinematic picture and sound quality of today's Apple TV 4K. We've
done it because we love TV. TV is more than just entertainment. It's cultural. TV at its

apps across your iPhone, iPad and Apple TV 4K. In fact, our vision for Apple TV app is
to bring together your favorite shows, movies, sports and news and make them
available on all of your devices so you can spend less time looking for something to

all built into the Apple TV app. If you love movies, the new Apple TV app is now the
place for you.
Next, if you subscribe to cable or satellite TV like Spectrum, DIRECTV or Optimum or
one of the new Internet live TV providers, you can now access all of your sports,
news and network TV right inside the Apple TV app. For so many people, these cable
bundles are convenient because you can get access to hundreds of channels for just
one price. If you want it all, there's no better way.
But for some of us, the big bundle is more than we need. So we designed a new TV
experience where you could pay for only the channels you want all in one app with
the password that you already have. Watch everything on-demand and ad-free.
Download your shows to take with you anywhere. Enjoy the highest quality picture
and sound available. And share this great experience with your entire family. This is
how TV should work. Now it does with Apple TV Channels. Only the channels you
want on-demand, ad-free for the entire family. And all of it is inside the new Apple TV
app. We're launching Apple TV Channels like HBO, Showtime, Starz, EPIX, CBS All
Access and everything else you see here. And we'll be adding even more around the
world.
So to recap, whether you get your TV from a live -- a streaming service like Prime
Video, Hulu or ESPN+; movies from iTunes; sports, news and network TV from cable
or satellite; or shows from HBO, Showtime and Starz with the new Apple TV
Channels, it's all together in one place: the Apple TV app. And because there is so
much to watch all in this one place, we've redesigned the Apple TV app to make it
even simpler to ﬁnd what you love.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25

Your home in the Apple TV app is watch now. Most of the time we watch TV, we want
to watch our show or tonight's game or maybe ﬁnish the movie we started last night.
That's where the up next row comes in. All of these things you watch, no matter
where they come from, are here in up next. It makes it so easy to pick up right where
you left oﬀ. But what do you do when you're all caught up on your shows? If you
know what you want to watch next, it's easy. Just use Siri. But if you don't know what
to watch, well, that's where the new Apple TV app really shines. Our expert editors
are like that friend you have that always knows the best shows on TV. Every day, they
do the work for you so you can just watch the good stuﬀ. But when it comes to TV,
each of us is unique. That's why the new Apple TV app is personalized for you. We
use advanced machine learning to understand what you like to watch from the
subscriptions you already have so we can help you ﬁnd your next favorite show. And
of course, the new Apple TV Channels are available, too. So when you subscribe to a
channel like Showtime, everything from that channel is in one place. It's so easy to
browse and you can play all of it right inside the Apple TV app. No more bouncing
from app to app.
Moving beyond watch now, we've also created a new home for movies so you can
buy or rent iTunes movies like Bumblebee or you can watch Ocean's 8 from your
new Apple Channels subscription to HBO. All your favorite movies are here. The
Apple TV app is also great for sports fans. You can see current games with live
scores, check out tonight's matchups and even get notiﬁcations when your favorite
team is having a close game.
To show you some of the cool new stuﬀ the Apple TV app can do, I'd like to bring
out Cindy Lin, director of program management. Cindy?
{BIO 18786391 <GO>}
Hi, everyone. I'm so excited to show you the new Apple TV app. The app is right here
on my home screen. Let's dive in.
Everything I'm watching is here in up next. I can pick up where I left oﬀ in the
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, watch the next episode of Project Runway or ﬁnish watching
Bumblebee.
I get my cable from Spectrum and I also have Hulu and Prime Video. It's all right here
in the Apple TV app. There's so much to watch. When I want to ﬁnd something new,
this is where the app really helps me out. It's always getting smarter about what I like.
The recommendations in "for you" are personalized just for me. I love Sandra Oh
and I've been hearing so much about this show. I'm deﬁnitely adding this to my up
next to watch later.
One of my favorite features is this new way to browse TV. Swiping is just like channel
surﬁng, except every show here is what I actually want to watch. And trailers play
right here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25

I love Jason Momoa in Game of Thrones and I can't wait to watch Aquaman. There's
already so much here. And it's so easy to add even more with Apple TV Channels.
Everybody's been talking about the new season of Billions on Showtime. And I need
to get caughup
t up. I can start my free trial right here. It's just a couple of clicks and then I'm done.
That's it. That was so easy. Now everything from Showtime is here in the Apple TV
app and I can start watching right away. There's nothing else to set up. I can skip the
intro to get right to the action. Okay. No spoilers. I'm going to pick this back up
again later from my up next.
So I have a 5-year-old son and there's a brand-new kids experience for us. All of my
son's favorite characters are here. There's Chase from Paw Patrol, Daniel Tiger. And
of course, everyone from Sesame Street. There are so many episodes here, even the
ones that I watched as a kid. And whether we want to learn something new, be
inspired by other kids or just let our imaginations run wild, I love that we have a safe
place to explore together.
So that's a quick look at the new Apple TV app. It's the best place to watch TV on all
of my devices. And I can't wait for you to try it.
Back to you, Peter.

Thanks, Cindy. Now that you've seen the new Apple TV app, you're going to want it
on all your screens. You just saw it on Apple TV 4K. It looks and sounds stunning on
iPad. And everything you saw is amazing on iPhone. So for all of those moments in
between, whether you're on your way to work or just stealing a moment for yourself,
all your shows are always with you. You'll be able to get this new experience,
including Apple TV channels on all these devices through a software update this
May. And I'm so excited to tell you that for the ﬁrst time, we're bringing the Apple TV
app to the Mac this fall.
And that's not all. We know you're going to want to this great experience on every
screen in your home. So we're doing something we've never done before. We're
bringing the Apple TV app to smart TVs. We're launching the same great experience
with Samsung this spring, followed by Sony, LG. And Vizio, all the biggest names in
smart TVs. And we're even bringing the Apple TV app to Roku and Amazon so
everyone can have an Apple TV experience on every screen. Today, the Apple TV
app is available in 10 countries. But we're bringing the all new experience to our
customers around the world in over 100 countries. The Apple TV app delivers on all
these principles, including our commitment that we won't share your personal
information with anyone. So that's the new Apple TV app. Your apps, movies, cable,

{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Thank you, Peter. The new features of the Apple TV app look really great. But we
have even more to contribute to the TV experience. Apple has always tried to make
the world a better place. And we believe deeply in the power of creativity. Our
products help people express their creativity and to tell their stories because great
stories can change the world, great stories can move us and inspire us. They can
surprise us and challenge our assumptions. We feel we can contribute something
important to our culture and to society through great storytelling. So we partnered
with the most thoughtful, accomplished and award-winning group of creative
visionaries who have ever come together in one place to create a new service unlike
anything that's been done before: Apple TV Plus. We have 2 amazing people that
are running this eﬀort for us, Zach Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht. And I'm very
pleased to introduce you to them now and ask them to tell you all about this
incredible new service. Guys?
Thanks, Tim. Jamie and I are so excited to be here with all of you today. As Tim said,
great stories can change the world. And that's because great stories connect us.
They connect us to each other. They connect us to new ideas and they even connect
us to new worlds and cultures we've never experienced. And that's important. And
it's powerful and helps connect us to something bigger than who we are as
individuals.
At Apple, we know that great stories begin and end with the incredible artists who
tell them, the artists who were thoughtful enough and brave enough to share their
best story with us and the world.
{BIO 18352282 <GO>}
We thought you'd like to meet a few of these exceptional artists, as we begin to
share our vision for a new service dedicated to the best stories ever told. We've
asked a few of them to speak about their inspiration and creative process. Because if
we're going to contribute, inspire, challenge assumptions and change the world, we
need to examine the art of great storytelling and the mindset of the greatest
storytellers. Have a look.

Jennifer AnistonNow my ﬁrst encounter with science ﬁction came from an anthology magazine called
Amazing Stories. And this magazine had been in existence for -- since 1926. And my
father had devoured it when he was a boy. And when I was a little kid, he read this to
me. And the stories he read me were, as the title promised, amazing, or so it seemed
to a 5 -year-old me. And it's relatively easy to inspire amazement in the head and
heart of a child. Kids enter into the booming confusion of life with a prodigious
capacity for amazement. And that amazement, that capacity is a human birthright. It's
our inheritance. It's how our interaction with the marvelous world around us gets
sparks ﬂying across our brains. And thanks to the visionary and inventive folks here at
Apple, my Amblin team and I are going to be resurrecting this 93-year-old brand
and oﬀering to multigenerational audiences a whole new batch of amazing stories.
And we want to transport the audience with every episode, like the World War II Pilot
whose plane magically travels through space and time from the past and into the
present day. Who will he meet? Can he return? Does he want to? What happens if he
doesn't? It's a universal human trait to search for meaning. So in these disconnected
stories, we think the audience will ﬁnd that one compelling narrative that will make
the ﬁrst season of Amazing Stories into a single thematic experience for them. And I
hope for all of you, too. Thank you.

From the unfettered imagination of Steven Knight, Sea takes place in a world in
which the earth was devastated by a virus that left only a few million survivors. And
those survivors, each and every one of them, emerged blind. Our story begins
centuries later, at which point the human race has existed for so long without sight,
it's disputed whether such a thing ever existed. In this world, we are going to have
our evil queens, brave heroes and thrilling adventure. But beyond the adventure,
Sea will ask questions you may have already started asking yourselves just now with
your eyes closed. How much of my experience of the world is visual? Without sight,
would it change who I am? This is a world constructed unlike any you've ever
experienced. Sea is a journey wherein we may discover something entirely new
about ourselves, about our world. As a result, we cannot wait for you to join us on
this journey.
Hi, Thank you. I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan. Okay. Pakistan's in the house. Hi. What I
knew of America, I learned from Hollywood movies and American TV shows. So
when I was moving to America at the age of 18, I was excited. I was excited about the
idea of being dwarfed by skyscrapers that would loom above the horizon to herald
my arrival. Then I landed in Iowa. Okay. Iowa is here, too. And I thought, this is very
diﬀerent from the America in movies. You don't -- you guys don't lead with that
America, you know? I'd miss the one movie that would have prepared me for that
America, Iowa, Field of Dreams, did not see that one. I was like, this is false
advertising. This is not the America I was promised. I was one of two Pakistanis at the
college I went to. But I have found common ground with people. My love of
Springsteen, their curiosity about how to say various swearwords in Urdu. She could
help you out, too. I once made a huge pot of this Pakistani beef stew called halim.
And I misread the recipe and put in twice the amount of chili powder. I lost a lot of
friends that day. They didn't, like, die. They just wished they were dead. Eventually, I
moved to Chicago and I did what every American does. I struggled to pay rent, fell
in love, got jobs, lost jobs, got a cat, burned food, disappointed my parents and tried
to ﬁgure out what to do with my life. Normal everyday life stuﬀ.
When people defend immigration, they focus on the exceptionality of immigrants.
Albert Einstein was an immigrant. Joseph Pulitzer was an immigrant.
While those stories are inspiring and valuable, we wanted to focus on the immigrants
doing everyday life stuﬀ. Little America is an anthology series inspired by the true
stories of immigrants in the U.S. Here's the thing, we -- it's not about telling like
immigrant stories, these are human stories that feature immigrants. When you get to
know someone and start to see your struggles in their struggles, your passions in
theirs, your problems in theirs, they stop being the other. I, along with my partners,
Emily Gordon, Lee Eisenberg, Alan Yang and Epic Magazine wanted to make a show
that did just that, because ultimately, we're all looking for the same thing. Food,
home, meaning, love. Like the emotional story of a young Indian boy living in Utah,
whose parents achieved the American dream of running their own motel, until they
were suddenly deported. 12-year-old Kunal wasn't going to let his parents' dreamFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25

Page 20 of 26Unidentiﬁed Participantdie. So this young boy secretly ran the motel for the next 10 years on his own, while
simultaneously plotting his quest to get his parents back to the U.S. Okay, true story.
He competed in the National Spelling Bee so that he could meet First Lady Laura
Bush and ask for help. And he came in 13th and he actually got to meet her. He did. I
know you guys are like, 13th doesn't sound that impressive. But he was running a
motel at the time, too. And he speaks a whole other language. Did Laura Bush help
him? Tune in to ﬁnd out.
Little America will cover the full range of human emotions. Some episodes are funny,
some are romantic, some are thrilling. They feature immigrants from Iran, Syria,
Nigeria, Mexico and more and are set all over America from Texas to Oklahoma to
California. The majority of the writers and directors are either immigrants or the
children of immigrants. Yes. On set, one of our actors said to Emily, "I have been
acting for decades. But I have never gotten to be in every scene." How awesome is
that? We hope Little America will help viewers understand that there is no such thing
as the other. There is only us. Which is why at this moment in history, we are excited
that we get to tell these stories with Apple. Connecting humanity is in their DNA.
The immigrant dream is the American dream. Connecting through our stories will
give us a better understanding of each other. An understanding that allows us to live
together, eat each other's food, maybe learn some fun new ways of swearing. And
that is the America I was promised. We can't wait for you to see our little America.
Thank you.

consciousness and to build greater awareness through compelling conversations
with newsmakers, with leaders, with artists, with people in all walks of life. I want to
reach that sweet spot where insight and perspective, truth and tolerance actually
intersect.
So I have 2 documentaries in the works right now, one exploring the toll of sexual
harassment, assault and violation in the workplace. The working title is, Toxic Labor.
The other yet unnamed multipart series, focuses on mental health and how this
scourge of depression and anxiety, posttraumatic stress, addiction, trauma and loss
is just devastating lives daily across the globe. And what I know is, if we do our jobs
right, we're going to replace shame. And we're going to replace stigma with
wisdom, with some compassion and with honesty.
And now for what I love the most, for me there is nothing more thrilling than being
transported by a brilliant book. Nothing. And the only thing actually more gratifying
than an extraordinary read is being able to share that experience with others. And
we're going to do just that by building the biggest, the most vibrant, the most
stimulating book club on the planet. It as a club -- listen to this. Imagine where Apple
stores stream a conversation with the author and me live across all devices, across all
borders, uniting people through stories that remind us that no matter who you are orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-03-25

Timothy D. Cookwhere you're from, every man, woman and child looks up in awe at the same sky. So I
want to literally convene a meeting of the minds, connecting us through books.
For as long as I can remember, I've had this dream that for us all to someday realize
that deep potential that we are each born to, it abides in every soul, I know this to be
true. And my deepest hope is that we all, humans, get to become the fullest version
of ourselves as human beings to join in the mission and vision for our common
good, to leave this world more enlightened, kinder and better than we found it. And
to move together 1 billion plus strong into a future of our own design, all connected
through Apple. Thank you.

Thank you for the opportunity.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
Thank you. I will never forget this. Okay.
Oprah joins these amazingly passionate and award-winning artists. These are people
who we admire for their unique voices, incredible creativity and wonderfully diverse
perspectives. They've impacted our culture, society. And we're so excited and so
humbled to be working with them. We can't wait to hear all of the incredible stories
that they are going to tell.
What a fun morning. From everything we've shared with you, you can see how
important these services are for us and for all the ways they extend the experiences
of our customers even further. They entertain, inspire, inform and enrich our lives
because at Apple, the customer is and always will be at the center of everything that
we do.
Now before I close, I'd like everyone from Apple that worked so hard in making
today possible to stand up so that we can recognize you. They've sacriﬁced a lot to
get us to this day. And I sincerely thank you. It's amazing, the privilege of a lifetime
that I have to be able to work with all of them. I want to thank everyone for coming. I
want to thank all the artists that came out today and shared time with us. And most of
all, thank you to all the folks watching, our customers. Thank you, bye-bye.
