Presentation
Welcome everyone, to a conversation between Bernd Leukert, the Chief Technology,
Data and Innovation Oﬃcer at Deutsche Bank; and Rob Enslin, President of Global
Customer Operations for Google Cloud. I'm Jennifer Courant. I'm the Chief Data
Oﬃcer at Deutsche Bank. I welcome you to this conversation.
Some of the statements that Mr. Enslin may make today could be considered
forward-looking. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to diﬀer materially. Any forward statements that Mr. Enslin
makes are based on assumptions as of today. Alphabet undertakes no obligation to
update them. Please refer to Alphabet's most recent Form 10-K for a discussion of
the risk factors that may aﬀect its results. Bernd, let's get started. Can you tell us what
you expect out of the partnership with Google and why you chose them?
Questions And Answers
{BIO 18057642 <GO>}
Sure. I think we have huge expectations and high ambitions in that strategic
partnership. And let me start that it's simply, we want to create signiﬁcant value for
our customers, for our clients by becoming a cloud-based company in the ﬁnancial
industry. And Google will help Deutsche Bank to modernize the technology
infrastructure but as well to modernize the way we work.
And with that, I think harnessing and leveraging the Google Cloud technology will
allow us to create new digital oﬀerings in the engagements with our customers and
let's say a better opportunity to win permanently market share. The partnership will
not only drive cost savings, what some might assume, but also and this is probably
the most important thing, increase revenue and with that, value through customer
engagement that is fundamentally new for the ﬁnancial service industry.
So it will enable a cultural transformation for Deutsche Bank, which goes signiﬁcantly
beyond technology. This is an entire mindset for our employees and we want toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-01

A - Robert Enslinlearn and engage a lot from the Google engineers. We want to jointly innovate and
leverage leading-edge technologies which exist today but which Google will have in
the pipeline going forward and then provide exciting opportunities for our talent.
We want to be the most attractive ﬁnancial service industry company on this planet. I
can share with you that since we announced the partnership, we see already a
signiﬁcant change on that.
And now, Jen, you ask, why Google? I think I have to admit, this was not clear from
the beginning. We started with a due diligence phase. We had a contest with several
technology companies. Then at the end, it was the delivery capability, the
partnership that Google has demonstrated across the entire proof-of-concept life
cycle. We started with a few showcases and Google has permanently outperformed
the others in terms of delivery, in terms of engagement and this in record time.
Then the second important element was in terms of the leadership commitment
from Rob, but I would say the entire Google leadership that was fundamental on
how the leadership between the 2 companies have worked together, how we build a
partnership and how each member of the leadership was essential in framing such a
strategic partnership, which Deutsche Bank has never done before.
And that was conﬁrmed in many dialogues. I would say the partnership was already
present while we had the proof of concept. So we leveraged the skill, the capabilities
and the competencies in our daily business while we were still in the evaluation
phase, which was creating, I would say a lot of trust and conﬁdence that it's a perfect
ﬁt.
Thank you, so much, Bernd. Rob, coming to you. We know that Google has a number
of relationships with ﬁnancial services companies. What do you see that are common
requirements or needs in our industry with regard to cloud?
{BIO 16346176 <GO>}
Yes. First, look, we're exceptionally grateful and proud of the partnership we have
with Deutsche Bank and what we're going to do together in ﬁnancial services and
the innovation that we will bring to this industry, utilizing much of the technology
that Google has. So really exceptionally proud to work with Bernd and Christian and
the whole Deutsche Bank team.
But when you look at 2 primary needs we see across ﬁnancial services, it's the need
to modernize the foundational technologies to drive eﬃciencies, scale, and move
more quickly, faster, have speed, have access to new capabilities, unlock the value of
data assets that most of these ﬁnancial service institutions have locked up,
leveraging cloud to drive business transformation.
We are seeing many diﬀerent forms of this, but generally, the needs are focused in 3
key areas: growing with existing customers, reach new ones as traditional
distribution models are changing, being able to bring FSI products and capabilitiesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-01

A - Bernd Leukertto wherever customers are and provide richer and more personalized interactions;
drive cost and operational eﬃciency to address the industry's expertise and expense
pressures, eliminate paper, automate routine operations, drive more do-it-yourself
capabilities and manage the risk and regulatory requirements. These are increasing
for ﬁnancial institutions, so we have to automate controls, leverage data to make
better risk management decisions and speed up the risk and reporting process.
Thanks, Rob. Bernd, the contract for the partnership was signed in December last
year. What has been achieved in these last ﬁve months?
{BIO 18057642 <GO>}
Yes, only ﬁve months but it felt that the partnership is much longer. So we have built
a lot of momentum. We are building the cloud foundations with 20-plus application
landing zones now live already. The teams are developing design blueprints that we
will reuse for other applications, migrating to GCP in the upcoming months and
years. So we are not making the mistake some companies did on everybody just
getting started and then there has to be a reset button pressed in order to have an
eﬃcient and scalable way of moving to the cloud.
In addition, we have a full secure network connectivity between Deutsche Bank and
GCP and the networks in Europe established. We have, as we speak, approximately
50 GCP services that we have hardened, that we have made available on the landing
zones for secure consumption in the native environment on GCP. We have also been
testing Google's AI and machine learning capabilities. Of course there is huge
excitement to explore these capabilities in various areas.
So in general, this reﬂects my core belief that the future of ﬁnancial services will not
be based on, let's say integrated oﬀerings only. Therefore, we will move away from a
classic vendor model, which we have done for the last decades and move more into
where we need, we want to buy ready-made solutions or ready-made services and
rather move in that collaboration towards a strategic partnership. With Google as a
leading technology company, we are convinced that we can conquer and we can co-
innovate in the future in the ﬁnancial service industries.
And if we stay Jen, on use cases, a large part of our audience are clients of the
investment bank and the corporate bank, and there are really a couple of interesting
use cases, a tremendous amount of opportunities. But we said we want to start with
dedicated use cases. And an example here is asset-as-a-service, where in the past, I
think we have sold our ﬁnancial service capabilities to the CFO, to the treasurer of
corporations. But now with the service enablement and the transformation of the
business model of our customers, we want to embed our ﬁnancial services into the
business model.
And what is the new thing when customers are transitioning from selling products
towards oﬀering outcome, which is the service the product gives, we want to be the
ﬁnancial ingredient in that capability. Another example is contextual banking, so an
understanding of our customers very deeply through the understanding of the data.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-01

A - Robert EnslinSo the ability to create a platform that enables our corporate clients to manage their
order-to-cash process much more eﬃciently, and again of course leveraging
capabilities like machine learning.
And through an application, they can gain access to their invoices, to their credit
notes, to their debit notes, to their promotional eﬀorts, to their available ﬁnancing
and then further enable them to make payments through one of various electronic
payment options, and this is all available on an app at ﬁngertip. The platform will
also enable our clients to manage their counterparty risk, which is getting more and
more important, of course through a built-in risk solution, where we feel we have a
very strong advantage against many competitors.
And ﬁnally, not to forget that it will allow us to bring together ﬁntech companies with
Deutsche Bank capabilities and oﬀer a solution that is integrated, that is embedded,
that is frictionless, again to the advantage of our clients. So a tremendous amount of
opportunities.
No, absolutely, absolutely. I know it's very exciting not just internally but for all of our
clients. Rob, that really brings us quite nicely into ﬁntechs, and this year's conference
has an additional focus on ﬁntech companies. In your experience, how do you think
the partnership can beneﬁt from the expertise and innovation coming from the start-
up community?
{BIO 16346176 <GO>}
Yes, good question, and it's really good to see that the ﬁntechs are part of this year's
conference. Look, ﬁntechs are keen to partner with ﬁnancial institutions, banks and
are rapidly developing strong focus areas of expertise around ML and AI. They've
been able to use it via the cloud and through open APIs, which will accelerate the
bank's ability to innovate faster and work with best-in-class technology companies. I
mean this is really important.
Many ﬁntech start-ups oﬀer machine learning platforms both already on Google
Cloud, enabling banks to evolve relationships with their clients. If you take an
example like a ﬁntech ML-powered platform that can learn from de-identiﬁed
customer data to accurately predict additional products and services, deepening the
relationship between a bank and its clients or machine learning that allows this
approach to achieve a high success rate in much less time than the required
traditional manually supervised approaches, this is really key.
The beneﬁts of this approach, though, are bidirectional. So what I mean? Large
banking institutions have a rich understanding of transactional data that is typically
beyond the reach of ﬁntech start-ups. Banks can provision synthetic data sets
resembling actual customer data, providing ﬁntech start-ups with better data on
which to train these models. This creates a ﬂywheel eﬀect, enabling both the bank,
the ﬁntech start-up to rapidly progress with each other's help. This, I believe, adds
tremendous value to your customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-01

Page 5 of 7A - Jennifer Courant
A - Bernd Leukert
A - Robert EnslinAbsolutely, absolutely. You touched on probably the topic that is nearest and dearest
to my heart, which is data as the data oﬃcer for DB. I wouldn't let the opportunity to
be able to ask both of you questions to go by without getting more in detail on this.
I'm so excited about the opportunities we have around AI, around machine learning,
around really creating innovative products for our client. How are you both ensuring
that the bank can maximize the insights that we get from our data in the most
compliant way possible to ensure the safety and security of our clients' data but for
the beneﬁt of our client? Bernd, maybe you could go ﬁrst?
{BIO 18057642 <GO>}
Sure. I think ﬁrst of all, our role is that we have to ensure that the data is of high
quality, is complete and is able to be applied in machine learning, in artiﬁcial
intelligence in order to get the beneﬁts out of the data. And how do we want to do
that? We want to get rid of the siloed business information warehouses, which we
have today one for ﬁnance, one for treasury, one for risk and rather move and create
a secure data lake in the cloud, which we call the data factory.
Then we can converge analytics, we can converge all kinds of usage, all kinds of
reporting, reporting on this shared data across the various domains, across the
various businesses and establish kind of a single source of truth for the data which
we manage. Then we can build on that and provide tools for easier access of data so
that the business teams can increase their data literacy and we can empower citizen
data scientists to leverage this.
And I just had last week a session with our colleagues from the private bank. One
guy was saying, oh, this allows us with that insight that we can introduce new
products, new capabilities within days or weeks, while today it takes months,
sometimes up to a year, is a tremendous beneﬁt of reacting to a fast-changing
environment in the business. And ﬁnally, to provide data in a more, I would say real-
time fashion so that we can use data and the analytics to drive but as well to measure
a wide variety of processes which we have in the company and including key
operational processes where we have a tremendous need to automate but as well
not just to automate the process as it is today to re-engineer a process and make it
leaner. So this is what we expect from data. With that, Rob, any comments from your
side?
{BIO 16346176 <GO>}
Yes, Bernd. Let me make a couple. Let me just step back, right? Our company
mission at Google is to organize the world's information and make it universally
accessible and useful. In Google Cloud, our technology and expertise in real-time
data and analytics enables customers to extract unique insights to make real-time
decisions. So by partnering with us, you can ensure that you'll remain on the cutting
edge of world-class tooling and Google-built models.
We are constantly innovating. Just last week, we launched Vertex AI, a managed
machine learning platform that empowers companies to more quickly, easy manageFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-01

Page 6 of 7A - Jennifer Courant
A - Bernd Leukertmodels, allowing them to keep pace with dynamic business needs. Vertex AI
requires nearly 80% fewer lines of code versus competitive platforms, enabling data
scientists and machine learning engineers to work more eﬃciently and build and
manage these models much faster, improving their entire development life cycle.
And Google Cloud provides ﬁnancial institutions with underlying technology tools to
keep pace with this. Apigee open banking API is an example, which simpliﬁes and
accelerates secure delivery of open banking compliant APIs, allowing banks to
connect and build entirely new consumer-facing services. Contact Center AI enables
virtual agents to converse naturally with customers and expert human agents on
complex cases. Lending DocAI really transforms the home loan experience by
crushing paper. It reduces processing time and streamlines data capture.
And we're doing it in a safe, secure and compliant way. Our trusted infrastructure
does not rely on a single technology to make it secure, and we build security
through progressive layers. Our security products leverage the power of Google's
infrastructure and intelligence to help you power your security teams, reducing the
complexity of managing security at scale and lowering the cost of protecting your
users' applications and data in the cloud.
And when it comes to compliance, Google Cloud provides you with a globally
consistent regulated cloud environment with support for industry security and
privacy compliance requirements around the world, working closely with
organizations across Europe to stay ahead of regulatory concerns for our customers
and your customers. Our ecosystem of security technology partners constantly
brings new existing security innovations to our cloud services. So you look at that,
that's how we actually are partnering and that's how we secure your data and make
certain that you are beneﬁting with Google Cloud.
Thanks so much, Rob. Bernd, I think we're almost at the end of our time together
today. Can I ask you one last question? What do you expect from the partnership in
the next few months, in the short term and over the coming years as we continue to
build our partnership with Google?
{BIO 18057642 <GO>}
So in the short term, we are really focused on the core objective of the partnership,
which is migration and modernization and rearchitecting our entire application
portfolio into the cloud, with the beneﬁt of having elasticity, of having reliability, of
having mission-critical applications that simply run. And ﬁnally as well, when we talk
about our apps to be cloud-ﬁrst, it's about speed. It's about providing ideas into
concepts, into value, into service oﬀerings to our customers, which we have not been
able to do it at the speed we desired in the past.
Then second, of course to reiterate that, we want to onboard ﬁntechs. We want to
partner. That is new for Deutsche Bank. That was a closed shop. And now we want to
integrate them into our oﬀering.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-01

A - Robert EnslinWe have a tremendous opportunity on giving them access to our huge customer
base, and while on the other side, enabling them to consume our services because
when we moved to the cloud, it was quite cumbersome for them to be
complementary in the past. Why not teaming up and oﬀering the services which we
oﬀer to the customers as well to them?
Finally, I think the co-creation of products and services, but this has a longer time
horizon. But we want to solve the evolving challenges of our clients and support
entirely new business model. Eventually I think we want this partnership to set in
motion a cultural reset and I would say an essential driver of our entire
transformation that has engineering, that has software, that has technology at its
core.
Thank you, so much. I want to thank both of you for spending time with me today. I
was really excited and proud to be part of this, and thank you really for sharing your
insights.
