Page 2 of 44Laxman NarasimhanAnd we appreciate you taking time to be with us here in person and virtually, as we
know this is a busy week for everyone.
So, over the next hour, you're going to hear from our presentations from our
executive leadership team, and then we're going to transition into questions. And
then we'll wrap up by about 6 p.m. Eastern Time, and then we'll invite those in the
room to join us for a mix and mingle.
So, just a few housekeeping items ﬁrst. We had our forward-looking statements
shown before the start of this presentation. We hope you all took a look at those.
And at the end of our meeting, we will have all presentations that you see today up
on our website at investorrelations.com.
So, with that, let's take a minute to remind you of our heritage, and then Laxman will
join us on the stage.

{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Welcome, everyone. Thank you for being here. Starbucks is an iconic brand that has
changed how people connect over coﬀee worldwide. We are a partner-centric
company, an innovation-led company, a digital and technology company, a global
company, a company that challenges the status quo. And as a result, we deliver
enduring shareholder returns. We transform so that we can continue to uplift the
everyday and have transformed every few years in the 52 years of our existence.
In that spirit, Howard Schultz launched the reinvention plan in September 2022 to
reset the business for even greater long-term success. The focus of our reinvention
plan was to elevate the experiences in our stores, for our partners, and through our
partners, for our customers.
Our reinvention was designed to reaccelerate growth through focus on four key
building blocks: comp stores growth; store growth; margin expansion; and ﬁnally,
disciplined capital execution -- allocation to collectively establish a more durable
business model.
We have strong early momentum on every key metric of our reinvention plan as
evidenced in this morning's Q4 and ﬁscal year 2023 record earnings results. Globally
in the full year, we grew comps at 8%, revenues at 12%, and earnings at 20%.
Based on the momentum we see and prevailing trends, we set strong guidance for
ﬁscal year 2024 to grow comps 5% to 7%, with revenue growth at the low end of the
10% to 12% range and earnings growth of 15% to 20%, reﬂecting our conﬁdence in
the multiple parts we have to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

Page 3 of 44This afternoon's session is about what comes next. Building on this incredible
heritage, momentum and a mission grounded in human connection, we have
limitless opportunity. But to achieve what is limitless, we need to address what limits
us. We have always striven to be a diﬀerent kind of company. And to continue to do
so, we need to recognize we operate in a diﬀerent kind of world.
We've successfully created a theater in the front of our stores, but we need to
strengthen the factory in the back. We see a long runway of high return investment
opportunities and changes that we believe will make us more eﬃcient and
strengthen this factory in the back, enable operational excellence at scale, and
ensure we achieve our fullest potential. We want to therefore share our ambition and
strategies with you, so you too can see the multiple paths to achieving our targets.
Earlier this year, as I took on the CEO role, and with this team that you will see later,
we refounded the company and evolved Starbucks' mission, promises, and values
while taking a deep look at the business and its long-term opportunities. As you
know, I immersed myself in the business for six months, where I met and connected
with partners around the globe and in all parts of the business. I am really excited by
the energy and passion I found, by the strengths and advantages the company has,
and even more so, by the opportunity ahead.
I truly believe that we have a rock-solid foundation for which to build signiﬁcantly, to
reimagine the third place, for more people, in more places, at more times of the day,
in more ways than just in the store and build more human connection at a time when
we need it more than ever.
We've always said we are in the business of human connection. Our previous
mission was beautiful and it served us wonderfully, but it had been written before
the iPhone was launched. We wanted to bring human connection more explicitly into
our mission and give agency to our baristas. Every single one of their action leads to
a higher order purpose. It reﬂects the digital nature of the business, so the
conversation is both in the physical as well as in digital communities.
Our recrafted mission builds on the amazing heritage and history of the Starbucks
brand and shines a light on the diﬀerence we know we can make in this world.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
With every cup, with every conversation, with every community, we nurture the
limitless possibilities of human connection. This mission is our North Star. Guiding us
in delivering this mission, we looked at the promises we've made to our stakeholders
over the years and how we have lived up to those promises.
When we're at our best, we promise our partners a bridge to a better future. This
language coming directly from our store manager in our Pike Place store. For our
customer, at our best, we promise to uplift the everyday, that one moment each dayFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 44to feel connected. At our best, our farmer promise is we ensure the future of coﬀee
for all. This is painted on the walls of our farmer support center in Costa Rica.
At our best, in each of our communities, we want to make sure we contribute
positively, whether that's in Shanghai, in Seattle, in the virtual Leaf Rakers Society, or
via our Odyssey platform. At our best, our environmental promise is to give more
than we take. We will leave our planet better than we found it and make
sustainability part of every decision.
And ﬁnally, to our shareholders, at our best, we promise to generate enduring, long-
term returns. And this is not new for this company.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
Each of these promises is part of our DNA. And as you saw, we've been making
strides towards each of them. Today, we're taking the next step in the re-founding,
building on the mission and laying out our long-term strategy.
Now, much like a Starbucks order, we're calling it the Tripleshot Reinvention. And like
a Starbucks order, the Tripleshot Reinvention in this case comes with two pumps, an
order that will deliver signiﬁcant long-term shareholder value.
In a minute, my leadership team will give you deeper insights into each part of our
strategy. The Tripleshot starts with elevating the brand. Sara Trilling and Brady
Brewer will speak to how we will elevate the brand by running better stores,
elevating the experience through purpose-deﬁned stores and an accelerated
renovation of our network and through further product innovation.
Next, strengthening and scaling digital. Brady and Deb Hall Lefevre will discuss how
we will grow customers and visits through Starbucks Rewards, innovate faster on
digital, and add features and oﬀers by enhancing our technology infrastructure with
some exciting new partnerships and collaborations that we are exploring, at a time
when we are seeing arguably the largest architectural shift in technology in a
generation.
Further, becoming truly global. Michael Conway and Belinda Wong will show you
how we intend to become truly global, focusing on store growth around the world,
underpinned by the global opportunity we see for a coﬀee culture and by the strong
unit economics we see.
And the Tripleshot Reinvention is customized with two pumps. First, a pump of
unlocking eﬃciency. Rachel Ruggeri and Sara Kelly will talk about how progress on
our foundational reinvention plan has opened new doors for us to gain even more
eﬃciencies outside and inside the store, enabling investment for revenue growth
and for margin expansion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 44Sara TrillingAnd ﬁnally, the second pump, reinvigorating the partner culture. Ensuring that our
culture embodies our values is fundamental to me and I want to take the time to talk
about the evolution of our culture to drive our growth.
These together drive our plan going forward to deliver long-term sustainable
growth. We will share exciting announcements, progress made, work currently
underway, and also how we will track our progress. I am really excited to be leading
Starbucks at this amazing inﬂection point.
Let me start with Elevate the Brand. I want us to delve deeper into this ﬁrst area. We
start with strength. The brand is very strong. It is iconic. It is durable. It's attracting a
new generation of customers and becoming more global each year.
And the brand has range. It is the number one specialty coﬀee brand in 86 markets.
The number one in premium coﬀee in grocery retail. The number one ready-to-drink
coﬀee in major markets around the world. And this brand is highly digital. It works in
the traditional stores you're familiar with, and it ﬁts well with stores that are in places
with a lot of heritage, like our very traditional tatami-carpeted Kyoto store.
It also ﬁts into environments with the most cutting-edge art, like we have at the Kyoto
BAL store, which is just 10 minutes away from that traditional store. I believe strongly
that the most distinctive brands of the world have a great set of functional beneﬁts,
and we oﬀer a great set of emotional beneﬁts that link, in a lot of ways, to what our
functional beneﬁts are.
But the truly distinctive brands also deliver a spiritual beneﬁt, and in our case, human
connection. Starbucks does just that when our partners deliver our global brand
through approximately 400 million customer occasions each week at home and
away from home. We fully expect demand for Starbucks to continue to grow
materially around the world.
Building on the strong brand, Sara will share how more stores and better stores will
drive reinvention in growth. Sara Trilling.
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
Welcome, everyone. Welcome. It is so wonderful to have you all here joining us this
afternoon. So North America is made up of over 17,800 stores across U.S. and
Canada, including both company-operated and licensed. And yet, as Laxman
shared, we have so much opportunity for continued growth. What I'm here to share
today are the multiple and proven paths to improve our partner and customer
experience while elevating the brand and improving margins.
Over the course of the last year, we've sharpened our purpose-deﬁned store
strategy, shored up our operational execution, and enhanced our operating system.
We saw great success in our approach, learned many lessons along the way, and are
conﬁdent we can apply our learnings across our global store portfolio.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 44As I've traveled the U.S. from rural towns to densely populated cities, I have no
doubt there is abundant opportunity to continue to serve the strong demand we
shared in our earnings call this morning. We've seen our average weekly sales
outpace pre-COVID levels by double digits, with high attach rates and across
dayparts. This means more customers, more orders per customer, and an
opportunity to serve those customers better.
To capture that demand, we'll build more new stores with new formats in new cities
and cities we're already in. So to be clear, Starbucks has not saturated the U.S.
market. It also means unlocking capacity in our existing stores. Stores are at times
packed, which doesn't always create the best experience. We're serving customers
through as many as four channels simultaneously. We've got Cafe, Drive-Thru,
Mobile Order & Pay, and most recently, Delivery. Designing stores that are purpose-
deﬁned will, ﬁrst, unlock capacity; second, simplify operations; third, make it easier
to be a partner, all enhancing the overall customer experience.
As we shared this morning, our U.S. business will grow stores in ﬁscal '24 by
approximately 4% on a base of over 16,300, growing well over 20,000 over time. We
see a tremendous opportunity to better leverage our footprint to serve really what
are the evolving needs of our customers. Innovation, speciﬁcally in our store formats
to purpose-deﬁned stores like pickup, like drive-thru only, like double-sided drive-
thru, and delivery only really allows us to better meet our customers where they're at
and to do so through diﬀerentiated experiences.
So, for example, we see an increasing shift towards convenience, evidenced by
growth in Mobile Order & Pay and Delivery, which when we combine them, reached
31% of sales in Q4. It's up more than 30% from just a year ago.
Pickup stores. They represent only 1% of our portfolio today in the U.S., but they play
an increasingly important role to support inﬁll and in doing so, really load balance
the increased demand we're seeing in our existing stores, using our digital app, it'll
help in navigation.
So today, less than 4% of sales are delivery and less than 1% of our portfolio is
delivery-only stores. And yet this business is growing rapidly and expected very soon
to be well over $1 billion in sales. By 2025, we expect to serve nearly 40% of our
delivery orders through our delivery-only stores, so again, alleviating pressure in our
most capacity-constrained stores.
Drive-thru. Drive-thru will remain an important focus for our stores as well. So for
customers that want a quick and on-the-go experience, the drive-thru-only stores,
they are the perfect format because they maximize both throughput along with
service. And of course, we have our cafes and our elevated roastery and reserve
experiences for in-store occasions. So the traditional third place will remain a
critically important part of our portfolio really long into the future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 44Brady BrewerOur stores are designed intentionally to meet various need states, as well as for
accessibility along with sustainability. In fact, we expect to triple our greener store
portfolio over the next three years. So with this purpose-deﬁned strategy in place, it's
really hard not to see the opportunities for increasing our store count in every market
in North America. But let's talk a minute beyond new store growth, because we also
have an opportunity for growth in our existing portfolio of stores.
So, one example. We've created a set of operational standards for Mobile Order &
Pay that launched this fall, and it will improve customer engagement speciﬁcally at
the point of pickup. The standards we're creating create consistency in the
experience across our portfolio, and it's that experience that brings our customers
back for incremental occasions.
Additionally, we've built a single system of metrics to evaluate our performance
across the full suite of our U.S. company-operated store portfolio. This enables us to
drive operational excellence, but to do so systematically and to do so at scale. We've
invested in new and more eﬃcient equipment across our stores, which unlocks
capacity, and it improves the partner experience. So, this is supporting record levels
of demand, as evidenced by our most recent performance.
So we're going to leverage our renovation strategy, which is increasing to nearly
1,000 stores per year, to upgrade our stores while also controlling costs. So the
upgrades include things like Siren System, which we introduced at our Investor Day
last call. So not only do refreshment dispense, along with our cold-pressed Cold
Brew, help meet this increasing growth in cold beverages, but Siren System also
creates the backbone of our new operating system.
So importantly, these enhancements can be applied at scale and across our stores,
really, around the world. So as you can see, we have multiple paths to better serve
our customers by elevating the brand through improved operations and enhanced
partner experiences. Our strong performance this past year in revenue growth and
margin expansion demonstrate great strides in our purpose-deﬁned store strategy,
operational execution, enhanced operating system with more to come.
So we remain laser-focused on making it easier to be a partner in our stores so that
they can connect with our customers, because this is the best predictor of a repeat
visit.
So now let me turn it over to Brady. He's going to share a little bit about how our
product strategy ﬁts into this vision. Brady?
{BIO 17845948 <GO>}
Thank you, Sara. Thank you, everyone. How many of you were with us last
September? About a third, a half. Okay. Well, it's good to see you again. Sara, thank
you. Today, I really want to build on Sara's points about elevating the brand, both
through the store and the partner experience. But today, I'd also like to build on the
third element, which is around product, and you heard Laxman talk about that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 44I'll share three key drivers of our product strategy that will elevate the brand and
unlock growth: targeted day-part innovation, beverage innovation, and growing
food attach. So the ﬁrst one around targeted day part innovation.
We're continuing to grow our peak morning business in North America. And while
we have grown the afternoon day-part, we see opportunities to signiﬁcantly
accelerate it. You'll see us expanding our product menus in ways that tide customers
over between lunch and dinner and this strategy has helped drive our North
America food business to nearly $6 billion annually in ﬁscal '23.
A perfect example of this is how we've served our customers' love for all-day
breakfast. Our egg sandwiches and our sous vide egg bites oﬀer customers a high-
protein, satiating recharge.
In our North America company-operated business, these all-day breakfast categories
grew 20%. With total North America sales of these products approaching $3 billion,
it grew 20% overall, but 26% in the afternoon day-part. So we know we're on to
something. And like I said, it's approaching, just these categories alone, $3 billion or
nearly half of our total North America company-operated food sales.
As we continue to innovate across our all-day and afternoon food platforms, we'll
also expand with new all-day snacking platforms and introduce an elevated fresh-
baked oﬀering over time, all in service of driving afternoon and all-day visits.
Beyond product, we're also activating our digital relationships through personalized
incentives that will entice customers to discover new products, establish new
routines, and boost all dayparts, including the afternoon. It's about the right
products, massive customer reach, and personalized marketing. And the
combination of those are a powerful business driver, as we saw in the fourth quarter
of ﬁscal '23.
The second platform is really around beverage innovation. Today, in North America,
85% of net beverage sales comes from our core beverages, which grew double
digits over the past year. Even after more than 50 years, we're still ﬁnding ways to
grow coﬀee and our core menu, a phenomenon most businesses struggle to
achieve.
10% of our sales come from returning favorites like the Pumpkin Spice Latte or the
holiday beverages that launched today and continue to grow year after year, and the
remaining 5% comes from new platform and beverage innovations that can earn
their way into a core menu item. So all of this adds up to a core beverage portfolio
that is very strong and highly productive for us.
So how do we achieve that? We share with customers ways to make their beverages
uniquely theirs, so they ﬁnd a beverage they cannot get anywhere else. Whether it's
adding a shot of espresso, a ﬂavor, oat milk, or increasingly a cold foam. And we use
analytics to discover what's trending and then we amplify those ideas withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 44customers. As a result, our core remains highly relevant to our customers and it
supports our growth.
We're innovating in both our food and beverage platforms with lower-calorie plant-
based wholesome products to meet our customers' changing needs. And when our
beverage innovation hits the mark, it can earn its way back into that core menu. A
great example of that is our Iced Shaken Espresso with oat milk.
As part of our focus, you've heard us talk about around plant-based, cold,
customized beverages. We launched the Iced Shaken Espresso platform about two
years ago, and it has already rocketed up to $1 billion in sales per year in the U.S.
alone, the fastest new beverage platform to reach that milestone in our company's
history.
We're also introducing exciting innovation to Starbucks Refreshers Beverages, which
again, grew at double digits in FY '23, even overtaking Frappuccino at multiple
points in sales during the year. So Espresso, Refreshers, and Tea, each of these are
driving our business.
Our Tea Latte platform like Chai and Matcha is growing at nearly 30% year-over-year.
So to continue with this, we're introducing seasonal ﬂavors like today with our Iced
Gingerbread Oat Milk Chai, and we have more new concepts coming in the months
ahead.
We also have an ability, or an opportunity, really, to lift our Hot Brewed Coﬀee
business, which we'll continue to do as we roll out the remarkable Clover Vertica
machine in FY '24, which is out in the lobby there. From Hot Brewed Coﬀee to
Espresso, from Refreshers to Tea, we will continue to grow our strong core by
expanding on what Starbucks does best, beverage craft and customization.
Lastly, I want to talk about growing food attach. Through product assortment,
personalization, and operational improvements, our food business has reached
nearly a $6 billion business in North America, as I shared earlier. And it's growing at
double digits, but there's still a lot more opportunity.
Earlier, I referenced our clear strategy to further increase food attach, expanding all-
day breakfast and oﬀering all-day snacking options. Snacking, it turns out, is one of
the fastest-growing macro consumer trends in the U.S., reaching now a $110 billion
market segment. We know our customers are looking for snacks and particularly
wholesome and premium snacks. So in addition to new grab-and-go food products,
we'll also oﬀer a widening snack selection.
All of this is backed by supply chain excellence, because we see that simply being in
stock of these items and these fast-growing categories unlocks the next level of
growth, especially as our customers seek out these signature products.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 44A note about sustainability. Supporting our product strategy is our ongoing promise
to give more than we take from the planet. You heard Laxman talk about that. Like us,
our customers care deeply about the environment, and it's important that we join
them in their sustainability journey, whether that's serving a range of plant-based
beverages or products, or oﬀering a reward for a reusable cup to reduce waste.
Overall, we see clear and precise opportunities to enhance our brand and deliver on
our double-digit revenue growth guidance. We continue to think big and do the
unexpected with product innovation, all while staying true to our core, staying
focused on coﬀee, craft, and connection, and doing it all more sustainably.
Both Sara and I provided you some key details on how we'll further upgrade the
brand experience by running great stores for better operations, by building more
purpose-deﬁned stores with accelerated renovations, and by continuing our proven
track record of product innovation across dayparts, within our beverage core, with
more elevated food and doing it all healthier and more sustainably.
Now, I'd like to dig into the second element of our Tripleshot for Reinvention,
strengthening our digital leadership. I think as many of you have seen, our coﬀee
and innovative products have always been drivers of our growth, but in the last
decade, the digital ﬂywheel has been the accelerator.
Now, we're taking our digital ﬂywheel into the next phase of acceleration, and this
phase builds on who we have always been, but our ambition goes even higher. Our
ambition is to know every customer, to personalize their experience, and make
Starbucks eﬀortless across all channels globally.
We're bringing this to life through a strategy that oﬀers customers both convenience
and connection in ways that only Starbucks can do. And I want to start with
convenience. It's table stakes these days. How we deliver convenience, it's about
backing it with human connection. That's what makes Starbucks special.
And convenience at Starbucks is more than just faster service or fewer taps on a
screen. It's about deep care for customers that guides us to create an eﬀortless and
frictionless experience. We do this in ways big and small every single day. We drop
new releases into our app continuously, and we optimize every aspect of our end-to-
end digital experience.
And we've accelerated the pace of these innovations in the past year. So I'd like to
share just a couple simple examples to bring it to life. We know that ﬁnding the right
store to order and pay in our app can be challenging at times. So we recently
improved the ability for people to select a store and signiﬁcantly reduced the orders
that are sent to the wrong store.
We know that seeing an item out of stock, especially your favorite items, is
disappointing and may lead people to skip their visit. So we created a Deep Brew-
enabled algorithm to recommend substitute products to turn a moment ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 44disappointment into a moment of discovery. These types of moves to continuously
make the experience more eﬀortless, whether they're big or small, add up to big
business impact.
I talked about convenience, but I want to talk about human connection in our digital
experience. Feeling uplifted and a sense of warmth and belonging is at the heart of
Starbucks and that starts with knowing every customer. The more customers we
know and can form a digital relationship with, the better connection we can oﬀer,
and the more our digital ﬂywheel accelerates.
So today, we have 75 million Starbucks Rewards members around the globe that
have visited us in the last 90 days. But even with that extraordinary number, that's a
limited view of our total strength. If we widen the aperture beyond just Starbucks
Rewards members to include all the customers that Starbucks can know and reach
directly around the world, the number is 3x greater.
Starbucks has direct digital relationships with hundreds of millions of customers.
Hundreds of millions of customers that we can reach with personalized messages
that engage, activate, and uplift them, and in a way that also drives our business. So
building digital relationships is a ﬂywheel accelerator. Hundreds of millions of
customers is a start, but we want to know every customer. We're achieving this
through multiple paths.
One way is by connecting Starbucks Rewards to the world's best and biggest loyalty
programs. You saw this last year as we introduced our ﬁrst U.S.-based Reward
Together partnership with Delta Airlines, which allows both loyalty members of
Starbucks and Delta to link accounts and earn rewards, and we plan on taking it even
higher with Delta.
Now, building on the success with Delta, we're sharing today that we will introduce
two new Reward Together partnerships in the next six months, including a leading
ﬁnancial institution and a world-class hospitality company. With these new
partnerships that we're announcing, we'll extend the beneﬁts that Starbucks Reward
customers always love, and we'll bring that to new customers to bring them into the
program.
Our Starbucks Rewards membership growth rates across the globe have put us on a
path to double our Starbucks Rewards membership with another 75 million
customers in the next ﬁve years. And as we do, we'll continue to evolve what it
means to be a member and how you're rewarded.
We're also deepening connection with our customers by engaging them with
entertainment content that sparks conversation and provides what really are micro
moments of joy. Some examples of this, The Starbucks Daily, in partnership with Hark
Audio, in which we have a minority stake, brings customers brilliant podcast
moments to uplift their day. And we intend to go deeper into the content space in
our digital experiences. We're partnering on the upcoming holiday release of theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 12 of 44Deborah Hall Lefevreﬁlm The Color Purple, a new take on the beloved classic, to bring our customers
uplifting moments surrounding the ﬁlm's debut.
We believe in the power of connection through conversations, and curated content
is a great source of conversation, and it will play a bigger role in our future digital
experience. Now, we're not just connecting with our customers, we're also
connecting customers to each other, facilitating connections between customers,
and as a result of that, we're creating these uplifting digital communities alongside
our stores.
The third place has always been about community, but the idea is no longer limited
to a physical place. We're expanding the warmth and belonging of the third place to
any place that a customer connects with us, and we're enabling our customers to
connect to each other.
So, for example, we have a digital group called the Leaf Rakers Society on Facebook.
This is all centered around a community with a shared love of Starbucks and the fall
season. We also have an online Discord group, which is part of the Starbucks
Odyssey beta where super-fans of Starbucks interact online and they're also meeting
up in real life.
So while we've seen a profound and positive impact on our brand and business from
our digital experiences, we are still accelerating. As I said, our ambition is to know
every customer, to personalize their experience and make Starbucks eﬀortless. This
is our digital ﬂywheel acceleration phase and we're taking it to unprecedented
reach. We have a clear and compelling roadmap. The acceleration has already
started and we will extend our digital leadership globally.
To hear more, I'd like to next introduce Deb Hall Lefevre, where she'll talk about
some of the foundational elements and the technology investments to help us
realize our ambition. Deb? Thank you.
{BIO 20139738 <GO>}
Thank you, Brady. In many ways, Starbucks is a tech company. We are a company
that uses the power of digital to nurture the limitless possibility of human connection
anywhere in the world. With more than 38,000 locations and 22% of global sales
coming through digital channels, Starbucks continues to leverage and grow our
scale. And that scale is important because it allows us to attract world-class talent
and create collaborations with technology pioneers.
During this time of unprecedented technological change, we are modernizing our

Page 13 of 44Included in the modernization of our tech stack is the extension of Deep Brew, our
internally built predictive AI platform that allows us to innovate through data, hyper-
personalize the Starbucks experience for each customer, and eﬃciently manage our
stores through augmented capabilities.
We've been using AI for years, and our recent Deep Brew enhancements allow us to
deploy new artiﬁcial intelligence machine learning models in weeks instead of
months to unlock value faster. For example, Deep Brew now serves up alternative
food and beverage recommendations, and we're also reﬁning our forecasting
algorithms to improve our customers' experience, supporting the record food attach
in our U.S. company-operated business this past year.
We've always been digital leaders, launching Mobile Order & Pay in 2015, Deep
Brew in 2018, and being on the forefront of testing innovative capabilities like voice
ordering and more. And with the rapid takeoﬀ of generative AI, we are poised to
lead once again.
Getting all our stores, including our global licensed partner locations, ready for
faster rollout of innovation will be important because while the pace has been fast
up to now, it will only get faster. By the end of ﬁscal 2023, we move from taking
months to release new features to now being able to release on a two-week cadence
with higher quality. We will continue to improve our delivery velocity and our
eﬀectiveness by moving our resource allocation from running and sustaining to
growth and innovation.
Speaking of innovation, I'm excited to share that we intend to extend our innovation
lab with Microsoft. We have a long-term partnership with Microsoft and we look
forward to exploring the utilization of their groundbreaking multimodal model to
ingest trends in social media, global food and taste preferences, as well as our own
transaction data and insights from our Deep Brew AI engine.
This will take our product development and personalizations to new heights. Right
from when a customer thinks about what they'd like to have, to the barista who then
builds it, to our marketing team, who developed the perfect communication to
enhance the experience.
As you've already heard, we can't succeed at anything without our partners. We are
constantly striving to improve our partners' experience and make their jobs easier.
We have many, many use cases underway, and we are thrilled to collaborate with
Apple products as we launch our ﬁrst product innovation store to streamline the
tools and the information each partner interacts with during their shifts.
Whether it's inventory management, TikTok beverage builds, or cleaning schedules,
we will use this innovation store to experiment and reﬁne technology to assist our
partners all over the world and make it easier and more fun for them to deliver
amazing customer experiences.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 14 of 44Michael ConwayOur goal is to streamline where we can. It's in the spirit of less is more. Today, we
have 66 applications our partners use to run our stores, and that is just too many. So,
we are excited to collaborate with these tech pioneers to take a more holistic,
partner-centered approach to designing our partner experience using fewer
applications and less communication, which gives them more time to connect with
our customers.
Lastly, our customers, they tell us again and again, they come to Starbucks for
connection and convenience. And to that end, we continue to explore innovations in
eﬀortless customer experiences with Amazon. We are reimagining the customer in-
store experience with the Amazon One and Just Walk Out technology, and we're
eager to learn how this could evolve the experience going forward.
We're excited about the momentum we're building to accelerate our innovation and
deployment, to simplify the partner experience, and exceed our customers'
expectations for convenience, making connection the reason they keep coming
back. This focus on strengthening and scaling digital, as Brady and I just described,
is a core element of the Tripleshot Reinvention strategy.
We will lean into opportunities we see with accelerating digital releases, expanding
customer reach with new Reward Together program partnerships, and collaborating
with tech pioneers in this moment of unprecedented technology change, all to
elevate experiences for our customers and our partners, and double our Starbucks
Reward members.
Next up, Michael Conway will share how this translates into global business growth.

{BIO 18036959 <GO>}
Thank you, Deb, and good afternoon, everyone. The third shot of our Tripleshot
strategy is becoming truly global. Over the past ﬁve years, we have opened nearly
9,000 stores, 7,000 of which are outside the U.S. and we are still only scratching the
surface. While we have been an international company, now we will become truly
global, as we create surround sound of omni-channel strategies in the 86 markets
where we operate Starbucks stores.
Today, International and Channel Development are important components of our
global growth algorithm, comprising roughly 85% of our total global customer
touchpoints, more than half of our global store count, and a third of our proﬁt
growth, split almost equally between China and the rest of our International and
Channel businesses.
As the global coﬀee culture grows, we have much higher ambition for our earnings
contribution from these businesses in the future. Channel Development, which
includes our CPG and food service partnerships, elevates and extends the Starbucks
brand around the world. This segment brings nearly 40% of households into theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

Page 15 of 44brand that do not regularly visit our cafes, a tremendous opportunity to introduce
store occasions over time as markets grow their coﬀee consumption.
Importantly, channel development also contributes well above our company average
margins, an accretive element to our expectations of improving margins over the
next few years.
Anchored through our now ﬁve-year partnership with Nestle, we are the market
share leader in U.S. at-home coﬀee and are growing signiﬁcantly outside the U.S.
Our global ready-to-drink business continues to rapidly innovate and accelerate
alongside strong partners like PepsiCo, Danzao [ph] Foods, Suntory, and Arla. And
through our thousands of We Proudly Serve food service locations, we are able to
complement Starbucks retail and reach customers in ultra-convenient ways in
locations that perform well with lower volumes than our retail stores.
In our International segment, we recently celebrated the opening of our 20,000th
store outside the U.S., and we are growing 10% annually, a pace we anticipate will
continue over the next three years. We are increasingly leveraging drive-thrus to
reach more customers while also elevating the brand in places like our Battersea
power plant location in London. We have strong conﬁdence in our licensed store
growth through strongly engaged licensees focused on growing the business
because of the high returns that Starbucks provides them and the elevated brand
that customers continue to seek.
Emerging markets also present a signiﬁcant opportunity. Today, we are only 19%
penetrated in fast-growing markets like India, Southeast Asia, and Latin America with
a 10,000-plus store opportunity remaining. As a result of all this, three out of every
four new stores over the near term is expected to be opened outside of the U.S. as
our store portfolio becomes increasingly global. Our strong unit economics ensures
that our licensed partners continue to invest in our brand. We are well ahead of the
growth expectations we indicated at last year's Investor Day as we continue to
accelerate sales volumes per store.
Now, digital is an important driver here, aided by Starbucks Digital Solutions, which
is now leveraged by more than a third of our international licensed stores just a year
after introduction. This is also laying the foundation to pursue tremendous
headroom in growing our digital transactions as it gives the licensees access to our
proprietary tech stack, and most importantly, Starbucks Rewards and Mobile Order &
Pay.
Starbucks' fourth largest market and one of our strongest licensed markets is Korea,
a highly competitive environment. Yet, we are winning. We are winning through
innovative and locally relevant products and digital experiences that create an
unmatched and elevated brand connection for the customer.
Our company-operated markets of both the UK and Japan are also thriving. Fiscal
year '23 comps remained well above our historical averages. In the UK, we opened aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 16 of 44Belinda Wongrecord 110 net new stores, taking our total count to more than 1,200 stores. An
increasing number of these are drive-thrus, which has helped us more than double
our proﬁt in the UK versus pre-COVID levels.
And in the highly competitive Japanese market, our steady drumbeat of locally
relevant product innovation, including customer favorites like Melon of Melon and
our new Mousse Lattes continued to set us apart and drove record transactions in
ﬁscal year '23. Like Japan, China is also leveraging innovation to grow rapidly with
more opportunity on the horizon.
And now, I'd like to introduce Belinda Wong to give you more details. Belinda?
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Thank you, Michael. Hello and good afternoon, everyone. We just concluded a
watershed year in China where we put the pandemic behind us and built growth
momentum for the future. We have transformed into a very diﬀerent business since
2019. Our store network has expanded by 65%. We have built a thriving omni-
channel business and we have signiﬁcantly digitalized our supply chain and store
operations. As a result, we now oﬀer a full spectrum of Starbucks experiences that
are unique in China across our 6,800 stores. China continues to be one of the
world's most important consumer markets, despite recent headwinds.
Today, only 35% of Chinese middle-class consumers drink specialty coﬀee at least
once a quarter. And this is expected to grow by 50% -- to 50% by 2027. The
opportunity is not just in penetration, but also frequency. Imagine if the per capita
consumption of 13 cups per year grows to Shanghai levels, we'll still only be at a
fraction of where the U.S. and Japan are today.
We've always reported on the number of prefecture-level cities we entered. Four
years ago, we began to enter more aggressively into county-level cities. Moving
forward, we'll take a more granular approach to report the number. Of the close to
3,000 county cities in China, Starbucks has increased our presence from 500 cities
to over 800. And we still have a lot of white space in addition to further penetrating
the cities where we operate today.
I would like to go a little deeper on how we drive sales in our comp stores. This
summer we launched an unprecedented 28 new coﬀee-forward locally relevant
beverages, combining great taste and aesthetics from local adaptations of global
innovations like Iced Shaken Espresso, the Starbucks Refreshers, to uniquely Chinese
creations such as Mousse Espresso and Starbucks' smaller size Intenso Collection.
These beverage innovations have attracted millions of new customers' trials, mostly
younger customers driving increased visits and growth especially the Iced Beverage
category. Our beverages have helped to convert new customers into members,
driving our Starbucks Rewards program to a record 21 million active members this
past quarter, enabling us to build deeper relationships and increase frequency of
customer visits.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 17 of 44There are also huge opportunities across dayparts. Over the past four years, we have
built up the breakfast daypart, supported by our evolving food oﬀerings and growth
in convenience channels such as Delivery and Mobile Order & Pay. Lunch and
afternoon continue to be our strongest dayparts and are growing.
Today, one in four customers attach food with their orders and there's still room for
growth versus the two in ﬁve in the U.S. as we personalize experiences targeted at
speciﬁc dayparts, including our afternoon and evening dayparts, fueling ticket
growth.
Our Delivery is on its way to a $1 billion business, and we continue to innovate new
services to fuel new customer demand, such as Starbucks Curbside, which delivers
the same convenience of a drive-thru, pioneered in partnership with China's leading
map navigation platform.
Another key part of our transformation is digitalization across our supply chain and
store operations. As a result, we've been able to increase our labor productivity by
30%, decrease wastage by more than 50%, and lower logistics costs substantially.
Overall, our store operating expenses decreased by 15%.
I'm excited about the recent openings of our Coﬀee Innovation Park in Kunshan, as
well as our Innovation and Technology Center in Shenzhen. These two unique
investments will continue to fuel our productivity and eﬃciency eﬀorts, and drive
new innovations and experiences for our customers, for our partners, coﬀee, and
sustainability eﬀorts.
Our relentless eﬀorts to optimize store size, equipment, and rent structure have led
to a nearly 20% reduction in our new store investment. And as a result, we continue
to achieve strong returns as stated at our Investor Day last year with a payback of
less than two years and a 2:1 sales-to-investment ratio.
We will continue to inﬁll our existing cities with purpose-deﬁned store formats while
entering more new county cities where new stores consistently outperform the
market average, demonstrating the power of our brand.
Our plan is to open close to 1,000 net new stores a year, driving strong returns on
top of our existing locations, which continue to deliver strong proﬁtability. And we're
on track to operate 9,000 stores in China by 2025.
We are still in the early chapters of Starbucks' growth journey in international and
channel development. As coﬀee culture grows around the world, we will have over
35,000 stores by 2030 outside North America. Our stores have very strong unit
economics, ensuring our licensed partners will continue to invest in our brand over
time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

Now, I'd like to hand it over to Sara Kelly to talk about our reinvention. Thank you.
{BIO 22936392 <GO>}
Thank you, Belinda. Originally, Frank Britt, our Chief Reinvention Oﬃcer, had
planned to be here today to share with you this next part of our strategy.
Unfortunately, he's not feeling well today, so I am stepping in for him. Lucky you.
My peers just detailed detail the three-year growth strategies, our Tripleshot. And
just like a typical Starbucks order, we are going to now customize, as Laxman said,
with two pumps. The ﬁrst is unlocking eﬃciency.
Over the past 12 months, our focus and discipline around our reinvention has driven
tangible ﬁnancial results, mainly in our U.S. business. The progress we are making,
which shows up in our in-store operating expenses, has driven incredible
incremental ﬁnancial eﬃciencies to support revenue growth and margin expansion.
This has also unlocked capital for us to invest into our partners and into our business,
more than 20% of our proﬁts, further extending our competitive advantage.
In order to accelerate the company transformation, we have built a new and durable
level of planning, of process, and analytical rigor to scale our reinvention agenda
Taking it a step further, looking at our store operating costs in our P&L, our eﬀorts
drove a decrease of our expense as a percentage of revenue, supporting the 100
basis points of margin expansion in the ﬁscal year 2023 that Rachel Ruggeri
highlighted this morning on the earnings call.
So how do we do that? Investing in both our partners and our in-store operating
environment with equipment and with tools. Making our stores more productive also
makes them run better. In the last year, we added a new and more eﬃcient
equipment to our U.S. company-operated stores, equipment such as the portable
cold foam blender, the Clover Vertica brewer coﬀee machines, which you saw today
as you came in, and faster warming ovens. These investments are unlocking
productivity and creating a better experience for our partners to serve our
customers.
In addition, we invested in new tools to support our retail leaders in managing their
business, including how they address our partners' staﬃng and scheduling needs.
The result is that hourly turnover is now below pre-pandemic levels, creating a more
consistent partner experience across the 9,600 company-operated stores we have
here in the U.S.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 19 of 44Rachel RuggeriSince our founding, we have focused on investing in our partners, creating inclusive
environments where our partners can grow, where they can thrive, and where they
can build a bridge to a better future. A cornerstone of that commitment is better
schedules that ﬁt their lives. We have made meaningful progress in increasing
partner hours and have now collected partner preferences that will be factored into
our scheduling platform moving forward.
As a result, and as Laxman shared during this morning's earnings call, total hourly
cash compensation has increased nearly 50% since ﬁscal 2020. By the end of ﬁscal
year 2025, we expect to have doubled hourly income versus ﬁscal year 2020. This is
through hours and higher wages. These are investments that matter. They drive value
for our partners and for our business through increased stability and higher
retention.
To remain the retail industry employer of choice, we must continue to create a
uniquely Starbucks experience, an experience that uplifts, an experience that
inspires and then engages our partners. We will continue to listen to their evolving
needs and best support them on their job, with their teams and in their life.
In the year ahead, we're going to continue our unwavering commitment to elevate
the value created for our nearly 200,000, actually more, I should say 200,000 U.S.
in-store partners and be strategic with our investments to deliver against our partner
promise, again, to build a bridge to a better future.
As early as next week, we'll be sharing directly with our partners how we will again
raise the bar in industry-leading beneﬁts with a bundle of new and exciting partner
experience enhancements. This will include investments in pay and innovative
beneﬁts across ﬁnancial well-being, skill building, as well as improvements in digital
partner engagement, more personalized scheduling, and elevated coﬀee and
community experiences.
These eﬀorts will play a pivotal role in further solidifying our status of providing the
best portfolio of beneﬁts across the retail industry. In turn, our partners will create an
even more uplifting customer experience, further diﬀerentiating our brand and
driving our business.
Now, let me turn it over to our amazing CFO, Rachel Ruggeri, to expand further on
how we're expected to drive eﬃciencies in the years to come. Rachel?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Thank you, Sara, and welcome, everyone. So Sara shared the very early success
we're seeing as it relates to reinvention. But as she shared, there is so much
opportunity ahead, both in the store and out of the store. We have multiple paths to
drive growth and proﬁtability. Our results prove that we've executed strongly on the
reinvention plan and we'll continue to do so.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 20 of 44Now, when we look at our P&L, we refer to expenses in the store as largely those that
show up within store operating expense, while expenses out of the store are more
aligned with cost of goods sold or COGS. These expense lines combined represent
over 70% of total company revenue. That's signiﬁcant.
Over the past three years, these expenses have grown faster than our revenue
growth. This is driven by several factors, most speciﬁcally the high inﬂationary
environment we navigated through the past few years. But as Sara shared, we
unlocked leverage this past year in our store operating expenses, driven by the focus
and discipline executed through our reinvention, driving full year 2023 margin
expansion of 100 basis points. And we see opportunity for further leverage, with a
target of driving more than $3 billion out of the P&L over the next three years.
Now, I want to make it clear, though, that we are not solely focused on reducing
costs This is about creating sustainable eﬃciency in our business to drive growth.
Importantly, some of the eﬃciencies realized will be reinvested back into the
business to support revenue initiatives and brand enhancing innovation, highlighted
by the partner eﬀorts Sara detailed.
As I shared earlier today, we expect to invest upwards of a $1 billion in incremental
investments in ﬁscal year 2024 across wages, new store equipment and
enhancements, digital innovation, and supply chain modernization. While we will
continue to invest in our business over the long term, we're conﬁdent the revenue
beneﬁts from these investments will outpace costs, leading to continued and
consistent margin expansion.
Sara already shared the area of focus in the store that will lead to store operating
expense leverage. So let me focus more speciﬁcally out of the store in the area of
cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold represents 30% of revenue for Starbucks.
Several work streams are already underway to drive reductions in COGS, which we
expect to yield over $600 million in annual savings or nearly $2 billion over the next
three years. That means of the approximate $3 billion eﬃciency target in total that I
just shared, nearly 70% will come from opportunities in cost of goods sold or out of
the store.
Our biggest opportunities are in how we manufacture, source, and distribute our
products to our stores. We see opportunity here of $200 million to $300 million
annually. We'll use our scale to capture more value, creating greater eﬃciencies,
leading to simpliﬁcation and better ﬂow of products, a better experience for partners
and customers.
Additionally, we can meaningfully drive waste out of our stores through eﬀorts like
further automating the ordering of our inventory, reducing complexity for our
partners while we increase attach. Now, this past year, we drove waste improvements
in our stores, yielding over $90 million of beneﬁts. But even with the solid progress,
we have more opportunity ahead.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 21 of 44Laxman NarasimhanBeyond cost of goods, we also see opportunity to drive leverage from G&A. Over
the past year, we purposely grew our G&A ahead of revenue growth to invest in the
technology and resources to support our reinvention. Over time, we expect to grow
G&A at a rate below revenue growth, contributing to our expectation of margin
expansion.
Now, while eﬃciencies are incredibly important, there is no better way to expand
margin than through sales leverage, inclusive of strategic pricing. To further the
opportunity around sales leverage, we've started to work to improve how we
manage our revenue through more targeted actions, actions detailed by Brady and
Deb earlier today.
Speciﬁcally, we're furthering our technology to address daypart oﬀerings,
suggestions around customization using Deep Brew, and even incremental channel
opportunities. As evidenced by our strong ﬁscal year 2023 performance, particularly
in the U.S., our focus on customization, mix, and attach is driving meaningful ticket
growth, and will continue to be a core focus.
The combination of eﬃciencies that Sara and I outlined, the $3 billion over the next
three years, coupled with opportunities around sales leverage and pricing and with
targeted investments in the partner value proposition, give us conﬁdence in our
ability to progressively expand margin, returning to our historic levels over time.
I'll conclude by saying that we are very conﬁdent in our ability to create a more
resilient, durable business for the long term. This past year, we purposely built the
foundation to support our new era of growth, as shown with this morning's guidance
for ﬁscal year 2024. But while our opportunity is clear, we know that our success,
everything that we do, is dependent on the diﬀerentiated experience our partners
create for our customers. After all, our partners are our superpower. Thank you.

part of a Starbucks bean-to-cup journey from our farmers to our roasters to our
distributors and to our support teams. We are all in this together as we work through
the second pump of our customized reinvention strategy, reinvigorating the partner
culture at Starbucks, which brings me back to our mission. With every cup, with every
conversation, with every community, we nurture the limitless possibilities of human
connection. So that's the Tripleshot reinvention with two pumps.
Let me take you back to the inspiration of Milan's coﬀee culture, which Howard
Schultz brought to America and that we are now bringing back to Italy. We have 20
stores in Italy now, and we're opening a new ﬂagship store in Rome next year. In our
Italian stores, the most ordered product in our stores is the Espresso, both Hot and
Cold.
On my Starbucks journey, I went to the Milan Roastery. Put simply, it is Starbucks at its
best. It's Howard's genius at its best. As I have learned and the world has witnessed
for over 50 years, it epitomizes how art, architecture, beauty, and design are central
to the ethos of Starbucks, no matter the moment, no matter the venue, and no
matter the creative expression.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
What you just saw was ﬁlmed in our Milan Roastery, and it's how Starbucks showed
up during Milan Fashion Week this year. We love featuring beautiful design,
architecture, and celebrating artists in our stores worldwide. This includes the
creative works by many of our own partners who are artists, musicians, and vibrant
contributors to culture. Our cafes often represent the beauty of the local
communities we serve. Whether I'm walking down one of the halls of our support
center or visiting a store, it's very clear to me that art, music, architecture, and culture
serves as an inspiration for Starbucks to dream even bigger.
As part of that dream, we're announcing here the establishment of the Starbucks
Annual Art Prize. This new honor will celebrate inspiring emerging artists who
represent craft, courage, belonging, and joy, and whose art creates the kind of
conversations and experiences that bring us together, which is so needed at this
time. The walls inside our 38,000 stores and the walls outside our 38,000 stores will
essentially become galleries featuring art in the service of human connection.
Each year, we will select one emerging visual artist who brings a new perspective to
the table with a $1 million prize and opportunity to display their art in our stores
around the world.
We plan to establish ﬁve architectural prizes for emerging talented architects whom
we'll work with and contract with in diﬀerent parts of the world to design and build
unique and distinctive stores in our many markets around the world. This award will
be determined by an experienced panel of judges.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

Page 23 of 44We have also announced Starbucks Scouted inside our company to highlight the
artistic, music and creative talents of our partners in stores. Perhaps, you will soon
hear it in the soundtracks in our stores.
At our annual meeting of shareholders in March, we will share more details of how
we will continue to elevate this beautiful brand, embracing the principles of beauty,
design, art, culture, and human connection.
We have spent the last several months paying our respects to the past while re-
imagining the future. We have rolled out a new unifying mission for this company.
The mission is manifested in the evergreen promises that we make and that we keep.
And those promises inform the strategic priorities, the Tripleshot Reinvention with
two pumps plan that we shared with you in depth today.
Lastly, we also co-created with our wonderful partners the set of values that will
reground and reinvigorate the partner culture of Starbucks. As we move into ﬁscal
year '24 and beyond, you will see progress against our Tripleshot reinvention with
two pumps. To summarize the key elements of our strategy, here's what you can
expect.
We will ﬁrst elevate the brand. To do this, we will run our stores better, grow with
more purpose-deﬁned stores and accelerated renovations and drive further product
innovation. Through these strategies, we expect to improve customer connections
and grow the North American store portfolio to over 20,000 stores over time.
Second, strengthen and scale in digital. Speciﬁcally, we will accelerate our digital
operating model with more frequent releases. We will also expand our Reward
Together program, building on our successful relationship with Delta, with the intent
to announce two new partnerships, including a leading ﬁnancial institution and a
premier hospitality company.
And we will further extend our digital and tech leadership through personalization
and customization, resetting our tech architecture and building on our distinctive
Deep Brew platform.
As a result, we plan to extend our reach to new customers through new partnerships,
and we expect to double our Starbucks Rewards members to add another 75 million
members globally within the next ﬁve years. Additionally, we continue to partner and
collaborate with tech pioneers, including Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon to help us
further strengthen and scale in digital.
Third, become truly global. With the abundant opportunities we have outlined today,
the international segment will play a critical role for Starbucks, fueling nearly a third
of our overall earnings growth potential over the long-term. We will expand our
footprint to 35,000 stores by 2030 outside of North America. This store growth will
be bolstered by strong unit economic expansion, underpinned by the extension of
our digital platforms to all our licensed partners globally.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

A - Laxman NarasimhanOverall, we plan to expand our global store footprint to 55,000 by 2030, growing on
average eight stores per day, with nearly one-third of the future earnings coming
from international.
Fourth, we will unlock eﬃciency. $3 billion in eﬃciency, $2 billion of which will come
from opportunities in cost of goods sold or out of the store, to both reinvest in the
Starbucks experience and to drive returns to shareholders through progressive
margin expansion and earnings growth.
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly to the foundation of the Starbucks brand, we
will reinvigorate the partner culture at Starbucks. We will further our mission,
promises and values while investing in the partner experience around the world.
Progress on the strategic drivers are the metrics we will use internally to measure our
success. And you will see how this ladders up and how we, as a company, fulﬁll
promises to our partners, to our customers, to the farmers, to the communities, to
the environment, and to shareholders with the guidance that we are setting.
We've delivered great results and earlier this morning, have set guidance for ﬁscal
year 2024 to grow comps at 5% to 7% with revenue growth at the low end of the 10%
to 12% range and earnings growth of 15% to 20% Our business has great
momentum. We have signiﬁcant headroom and strength in our brand, giving us
conﬁdence in our ability to further grow and invest in our partners, while delivering
consistency in shareholder returns. Therefore, we see multiple parts to the shape of
the long-term algorithm of comp growth of 5% or greater, revenue growth of 10% or
greater, and EPS growth of 15% or greater.

Q - AnalystThank you all for hanging with us while we all got on stage. I'm going to try and play
the air traﬃc controller on the questions, and so feel free to raise your hand. There
are mics that we can take around, and what we will do is I'll take the question and
then send it on to my management team here who can help answer it. So maybe ﬁrst
in the back. Thank you. On the right there. Oh, sorry. I didn't see you.
Hey, thank you. I guess, I have kind of a two-parter. The $3 billion in savings, if you
had to give that a conﬁdence level or a visibility level, scale of 1 to 10, and just give us
a sense of your conﬁdence on that, how much you've really feel like you've identiﬁed
there? And the other thing that was striking to me, maybe you can react to it, is I
don't think our models reﬂect one-third of the growth in the next few years coming
from international when it comes to proﬁtability.
So it seems like something? I wonder how you're thinking about it, like in that sort of
a timeframe versus some sort of very long-term type thing, and obviously China is in
that number, so that permeates our thinking. Thank you.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Well, on the productivity front, do you want to start that, Rachel?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Sure. Of the $3 billion that I spoke about related to eﬃciencies, I would look at it as
it's $3 billion over three years. Largely, you could say loosely about $1 billion a year.
And I would say our conﬁdence level for the year that we're in is quite high. Of
course, we've got opportunity as we continue to work pipelines in the future, but
we're very conﬁdent in the year ahead, which is part of the guidance that we had
given this morning for FY '24. It's included in that, and it helps support the $1 billion
of investments that I also shared. So that will help us to continue to expand margin
progressively, but also continue to drive our earnings growth.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Do you want to take the second question on the earnings growth, too?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Sure. And as far as it goes with the third of the earnings growth, or nearly a third of
the earnings growth coming from the international segment, I think what's important
there to think about is Michael showed the slide in the beginning that showed that a
third of the growth this year was coming from internationals with channels. As we
move forward, we would expect in this year and in each year going forward, so this
isn't a long-term outlook, this is currently and in each year forward, that about a third
of the earnings growth will come from largely from the International segment. And
that does include China in it, but I think you could think about it as nearly half
coming from China and the rest from markets around the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

(inaudible) after that is okay?

{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
Yes. Hi. Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. I had a two-part question. I was looking for
an update just on Siren System. Obviously, when we convened about a year ago,
obviously a very exciting plan around that. And the last we talked, it was going to be
around 40% of the store base in the U.S. by 2026. So curious where you stand with
that. And Rachel, if you could help contextualize the $3 billion of savings versus how
much of that is going to be rolled into Siren Systems in 2026. Just help us better
understand the cost for OpEx versus CapEx with that as well?
Sure.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Let me ﬁrst start with just setting up this question that you've raised, and then I'm
going to hand it to Sara Trilling to talk you through it. As you've seen over the course
of this year, the operating foundation we've put in the business has actually resulted
in a lot of improvements in what we're making in the store. Siren System is clearly
one aspect of it. So Sara, perhaps you can touch a bit on the platform as well as
where Siren System ﬁts in.
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you, absolutely. So as Lax just shared, running great stores requires
us to fundamentally change how we operate, not only what we're operating on, as
Siren System might be thought of.
And so we've already done a lot in terms of how we're operating. And you heard me
speak of the examples, mobile order and pay being one of them where we're
launching a suite of new tools and solutions that will help us to better capture that
demand. Other tools as well that will help us sort of look across our total portfolio
base to understand how we're operating at scale and monitor those stores'
performance and really support stores that need support from the center.
I think, we've rolled out a lot of equipment already. Mastrena being one, our
handheld cold foam blenders being another. And we're seeing great success in
terms of unlocking capacity with those solutions. Our drive-thru times are a great
proof point. We're seeing decreased drive-thru times at peak, which is wonderful, so
we can serve more customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

Q - Andrew Charles
A - Sara TrillingSiren Systems speciﬁcally, we're on track in terms of our rollout schedule. The way
that we're getting there is through our renovations strategy. So we're renovating
1,000 stores a year. We've also got new stores. And we're putting Siren System in
those locations. That's how we're moving forward. I think most important is really that
Siren system and the equipment that we're deploying, it unlocks capacity and it will
certainly help our partners better serve our customers and drive the connection
which keeps them coming back.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
I think one of the things we've talked about in the past as well is that what the Siren
System requires and what all the improvements require, obviously, is the changes in
the processes in the store. So really, in some ways, we're setting the operating
platform that we have in the stores. And with the renovations creating the ability for
us to actually bring that equipment in, and we're bringing it in a sequential manner
exactly as per plan, and it is on schedule. Do you want to touch on the second
question?
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
And of the $3 billion, the eﬃciencies that I spoke about, it's all OpEx. And about $2
billion of it over the next three years comes from cost of goods sold. So you can
think about that line that will include what I spoke about with how we source,
manufacture, and distribute, how we buy our products. There's a big opportunity
there. Another portion of it is waste. And so that's -- those are the kinds of things you
can think about that you'll see in that $2 billion. The remaining $1 billion, over the
next three years, is largely in the store, and that's related to continued eﬃciencies
we'll see largely from staﬃng and scheduling this year. So a little bit about what
Sarah Kelly spoke about with having the right schedules for our partners, making
sure we understand their preferences, and being able to leverage our labor more
eﬃciently to be able to support our partners, but also to better support the stores.
That creates a stability that leads to eﬃciency in our business. That'll be a big driver
of the $1 billion. And inclusive in that is some of the new equipment that we'll roll
out, more speciﬁcally Siren system. But since that's a little bit further out, that'll play
more into FY '26.
{BIO 16591426 <GO>}
(inaudible)
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
Oh, of the renovation plan. All of our renovation -- so when we think about the $3
billion that I spoke about this morning in CapEx, 85% of it is coming from new store
growth and renovations, and then some new store equipment. So most of that is
global store growth, but within that number, also that 85% is renovation costs as well,
which are increasing to that $1,000 that Sara spoke about, as well as store
equipment, which includes Siren System and some of the other equipment that we'll
roll out. There's not as much of an OpEx impact from that. Of course, you'll have the
depreciation, but it's largely a capital in nature.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

A - Brady Brewer{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
One thing I want to add, just really straddling both questions, your question about
visibility and certainty. What has really changed over the course of the last year is just
the systematic approach that we're taking to the overall program. So we have tools,
we have dashboards, we kind of know where we stand and the discipline around
measurement and also discipline around visibility, at which level are we at in terms of
certainty and visibility and how do we move that along the pipeline of what we do
and then the implementation that happens. And I think what you saw in the
reinvention program this year that we actually accelerated it and actually delivered
more than what we thought.
So this has been very helpful to us in terms of the way we are managing this. And
this is exactly how we intend to manage it. So we have a clear sense of where it's
coming, where it's going and where we stand. So hopefully that answers your
question, visibility. I think Sarah's got a question there. Sorry, yeah, go ahead.
Hi, thanks. So obviously doubling the number of Starbucks Rewards members would
be a massive feat over the next ﬁve years. I guess I'd be curious to hear in the U.S.
and in China what you're seeing now in terms of ticket and traﬃc lift when someone
joins Rewards. And I know it was mentioned on the call that this is a tool you have
that you didn't have in '08/'09. Do you have proof points of being able to inﬂuence
consumer behavior when times are more challenging?
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
So let me take that and just break this into two parts. So I'll break into the U.S. part.
Brady, if you could take that on and Belinda -- and Molly, I'd like you to talk a bit
about China.
{BIO 17845948 <GO>}
Sure. Yes, doubling our number of Starbucks Rewards members is a big goal, as you
heard. And at the same time, we're on track to do that right now. If we take our
growth rates in FY '23 and you draw those out, what we're seeing is that this year in
the U.S., we signiﬁcantly grew our Starbucks Rewards member population. In
international markets, it grew even faster.
When we look within the U.S. and say, how do you get to that number, you can see
things like our licensed stores where at a grocery store, in an airport, at a Target, less
than half of those stores even have our digital ﬂywheel. So our Starbucks Connect
program that we're rolling out to our licensees helps accelerate our ability to bring in
new members. Internationally, it's things like Starbucks Digital Solutions which is a
massive unlock where, as you heard from Michael, we're rolling that across our
markets, but it allows them to oﬀer Starbucks Rewards. Also the incentives and the
oﬀers that we've oﬀered to our customers is highly attractive and we've seen a big
ramp in Starbucks Rewards membership over the last few years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 29 of 44A - Laxman Narasimhan
A - Molly Liu
A - Laxman NarasimhanSo I think between those things and program innovation, the things you heard about
with Reward Together, we have a path that we see to doubling that membership.
What we have always seen is that when a customer joins Starbucks Rewards, their
spend and frequency increases signiﬁcantly. When they start to mobile order, it goes
up even further. And so that accelerator in our digital ﬂywheel is one that we say
more customers in the program times those beneﬁts equals signiﬁcant growth.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
I can say one more thing on that, Brady, is that if I look at the 90-day actives that we
have in the U.S., we actually have -- as Brady pointed out, we have a larger number
of those that we are digitally connected to. With very targeted communications and
messaging and oﬀers, we're able to bring them back, particularly for things like
favorites or for speciﬁc visits to bring them out of the laps into what we do. So we
run it that way. And in a lot of ways, when you look at some of our limited time oﬀers,
it's a great tool to bring them back. So that's in the U.S. Molly Liu is our Co-CEO from
China. She joins us from there. She's working very closely with Belinda. Molly, go
ahead.
{BIO 20115764 <GO>}
Thank you, Lax. As a 11-year partner, ﬁrst I will say, it's very privileged for me to be
here representing our 60,000 partners in China. Now, thanks for the questions for
the China loyalty program and our member engagement. We just celebrated a
record high, 21 million active members in China. And we're still on the runway to
further grow both member count and frequency.
And I will share, other than what Brady has already shared, two secret power
weapons that we have. Number one is the real omni-channel full spectrum of
services we have in China. That's a very powerful tool for us to build connection with
our members, both recruit new and drive more frequency of our existing members.
Because when they frequent more channels, be it MOP, delivery, in-store, e-
commerce, or even we have CPG, and also we probably serve as well, it helps to
build a big routine for them with Starbucks brand.
Second thing is really the locally relevant product innovation. So this summer, we
launched 28 new products. This helped us to expand our member base signiﬁcantly.
This summer, we actually increased 2 million new active members to our base. And
also, our recent introduction of a product line called Starbucks Intenso line is really
based on customer insights, targeting the very sophisticated coﬀee drinkers, works
very well with our Gold members. It's only launched in the market for two weeks. We
already see very early encouraging sign of high -- record high repeat rate and
increase in Gold member frequency.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Now we touched on the investments we're making in technology and the
architecture and the collaborations we have here, but we're also doing the same
thing in China. Maybe perhaps you want to just touch on the investments we're
making in Shenzhen, Molly, and what we're doing there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

Q - Jeﬀ Bernstein{BIO 20115764 <GO>}
Yes. So we just announced the investment of our Starbucks Innovation Technology
Center in Shenzhen this August. Although we have started our digital journey and
experience many years ago, we've built so many capabilities in China. This new
milestone will enable us to further accelerate on ﬁve aspects. Number one, create
more compelling customer digital experience.
Number two, help our partners to further optimize and improve the way they work in
our stores. Number three, on the coﬀee part, both product innovation and the coﬀee
value chain since our opening of the Coﬀee Innovation Park in Kunshan, China, really
have a vertically integrated coﬀee value chain in China. So SITC, the Starbucks
Innovation Technology Center, are going to leverage technology and big data to
help us advance product innovation and coﬀee innovation as well. And not to
mention, on the store development side, big data is going to enable us, and IoT
equipment are going to enable us to build a better store at a faster speed, and
ﬁnally, advance our sustainability agenda. So a lot of aspirations for our SITC, really
looking forward to that.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
So in the end, I think, as you said, we announced -- we had the Delta partnership last
year. We're going to be announcing in the next six months two more that, again,
feeds into what we do with the overall Starbucks Rewards program. Great. Yes,
please.
{BIO 7208345 <GO>}
Thank you, Laxman. Jeﬀ Bernstein from Barclays. Two-part question really related to
China. The ﬁrst part, Laxman, you really -- you inherited, I guess, a year ago,
tremendous enthusiasm about China. I'm just wondering whether over the past year,
you've embraced that enthusiasm. It seems like the past year between macro
uncertainty and COVID concerns and competition. Just wondering your conviction in
that passion that you inherited a year ago.
And the second part of the question, I mean, Belinda talked about the volatility over
the past year and that you're happy it's done. And Michael talked about the licensed
business model and how great it is and the stability it generates. So I'm just
wondering, Laxman, it's come up in past Investor Days as something you always
consider, but what are the pros and cons to maybe converting the company-
operated China business into more of a licensed business? I mean, every other
country around the world, 80-somewhat countries, is primarily licensed and
generates a higher margin, annuity stream of royalties, less operating vulnerability.
You could take on more balance sheet leverage, return more cash. It seems like
China is the tail that's wagging the dog in terms of the volatility and China really
drives your stock and people tend to disregard the other 85 countries. So I'm just
wondering, would you have given any more thought to potentially licensing out
China? Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

Well, thank you for the question. Well, ﬁrst of all, I have studied, advised, led
businesses with a China footprint for the -- over last 20 years. And it's a remarkable
country and I have deep exposure to that country over the years that I've been a
professional. I think that I have a lot of heart for what one of the largest consumer
markets has to oﬀer us and has to oﬀer the world. I think we're in a business of
delighting consumers, uplifting every day with coﬀee. We build bridges between
diﬀerent countries through coﬀee.
And as I look at what we have in China is we have a terriﬁc business. I mean, I'm
actually quite amazed by what I saw. If I look at the partners we have in China, they
are remarkable. And this is a business that's been built by a China-led team. And it's
quite rare to have that, and we have that. The second, I look at the stores we have in
China, and they're amazing. I'd love to have some of those stores elsewhere, but we
have them there. Third, we have vertically integrated supply chain that Molly referred
to. And I think that's terriﬁc, including, if you go back to Howard's original idea of
saying, we want to go to China and develop the specialty coﬀee industry, we're now
enabling the growth of coﬀee in Yunnan, we have an amazing factory in Kunshan,
advanced distribution there, a digital supply chain that I would love to have in the
U.S.. And if I look at that, I say, that's a great source of advantage.
And then the ﬁnal thing we have is we have a brand, this brand is known as
Xingbake in China. It is known as Xingbake in China. So it's a brand that I think
people really care deeply about in that place. And I think the headroom for that
brand in China is large. Today, we're at 12 cups per capita, as Belinda pointed out,
Shanghai is much larger. We have 1,150 stores of our own in China, in Shanghai and
we have upside in Shanghai in terms of where else we could be. So I think these are
still early days in this industry. If we look at competitive environment, glad that we
have folks who are expanding the market.
And if you look at how competitive our business is, just take a look at the results
we've had. The transaction comps we have in food and beverage are strong. And I
think what it reﬂects is a brand that's loved, product innovation that is both global
and locally relevant, and is going to speed up even more, a digital capability that's
incredibly strong. So this is a business that I think does well, and if I look at the
expansion of stores, the kind of returns you make ﬁnancially are strong. So I look at
this business and I say it's a good business to have, and we have no plans to look at
the options that you suggested.
We have a couple questions from online, so I'll just go through them one by one. The
ﬁrst one comes from David Tarantino, Baird. It's directed to Belinda. Can you please
address investor concerns about the rapid growth by lower-priced coﬀee
competitors in China? Is it impacting your business today? And how do you see the
coﬀee market evolving over the next 5 to 10 years in China?

{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Thank you for the question. I think we said quite a few things about competitions
already, but let me just start by saying that I'm very pleased with the results that we
posted in Q4 and also in FY '23. What I meant by that is you look at the record
number of stores that we've opened this year, 785 stores, net new stores, highest
ever. And you look at our transaction comp that we posted in Q4, which is a
sequential improvement from Q3. The beverages that we rolled out really drove new
customers, transactions, in-store visits. So very pleased with the sequential
improvement.
Now, I spoke about the full spectrum of experience set in my presentation, so let me
just add some colors to that. In China, Starbucks is the only brand right now uniquely
providing full categories in the space, in the channels that we have. We have
beverage obviously, food, merch, coﬀee, full spectrum at our scale, we're very
unique. You look at our day parts, very meaningful four day parts that we have built
out. And I talked about the breakfast day part that we're now even exceeding 2019.
So that's very exciting. So four very meaningful day parts. You look at our -- the store
portfolio that Lax just mentioned, we probably have one of the best real estate
portfolio for retail companies in China.
So you look at our 6,800 stores, they are in the best locations in China, which helps
us to provide the full spectrum of service that we provide. So we are -- we have all
that to fulﬁll our customers' occasions, needs, and I'm very conﬁdent that this is only
the beginning. The early chapters for Starbucks, you looked at the white space that
we haven't opened, the comp sales that we're going to continue to go dry for our
existing stores that we've opened. There are plenty, plenty of room to grow, a lot of
headroom ahead, and we're very conﬁdent and excited. And our brand is very
strong, so -- and our partners are great. We're going to continue to move forward.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
I'll just make one ﬁnal comment on that. It's interesting when markets evolve, they
tear. This is a market, it's actually in its fairly early days, it hasn't yet fully teared. You
can get low priced coﬀee just down the street, but when you look for an experience,
you look for something that's distinctive, you look for something that's quality, you
look for something that's innovative, clearly, you go to another place for it. And that's
the place for Starbucks, that's the place for Xingbake in China.
{BIO 17258322 <GO>}
Another question from online from Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer. This is for Rachel.
You talked about the $3 billion. Can you help us better understand what percent of
that $3 billion in cost-saving initiatives you plan to ﬂow through back to margins or
invest in the business? What we're trying to get at is, what is the net savings
initiative? Hopefully, you can share something related to the eﬃciencies.

Page 33 of 44A - Laxman Narasimhan
Q - Lauren Silberman
A - Rachel RuggeriThe way I look at it is, as I guided this morning, we're looking to see progressive
margin expansion. And when you look at ﬁscal year 2023, we expanded margin on a
full-year basis by 100 basis points, and that included over a $1 billion invested largely
in wages as we lapped the annualization of wages from the prior year. So we had
over a $1 billion invested in FY '23. And we were able to unlock eﬃciencies through
our reinvention plan that created and we were able to unlock eﬃciencies through
our reinvention plan that created sustainable operational eﬃciencies that helped us
support that investment, allowing us to expand margin, largely through sales
leverage and strategic pricing.
I would look at it in a similar way, where when you think about the $3 billion in
opportunity, particularly in the year we're in, you could say almost about a $1 billion
in eﬃciency will help support the $1 billion that I spoke about in OpEx investment. It
allows us to be able to leverage our business, to be able to continue to fund our
investments, while we continue to expand margin and grow our earnings.
So I would look at it from the perspective of what we delivered in FY '23, and how
that will translate into FY '24. That's the way I would think about the $3 billion. It's a
way for us to continue to fund the critical investments that we need to be able to
support our business, but also to be able to commit to the margin expansion and the
earnings growth over time. So it allows us to have a very balanced path in terms of
how we grow our business over the long-term, through revenue growth, as well as
through margin expansion. And that's diﬀerent from where we were a couple of
years ago.
So that's the important lock is that we'll be able to see earnings grow faster than
revenue while we're expanding margin, and importantly, investing back into our
business.

Hi, Lauren Silberman, Deutsche Bank. So can you talk about the decision to trim the
top-line guide, and perhaps if anything's changed from last year? And then if you
can speak to how you can still maintain the 15% to 20% EPS growth in ﬁscal '24 and
15% plus thereafter. Thank you.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Yes. What I would look at, Lauren, is this morning I provided guidance for ﬁscal year
2024. And so that's the low-end of the 10% to 12% revenue, the comp of 5% to 7%
progressive margin expansion and earnings growth of 15% to 20%. That's our
guidance for this year, that's why there's ranges because it's a guidance. With what
you saw in Laxman's presentation and what we've pointed to for the future, that's
more about the shape of a long-term algorithm when you take all these strategies
that we talked about today, that's the shape that supports a long-term algorithmFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

So I wouldn't look at it as guidance per se, I would look at it as a shape to what we
see for future opportunity. We'll continue to provide more fulsome and detailed
guidance annually, usually in Q4 when we provide next year's guidance like we'll do

Thank you. This is Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. I have one question and two quick
clariﬁcation if possible. So ﬁrst of all, I would like to understand whether the
implementation of the Siren System is going to change the typical renovation
timeline of your stores? And if so, what is the comp drag that you might be
expecting over the next three years related to the acceleration of the renovation?
And quick follow-ups if possible. Lax, I think you mentioned how excited you are on
the China business. I just didn't quite hear explicitly that you're not looking into
licensing, so I just want to conﬁrm that, that was your answer, you're not looking into
licensing China right now. And then the second clariﬁcation if possible. Last year, you
mentioned about $20 billion of shareholder returns that were expected by '25. I
wonder whether this is still relevant in the context of the updated guidance?

Thank you for following. I'll just take the second question. The answer is no, we're not
looking at it. Let me go to the Siren System and maybe perhaps you can take it on.
Should we start with that?
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Yes.
And I'll be succinct on the Siren System. Yes. Obviously, with the level of equipment
that we're putting into the stores and the investments that we're making, renovation
timelines will extend. However, two things that are happening simultaneously. One,
we're working to develop new ways and to drive eﬃciency in our overall new store
build out and renovation process, really to shorten those timelines overall. So that's

that the investments that we're making are going to unlock capacity and drive, right,
more throughput and help us to tap into unmet demand that exists today. So
therefore, we're not anticipating a comp drag.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Great. And Rachel, perhaps you want to take the capital allocation question.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Sure. And as it relates to the $20 billion, that $20 billion, we expected by 2025, we're
still committed to that. It could be a little bit further out. We will still drive, and these
are the reasons, is we will still drive high-return, growth-oriented investments. So our
ability to drive our ROIC this year to 25%, which was much faster than what we
expected as we shared last year at Investor Day, we'll continue to focus on
investments that will help us to continue to see improvement in our ROIC.
In addition to that, we're committed to a leading dividend, and we'll continue to
target an approximately 50% payout ratio. As it relates to share repurchases, given
the interest rate environment, we're evaluating taking on any new debt in support of
share repurchases at this time. But I want to be clear that share repurchases, as I
shared last year, and no diﬀerent, would be about 1% on our earnings growth net of
interest. So a little bit more signiﬁcant than when we had last year, but about 1%. But
as we continue to see how things go, we'll continue to evaluate the perspective in
terms of what we do with share buybacks this year. But I think what's more important
for us is to make sure that we maintain ﬂexibility in our balance sheet while we
continue to support our critical investments.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
So those are your three questions, right? Wonderful. Yes, please. Sorry, I just want to
be sure they were three. Yes. Yes.
{BIO 15824796 <GO>}
Thanks. Peter Saleh, BTIG. You mentioned 4% unit growth in the U.S. in FY '24. And
Rachel, you and I were chatting before, and you indicated that most of that is going
to be drive-thru. Where does that leave your drive-thru mix at the end of '24 versus
about 50% pre-pandemic? And what's been the impact on the check and the traﬃc
through that transition?
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Can I take that?

A - Laxman NarasimhanWe'll start to see our mix move from move from 70% over time, closer upto -- closer
to 80%. It'll take a little time to get there. But I would say, our record ticket that we
saw this quarter, and even when you think about from a pre-COVID level, our ticket's
grown by 50% since pre-COVID. A little less than half of that is pricing. The
remainder is the increase we're seeing in attach, mix, and customization, which is
largely fueled by the growth we see in drive-thru, which has higher group orders.
In addition to that, we're seeing a growing delivery business. So delivery as a
percent of sales this quarter was 4%, that's up from 2% a year-ago. Delivery also has
much higher attach due to the group orders. So we see our shift towards continuing
to open new stores, continuing to open more drive-thrus, as well as continue to grow
channels like delivery, as well as growing our rewards program and MOP in our U.S.
licensed stores, as an example, as all opportunities for us to continue to drive
revenue growth in a more balanced way, where we'll see growth coming from traﬃc,
but we'll also see growth coming from a more strategic ticket, meaning we will drive
it through attach, customization and more premium beverages.

Great. Yes, go ahead.
{BIO 19285890 <GO>}
Thank you. Sorry, I am going to sit behind a pole. Brian Harbour from Morgan
Stanley. One quick one. Renovation pace, do you think that you could do more of
them after '24? Is that roughly 1,000 kind of the right pace going forward? Second
question was just, can you talk about -- could the broader team talk about some
examples of things within manufacturing, sourcing, distribution that you think will be
driving those cost reductions? Or there was also another bucket, I don't know, if
you'd care to comment on that, or maybe that's still TBD.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Well, Sara, why don't you take the ﬁrst one on in terms of renovations?
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
Can you -- I'm not sure I caught the question.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
So the question was, you've said we're going to take up the renovations to about
1,000 a year. I think your question was, could we go even faster than that? Is that
your question?

A 1,000 a year is at a higher rate and a pace than we've historically done. And I think
to the question earlier about closure times and really just trying to balance the needs
of our customers who rely on Starbucks and want to make sure they can access us in
their daily lives, we don't feel like there is today a path, right, to accelerate past to
1,000, but I want to punctuate that today. Because if I link back to the earlier
discussion, as we ﬁnd, right, eﬃciencies in the process for our renovations, and as we
continue to work to shorten down those timelines, as we look out to future years, we
can imagine a future, right, where we can continue to increase the rate of those
renovations. And remember, we're doing this on top of our new store growth
simultaneously. It's a lot of projects.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
For your second question, I'd like to call on Arthur. Arthur's just joined us a few
months. He's going through his immersions. Arthur, ﬁrst impressions.
{BIO 19688551 <GO>}
Yes, thank you, Laxman, and thank you for the question. I get to get involved here.
It's exciting. So brand new to the organization, about three months in. But the
question, I think, is very, very important to what you saw Rachel present today in the
combination of the in-store and the out-of-store. The out-of-store is a big component
of the eﬃciency and the problem we need to solve over the next three years. And
my role in solving that was to ﬁrst, my immersion was in the store, really looking at
what are the processes that our partners in the store are dealing with? What are the
back room, or what we call, the factory in the back, what are those opportunities, and
how could that product and the ﬂow of goods come in? And then working your way
back up to the system is how does distribution have to change so that the eﬃciency
and the variance that our partners are dealing with in store today can be removed
and standardized in order to allow for that eﬃciency and faster processing to take
place in the front of store, which is the theater?
Well, all of that is associated and predicated on how we actually buy, how we make,
how we then process and ﬂow, how we're consistent, how the accountability that we
have to provide to our suppliers, in the way that they're on time with their deliveries,
in the way that they are supporting our ﬁll rate needs and the ﬂow. So where it's early
days and what I've studied, I think, the opportunity that we have out of store is real
and it can be achieved. And I'm looking forward to working with my personal team
and with the team here on deck to help us solve those problems. But early days tell
me it's an achievable process improvement that can take place and helping our
partners and our customers have a diﬀerent experience over time.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}

Page 38 of 44A - Rachel Ruggeri
A - Laxman Narasimhan
A - Brady BrewerSara Senatore with Bank of America. I have, I guess, two questions, keeping with the
theme. One is, Rachel, you talked about sort of 85% of the CapEx going to stores.
Could you maybe talk about how you split up the incremental CapEx, the diﬀerence
between last year and this year?
And then the second question, which is perhaps harder to measure a lot of what I
think has been talked about is basically meeting unmet demand. So things like in
stocks or things like throughput, and then talking to customers who you already have
a relationship with through loyalty. Is there a way to quantify or at least give a sort of
magnitude, relative magnitude of those opportunities to think about growth,
whether it's what you see when somebody joins in terms of spend increases, how
you measure the impact of things like out of stocks of food or even throughput if you
want to talk about like sort of seconds of productivity, but just putting numbers
behind it, please.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
I can start with the capital. So of the increase this year, we were around $2.3 billion in
capital, and we're moving to around approximately $3 billion. All of that increase is in
the increase in the number of stores that we're opening globally, and then the
higher renovations. So that's really where all of that increase lands from a capital
standpoint. I think what's important about that is those are very high return growth-
oriented investments. So that will help fuel continued improvements that we expect
in ROIC as an example, while continuing to help us ﬁnd go after some of the unmet
demands that we've spoken about today.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Brady, do you want to take the question on customers?
{BIO 17845948 <GO>}
Sure. Yes, I mean, we slice and dice our business with so many metrics that we -- I
can't share all of them today. But what I can assure you is we do see signiﬁcant
increases when someone joins Starbucks rewards. That curve steepens when they
start mobile ordering. We have what we look at as latent demand, and we measure
that. How many people balk walking in the store and walk out? How many people
balk outside of the store? What does that look like in a drive-thru? So we look at
latent demand that we're unable to serve.
But then we also look at customers and what new opportunities can we capture? So
we look at the market and the demand spaces of the market. We measure where
Starbucks is playing, what the headroom is, and we strategically go after those
spaces. We do that with product innovation, we do it with services like delivery. I
mean, remember, I think what you've heard Laxman talk about earlier today, and
Sara was that, the delivery business is approaching a $1 billion in the U.S. That's a
business we didn't even have a couple of years ago. So very strategically and
precisely looking at opportunities to capture new customer occasions and address
latent demand that we're not able to serve eﬀectively yet, that all ties in with the
eﬃciency that we're talking about as well. So very disciplined, very metrics-driven
and we pursue it with a lot of strategic rigor.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

I know it's early days and we can't share numbers on the supply chain, your question
on ﬁll rates and alike. But do you want to just philosophically just address this
question?
Yes, I think it's a great question. It's intuitive to how the store operates today with
what we're saying and describing the Siren System and then the needs from the
upstream from the out of store. And absolutely, there is opportunities for us, and
that's what we're sharing in our eﬃciency models of how we think about operating
diﬀerently in the way we ﬂow goods in and the way we operate in a standardized.
You heard us talk about today purpose-driven store models models, right? Think of
that as purpose-driven demand models as well, right? It's allowing us to standardize
the variance and standardize the process so that's easier for our partners and
customers. And that's how we lead to a consistent time of performance against the
customer needs.
I think what I'm going to do is also, as I said earlier, there are things in China that we
have and the way we've digitized our operations that I would love to have here.
Belinda, could you talk a little bit about particularly that question just around --
{BIO 17337899 <GO>}
Yes. Yes, so I'm very excited to share that. In the past three years, while we were
having COVID distractions, we wrote out a project we called Rainbow in all of our
stores. It took us two years to do so. What it is, is that we use technology like IoT, a
new ALP system, and we made it much easier for our goods to arrive at the stores
and make it very easier for our partners reduce the number of hours that they have
to receive. And then when throughout the in-store, the inventory management, it's all
digitalized.
So what happens at the end is that we are much better in handling waste, reducing,
and also inventory management, a lot of reduction on labor hours, and also a lot
more accurate. So it helps us to forecast much better, and that is all digitalized, and
that is part of what I've just shared in my presentation on the eﬃciencies that we've
talked about. Now, so that's Project Rainbow and what we've done in-store. Now,
again, I won't go into it, because you've heard it before, the Coﬀee Innovation Park
that we also just opened, that's our manufacturing, that gives us -- that is now giving
us the fully integrated supply chain, and that's going to give us a lot more
productivities as well going forward.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
You should know, I've been to China twice in the last ﬁve months, and the second
trip that I went to, which is probably the sixth week that Arthur was in, I took him with
me. And he spent all his time basically looking to see what that system is and seeing
how we can actually in some ways bring it here. Because I think it's entirely possible.

A - Brady BrewerLaxman, there's been a few questions about refranchising China. I kind of wanted to
ﬂip it the other way. I think one of the biggest maybe stamps that your, not
predecessor, but Kevin Johnson put on the business was actually consolidating the
business into two bets on the U.S. and on China. I'm curious. It seems like one of the
big focuses today is on highlighting the growth in international outside of China.
That feels like an incremental message you're trying to get across today. Have you
considered whether or not you want to do equity bets around the world outside of
just the U.S. and China and almost ﬂip kind of what Kevin Johnson did on its head?
I'm just curious if that's something you've considered, any thoughts on it? Thanks.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
No, we haven't considered a full equity ﬂip. We have not. But because part of it is we
have great partners in various parts of the world, and what they have done is they've
come to us, shown what is it they can do, the kind of returns they can get. They have
great management teams. We bet on those management teams. And the fact is in
India, for example, we have a joint venture, right? We have 50-50 joint venture in
India.
So the real thing we're focused on is global growth. As coﬀee culture expands in
various parts of the world, and if you take a look at the strength of the brand, we are
now in 86 markets. And many of these markets were not as fully penetrated as we
could be. The question is, how do we take up the trajectory of our presence in these
markets, particularly as they continue to grow? So it is, in fact, a third leg of the stool
that I am highlighting, right? You've clearly got the U.S., you have got China, and we
can do this in the most capital-eﬃcient manner, we will.
Yes, please. Right here. Yes, right. I like that. Yes.
Thanks. Dave Palmer again. I think investors are often scared of a recession with
Starbucks. They fear that at least an economic slowdown is looming, that the brand
would fare any fraction as badly as it did back in the Great Recession. And so I
wonder, there are also some fast food players out there that are already seeing
slippage in the low income cohorts out there. So they're already speaking to
weakness or areas of that. So I was wondering if you could maybe address that head
on. Are you seeing any signs of weakness out there? I know you just had a great
quarter, but perhaps if you slice that, you can see something diﬀerent. But more
importantly, how could you adjust better than maybe the old Starbucks back in '07,
'08 did with that the mix you got and the digital tools you have today? Thanks.

A - Laxman Narasimhan
Q - John Tower
A - Rachel RuggeriYes. So I guess the headline answer to that is our transactions are strong and
growing. And as recently as the last quarter, we're seeing that true. So it has not
shown up in our business as it has shown up in other businesses in the market. I
mean, what we see macro level-wise across the landscape of consumers in the U.S. is
the consumer is fairly stable. Where they're choosing to splurge is experience over
durable goods. And when they're talking about experiences, they're talking about
travel and restaurants and bars. And the younger you go, the more likely they are to
splurge in restaurants and bars as the one place where they want to spend. So
Starbucks is the beneﬁciary of that.
Our business has not been impacted. Transaction strong and growing. And we have
more customers than ever, a record number of customers coming to Starbucks. What
I'd say versus the 2007-2008 is back to that digital customer relationship that we
have with a rewards program, with the products that we have that they can't ﬁnd
anywhere else. It's a very resilient brand, even more resilient than 2007, '8, '9,
because we didn't have those tools to the level we have them today. So product
quality, product innovation, a rewards program that engages them, we feel good
going into uncertain times as always about the resilience of the brand.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}

{BIO 18857052 <GO>}
Hey, got a simple one. John Tower, Citi. Just curious, the long-term same-store sales
target that you outlined, the 5% or greater over time, I'm just curious if you could
break down how you're thinking about the components of that. Obviously, there's
puts and takes in terms of what's playing in at diﬀerent times across the globe, but
5% on a business this large seems like a big number over the long-term. So I'm
curious to hear your thinking around it.

{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 18857052 <GO>}
Correct.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
I would say we think about that comp largely as a combination of increasing traﬃc,
but also I think what's diﬀerent when you think about, even the past versus today is
that we have an ability to drive comp through more strategic pricing. So our ticket
can be higher, not from typical pricing moves we've done in the past, but moreFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-11-02

but also the concept of customization. So when we think about that 5% comp, we
have more of a balanced opportunity for growth between traﬃc and a higher ticket
related to these areas of opportunity we've seen come to life in the past couple of
years and accelerated.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
Thank you. We'll go to the back.
Thanks, Laxman. Here, I mean North America hitting 18,000 stores plus early next
year, U.S. 16,000, at the long-term goal of 20,000 plus stores, can you elaborate on if
we are really this close to the saturation? Or do you guys have planned to revisit the
portfolio like closed on low-performing stores, like probably replace it with a higher
volume stores? And then also on the peak margins commentary returning back to
that like do you have a timeline in mind and how we get there? And a quick follow-
up to that, on the G&A Laxman, did you get a chance to revisit the G&A structure like
probably as a percentage of revenues or on a per company store basis since you got
your seat? Thank you.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
You know what, you've asked three questions. So with that, why don't I go to you for
the ﬁrst one? Go ahead on the number of stores.
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
Just a couple of thoughts on growth. I mean, one of the things that I want to come
back to really is the purpose-deﬁned strategy, because what we're doing is, we are
moving forward with stores that really complete, they don't compete, right, with our
existing stores. Again, if you think about what's happening with convenience,
speciﬁcally, the growth in drive-thrus, the growth in mobile order and pay, it is just so
clear, right, that there is an opportunity to capture some of that demand in inﬁll type
stores. So that's a big, big piece of our bet looking forward. So that's everything from
pickup stores to drive-thru only stores, to double drive-thru stores, and even to
delivery.
Now, we still see a very viable path, and we have not come anywhere near to tapping
out with our core drive-thru model either. So if I look at what's happening in the
center of the country, places like Tuscaloosa and other markets of that scale, there is
just so much opportunity. We're welcomed, we're celebrated as a brand in those
markets. And I think, we've got an oﬀering that continues to be incredibly
compelling. So there's no slowing down at this point, and we're really excited about
the future in terms of continuing to grow scale and in-store count.

Before I address that, I just want to -- you asked a point around, our stores and
potential closures, and it goes back to a little bit about the question that's what's
diﬀerent from 2008, and even as we continue to expand, is we have an incredibly
strong portfolio across the globe. So many years ago, we had stores that were not
performing well, and a couple years ago, when we did our trade area transformation,
we really strengthened our portfolio. So we have a very strong and healthy portfolio,
and that helps support not only the business we have today, but then it gives us even
more conﬁdence as we continue to grow. As it relates to --
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
And that is true across the world.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
That's right.
{BIO 19067074 <GO>}
It's not just here. It's across the world.
{BIO 20021043 <GO>}
Yes. Yes. And as it relates to the margins, where we -- where I said in my prepared
remarks that we would continue to progressively expand margin returning to
historical levels over time. I think it's -- there's a lot of questions around, will we see
that 19% to 20%? I think our high was like a 19.7% at the total company level when we
were in '19. And what I would say around that is, absolutely, we have the opportunity
to be returning to those levels of margin.
But I think what's more important for us, is that we continue to be ﬂexible rather than
guiding to a margin percent, but ensuring that we expand every year, and we will, is
ensuring that we are ﬂexible so that we can continue to invest in our business. It'd be
investments in partners, investments in technology, investments in stores, those
investments are critical to fuel our growth. And so we need to be able to do that and
have that ﬂexibility so that we can support the earnings growth that we're guiding to,
which at the end of the day, right, that's the attractive part of the equation in the end.
And to do it in a way that's balanced and healthy, I think, is really important.
{BIO 19784170 <GO>}
And as relates to the closures question, I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that piece. We
have an always on process for reviewing our store portfolio, quarter-by-quarter, with
a lot of diligence and a strong methodology. And so we're not anticipating anything
new and above and beyond in that. It's just going to be a continual process as we
continue to reposition our portfolio over time.

Page 44 of 44I have not forgotten your third question, which was on G&A. I think as Rachel
mentioned in her presentation, we did make some choiceful investments in G&A,
particularly as we started the reinvention program. And the intention for us is for that
to grow slower than revenue growth. So we will see leverage in the G&A line as we
go. So hopefully that addresses your question.
