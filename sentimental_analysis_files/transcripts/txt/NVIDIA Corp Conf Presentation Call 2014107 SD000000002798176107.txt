Okay. Good morning, why don't we go ahead and get started. Good to see all of
you. My name is Harlan Sur, small; to mid-cap semiconductor and semiconductor
capital equipment analyst at JPMorgan. We are very pleased to have Rob Csongor,
Vice President of Investor Relations at NVIDIA here with us this morning. We also
have Colette Kress, who recently joined NVIDIA -- she is there waving -- recently
joined NVIDIA as their Chief Financial Oﬃcer. This happened in September. So
Colette, thank you for joining us this morning as well.
NVIDIA held its press conference on Sunday evening. And what I've asked Rob to do
is to spend a few minutes just giving a brief overview of what the team is showcasing
here at CES. And then we will open it up for Q&A. So Rob, thanks very much for
joining us this morning.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, Harlan. Good morning, everyone. It's pretty exciting -- CES for us.
I think, as you guys know, NVIDIA is singularly focused on visual computing. And
what that has meant for NVIDIA in the past has been primarily the PC. NVIDIA has
been reinventing itself and bringing visual computing into a number of new markets
as visual computing becomes important in other markets. And it's been extremely
exciting for us at CES to show the work that we have been doing and the work that
some of our partners have been doing, including some really exciting
announcements last night and some more announcements coming today. So I'll not
just cover what -- not only what we covered at the press conference. But I'll also talk
about some of the new news that's coming on.
I can summarize what we have announced really in three fundamental areas. First of
all, we made a number of new announcements on gaming. We announced a fewFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 11new things on chips. And we announced a few new things about cars. So what I'll do
is kind of run you through those things.
On the gaming side, you guys are no doubt aware that there is a next-generation
gaming console ﬂeet out there. But the other thing that's out there now in what is the
largest gaming market is next-generation PC gaming. And we announced a very key
technology called GameStream. Fundamentally, what next-generation PC gaming is
is the ability to play the highest-ﬁdelity games anywhere you want.
So what we demonstrated was NVIDIA technology running ﬁrst of all on a PC. So we
were playing the latest high-end Batman game. The audience could see Batman
playing on a PC. But then we showed it playing on a television using the shield
device that we had. GameStream is streaming live in perfect synchronization
anything that's happening on your PC into another room in your house, where you
sit and play with a shield. And then play it on the television.
We then showed the same game not just playing on a shield. But also being
streamed from France. So in other words, what we showed was interactive gaming
going over 6000 miles, 30 milliseconds. That's how long it takes the speed of light
to reach from France to Las Vegas. And we showed completely synchronous
interaction playing the same game, Batman, on a mobile device, being streamed
from France.
So these are new technologies that fundamentally take gaming and allow you to
have the highest ﬁdelity, highest performance PC gaming. But play it anywhere you
want; on the road, inside your house, in front of your PC or in front of your television.
And these are technologies that we think are important and coming out very soon.
The other key announcement we made in gaming was a new technology called G-
SYNC. Now if you're a gamer, you will be intimately and immediately familiar with the
phenomena of tearing. So for those of you not familiar with it, historically -- and this
is a decades-old problem -- the monitor and PC exist out of sync with each other. In
other words, the monitor -- the GPU renders frames for a game interactively. And
then the display displays it when it can.
So in order to sync the two, what happens is you buﬀer. And occasionally what you'll
see is stuttering on the screen, or you'll see the phenomena known as tearing where
half the screen will be rendered. Then it's already rendering the next frame. And then
they are out of sync. So you see this kind of rippled tear across the middle of the
screen. This is a decades-old problem that everybody has lived with. We have been
working on new technology that goes into the monitor and then synchronizes the
monitor so that the monitor and the GPU exist in perfect synchronization. It displays
when we render. And what that required is technology and then collaboration with
all of the display guys. So what we announced at CES was that display
manufacturers, including ASUS, BenQ, Philips and a whole list of other display
manufacturers are going to be releasing G-SYNC monitors that allow this frame rate.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Page 3 of 11It sounds like second-order technology. And I promise you it's not. Some of the
reaction from the press has been this is the single biggest thing we've seen in
gaming in a very, very long time. It creates the immediate eﬀect of 60 frames per
second, silk graphics and gaming instead of this decades-long problem with
stuttering. So those are the announcements on gaming.
We were really excited to announce our next-generation Tegra. You guys know that
last year, we introduced Tegra 4 late to the market. And we said that we were
introducing Tegra 4 late to the market in order to move in the schedule of a product
called Project Logan. Well we paid the consequences last year. And on Sunday we
got to reap the rewards.
So we announced a new product. Everyone was expecting it to be called Tegra 5. It's
called Tegra K-1. And what we did is we took the best GPU we make, Kepler. And we
moved it to Tegra. This does more than just increase the performance of our chip.
What it does is instantaneously take all the content we have in PC. It takes all of the
content we have in CUDA. You guys are familiar with CUDA, our computer
architecture. And all of that content is now brought to the mobile world.
I've got to read you some quotes; these are quotes from the press. Anon -- from
Anon Tech, I think if you guys are familiar with the tech world, he is probably one of
the more respected. He said with Tegra K-1, NVIDIA went overnight from playing
games to drop-dead serious. And Tim Sweeney is the founder of Epic Games. Epic
Games is one of the largest content developers for gaming. Tim said we can take
absolutely anything that runs on PC or high-end console and run it on Tegra K-1. I
didn't think we would be at this level for another 3 to four years.
So that was one thing. By the way, Tegra K-1 consists of 192 cores. It's a 192-core
super chip. But this is not like when we talk about Tegra 3 or Tegra 4. When we talk
about Tegra 4, we say it's a 72-core GPU. That's talking about graphics. This is a 192-
core fully programmable graphics and processing core super chip.
So we are extremely excited about that. And there's a number of things that we
showcased at our event. If you come to our booth, you can see what's possible, what
can you do now on a tablet, a phone, a car, with this level of processing capability.
There was one other surprise that we kind of popped. I don't think people were
expecting this. But we announced that Tegra K-1 is going to come in two ﬂavors. The
ﬁrst ﬂavor is what people were expecting: a 32-bit Quad-core A-15 processor with
192 cores.
The second thing we announced was the ﬁrst Denver product that we have been
talking about for a number of years. So we announced a number of years ago that
NVIDIA had an architectural license for ARM -- with ARM for V8. And what we not
only announced yesterday. But we showed it running. We showed our dual-Denver
version of Tegra K-1. And we showed it running Android. So that was the ﬁrstFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11demonstration of Android running on a 64-bit apps processor. And that was on
Sunday.
Okay, the third area was cars. What we announced on Sunday was a new product
called Tegra K-1 VCM. So VCM stands for vehicle control module. So if you can
imagine, what we did is we took Tegra K-1 -- and remember, I said this is not just
about graphics horsepower. This is about the world of CUDA: taking all the compute
applications, computer vision, all of those types of applications. And now moving it
into a mobile world. And Tegra K-1 for VCM basically brings supercomputing into
your car.
Car & Driver, by the way, let me just read you a quote here really quick. The next
generation of Tegra will perform at 384 gigaﬂops with four processors per car. A
two-car garage would have as much computing power as the $120 million Blue
Mountain supercomputer installed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1988. So
this is Gary Vasilash from Car & Driver.
So I think -- the car used to be a collection of metal, upholstery and rubber. And it is
very rapidly becoming a supercomputer. And it sounds very grandiose to say it. But
when I tell you about what happened last night, I think you'll understand why it's not.
What we did, the second thing that we showed oﬀ was a product, an initiative from
NVIDIA called Project Mercury. One of the announcements that you'll see today is
announcement between NVIDIA and Audi to create rendered instrument panel
consoles for the ﬂeet of Audi cars. And what's required for consumers, if you want to
replace the physical gauges and replace them with rendered, the advantages is not
eye candy. It's not just eye candy. If you talk to Audi, they are dead serious about the
implications of human-machine interface and the advantages of rendered displays
as it pertains to safety, better features, more awareness for the driver and what they
call advanced driver systems.
So one of the things that we showcased in the press event was Tegra K-1 for what's
called ADAS; it's Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. So what this does is the car
equipped with cameras is doing computer vision using a Tegra, to do things like
pedestrian detection, collision avoidance, blind spot management, lane warning, to
keep the car, adaptive cruise control, all done automatically using the computer. So
there is a tremendous amount of processing power involved with doing this. And we
demonstrated this.
The second thing was we showed rendered instrument cluster and the amount of
horsepower -- and I just invite you to come to the NVIDIA booth, because you really
have to see it to kind of grasp what you're looking at. You can custom-create your
instrument panel. Using tools developed by NVIDIA and an incredible amount of
software, you can create brushed aluminum, bump rubber, chrome. You can do all
these things. And we couldn't do it with Tegra 4. The amount of computation
required to create something that looks so real and is lit, using global illumination, to
create that level of realism, is just not possible unless you have a tremendousFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Q - Harlan Suramount of computing power. And that's what Tegra K-1 brings to the instrument
cluster. Okay?
Let's see. There was -- I think today, if you say the word Android, most people think
of phones and tablets, because that's what mobile is. So -- but one of the things that
was announced yesterday was we did an announcement together. Google and
NVIDIA together with Audi, Honda, Hyundai and GM announced the open
automobile alliance group, which is -- has the objective and mission to bring the
Android platform to a device that's always been mobile: the car. So when we've
talked in the past about how Android is moving beyond phones and tablets to lots
of other devices like televisions and consoles, yesterday's announcement is the
concrete delivery. You're going to see Android in a lot of diﬀerent devices. And
NVIDIA's focus with Tegra is on those segments of the Android market where visual
computing matters. And the automobile is clearly one of them.
There's one more announcement that you will see today. NVIDIA and Audi are
announcing three new things. We are announcing a new infotainment system that's
twice the power of the previous generation. We are announcing a fully integrated
rear seat tablet that integrates together with the car's infotainment system. And we
are announcing the ﬁrst fully rendered instrument cluster powered by NVIDIA Tegra.
There was one other thing very cool. And then I am done. Last night at the Audi
keynote, Rupert Stadler, the Chairman of the Board and CEO of Audi, announced a
new system called zFAS. And zFAS is just astounding. At the -- I don't know if you
guys saw it. But at the announcement last night, at the keynote, Audi had two cars
drive themselves onto the stage. zFAS is a system for piloted driving. And Jen-Hsun,
our NVIDIA CEO, came onstage with Audi to announce that zFAS is powered by
Tegra K-1. So that was very exciting for us. It's just the result of a lot of work at NVIDIA
and we are very pleased.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Great. Well thanks for that overview on what the team is showcasing here.
On Tegra K-1, obviously you guys have working 28 nanometer silicon, I think the
tablet you're using here is based on Tegra K-1. Is that correct?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Yes. I have one here.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Then I think Jen-Hsun showed the Denver-based 64-bit-based version of K-1 at the
press event on Sunday. So I guess the question is, when is the team going to be in
the position to start shipping qualiﬁed production units? And when are we going toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Q - Harlan Suractually start to see Tegra K-1 showing up in customer smartphones and tablets? Is it
2014, or is it 2015? Can you just give us a sense on time lines?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Yes, sure, it will be this year for sure.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
When we announced Tegra K-1, we are not announcing demos. We did demos last
year. We did sneak previews of Logan last year. So what we are announcing is that
we are moving into production. So you're going to see devices being built in Q1.
And then I would expect that you would see device -- devices start coming out in the
Q2 time frame.
And most likely, the announcements -- most likely announcements are on that are
done close to the launch of the product --
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
-- With the exception of last night's announcements with Audi.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
And I'm assuming that the ﬁrst devices that are going to be rolled out are going to
be based on the Quad-Core A-15 architecture versus the Denver architecture? Is that
a fair assumption?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
Yes. That's right, Harlan. The ﬁrst devices that are coming out are the Quad-Core A15,
the 32-bit. And the 64-bit we demoed last night for the very ﬁrst time. The part had
literally just come back like a week ago. And it was up and running. So we said hey,
let's show it.
But that will I think -- what that means is that we have functioning parts right now.
And then you can look for it to come really in the second half of the year.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Okay. And one of the trends in the smartphone and the tablet space from an
applications processor perspective has been -- we've seen more and more
integrated platforms coming to the market, in other words, integrated appsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Q - Harlan Sur
A - Rob Csongorprocessor with LTE baseband modem. So question for you is similar to your Tegra 4
strategy, you had a Tegra 4i with integrated LTE cellular connectivity. Is that a strategy
that you're going to pursue as well with TK-1?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
We haven't announced anything. We just announced the Tegra K-1 right now. So we
haven't announced any kind of roadmap really beyond that. But it's clear that the
modem is important for us.
One of the other things that Audi talked about last night was the concept of the
connected car. All these cars are going to be connected via LTE, almost continuously.
A recent report came out. And by 2017 almost every car on the road will be
connected on a continuous basis.
So the investment we made in acquiring Icera was our recognition that this is a key
component of visual computing. We are not in the baseband business; we are in the
visual computing business. And the baseband helps us.
Now in some cases, an integrated solution might make sense. And in some cases a
discrete solution would make sense. So I think we are -- we will have both. You will
see both. And then as we get more into these markets, I think we'll unveil more of
our roadmap and you will see where we make decisions on what goes where.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Okay. As it relates to Tegra VCM for automotive, I think this is a great example of
addressing the need for more processing horsepower, processing capabilities in
cars to support things like ADAS, right, for things like collision avoidance. ADAS
requires heavy computational power running very sophisticated algorithms. So how
does this move to more intelligence in the car increase in NVIDIA's dollar content
per car, looking out over the next 1 to three years? So for example, if you take the
current Audis that are shipping today with -- I think it's Tegra 3. And maybe compare
that to some of the partnerships that you are announcing today and those cars. And
how much Tegra content could we see in the next 2 to three years?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
You could end up -- I would say with as many as eight processors per car. The ﬁrst
cars with NVIDIA really just focused on infotainment. And when I say infotainment,
that really means the car nav. We very rapidly started moving to cars that had two. So
for example, the Tesla S sedan, you guys are familiar with, has a big beautiful 17-inch
display in the center, very high-resolution moving map of Google Earth. That was a
collaboration between NVIDIA and Audi and Google. And that car has two.
I think when you start introducing instrument cluster, when you start introducing
ADAS, you very rapidly start adding -- you need a lot more compute capability to do
those types of things. And I think as more and more of these features and all of these
features are very, very visual computing-intense, as you said, you will see more
processors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Okay. Obviously, the design-in lead times are pretty long in the automotive space.
So when would you envision seeing Tegra K-1 VCM starting to show up in next-
generation automobiles?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
That's actually a great question. The answer a long time ago would've been: it takes
forever. I was actually -- I started -- in 2003, I was actually GM of automotive. And we
closed our ﬁrst design win. And that product didn't come to market for six years.
I think one of the things that Rupert Stadler talked about last night in his keynote was
that the car is evolving. The car always used to lag technology-wise behind
consumer electronics because of the fundamental nature of how a car was
architected in. With VCM capability -- imagine a backplane similar to a PC with a
consistent architecture. And as new technology comes, you can simply replace a
VCM and put in the latest technology with the appropriate software.
The end result is that time to market for new technology literally has gone from six
years to a couple of months. And I think what you will see going forward is that the
car is going to advance beyond the capabilities of your smartphone very rapidly. As
you can imagine, in order to do pilot of driving, computer vision and all of that type
of thing, that's a level of horsepower that I don't think you have in your smartphone
today.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Why don't we see if there are any questions from the audience.
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
It's perfectly clear, yes.
The technology seems really impressive. But how much is the incremental revenue
growth of the new product versus the old? And how much more proﬁtable or less
proﬁtable is the new product?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
That's a good question. I would say that we haven't talked -- we haven't unveiled
speciﬁc ASPs. And there's a lot of productization and a lot more things that have to
happen. But we have talked about the revenue growth of our automotive business.
Today, it's roughly a $100 million business for us. But very rapidly ramping. And it's
very steadily ramping. We have also said that it is our largest backlog -- revenue
backlog. And the reason is the bad news is, as Harlan said, is it takes forever to get
designed in. But once you get designed in, you get a purchase order that extendsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

A - Rob Csongorout for many, many years. So that's why the revenue backlog is something a lot more
visible for us.
So based on what we can see, we have talked about the fact that we see the
business roughly doubling on a year-to-year basis to $400 million by 2016. And
depending on how fast some of these new driver systems and advanced features go.
And I think you will learn a lot more -- there's a lot of design wins and a lot of things
that we haven't been able to introduce or talk about yet. And I think as some of that
becomes clear, you'll see a lot more of the tangible indicators of that revenue
growth.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
That -- so that was doubling to $400 million in ﬁscal 2016, right?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
I think we said by 2016.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
By 2016, okay, got it. Question over here?
Could you talk about design wins on 4i?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
The question is -- can we talk about design wins on 4i? The honest answer is no, not
today. We don't have any news to date on that. CES has actually become less and
less of a phone show. I think a lot of people kind of look at MWC as their next stuﬀ.
But Tegra 4i is doing great. And when we have some news, we'll share it.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
I've got a question on Tegra 4. We were surprised with the win that the NVIDIA team
captured on the Xiaomi Mi-3 smartphone for China. As most of you know, Xiaomi is
one of the fastest smartphone suppliers in China. Up until the Mi-3, Xiaomi had
exclusively used QUALCOMM on their prior 2 generations of phones. And we're also
hearing about Tegra 4 showing up on smart TD-LTE smartphones at ZTE and a few
more high-end China smartphone suppliers.
So the question for you is -- what are the performance diﬀerentiators that are
enabling Tegra 4 to do well, especially with some of the high-end China smartphone
OEMs?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
That's a great question. And I think it's -- if I can, I'll kind of take your question and try
to address I think what is one of -- a fundamental concept of Tegra.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Page 10 of 11Q - Harlan Sur
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Rob CsongorWe get asked all the time, how can Tegra succeed when you're going to be
competing against MediaTek and QUALCOMM on low-end phones and so on? It
always is kind of a weird question for us because, similar to the PC market, we have
never been a low-cost supplier. We have never competed in the low end of the PC
market. 70% of the PC market you don't need an NVIDIA GPU and we've never sold
to it.
What we do is we carve out segments of these markets where visual computing
matters. And then we sell into those markets where people really value it. Then we
drive a very large business with very large gross margins, good operating income,
we generate cash etc., etc.
In the PC market, those segments are gaming and professional design. Our strategy
with Tegra is the same. You will not see Tegra in low-end phones competing with
MediaTek, or with QUALCOMM. But you will see Tegra in devices where visual
computing matters. The Xiaomi phone is an example of a device where visual
computing matters. Xiaomi wanted to put out a phone that would win every
benchmark in the China press. They would outperform smartphone, outperform
Samsung Galaxy S4. And it would run the best games in the largest Android gaming
market in the world, which is China. And for that, they went with Tegra. And they
accomplished exactly what they set out.
Now phone -- I know that when you say Android, you automatically think about
phone. And phone is an opportunity for NVIDIA. But we view the Android
opportunity for Tegra as much, much more than phones. Another way to say it is that
it is not critical to the success of Tegra for us to win every phone design. And
hopefully, when you take a look at new types of devices coming out, new types of
tablets, when you see the capabilities of what Tegra K-1 can do in a tablet, when you
see what it does to a car, when you see what it can do to other devices that I think
you'll see coming out this year, then I think you will understand that NVIDIA's focus.
{BIO 6539622 <GO>}
Got it. One question back there.
What is your view on the Chromebook market and the suitability of the ARM
architecture for it and NVIDIA's plans?
{BIO 3210739 <GO>}
That's a great question. You guys know we are very close to Google and we
collaborate with them on a lot of things. We see Chromebook and clamshells and
Android in all of these markets kind of evolving into a lot of diﬀerent types of
devices with a lot of diﬀerent ﬂexibility and diﬀerent kind of features and capabilities.
Today, Chromebook is a very convenient way to look at documents, to look at
Google Docs, to browse the web and do a number of things. It isn't a primary
gaming platform today. And for that, I think that's why you will see most of our focusFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07
