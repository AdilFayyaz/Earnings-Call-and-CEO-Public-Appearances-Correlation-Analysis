Presentation
All right. So we're going to hear from the leader in the battery electric vehicle
market. So I'm lucky to have Martin Viecha here, Head of IR from Tesla. I also want to
point out, Tesla has been kind enough to loan out a couple of cars that will be
available for test drives with fully autonomous or with a version of that downstairs,
starting at 5:00 p.m. -- or starting at 4:00 p.m. So you can drive them around the city
and experience it ﬁrsthand. And so with that, I'll turn it to Martin.
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Yes. Absolutely, I recommend we have, I think, 2 Model 3s out
there with Navigate on Autopilot, which is basically highway and autonomy, which is
not available for all of our customers.
So I basically wanted to just walk you through our business and what we're trying to
do and where do we go from here. So the ﬁrst thing, I think, many of you would
already know, the 3 products that we currently sell are vehicles, which is the vast
majority of our gross proﬁt; storage; and generation, which is solar generation.
When you think about automotive industry in general, I think one thing you notice is
that the automotive industry, as of today, is spread across various diﬀerent
technologies. In other words, every single carmaker needs to continue to invest into
gas-powered and diesel-powered engines and, at the same time, they're investing
into fuel cell, EVs, plug-in hybrids, mild hybrids, et cetera, et cetera.
We're really focusing on one thing and one thing only and that is how do we get
electric cars to work, how do we get them to be as cheap as possible, et cetera, et
cetera.
So in order to build the Model 3, we have to build the largest battery factory in the
world, which is Gigafactory in Reno. I'm just wanting to put something intoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-08-06

Martin Viechaperspective of how signiﬁcant this factory is.
Last year, in 2018, if you look at all non-Tesla electric vehicles sold around the world,
the total number of batteries used in all non-Tesla EVs was about 46 gigawatt hours
of batteries. So that's 1.1 million non-Tesla EVs sold last year times roughly average 49
kilowatt hours average battery pack size. So that's 46 gigawatt hours global
production of electric vehicle batteries.
Our capacity as of today. So installed capacity today, is about 44 gigawatt hours,
that's 35 gigawatt hours in Gigafactory, Reno and the remaining 9 gigawatt hours for
Panasonic in Japan. So size absolutely matters when it comes to reducing the cost of
making a battery.
The other thing I wanted to point out is that if you look at EPA range of the highest
range vehicles on the market today, the range of Model S -- and I'm not sure if this
thing has a laser or not. The Model S range is the orange bar in the middle.
Upper right on that side...
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
I tried to click it. But it doesn't do anything. Anyways, it's ﬁne. The range of Model S
from seven years ago has still not been beaten by any electric car that was
introduced since. And in the same time, Model S range increased over those seven
years by about 100 miles. So from roughly 270 miles to about 370 miles as of today.
But the really fascinating thing is that the Model S, on the very left part of the chart,
has almost the same battery size as the Audi e-tron on the very right side of the
chart. So one of them has a range of 204 miles, the other one has a range of 370
miles, yet the battery pack size is roughly the same.
The diﬀerence comes in powertrain. And I think this is the most underrated
technology that during my conversations with investors that comes up is that there's
a general feeling that anyone can make a powertrain, anyone can make an electric
motor. Electric motors have been around for decades. While that is true, to make an
electric motor that is incredibly eﬃcient, has very fast acceleration, very high top
speed, cheap to make and will last for 1 million miles, to have all of those attributes
combined is actually very, very complicated.
So the most important part by far is energy eﬃciency. We all know that, for example,
MPG. So for example, Toyota Corolla has a much better MPG than Chevy Camaro.
The metric that we look at, which is an equivalent metric, is miles per kilowatt hour.
And it's very easy to calculate. Again, you take the EPA range of any electric vehicle.
So 310 miles for Model 3 divided by the battery size and you get 4.0 miles per
kilowatt hour of eﬃciency. And if you -- you can see that the diﬀerence between
Model 3 and the rest of the industry is quite substantial.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-08-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 3 of 10But that's not the only part of the story. The second part of the story is that
acceleration is actually signiﬁcantly faster as well. So better acceleration, better top
speed and the best-in-class eﬃciency.
What this chart is basically telling you is that Model 3 can have pretty much half the
battery size, half the cost compared to the e-tron and still have the same EPA range.
This is -- so if you take that into combination and you take, okay, you have battery
packs that are relatively cheap to build and you have a motor that enables you to
have a very long range, what's the result of the combination of these 2 things?
This is a trailing 12 months of the U.S. electric vehicle deliveries. And there's 2 things
that I wanted to highlight about this chart: number one, 100% of the growth is
coming from a single product, which is the Model 3; and the other thing I wanted to
highlight is that, that orange bar or the orange area at the bottom is actually gently
declining. So those are all the other EVs combined, that's the Chevy Bolt, Nissan
Leaf, Jaguar I-Pace, Audi e-tron. And so on. And the fact that we've seen absolutely
no growth in non-Tesla electric vehicle sales for the past 2.5 years, yet there's been
quite a few new entrants that came to the market is quite odd.
So what is the reason why all these new car makers are coming in with their EVs, yet
there's absolutely no impact on volumes? I would actually say that the #1 reason by a
country mile is the price of these cars.
Electric vehicles -- these are the 5 most popular electric vehicles in the U.S. I would
say that the price of electric vehicles in the U.S. is extremely high compared to their
gas-powered equivalents. So if you look on the left, you see Audi e-tron base price
$75,000. You can buy for $50,000 slightly bigger, slightly faster Audi Q7. And it's the
same story with I-Pace, same story with Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf. They're
dramatically more expensive than their gas-powered competitor.
On the other hand, if you look at the Model 3, Model 3's price -- Model 3 is the ﬁrst
electric vehicle in history that's priced on par with its gas-powered equivalents. In
other words, before subsidies, before tax incentives, before fuel savings, just your
base ticket price is on par with gas-powered equivalents. But actually, Model 3 basic
equipment is you have autopilot, you have satellite navigation, you have parking
sensors and a lot of other kit that you would have to pay for with other car brands.
So if you give customers a choice, you give them an equal choice of -- for roughly
the same price, you can get an EV or you can get a combustion engine vehicle, this is
the result.
After less than 12 months of sales, Model 3 started to outsell BMW 3 Series, Audi A4,
Lexus IS, Mercedes C-Class and Jaguar XE combined. This -- I've never seen this in
the automotive industry before, maybe in the '70s when Toyota Corolla came to the
U.S. market for the ﬁrst time and completely blitzed the competition. It's extremely
rare to see this in the industry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-08-06
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 4 of 10And it's just not one point. So since July 2018, one year later, this is what happened.
So this is the last 12 months. Again, Model 3 substantially higher number of sales
than all the main competitors combined.
So what are the reasons for this? Because a lot of people say, hey, all these other
carmakers are just going to start their EVs. Well does it mean that Mercedes C-Class,
if there's going to be an electric version, is going to sell 3 times as many units as a
regular C-Class? Probably not. There's probably something else about the vehicle
that people like that is not just the electricity.
So actually, this is like a short list of things that I think are diﬀerent about Model 3
than about other cars. And these are the reasons why people want to buy Model 3.
So ﬁrstly, you have ground-up design. If you design the vehicle from ground up to
be electric, you can extend the interior space. So I highly recommend going for a
drive later on, you can see that the interior space is quite a bit bigger than equivalent
gas engine vehicle simply because there's no gas engine so you can extend the
interior size.
Secondly, decluttered interior. I'm not sure if you remember using your iPhone for
the ﬁrst time in 2007 or 2008. It felt a bit weird compared to using a Blackberry,
right, like you were probably missing your buttons. And it was more diﬃcult to text.
But then after a few months, you just realized there is no way back. It's just so much
nicer to have this decluttered, nice and simple interface. And that's exactly what we
tried to do with the Model 3.
Then you have software updates, 4G. This is another thing that's, I think, fairly
fascinating. Apple has introduced software updates 12 years ago. We have
introduced software updates on our cars seven years ago. I'm not aware of any
carmaker that has introduced software updates to their ﬂeet even after very, very
signiﬁcant amount of time passing.
Then we have Superchargers. We learned that it's basically impossible to mass sell
electric vehicles without a charging network because people don't buy cars for 90%
of their journeys or 95% of their journeys. People buy cars for 100% of their journeys.
And as a result, you absolutely need a supercharging network to allow people long-
distance travel.
Then you have own stores. And this is an important one, not so much from
customers' perspective. But mostly from the business perspective. Dealerships,
generally speaking, do not want to sell electric vehicles. They don't want to sell
electric vehicles because the maintenance cost and the reoccurring revenue and
proﬁt generation is pretty limited for electric vehicles. That's why carmakers are not
really -- sorry, dealerships are not really incentivized to sell many EVs. That's exactly
why many other carmakers were forced to build their own dealer networks, such as
BMW i, their own dealer networks to be able to sell some EVs. And lastly, of course,
Autopilot.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-08-06

Page 5 of 10So the other thing I wanted to speak about is that many people tell me that, well, this
is unsustainable. This massive gap between us versus all of our competitors
combined doesn't make any sense. It's not sustainable. There's actually something
more behind that. Only 12% of our trade-ins -- so this is a database of all the trade-ins
we've ever received from people who are buying a Model 3. From all the people
who traded in their vehicles, only 12% were driving another midsize premium sedan,
like the C-Class Mercedes, like the BMW 3 Series, et cetera. 25% came from other
premium vehicles. So Mercedes SUV or BMW 5 Series, et cetera, et cetera, just
completely diﬀerent cars. But 63% are coming from nonpremium vehicles.
So every single year, a portion of population transfers from nonpremium to
premium. And disproportionately, from this group of people, they're choosing a
Model 3. So we're sort of grabbing that -- the people who jump from, say, Corollas or
Camrys or some of these cars to their ﬁrst entry to premium. It's disproportional to a
Model 3.
So what does it mean for our cash generation? So this is a chart of our volumes and
how our volumes have grown thanks to the Model 3. And if you overlay that with free
cash ﬂow, you can see that there's quite a bit of similarity. By free cash ﬂow, we mean
operating cash ﬂow minus CapEx.
The main debate after Q2 by far has been the gross margin. That's the topic that I've
been getting by far the most questions about. The gross margin -- the headline
number declined. So from about 20% to 19%. And we can see that if you take out the
regulatory credits, the underlying gross margin actually improved by about 200
basis points to about 17.2% in Q2.
So what's our global expansion approach? Where do we go from here? Well this is
what we are today. We're making Model 3s in Fremont, California. We will basically
build or we're currently building a simpler version of the same production line in
Shanghai, China. Then we are building a similar vehicle, SUV, SUV based on a Model
3, which is called Model Y, 78% components commonality with the Model 3. We're
going to build that in Fremont, California in a bit over a year. Then we basically can
take the same copy-paste approach with Model Y in China and then Europe.
And of course, on top of that, we're preparing some new product as well. So we
have the pickup truck unveil, hopefully, later this year. And the Semi truck and the
Roadster.
So when people ask me -- I've been working in the automotive industry all my life,
what is the main diﬀerence between Tesla and every other carmaker or every other
automotive-related company that I have ever worked with. And it's -- by far the #1
diﬀerence that I have seen is the pace of innovation. And I'll try to give you one
example.
This is the original Roadster. We stopped making the original Roadster in 2012. And
at this time, we were able to produce about 10 units a week. And it wasn't -- probablyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-08-06

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantwasn't a very good car. Five years later, we started to produce a Model 3, which is
hailed by journalists as one of the best cars ever made. We can make 5,000, 6,000 a
week consistently. And it's easily 70% cheaper to make than the original Roadster.
This was ﬁve years later.
If you also look at what's happening in Shanghai, this is Gigafactory Shanghai in
January of this year. And I remember at the time when pictures started to come
online that this is where we want to start producing cars at the end of this year, it was
like madness. Six months later, this is how it looks like.
And actually, it's not just the shell. If you look inside, it's the same story. So it's a
stamping press getting ready robots (for) body welding. So we're, hopefully, going
to start inviting investors to Shanghai early next year so people can see it for
themselves because it is a very important part of the next leg of the growth story for
our company. Thank you very much.
Questions And Answers

Sir, shelf life as in...
Usability. How long their car does work?
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Well it's a...
(inaudible)
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Got it. So it's a -- well, Model 3, the warranty is 120,000 miles, which is essentially
roughly the mileage at a -- it's roughly a scrappage mileage of each car in America.
So when car gets scrapped, on average, it would have about 120,000, 150,000 miles
on the clock. So we gave a warranty of 120,000 miles. And I think the battery is also
8-year warranty. But of course, I mean, we've had Model Ss and Xs that have run
200,000, 300,000, 400,000 miles. And they're still working.
Can you talk a little bit about storage and generation (inaudible)?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-08-06

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Absolutely. So the storage and generation, I think, I'm personally much more excited
about the storage part because the growth that we've seen there is -- has been really
strong. So last year, we deployed 1 gigawatt hour of energy storage. This year, we're
going to roughly double that number. And a fairly signiﬁcant growth should continue
in further years as well. We recently launched this new product called the Megapack.
So we used to have Powerwall, Powerpack and now we have Megapack.
Megapack is essentially just an incredibly large version of a battery pack that can be
deployed quickly all around the world as a peaker plant or if you want to attach it to
your existing factory, et cetera, et cetera. And of course, we're currently negotiating
with several diﬀerent parties, whether it's diﬀerent governments or diﬀerent states,
about installations of such Megapacks. So that's a bit I'm excited about.
(inaudible)
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
That is correct. So essentially, our cell production wasn't at the right place at that
time. And we just decided to divert all the cells into Model 3s. But now the cell
production is signiﬁcantly better. So we can start selling Powerwalls at higher
volumes now. So it used to be, if you wanted to buy Powerwall a year ago, it would
be like six months waiting time. And now it's a lot better. You can get one pretty
quickly.
You mentioned that the stores are a part of the strategy. What is going on with the
number of stores? Last year, Elon -- or some months ago, Elon said you'd close
some, then rationalize some (ﬂows in sales). What's the current situation?
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Yes, I think it's -- we haven't been opening any new stores for a while. We closed
down a few. But not that many. The main thing we're focusing on is service centers.
So we are trying to open as many service centers as we possibly can. I think we
opened like 26 service centers last quarter. We added 100 vehicles to our mobile
service ﬂeet. So service centers are, I think, we believe, the main driver.
You need to have the infrastructure. As long as people see service in their city and
bunch of supercharging stations in their city, like, that's going to make them go
online and buy the car. But store growth, we've noticed, historically, does not really
generate that much demand.
What portion of your customers have test driven the car?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-08-06

So in -- I think the last number we gave on this statistic was end of Q1. So from the -- I
would say, the past year, the number of Model 3s bought without a test drive was
more than 70%. Super high. And it's simply because, I think, people read the reviews
online. Reviews are great. Their friends take them for a drive or somebody else takes
them for a drive. And there's no other car that you can buy instead of it. There's no
other peer. So people just buy it.
Do you have data on whether they've actually driven another vehicle, et cetera?
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
No. We wouldn't have the data. No.
Because, I mean, the reason why I ask is (we would) ask that question about all other
vehicle purchases (inaudible) very small %.
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Correct. Absolutely.
So my question is, if you actually make them available, it's going to be a line of
(inaudible). If you actually make them available, your demand (would likely be) a little
bit higher, no?
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Potentially. Yes. Like, in theory, there's a lot of things we could do. At the moment, I
think we're still in a phase where there's a lot of growth opportunities in Europe, for
example. Sorry?
Your production...

But generally speaking, like in the U.S., we're outselling all of our competitors
combined. In Europe, we're not outselling a single one of our main competitors.
There's so much potential for growth in Europe. U.K., speciﬁcally, for example, I think
this is not a worry.
Maybe one more -- in fact, one more question. (inaudible)
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
I know, anniversary's tomorrow.
(inaudible) about 40% in your (growth) capital -- CapEx -- mainly the CapEx has been
declining steadily. How do you fund the growth that you talk about in the
presentation with your cost of equity and cost of debt going up in (that equity)?
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Can we -- can I go back to the presentation? So I mean, we can see that this is
actually happening. So it's not just like us presenting about us. This is a real building
that's going to start producing. The other thing that I wanted to highlight was this:
the deployment of step 2, which is the Model Y, is going to be uncomparably
cheaper than deployment of Model 3 simply because so much of the production
line can be shared between the 3 and the Y, the CapEx necessary for that is going to
be a fraction of what we needed for Model 3.
The second thing I wanted to mention is that how many carmakers now are building
new factories, building new plants all around the world? Not as many, if any. As a
result, when we go to Kuka or Fanuc or any of these other component suppliers, the
fact that very few other companies are building factories gets reﬂected.
And very lastly, our payment terms on CapEx side are better than they've ever been.
So that's about it.
Thank you.
