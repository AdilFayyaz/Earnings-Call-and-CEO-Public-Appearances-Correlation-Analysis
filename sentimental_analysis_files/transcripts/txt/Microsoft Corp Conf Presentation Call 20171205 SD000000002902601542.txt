Good morning. Good morning, everybody.
I don't know who picked the music. But my teenage son would love that if he were
here. He's -- (Phil's) got a quirky sense of humor when it comes to music.
So welcome, everybody, to our technology summit, our ﬁrst annual technology
summit. We have an industry vertical equity research conference of about this size
probably every week, every 2 weeks maybe, some place in the world. This one,
however, is more special than all of the others because of what technology means to
Wells Fargo. So in addition to having 60 or 70 of our important clients that our
research analysts publish on and 150 or 200 investors who care most about them,
we also have the technology leadership from Wells Fargo here to interact with both
sides to help people know what we're doing with technology. And it just -- it pops up
everywhere in our business. We're obviously a big ﬁnancial services ﬁrm. But we're a
technology ﬁrm. And we're in the middle of a huge technology transformation, like
most big companies, big legacy companies. We have major technology
transformation going on in our infrastructure and our security. We have major
technology transformation going on in how we deal with our customers through
digital and through mobility. And we have major technology transformation going
on in our use of data and analytics and AI because we possess reams and reams of
data about 70 million customers in our company. So everybody who's here and in
diﬀerent parts of the technology stack or the technology value chain are important
to us. And there's a rich back-and-forth in terms of how this works.
So we've got a great lineup for you today. We've got a lot of -- I mentioned that
we've got Wells Fargo leaders here. So our CTO, Scott Dillon, is here. Our CIO, Ravi
Radhakrishnan, is here. Our Chief Marketing Oﬃcer, for those of you who care about
digital, Jamie Moldafsky, is here. Our Chief Innovation Oﬃcer, Steve Ellis, is here.
And there are others as well. So there's a lot of back-and-forth that can happen.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

research analyst -- is that a verb, ﬁreside chatted -- is Amy Hood, my counterpart, the
CFO at Microsoft. So please welcome Amy Hood to the stage.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Okay. Thanks, John. (inaudible) All right. I'm glad we've got the heaters on here. It's...
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Me too. Maybe -- yes, turn it up.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Well yes, when we planned this conference, the goal was to have 2 forces of nature
come. And it was winter and Amy Hood. So I'm glad they both made it. So Amy,
thank you for taking the time. It's really -- it really means a lot to us that you agreed to
keynote at our inaugural conference. And you came out here and -- or you're
standing up here freezing with me. It's like the -- and just think I almost turned the
heat down.

Questions And Answers
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
But the -- and just to get things started, it's a shocker. But I might want to talk about
Azure and commercial cloud and Oﬃce 365, just to start with. And obviously you
guys adjusted your goal of $20 billion in ARR in commercial cloud. You said that, two
years ago when you actually hit that target early, faster than you'd anticipated -- I
guess the question, just from -- to kind of start things out here, is like how do you just
see that growth trending in the coming years? Because obviously it's been going
faster than expected.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. I think a couple of things when we set the target April or May two years ago, was
that -- I think we had certainly an understanding of what the TAM expansion
opportunity was. And we knew with a good amount of conﬁdence what Oﬃce 365's
transition would look like. You saw that when we talk to people. We were very close
on what we thought the installed base would move, where we thought the % within
the installed base that would transition to the cloud over two years. So I would say
that portion was not as unknown. I think in many ways, for us, the bigger question
was how quickly the transition on the customer side would happen. We felt pretty
conﬁdent we could execute for Azure; and be competitive; and have an interesting
story and a diﬀerentiated one, including the fact that we were committed to hybridFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Page 3 of 13Q - Philip Alan Winslow
A - Amy E. Hoodfrom the beginning in our architecture. So for us, I think it was more a pacing of the
market. And I do think things have gone pretty quickly on the customer side in terms
of -- even you heard John talk about how important it is to Wells Fargo. There's
hundreds and hundreds of those stories. And I think the pacing has probably been
the bigger surprise. And I feel very good about our execution, obviously. But it's a --
it's as much about a market opportunity as it is about our executions in the line.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. Well let's break it down into the sort of the 2 buckets of commercial cloud.
And we'll start ﬁrst with Oﬃce. And you've talked about this on the call, I guess,
almost two years ago. And I think about of just Oﬃce 365 subscription growth more
than outpacing the sort of the oﬀsetting declines on the license side. And let's think
about -- this is a question I get a lot. It's, "But what about, like, Azure?" Because there
was Oﬃce license, Oﬃce 365. Azure, there's some replacement. But there's also a lot
of net expansions. So how do you think through this in terms of sort of like the
forward growth here and where we are in that process?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes, I've always explained these as being just fundamentally diﬀerent transitions.
Oﬃce 365, even when we designed the pricing model 7 or eight years ago, when I
had a diﬀerent job as the Oﬃce CFO, this goes -- it's a very long world view in terms
of Oﬃce. Oﬃce was really about the opportunity that's a seat business. When you
sell something by the seat, the opportunity to say you're going to have a transition
from a license to a subscription is pretty clear. You have a certain number of
information workers in the world. You know which ones you meet today with a
license, you know which ones you don't. That's new seats. And you knew which ones
you transition. And that's the transitioning seats. And so we could very easily say
there were going to be 2 drivers. There was going to be installed base growth by
new seats that we weren't able to reach in a paid model before. And then there was
going to be the transition of customers which -- and both of which ultimately would
lead to having ARPU expansion possibilities. So that one, I think the transition was
quite clear. You take one seat. You move it. If it happened to be paid upfront, then
they got to pay me over 3 or four years. And the math was pretty clean in terms of
being able to predict what that looks like. The distinction with Azure is that I actually
think what you're seeing is -- for us and for others, you're seeing on-prem growth
and cloud growth as people decide how they want to run their infrastructure,
including the investments they've made over the past. That to us looks like,
particularly for SQL and even for Windows, continued license growth even through
this "transition" because it's not a transition. This is really just people continuing to
add investment to their technology bucket of spend to digitize whatever process
that is, whether it's a business process for marketing environment or sales. And you
can kind of go on down the list. For me, that's why I think we bring people back to
that singular KPI because I really am indiﬀerent, as long as it meets the customer
need for their infrastructure and platform if they buy on-prem licenses or buy Azure
stuﬀ. The one thing I cared diﬀerently about this year than, I think, in the past is we're
really focused on Azure consumption as opposed to just a billing cycle, which is an
important distinction. You always recognize revenue based on consumption. You
don't get to recognize revenue just for selling something. And so really focusing onFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 13Q - Philip Alan Winslow
A - Amy E. Hood
Q - Philip Alan Winslowthat motion with customers to make sure they're successful is a really important pivot
that we've taken.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. Actually, maybe just to double click on that for a second: Obviously, you've
made some changes to the sales force to incentivize that focus on consumption. And
you talked about on the earnings call as sort of -- it's deeper customer relationships.
You have to know your customer more. How do you think about the process of -- it's
almost like a bit of a culture change from pushing product. So to speak . Not that
sales team would ever do that. But pushing product actually focusing on
consumption. So how do you put that into the sales force, into the model?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Well I think, let me break it down. There's a couple things that we've done with the
sales force for this year. We started really in July with the largest sales force change
we've had in certainly as long as I've been at the company, which in a few weeks will
be 15 years, which is just shocking. Time ﬂies when you're having fun, I guess. And
what we did was really fundamentally change how we go to market for all customer
types. At the high end, that's meant adding a lot of resources that are technical. And
when I say technical, I mean you would probably not see the distinction between
them and someone that works in Redmond writing lines of codes that's typical. They
are fully capable of implementing and doing most project start-up costs -- costs
meaning eﬀorts. They're capable of getting projects oﬀ the ground. They're capable
of demoing all deep Azure functionalities. That type of person was not someone that
we, frankly, had at Microsoft and used in that way. We tended to use that type of
person, that type of talent in either our service business, our consulting arm or
obviously in one of our engineering teams. So that large investment is meant
fundamentally to be about consumption. And so that's how people are paid. They're
not paid on selling a contract of Azure. They're not on bookings. But they're paid as
customers are successful, meaning they get projects up and running. The meter
starts spinning on Azure. And that's when they get rewarded. And so if you think
about the life cycle of making a customer successful, you absolutely start there.
You'd invest with technical expertise to help them on their journey. You'd pick the
right projects that matter to them. You'd show ROI through hands-on eﬀort to get
projects up to speed. Then you'd see our person and them be rewarded with a
successful outcome. So that's why I'm pretty wedded to the concept that this is of
diﬀerent ways that we should be rewarding our people because it's more cleanly
aligned structurally to customer success, which is ultimately in a consumption-based
business customer success is all that matters because it builds on itself over time.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. (inaudible). Well let's focus back on Oﬃce for a second here. I'm going to
make a statement. I'm going to read a statement here. And I want you to tell me
where sort of I'm right or where I'm wrong. And so it is Oﬃce 365 might be halfway
past the point, in terms of adoption, that 50% in the installed base. But Microsoft is
still in the early stages of migration to premium SKUs, i.e. E1 to E2, to -- sorry, E3, the
E5 and maybe even E7 one day. And that's going to last through the next 5, 10 years.
So where am I right. And where am I wrong in that statement?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

You're right in that structurally you're through. What we would say is the model we
have in the seat businesses in particular, like this one, is you move a customer. Then
once active directory is deployed and they have the most recent services in general,
churn goes down, which ultimately raises eﬀective pricing. And you have SKU
transitions as people -- and as we continue to build high-value products and as
customers see the beneﬁt of that product, they move and tend to move up the SKU
tiering, not all. You'll have tons of customers that don't need the functionality.
(inaudible) tons that are ﬁnding their just right place. But the logic is correct, that
does build on itself. The reason it tends to have a longer tail is simply accounting
because we tend to sign 3-year agreements. So by the time you actually get
everybody through a 3-year cycle of the new SKU, you ﬁnally have the ASP lift fully
implemented across the spectrum. So it tends to come. And it comes slowly but
tends to have a pretty consistent trajectory.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. Then let's stick with through the Oﬃce ecosystem and talk about LinkedIn, the
acquisition, obviously a very big deal for Microsoft. How are you thinking about
folding LinkedIn into just your go-to-market strategy this year and sort of going
forward?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think you've -- number one, let me start with I'm incredibly pleased with how it's
gone. It's been a -- it will be a year next week or the week after since we closed the
transaction. And we're ahead of every ﬁnancial targets that we set for ourselves. And
so that feels good. Their employees are pleased, meaning they're happier than they
used to be. That's actually a terriﬁc thing in terms of retention of employees. So
we're thrilled with that. And we've seen a bit of a revenue reacceleration, which we
talked about last quarter in the results. When you see those things, you feel very
good about the strong starts of what is an incredibly important decision that we all
made and then what is a very important ﬁnancial investment we've made. The way
that you'll start to see it and you've already seen it -- and there are little things. And
frankly, I think that's what you'll have to get used to a little bit on this one, is you'll
start to see integration in the experiences themselves: whether it's going into Word
and seeing LinkedIn integration on resume building; whether it's Sales Navigator
integration with CRM solutions for more social selling; whether it's maybe
incremental HR eﬀorts by LinkedIn to sell more to their existing customer base. I
think you'll see it as we both have really functioning, thoughtful sales teams that I'm
really ﬁne bumping into each other a little bit, because they work actually just ﬁne
that way. And so instead of trying to jam 2 sales forces together and let them -- and
disrupt basically customer momentum, we've made an active choice to not do that.
And there's a -- there are tons of examples where we buy companies to integrate
sales forces. This is not one of them, certainly not, given the momentum in the -- and
I think really to some of the unique attributes of each. So you'll see it show up and
across Oﬃce, across Dynamics. And within LinkedIn will be the most tangible side.
But you won't probably see large big-bang moments. It's not really LinkedIn culture.
And nor did ours, as much anymore. You'll just see thoughtful integration that
customers will care about show up in products every few months.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

(inaudible). Okay, we spent a fair amount of time on the revenue side of commercial
cloud and Oﬃce. I mean one thing that jumped out at me last quarter outside of
hitting the $20 billion in ARR was the jump in commercial cloud gross margin. It's
500 bps quarter-to-quarter, 800 bps year-over-year. And one of the questions I got
is how much of that is related to, let's say, the mix between Oﬃce 365 and Azure; or
just a mix shift between, call it, the standard services and the premium -- to premium
services within there. And...
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
This is actually pretty clean, it's mostly Azure. Because while Oﬃce continued to have
gross margin improvement, in fact all the services did last quarter that are in,
whether it's Dynamics, any of the underlyings, the mix shift, which we think to Azure
because it's the highest grower, we -- so it's mix shift to Azure. And yet you're still
seeing gross margins get better. So this one is the math's pretty clean. It's Azure
gross margin improvement. Now part of that is premium services mix. But part of it
also is just the cost per -- the cost to the infrastructure improvements across the
hardware and the software work. So I feel very good about that team's eﬀort. They
were very proud last quarter, I think, for many reasons. I think it felt like, on every
earnings call, I would get asked pejoratively about their margin structure. And so
when we said kind of 6 quarters ago that we expected material gross margin
through all of last year and then did it again in Q1, I think they feel like, "Hi. when are
they going to stop asking?" And I said, "Well keep going up. I'll let you know."
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes, great. And I guess, okay. So scale is an important part, obviously, of Azure. So
when you think about just scrolling this forward here, obviously you've got premium
SKUs in 365. You've got new premium services in Azure. You have scale in Azure.
How do you think about just the gross margin of commercial cloud going forward?
What are the puts and takes really of getting continued improvement there?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
This is one where I spend a lot of time on the component because, while we talk
about commercial cloud gross margin all up, which is the cleanest way with our
revenue, which is I think I have one big cloud business and what should it look like at
scale, the actual management technique is quite diﬀerent. The teams work quite
diﬀerently. So you want to focus on where can Oﬃce 365 margins get to. Where can
Dynamics margins get to as a service. Where can LinkedIn ultimately -- at LinkedIn,
when you clean out Amwork's 82, 83, 84, I mean, it's a pretty structurally high-gross-
margin business. Then you go to look at Azure's premium services and then their
more IaaS-type layers. And we manage each toward its best-in-class goals. The
outcome will only be a matter of the mix of the revenue that ultimately exists. So
while I continue to believe we have room for it to grow, it's really more about what
the makeup of the revenue looks like. And so what you'll see going forward is Azure
will continue to grow as a piece of that, which will put some structural downward
pressure on it. But you'll see all of them probably continue to increase, which is what
you want to see from a pricing and competitiveness standpoint.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Q - Philip Alan Winslow{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
All right. Well we've spent a lot of time talking about Oﬃce and Azure. But I want to
switch gear to this other little business called Windows. And I think Microsoft might
be known for that. But one of the things that's really struck me over the past several
quarters here is, if you look at the growth of Windows revenue versus just of the PC
market, I mean, Microsoft excluded had been out-punching PC market. And I get the
similar thing. I get the question from clients, saying, "Okay, is this attached? Is this
piracy? Is this ASP mix shift towards the premium SKUs? Then is this sustainable?" So
maybe if you can walk us through what's been going on that's driven that
outperformance and how you -- we should think about it going forward.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Let me put up our Windows business into 2 things. We have funny names for it: pro
and then non-pro. Let's call that commercial and consumer eﬀectively for this
moment. Our commercial PC business, otherwise known as pro, in general has
outperformed the market by a bit. That tends to be a little bit of attach of pro doing a
little bit better. But that one doesn't vary terribly far from the market. You might --
and if it does, we usually comment that it could be some inventory-related stuﬀ. Like,
this quarter we had a bit of pre buy. The pro number was a little high a couple
points. They'll come back. People would ask, "How do you know?" Well there aren't
that many buyers of PC licenses in the world. So when you see them move a little bit
in a funny pattern, you can kind of guess you got a couple weeks of inventory at a
speciﬁc OEM. So that one, when you see it move very far from commercial PCs,
which over a long period of time, have kind of been single-digit growers. I mean,
even when -- with the exception of year -- a couple years back when we had that
"end of XP, get a new computer" moment, outside of that, it has been very steady,
steady through some of the macro changes; steady even when, the diﬀerent regions,
it's kind of low single digits. The consumer side is far more volatile. This quarter was
the ﬁrst time they've actually been more in-line. The consumer business itself tends
to have a bigger ASP diﬀerence. There are more SKUs in our consumer business
than there are on the commercial business. The commercial business, we got about
2; and they're not that diﬀerent. And so you don't tend to have a ton of ASP
movement on commercial. So on consumer is where you tend to see the big ASP
diﬀerences. So devices have been pretty healthy at the higher end of the market.
When you see that happen, it tends to mean there's higher ASPs associated. And
you'll see a big delta between what units look like and what our revenue looks like. If
-- I'll give you the opposite. If low-end units were strong, which happened a couple
years ago, the opposite will be true. You'll see the revenue be far below unit growth.
And it tends to be about pricing tiers, more than anything else, where we have a
wide diﬀerence in pricing based on the -- you can think of it based on the price of
the device. It's spec-ed by -- the devices are by spec. So if you think low-end shifts,
low-end devices, you think low price. And if you think a lot of power, you think a high
one in consumer.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. Now obviously Oﬃce 365 has been a phenomenal success. I think everybody
in this tent would agree with that. Walk us through what is the opportunity of -- well,
what is Microsoft Oﬃce 365? And what is the opportunity there?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Microsoft 365, I think, is our realization that from a customer perspective what they
want is a modern experience on a machine -- just for a second. Whatever machine
that is. And that modern experience will be deﬁned by a few characteristics. It would
-- and most importantly for many CIOs or CTOs, it would have a modern security
plan and modern management tools, like in here -- I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you
before very well. That's nice. And so you're thinking about modern security and
modern management. People tend to think about Oﬃce and Windows quite
separately, as well as EMS products actually that are built out of our cloud and
enterprise divisions. Really the experience of a modern workplace or a modern
desktop or a modern even phone experience for Oﬃce is foundationally about
capabilities that don't just come from Oﬃce 365. And so we ﬁnally said, well, why
don't we sell the thing that customers actually ask us about, which is, "Wait, what's
the most secure environment to have?" And we would say, well, that's Windows 10
and Oﬃce 365. And that combination when deployed together is more secure than
any component. And so we've started to call that thing Microsoft 365. You would
also in our and in my world refer to the devices as being modern or not. So does it
have natural language ability understanding. Does it have natural input like gesture
or gaze. Does it take 10 inputs. So think about it in the broadest sense of the word as
if you wanted a modern computing experience and wanted to interact with a device
through either your normal keyboarding touch time. But whether it's gaze, whether
it's voice or whether it's ink, it should have all those attributes, as should all the
applications that sit on a modern device. And what you'd ﬁnd historically is we have
certain apps that are optimized for ink, certain apps that have not been. If you want
to have a terriﬁc modern experience, you have to have all the apps and the OS and
the device optimized for that to have it really make a meaningful diﬀerence to you
and how you think about computing. And so when you think about Microsoft 365,
think about the broadest, most inclusive, consistent experience between application
and the OS; and that they build on each other, including the device and its specs.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. Now you made a comment there about device, sort of, whatever. You're thinking
about being in, I'd say, a ﬂashback to build, obviously the keynote being the
intelligent edge. And it was talking about containerization of micro services on the --
all devices. It can be a car. It can be a thermostat. It links back to the Azure or IoT
edge. What is the opportunity there? Because obviously we hear about IoT. We hear
about intelligent devices. Where does Microsoft play into this? And what do you sort
of bring to the table that, I'd say, maybe some of your competitors don't?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Well you'd say most of the endpoints. What people still want is a secure,
manageable endpoint, especially if it's going to collect any amount of sensing data.
Do you want to be able to update it. How secured do you want it to be. That story,
for us, is both a Windows 10 story as well as an Azure IoT story around the
connectivity of those devices back to a data source. And so I feel actually quite good
about the investments we've made. And when I think about IoT or any endpoint --
and when we say edge, think about it in the broadest term, right, whether it's a PC,
which is the right way to interpret it; whether it's a phone; whether it's a sensor; orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

reside where it needs to reside for the application to work its best. Even Azure Stack
has -- right -- even Azure Stack has another way of talking about having an edge.
And so for us, I think it's a pretty -- it's a world view, more than I think of it as any
speciﬁc product. It's that all products should make it possible for you to run and
compute and assess data and capture data and then analyze data no matter the
environment, right? You think it could be -- for gaming it may need to be close,
although latency times are getting good enough that may not need to be the case.
For Azure Stack it's a realization that -- we always cruise ships -- it was the best
visualization for people to understand it's clearly not connected. So it's a good way
to think about what's important about having compute where it needs to be.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. I got a bunch more questions. But I'm going to ask one more and then open
up to the audience. And Richard, I was hoping you could -- my associate, could grab
the mic and then, as people raise their hand, walk around through them. But one of
the questions that I've been thinking about and I've asked you over the years has
been to sort of the life cycle of just the operational eﬃciency at Microsoft. I mean I
think everybody in this room agrees that, over the past, I guess, 4-plus years now, I
guess 18 quarters, I think, as CFO -- it's going to be your 18th quarter...
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes, I know. I couldn't count. But I'm...
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. And so you've just ﬁnished 18 and going on 19.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
So let's keep the streak alive. So -- but the -- when I think that, the operational
eﬃciencies, I kind of talked about the life cycle of it being the ﬁrst part was just
focusing on just the cost structure. Where are we spending too much. Where are
some things that need to be divested. Then there is a period of allocation. We'll call
it that, less note, no (inaudible) other sort of higher-return areas. Then we've hit a
point where when that started to fade that we kind of inched back towards more, call
it, normalized investment growth. How do you think about where we are in that life
cycle and in the process of, just call it, operational eﬃciency at Microsoft?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I tend to give it slightly -- it's something like that. But I tend to think it's not as much
of a life cycle as a constant eﬀort on all fronts, which is -- the ﬁrst thing you said is
really about picking the businesses we're in. That's the ﬁrst one. Which businesses
should you be in. Why you should -- why, how. That can change, markets change,

A - Amy E. Hoodmake as much sense as it used to. We still watch for that so we'll make sure that
makes sense. But you're right, a lot of that, I would say, is are we in the right
businesses, I feel like it's behind us. The next piece, which is really continuing to
focus on being more eﬃcient in how and what we do. We've done a ton of that work
I think that was maybe easier to approach. But I would say that was one we're pretty
focused on still. We, like every company on Earth, have an opportunity to reinvent
many of our processes, do them digitally; be more eﬃcient in how we build
software, how we ship software, how we sell software or hardware. So I feel like I still
have opportunities there to run a more eﬃcient operation. But fundamentally more
than about eﬃciency, it's about the customer experience being better. I tell people
all the time I -- most of the eﬃciency work we do now is focused on making a better
customer outcome, whether it's how many commerce systems do you need as a
company so that it does recognize you when you call; how many diﬀerent customer
interfaces. You want to have it -- or how modern should your build environment be
for engineers. All of those things matter because the customer, whether it's an
internal employee or whether it's an external customer who pays us money, beneﬁts
when we do thoughtful, eﬃcient work, as opposed to saying, "Oh, I see costs to cut."
It's just not a good frame for a successful company. Then I tend to also think we've
been a bit more of an investor this year in key places. But that was true years before,
I just -- I think, if you look at intelligent cloud. And we did some search investments
there. And I feel great about how that's paying oﬀ at the top line. As long as we see
things pay oﬀ at the top line, I really don't feel constrained in terms of investing to do
that. Because if we invest operating expense, we see it land as very strong revenue
growth, including share growth, at the top. We know we've got structural gross
margin improvement coming. That's a good leverage model for us, especially in the
subscription business where the gift that keeps sort of on giving is the top line. And
that model, I feel like -- I don't feel constrained in any way as long as we continue to
execute the spend thoughtfully. We have to. The industry is aggressive. We need to
be aggressive. We've got a good world view. We're executing well. The team is
good. And when you feel all those things, the last thing you want to be is not
aggressive. So I don't feel terribly worried about it. And I think whatever hope
people have inside the company that my willingness to be aggressive on that front
will be coupled with stopping the former 2 items, they know me now well enough
that's not how I work, because that's simply not how excellent companies work. I
remind them sort of I am a deep believer in strategic patience but execution
urgency. So if you believe in those 2 things, you can both understand where you're
going, invest patiently, invest in the right things, watch them pay oﬀ. So if you're not
doing well, let's ﬁx it. That's -- that means. That's not hard. That's just fun stuﬀ, I mean,
for me.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Yes. I'm going to totally steal that line, by the way. It's like...
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Well it's a good way to think about in general. So confusing the two is super
important. If you actually have a really thoughtful strategic plan and you're executing
poorly, that can be interpreted inside the company as a bad strategy. You -- then you
change course. It's a really -- and it wastes time. It wastes cycles. And more
importantly, it wastes energy of your people. And the opposite could also be true.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

A - Amy E. HoodYou can have a bad strategy and bad execution. Then you just say, "No, no. I'm right.
Just let me ﬁx this thing." That takes too much time. You're very far away from where
you need to be positioned as a company. And they're both really, really can be
damaging. And so I spend a lot of time with teams thinking about making sure we're
distinguishing between the two. It ultimately makes you much faster and much better
positioned for customer success. So it kind of -- it's an important frame as we think
about expense growth.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Great, awesome. Well I'll take, last 10 minutes here, some question from the
audience. So raise your hand if you have one. And (Rich) will walk over with the mic.
Otherwise, I'll continue. (Alex), in the front?
Maybe if you -- Amy, if you can go into the competitive dynamics in public cloud.
Obviously, Amazon was ﬁrst, they're larger. You've come up and done a great job.
And you've got good enterprise. And on prem as well is taking advantage. Then
maybe talk about where Google may or may not be in pricing and stuﬀ like that.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, (Alex). It's -- I get asked that question a lot. Let me talk about sort of
what I've seen. I think I feel very good about how we've executed given I think where
we were a few years ago with AWS. I think structurally we've done a very good job
being aggressive on the investment. We've done a very good job ﬁnding our
diﬀerentiation through hybrid from the beginning. In fact, we're using some of our
strengths in the enterprise to focus there and try to be successful with many of the
sales investments we already had. I think this past year has been a trajectory changer
for us on that front with Amazon. That being said, trust me, if you live in Seattle, you
feel the energy of 2 successful companies being there. If you're looking for core
systems engineers, we have most of them. I mean I -- in the Seattle region. It is a
hotbed of the world view of where the public cloud is going, where private cloud is
going. I -- it's a -- it's just a fun place to be, frankly, to feel that. So take my comments
about our progress in the spirit of an incredibly successful pairing of companies
executing incredibly well; executing with, I do think, a mutual focus on customer
success; and frankly, a not terribly diﬀerent view of where the world is going. So let
me start by saying that. And you see it at most customers. I see it in most partners,
ISVs. I feel like we've even made progress in the start-up community, which we knew
would be a harder one for us. And that's been a bit of a new cycle. And I feel great.
Then let's talk about Google, who I think we've been talking about seeing them in
this market for years. But I would say we've seen more of them in the past few
quarters than we'd seen before. It's not surprising. I think they're making a good
eﬀort. I think Diane Greene is an excellent leader and an established enterprise CEO.
I know that's probably not a title in the job she has. But that is who she is. She's
always been a winner. She's always been successful. So I kind of look and say I
absolutely expect them to continue to be aggressive. I absolutely expect to see them
at customers. I do think they -- we may not see them in the same way, in any level of
the same way that we see Amazon at customer presence. It's very diﬀerent. But I
would say we certainly see them more than we used to. I would also say thoseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

A - Amy E. Hoodcomments are pretty U.S. and Europe centric. And so I think, if you were to maybe go
to the APAC region, you'd probably say -- instead of probably putting Google in that
third slot, you'd probably aggressively be asking me about Ali. It's diﬀerent world
view. I think, when we sit in this half with the world, we tend to think of the 3
companies I just named being the most successful in this region. That's certainly true.
In Europe you see a very similar frame. If you went to Africa, certainly in China,
increasingly in India and across Asia, you'd probably see Alibaba have a diﬀerent
view of moving outside of China; well funded, well capitalized, certainly aggressive,
many of the same attributes, understanding of the cloud, understanding that they'd
like to take things outside the -- of their home region. So that's the only thing I would
add competitively to the landscape on a global basis.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. All right, I think we have time for one more question before we have to get
Amy away from the -- the wind here in front.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It's not that -- it's actually -- it's the humming. So I -- it's just a hard white noise I'm
hearing. So I'm just making up whatever question you ask me.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
It's like, "I think I heard this."
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I think you said something about Oﬃce.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
So one from -- one more from the audience. Otherwise, I'll -- we do, yes.
With the topic of tax reform looming, I would be curious about the prospects of cash
repatriation, what that would mean for Microsoft. And speciﬁcally, could it change
how you think about your M&A strategy?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
It would -- let me be clear, it won't change how we think about our M&A strategy. We
-- when we see assets that make sense to us; when we feel they're fundamental to
growing our business; when we feel we're a better owner than someone else
because of where they sit, how they ﬁt, that is what will dictate whether a deal makes
sense to us. That's always been through a bit like we didn't want to wait for a tax
reform to return capital. I don't want to wait for a tax reform to buy smart assets. And
many assets won't make any more sense or any less sense in a new environment. It's
just not, I think, how we are structured to think about the world. And when it comes
to how we think about spending, I think in general, as it -- our biggest capital spend
is data centers. Data centers need to be built where they need to be built. So it's lessFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-12-05

Q - Philip Alan Winslowabout is there an incentive to build one place versus in other. Data centers need to
be built where customers or data privacy, data residency, where maybe national
boundaries need to be respected. So think of it less about, well, I'm going to spend
a lot more capital because a tax reform. It's just -- or if I had to borrow before. It's --
our borrowing cost is not a big hindrance to us as a large cap with our credit rating.
So I've never really thought of it in those regards more than anything. It's
fundamentally about strategy for us. And where our customers need us to be.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
All right, well, we're 5 minutes out from the one-on-ones and (a few tracks) starting.
So Amy, thank you for sitting up here.
