Presentation
Today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are predictions,
projections or other statements about future events based on current expectations
and assumptions. Actual results may diﬀer materially from these forward-looking
statements because of a variety of risks and uncertainties about our business, which
are discussed today or described in our ﬁlings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including our Form 10-K and 10-Q. We do not undertake any duty to
update any forward-looking statement.
Please welcome to the stage, Microsoft Chairman, John Thompson.

Good morning. Welcome. I'm John Thompson, Chairman of the Board at Microsoft.
For those of you who are here with us at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue as wellFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 2 of 28as those of you viewing online, we welcome all of you to our Annual Shareholder
Meeting. We're streaming live from our Investor Relations website. We strive to make
the meeting as inclusive as possible by oﬀering our shareholders the opportunity to
participate and vote via the virtual shareholder meeting. I'd like to share with you the
presenters of today's meeting. I will be joined by: Satya Nadella, our Chief Executive
Oﬃcer; Amy Hood, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer; Carolyn
Frantz, our Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. And Carolyn will
address the business portion of the meeting, followed by Amy, who will review
Microsoft's ﬁnancial results. And ﬁnally, Satya will reﬂect on our progress over the
past year and our opportunities that lie ahead. Following his remarks, we'll then
show you some exciting innovations happening throughout Microsoft, especially in
the areas of accessibility. And then we'll have an opportunity for Q&A. But ﬁrst, let's
attend to the few formalities that are important for this meeting.
Broadridge Financial has been appointed the inspector of elections for the meeting.
The inspectors are located at the reception table in the lobby. Most of you have
already voted your proxy or your proxy votes have already been tallied. If you're a
shareholder of record or a beneﬁcial shareholder holding a legal proxy from your
bank or broker. And you want to vote your shares now or change your votes, ballots
are available from the inspectors at the reception table in the lobby.
Filing a ballot and giving it to the inspector will revoke your earlier proxy statement.
If you're a beneﬁcial shareholder a with a voting instruction form, you also may
submit those forms and use the computers at the reception table to cast a new vote.
The polls are now open and will close in a few moments after the presentation of our
business matters here today.
As Satya said in his letter to you, we are proud of the accomplishments and the
innovation that has occurred and the customer help that we have navigated through
in this transformation. We are even more optimistic about the opportunities ahead. I
want to thank all of you for your continued investment in Microsoft as well as the
excitement that you have about the company and our stock performance over the
last year or so.
We believe these results stems from Microsoft's commitment to business strategies
that provide long-term sustainable growth for our company.
The Board works to ensure that Microsoft's continuing success and represents
shareholder interest. Together, we rely on our diversity of experience, perspectives
and skills to provide guidance and oversight to help Microsoft eﬀectively manage its
risk and realize its strategic opportunities in a dynamically transforming world.
To better understand the Board's unique skills and perspective, I encourage all of
you to view our directors video series. The series can be viewed on our corporate
governance website.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28

{BIO 20191721 <GO>}
Thank you, John. Welcome, everyone. This morning, I'll walk us through the short
formal meeting and then, as John said, you'll hear from Amy and Satya, followed by
a Q&A session. The notice of the meeting and Internet availability of the proxy
materials were mailed by Broadridge Corporation beginning October 16, 2018. And
it went to all shareholders of record as of September 26, 2018. As a result, the
meeting is being held pursuant to proper notice.
We have received proxies representing more than 87.5% of the roughly 7.7 billion
shares of the company's stock that are eligible to vote. This means we have a
quorum present. And the meeting is duly constituted and will proceed.
This morning, we have 3 management proposals for you to consider. They were all
described in the proxy statement for today's meeting.
The ﬁrst item is the election of directors. The following 14 people have been properly
nominated by the Board: William H. Gates III; Reid Hoﬀman; Hugh Johnston; Teri
List-Stoll; Satya Nadella; Charles Noski; Dr. Helmut Panke; Sandra Peterson; Penny
Pritzker; Charles Scharf; Arne Sorenson; John Stanton; John Thompson; and Padma

Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 28Amy E. HoodThe second item is an advisory vote to approve executive compensation as
disclosed in the company's proxy statement. The Board recommends a vote for this
proposal.
Last, the third item, we ask that you ratify selection of the company's independent
auditor, Deloitte & TouchÃ©, for ﬁscal year 2019. The Board recommends a vote for
that proposal.
The discussion of the matters for shareholder consideration is now closed. And the
polls are now also closed. Now I'll share with you the preliminary voting tabulation.
First, all 14 nominees on the ballot to become director are elected with over 95% of
votes cast. They'll serve until the next Annual Shareholders Meeting and until their
successors are elected and qualiﬁed.
Proposal 2. The advisory vote on executive compensation has been approved with
by more than over 95% of votes cast.
Proposal 3, ratiﬁcation of the company's auditor, Deloitte & TouchÃ©, has also been
approved by over 95% of votes cast. We expect to post the details of the ﬁnal voting
results and all these matters on our Investor Relations website later today. We'll also
report the results in a Form 8-K that will be ﬁled with the Securities and Exchange
Commission within 4 business days.
With that, we've completed the formal portion of the meeting. And the meeting is
now adjourned. Let me hand the stage over to our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Amy
Hood.
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Thanks, Carolyn. Hello, everyone. And thank you for being here today or watching
online. 2018 was a record year for Microsoft. Revenue grew over 14% to $110 billion,
operating income grew 20% and EPS grew 18% as we continued to execute well
across priorities like commercial cloud and gaming.
The year began with the most signiﬁcant sales and marketing reorganization in the
company's history. We added industry and technical expertise to partner more
deeply with our customers on their digital transformations. We also reorganized our
engineering teams to align with emerging technology trends to better serve the
needs of our customers today and long into the future.
To further enhance our capabilities and increase future growth, we completed 9
acquisitions in addition to GitHub, the largest platform for the developer community.
We acquired Avere, a leading provider of high-performance storage for cloud,
hybrid and on-premises environments, giving customers from all industries the
ﬂexibility to process and store data wherever necessary for large-scale compute
workloads.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 28In gaming, we purchased PlayFab, a complete backend platform for mobile, PC and
console game developers to build, scale and launch cloud-connected games.
And we've announced the addition of 7 new studios since the beginning of ﬁscal '18
to bolster our ﬁrst-party content and fast-growing gaming services.
As we continue to invest in M&A and our own organic growth, we retained our
commitment to capital return, which included a total cash return of $21.5 billion.
In September, we announced a 9.5% increase in our quarterly dividend and we're
continuing to execute against our current $40 billion buyback authorization.
Now let me share a few highlights from the last ﬁscal year. Our commercial cloud
business grew 56% to surpass more than $23 billion in revenue, exceeding the
ambitious goal we set, to achieve $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud
revenue by the end of ﬁscal 2018.
We saw strong growth across each of our services: Oﬃce 365 grew 41%; Azure grew
95%; and Dynamics 365 grew 65%, as customers continue to choose Microsoft's
commercial cloud.
Importantly, we delivered on our commitment to make signiﬁcant improvement in
our commercial cloud gross margin percentage, which expanded to 57%, up 7 points
year-over-year.
For the sustained eﬀort of our engineering, sales and marketing teams, we drove
gross margin improvements across each of our key services.
And in the ﬁrst full year, post-acquisition, LinkedIn revenue exceeded $5 billion. And
we surpassed our original ﬁnancial commitment to be accretive to EPS, excluding
the impact of purchase accounting.
Platform improvements across mobile, video and messaging grew record levels of
engagement. And we delivered key product integrations such as the LinkedIn Proﬁle
Card in Outlook and the Resume Assistant in Word.
Our server products and cloud services business grew to $26 billion and grew 21% as
we continue to address our customers' real-world hybrid needs.
From a technology and licensing perspective, we're truly delivering diﬀerentiated
value and giving our customers the ﬂexibility they need to transform at their own
pace.
Now let's turn to progress across our Microsoft 365 oﬀering. We continue to see
healthy commercial and consumer demand for Windows 10, increasing our base ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 28Satya Nadellaactive Windows 10 devices and contributing to growth in our search business. Our
Oﬃce business saw double-digit revenue growth, as we reached even more
commercial and consumer users by helping people across all of our customer
segments be more productive and collaborative.
Surface also saw double-digit growth from continued innovation across a broad
portfolio of devices.
Our gaming revenue exceeded $10 billion. And we've surpassed 57 million Xbox
Live monthly active users, as we invested across content, community and the cloud.
Now a few comments on our current ﬁscal year. First, as we do at the start of each
ﬁscal year, we updated our investor metrics, based in part on feedback from you. We
have now included the commercial portion of LinkedIn in all of our commercial
metrics, to give investors a more complete view of our performance. In addition, we
added a LinkedIn revenue growth metric so that investors can track our progress on
this business on a quarterly basis.
Second, we're oﬀ to a strong start in ﬁscal '19, with double-digit revenue and
operating income growth in Q1. This reﬂects our commitment to long-term strategic
investments and consistent execution to deliver top and bottom line growth.
For the full year, we expect operating margin expansion, even accounting for the
total impact of the GitHub acquisition. That includes purchase accounting,
integration and transaction-related expenses. Looking forward, we believe that the
highest shareholder value was created by investing in our future and creating
diﬀerentiated value scenarios for every organization and person to achieve more.
We have focused on the right secular trends, invested in expanding markets. And
we're conﬁdent that our ability to execute against our innovation roadmap positions
us for continued growth as we remain deeply focused on our customers' success.
With that, please join me in welcoming our Chief Executive Oﬃcer, Satya Nadella.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you, Amy. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for being here today
as well as all those watching online. And more importantly, thank you for your
commitment to Microsoft as shareholders. I'm proud of the progress we've made in
the past ﬁscal year as we innovate and help our customers with their digital
transformation journeys. And I'm even more optimistic about our tremendous
opportunity that lays ahead.
We're living in a very crucial time in history, where the impact of digital technology
on every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy
is even more acute. It's therefore incumbent on us as industry leaders to ensure that
the technology we build always creates more opportunity. Too often, we celebrateFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 28technology disruption without reﬂecting on the unintended consequences. What the
world needs is technology that beneﬁts people in society more broadly and where
trust is earned each day.
At Microsoft, we are guided by our mission to empower every person and every
organization on the planet to achieve more. Our business model is fundamentally
dependent on our customers' and partners' success. We create economic
opportunity in every community, in every country, helping drive creativity in us all,
small business productivity, large business competitiveness, public sector eﬃciency.
We support new startups. We help improve educational and healthcare outcomes.
Our culture at Microsoft, which is at the core of everything we do, enables us to
pursue this mission. Each day, we push ourselves to be more customer obsessed, be
more diverse and inclusive internally and come together as One Microsoft to serve
our customers and ultimately, make a bigger diﬀerence.
Now everywhere I go, I see this mission and culture at work. Let me share just a few
examples. Right here in the state of Washington, Karrick Johnson, an 8-year-old with
dyslexia, avoided reading in class until he started using learning tools in OneNote.
And in Kenya, a startup, M-KOPA Solar, is using our cloud to connect hundreds of
thousands of homes to the power -- solar power for the ﬁrst time. And as a
byproduct, even helping all of those households develop a credit history.
In Poland, MedApp is using HoloLens to help cardiologists visualize a patient's heart
as it beats, reducing the time it takes to perform open heart surgery.
And large multinationals from Coca-Cola, to Shell, to Volkswagen, to Walmart, are all
using Azure and Microsoft 365 to build their own digital capability so that they can
thrive in a world where every company, every business is a software company.
As Amy said, all of this broad impact is fueling strong results and yet the opportunity
ahead is unprecedented. Think of computing going forward not as being separate
from the world. But being deeply embedded in the world. Every walk of life, every
part of our economy and society is being digitized. Every place, whether it's the
home, the oﬃce, the stadium, the factory, every industry from manufacturing, to
retail, to ﬁnancial services, to healthcare and everything that we use, from appliances
to our cars, are all becoming digital. And that's the opportunity in front of us. And
now I'll brieﬂy discuss how we are creating these new experiences and enabling
digital transformation for our customers.
We're building Azure as the world's computer, innovating with new capabilities
focused on both existing workloads like security and new workloads like IoT and
Edge AI. We expanded our global data center footprint to 54 regions, more than any
other cloud provider and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the
industry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 28Azure is the only hyperscale cloud with a consistent computing stack that extends
from the data center to the edge, where there's consistency in identity, data,
application platform and security and management.
All this rich infrastructure will be used to build AI, which will be the deﬁning
technology of our time. We are leading in the ﬁeld of AI research, achieving human
parity with object recognition, speech recognition, machine reading and just this
year, with language translation. But most importantly, we are focused on
democratizing these AI breakthroughs to help organizations of all sizes gain their
own competitive advantage because of AI.
Our acquisition of GitHub recognizes the increasingly vital role of developers and
the role they'll play in value creation across our economy and in every industry.
We're excited about the opportunity to bring our tools and services to new
audiences, while enabling GitHub to grow and retain their developer-ﬁrst ethos.
We're infusing AI across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn to help people
and organizations be more productive and digitize mission critical business
processes, from sales to marketing to HR. Microsoft 365 is already a multibillion-
dollar business that empowers everyone, from large enterprises to small businesses,
to students and teachers and more than 2 billion ﬁrst-line workers. More than 155
million people use Oﬃce 365 commercial every day. Every month, Outlook Mobile is
on more than 100 million iOS and Android devices worldwide. Microsoft Teams has
become a hub for teamwork in more than 300,000 organizations of all sizes,
including 87 of the Fortune 100.
Windows 10 now has more than 700 million devices that are active. And Microsoft
365 and Surface are inspiring device innovation, as you'll see from our incredible
holiday lineup today.
With Dynamics 365, we are helping customers convert their traditional systems of
record and engagement into intelligence. And with LinkedIn, we now have more
than 575 million members. We are helping companies transform how they manage
their talent, training, sales and marketing.
And in gaming, we are pursuing an expansive opportunity, from the way the games
are created and distributed, to how they're played and viewed. And we're investing
aggressively in the content, community and cloud services across every endpoint, to
expand the usage and deepen engagement with gamers, including the 57 million
monthly Xbox Live users.
Finally, we added 7 new gaming studios to bolster the ﬁrst-party content for our fast-
growing gaming services like Game Pass subscription service as well as Mixer.
In closing though, I want to really reﬂect on the optimism I have for the opportunity
ahead. With this opportunity comes even the deep responsibility. It's why we are
focused on instilling trust in technology across everything we do. We believe privacyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 28Unidentiﬁed Speakeris a fundamental human right. That's why compliance is deeply embedded in all of
our processes and practices. We are working to ensure that our enterprise class
security innovation not only helps our largest multinational customers. But also
protects small businesses and individual consumers, who are often the most
vulnerable to cyberattacks.
And as we make advancements in AI, we are asking ourselves the tough question,
like not what computers can do. But what should they do? That's why we are
investing in tools to detect and address bias in AI systems and in advocating
thoughtful government regulation as well.
Finally, we are putting AI into the hands of changemakers across society's pressing
challenges, with initiatives like AI for Humanitarian Action, AI for Earth and AI for
Accessibility. This is the opportunity and responsibility that grounds us in our
mission. And I could not be more excited about what's to come.
Now let's welcome the team to the stage, to really show you a set of demos. And
then we'll move to the Q&A.
Thanks, Satya. This morning, we wanted to show you a few demos that help bring the
Microsoft mission to life. We thought we'd start with gaming. Today, 4 billion people
are connected to the Internet. And over 2 billion play games online. As Satya
mentioned, over the next decade, we're going to continue to create amazing
content in games, invest in the cloud and build communities that allow anyone to
participate.
We have a mix of incredible games for people of all ages. But we want to make it
easier to discover new games and play them, either on your Xbox or your PC.
Earlier this year, we introduced the Xbox Game Pass, a content service -- a content
subscription service for gaming. Just like what Spotify and Netﬂix have done for
music and video, Xbox Game Pass will allow us to reach beyond the 2 billion people
playing games today. With over 100 games available for just $10 a month, we are
truly excited to bring gaming to everyone.
But we're also building a robust cloud platform. So that anyone can play the games
they want with the people they want, at any time and place. And most importantly,
on any device. Earlier this year, we announced Project xCloud, our future streaming
gaming platform with the goal of delivering a quality experience for all gamers on all
devices. We're building a service that's consistent with the speed and high ﬁdelity
that gamers expect on their PCs and their consoles.
This morning, we want to show you an amazing example of a product born from a
need and a passion. So to help me with this, I'd like to invite on stage Solomon
Romney, who is going to tell us more about the Xbox Adaptive Controller. Solomon?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28

Solomon Romney
Unidentiﬁed SpeakerGood morning. So I'm really excited to be here on behalf of Microsoft Stores to
demo this controller. So the Xbox Adaptive Controller was designed for gamers with
limited mobility. Now limited mobility is a broad term that can mean many things.
But for me, it means I have a partial hand. Now you might think that this makes things
diﬃcult when it comes to playing games. And you would be correct, which is why we
made a controller that is more usable for more people. So would you like to play
some Forza Motorsport with me?
Yes, I sure -- sure, I would.
Great. Well I'm going to use the Adaptive Controller. And this is going to be you. So
give me just a second here.
Cool.
And we will get you set up.
Now in the meantime, I see that we have all these diﬀerent buttons, triggers and
conﬁgurations on this controller. But I only see 2 buttons on the Xbox Adaptive
Controller.
That's correct. So there are 2 big buttons built into the Adaptive Controller. But really,
what makes it the ﬁrst of its kind is, if we take a look at the back here, we've got all of
these diﬀerent ports. And every one of them is unique and matches up to the ﬁgure -
- the inputs on a standard controller. So simply, I take a peripheral, which in this case
is my little PDP One-Handed Controller here, I plug it in. And away we go. So what
I've got ﬁgured here is what I like to call my 3-ﬁnger Forza setup. I'll have gas, brake
and steering right here on my one-handed lightweight controller. So when you are
ready...
I'm ready. Let's go.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28

Page 12 of 28Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Solomon Romney
Unidentiﬁed SpeakerSo up to this point, if someone needed to build a controller around their mobility,
they had to hack apart our hardware, prototype, solder, assemble, build a whole new
device, which took a ton of time and money. And with the Xbox Adaptive Controller,
we've simpliﬁed all that by creating a hub that is easy to use, aﬀordable for all
gamers, ﬂexible to all setups and available through our Microsoft Stores.
Now you all -- even made changes to the packaging, didn't you?
Absolutely. We wanted to make sure that from the controller, to the accessories app,
to even the packaging, that it was all as accessible as it possibly could. I have one
here. And we're going to open it up. So just to show you how easy it is, this loop on
the outside here. And the box just really blossoms right open. Then I take this other
loop right here and I grab that. And that's it. There's our controller. Slides right out.
Easiest thing in the world. We really see this as the beginning of a new era in
inclusive design. And this was born out of a Hackathon project, during which we
partnered very closely with our gamers with disabilities community. There is a saying,
it has a special meeting in the disability community, "nothing about us without us,"
which for us meant including gamers with disabilities during the entire development
process. This was. And remains, a core tenet of our design process. Thank you.
Thank you. So much, Solomon. So this gives you just a glimpse into how we're
creating amazing content in games, with Xbox Game Pass, investing in the future of
gaming with Project xCloud. And designing products like the Xbox Adaptive
Controller to help build communities that allow anyone to participate.
But now I'd like to show you -- talk to you all about Microsoft 365. As Satya said, this
is already a multibillion-dollar business for Microsoft and empowers everyone, from
the largest of enterprises to small businesses. And even teachers and students
around the world. So I wanted to give you a sense for how I use Microsoft 365 every
day.
I'd like to start with the app I use most for work, Outlook Mobile on my phone. If you
have an iPhone or Android phone and you're not using Outlook Mobile, you're
missing out on the best e-mail experience available today, regardless of whether
you're using it for Hotmail, outlook.com or Microsoft 365 work account or even
Gmail.
So Outlook brings together your e-mail, calendar, contacts and ﬁles to help you get
stuﬀ done, even on the smallest of screens. As you can see here, at the top, Outlook
intelligently separates my mail into 2 tabs, focused and other. These mails on the
other tab aren't necessarily junk, they're just less important than those in my focused
inbox. Outlook is using AI to (where) what's most important to me and prioritizes theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 13 of 28e-mail based on importance. We all use e-mail diﬀerently. But for me, I spend those
precious moments I have between meetings prioritizing my e-mail. And Outlook
makes this incredibly easy. You simply swipe to take an action on a message and
Outlook will let you customize the action to match how you work. I have mine set up
so I can archive this one with a simple swipe to the left, or I can ﬂag it to follow up
later with a swipe to the right.
It's not just about getting through my e-mail eﬀectively. It's about being smart. It's
about not distracting me when I need to focus, like a meeting or when I'm away from
work.
Our Android version of Outlook has a new feature that allows you to set an amount
of time to do not disturb. Or you can have it set to automatically turn oﬀ e-mail
notiﬁcations during evenings or weekends, or even during calendar events like
meetings. Which -- like that.
Now I'd like to switch gears to Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams is a shared
workspace for my -- for all of my team conversations, ﬁles, meetings and apps. It
gives me real-time chat with anyone inside or outside of my organization. And here,
you can see the chat I have with all of my coworkers.
It's also a full calendar and online meeting experience. But where Teams really shines
is how it allows us to collaborate -- how it allows me to collaborate in this shared
Teams workspace. As you can see, I can converse with the team, share and co-edit
ﬁles or even pin apps, depending on what works best for the team. Here, I have
pinned apps so we can watch a previous demo that I've done on -- with Microsoft
Stream and with YouTube. And here, I can check social media metrics to see how our
demo did online.
Also, if I want to add another app, I have a tab here where I have a big selection of
ﬁrst; and third-party apps to choose from. For instance, I could choose Excel, I could
choose OneNote, or if I was on a development team, I could add a shared code
repository on GitHub.
Microsoft Teams brings together everything you need in one place, letting you work
from anywhere and making it easy for you and your team to connect, share ﬁles and
work with all of your business applications.
Now I'd like to introduce you to Microsoft Search. What I'm about to show you is
available for public preview for Microsoft 365 subscribers. With Microsoft Search, the
best way to get internal company information about people before you meet with
them is the same as what you're already used to doing. Just search for it on Bing. A
Bing search in every mobile browser for Chris Capossela, who is the CMO and my
boss, gives me key information about him at a glance. Because I am signed into Bing
with my Microsoft 365 credentials, I can see internal company information as well as
Bing public search results, like his LinkedIn page and his Wikipedia entry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)

org chart and even groups he's a part of. All of this from a single search in Bing and
a browser on my phone. But of course, it's also available on PC.
As you know, we're in the middle of the holiday season. And I'd love to take some
time oﬀ around Christmas to go visit my family back in Maryland. But I can never
seem to remember the URL or the name of our internal time oﬀ management tool.
So I can just search for something as simple as "vacation." And there it is, our internal
time oﬀ management tool. I could never remember the oﬃcial name, the Timer
reporting tool. And before Microsoft Search, if I didn't search for those words exactly,
I never would've found it. I could navigate to the full tool. But for now, I can just show
the basics. I can check how many vacation days I have, how many days of sick leave
and how many ﬂoating holidays. And I can do all of this without leaving the search
experience in the modern Power Apps widget.
Being able to ﬁnd corporate resources using natural language is a powerful tool to
increase employee productivity. And we're going to be bringing this capability to
many more Microsoft 365 products in the coming year.
Now I want to show you a new experience between my Windows phone -- my
Windows 10 PC and Android phone that we just released this fall, called Your Phone.
So often, I'm sitting at my PC trying to be very productive. And I get that text from my
friends or family. I pick up the phone to answer and the next thing I know, I've
already lost 10 minutes. Not only do I have to respond to that text on the phone
keyboard. But I get sucked into other notiﬁcations, social media posts and all the
other things that smartphones do to distract us.
Now with the Your Phone app, I can get my text and photos right on my PC. Let me
show you how it works. This is the Your Phone app I downloaded from a Microsoft
Store. You can see all the recent text conversations I have right here. And I can reply
to it. My Forza skills do need work. But I can reply to it on my keyboard so I can type
my message faster. I no longer get distracted by the 5 missed calls from
telemarketers that I didn't want to talk to. And I can reply and just get back to getting
work done on my PC.
Another fundamental experience on our phone is photos. We've all had that
moment where we had taken a picture (of) a phone. And we want instant access of it
on our PC. Let me show you how that works. I can paste pictures of the Xbox
Adaptive Controller for a presentation I have later for work, since I work in Xbox
marketing. So what we can do is I can just take a picture of the setup. And it shows
up in -- almost instantaneously on my phone -- on my PC. Then we can drag this
photo directly from here, right into the PowerPoint presentation I've been building. I
really love how easy this makes it for me to use my phone and PC together. Your
Phone is available on the Windows 10 and Android phone app stores today. So this
gives you a sense for how I use Microsoft 365 each and every day. But so much of
the work we do is about empowering others. So I'd like to invite on stage Jessica
Rafuse from our Accessibility Team to show us some of the amazing work we've
done to make presentations more inclusive. Jessica?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28

Jessica RafuseGood morning, everyone. My name is Jessica Rafuse. I'm a mother, an attorney, a
former administrative judge. And I'm also a person with a disability. At Microsoft, I
lead our strategic engagement with organizations that focus on people with
disabilities. Microsoft 365 can create and deliver more inclusive presentations for all
of us. But today, we're planning a birthday party.
Let's do it.
So today, I'm working on a PowerPoint slideshow for the birthday boy, my son,
Spencer. First, I'm going to insert a photo of Spencer. Automatically, PowerPoint
Designer recommends some layout options for me to choose from. The AI that
powers this feature creates an aesthetically pleasing slide in just a couple of clicks.
As someone with muscular dystrophy, like many people with disabilities, we are
masters at ﬁnding eﬃciencies. Just a few clicks saves us time, which is better for
everyone. In addition to layout, AI is also calling on computer vision to recommend
alternative text or alt text for the photos I insert.
Alt text is a description of an image that is useful for someone who is blind or low
vision, who is using screen reading technology. Our friends, Eric and Rebecca, they
live on the East Coast. So they can't make it to Spencer's party. They are blind. And
when I e-mail them the slideshow, their screen readers will read aloud the alt text. So
they can enjoy the photos as well.
In this image, you see that the alt text is recognized by AI as a young boy in a yard.
That's accurate. But I can also modify it to an adorable young boy in a yard. I know,
he's pretty cute.
Our birthday party is not complete without a timeline of Spencer's key milestones.
PowerPoint Designer can help with that too. A simple list of key moments can be
transformed into a beautiful timeline, again, very quickly.
This one looks good.
That would've taken me forever.
I know. These inclusive tips are really good for everyone. So our slideshow is almost
ready to go. But before we want to ship it, I want to make sure that the entireFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28

review tab, right near spell check, you'll ﬁnd the accessibility checker. This will not
only show me the accessibility errors, it will also give me suggestions for how to ﬁx
them.
Okay. The day of the big party has arrived. All of the grandparents, the aunts, the
uncles, they're all huddled in the living room waiting for me to deliver our slideshow.
And AI is here to help too. Presentation Translator is located in the slideshow tab. You
simply select start subtitles, choose a language, in this case, English to English. And
get started.
So a new slide pops up with the code. You can take a picture of that code. And you
can join our slideshow. Our guests who are deaf or Spencer's grandparents who are
hard of hearing, even his friend's parents, who speak a diﬀerent language, everyone
can use captions for a more inclusive experience. Go ahead and try it. It's free and
available now.
PowerPoint Designer, auto alt text, Presentation Translator, each of these features
creates a more inclusive presentation, no matter where you are. And people with
disabilities have been critical to the creation of these features. When we innovate
through the lens of disability, we build products that make the workplace and our
lives better.
So please, everyone, go out, try these features in the latest version of Microsoft 365.
And thank you for your commitment to disability inclusion and accessibility.
Thank you.
Before we go into Q&A, I want to show you one last thing. It's something we've been
working on and gives you a sense for what the future of meetings could look like,
using some technology that we like to call HoloBeam. It was developed by one of
our Microsoft partners, Valorem. They've build a shared 3D-holographic meeting
experience that we hope will make every conference call and meeting more
engaging than ever before. To show us, please welcome on stage Sohana

This morning, I'll be calling a colleague, (Daniella), a design engineer that I've been
working with to reﬁne a piece of hardware. CC is here with a camera. So you on the
audience can see the holograms that I see in my HoloLens. Okay. Let's get started.
Hi, Daniella .
Sohana, how's Bellevue? Are you at the Shareholder's Meeting?
I am. Super excited to be here. But I really want to talk about the hardware changes
that we made. Have you had the chance to look at them yet? They have the latest
casing per your design request.
I did. But it was diﬃcult to see on the 2D spec sheet.
No worries, we can look at it here. Show gateway. Can you see it okay?
Yes. This is amazing. Oh wow, I can even air it out to get an expanded view. The
changes look great, Sohana. We just saved so much time instead of going back and
forth on e-mail.
Awesome, I'm so glad. Yay. Do you have any other questions, or you?
No, everything looks great. Thank you.
Yay! Awesome. Thanks, (Daniella). I'm so glad we were able to meet here.
I'll talk to you later.
Okay. Let's take a moment to just recap what we saw. First, I was talking to a

Questions And Answers

Good morning, I'm Mike Spencer, Microsoft's Head of Investor Relations. I'll be the
moderator for today's question-and-answer session. I now invite the speakers to
come back out on stage. And I also want to welcome Brad Smith, our President and
Chief Legal Oﬃcer, for the session. I hope you enjoyed the exciting product
showcase. If you haven't already done so, after we conclude the Q&A, I encourage
you to visit with the Microsoft Store associates who are on hand in the room next
door to experience ﬁrsthand some of Microsoft's latest products and services.
They're also available to assist with any technical support questions as well. In the
aisles, you'll see microphone stands set up. If you have a question, please queue up
at the stand. There's also a representative at each mic from the Investor Relations
team that can provide any assistance. And we'll try to get to as many questions as we
can. Let's go ahead and start. First here, over here, with mic 2.

I'm John Osborn, I'm a physician. I'm representing the shares of Bartlett Naylor. I'm
here in support of Columbia River tribes and First Nations. I'm in support of those
tribes and First Nations. I don't speak for them. My question, we've heard a couple of
phrases today, a crucial time in history and deep responsibility. Microsoft beneﬁts
greatly from the cloud and cloud computing, cloud services. Part of that is made
possible by the Columbia River and cheap hydropower. While Microsoft had -- has
beneﬁted, as many others have, those who have paid the price have included tribes
and First Nations. I'm here with a request. And that is that -- and I also asked this of
Jeﬀ Bezos at the Amazon Shareholder Meeting earlier this year that leadership here
meet with the leadership of tribes and First Nations. It really is a crucial time. The

A - Satya Nadellaall of that. Climate change is underway. I think we're all aware of that. And I think this
gets to the global responsibility that Microsoft has. In the Columbia River Basin, the
forests are burning, the glaciers are melting, temperatures are rising, the salmon are
dying from the hotter temperatures. We have real needs for attention. At the same
time, the United States and Canada are negotiating the Columbia River Treaty. The
tribes and First Nations have been excluded from the negotiating table. I -- my plea
to Microsoft, as a world leader, is, to the extent that you can, to step in and help
these indigenous people to right these historic wrongs and be forward-looking in
terms of stewardship. I think that Tahlequah, the mother orca who carried her dead
calf for 16 days over a thousand miles, riveted the world on the realities of what's
taking place here on both sides of the crest. So I make that plea. I have a letter that I
will leave with the board, an economic analysis by the tribes, the Catholic bishops'
Columbia River pastoral letter and the university consortium's moral responsibility.
Thank you very much.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I mean, I -- the one thing -- ﬁrst of all, thank you for your comments and suggestions.
So one thing that we are doing across all of our data center footprint where one of
the things I described is how we have 54 regions around the world. And one thing
that we have come to realize is that in many of the regions that we operate, the
communities that are around our data centers, some of the most high-tech artifacts
of the modern world, there is a lot of inequities, there's a lot of -- lack of access to
even technology like broadband. So one of the things that we have done, even in
the last year, is really taking a bunch of initiatives like Airband to bring, for example,
rural broadband connectivity so that they can have access to health care and
education. But in the spirit of what we did there is what I think we should deﬁnitely
take a look at, what you brought up with the Columbia River and the native
communities there. And we deﬁnitely will do so.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Yes, I will just add, we have been working with some of the tribes, including in that
area. And as Satya mentioned, we've actually recently, just a few weeks ago,
announced an agreement with a broadband provider to bring broadband access to
some of these tribal lands. We're also working with them to promote stronger
educational opportunities. But we can have a conversation about this. It's a good
prod. Thank you.

Q - Jesse L. JacksonI mean, overall, the goal we have is to ensure that the computing resource, which is I
think going to become the most -- one of the most important resources for any
society, any economy to thrive, right? As I described, when every walk of life and
every part of our economy is increasingly digitized, the new digital -- or rather, the
need for more compute is going to be ever-increasing. And that's why we have built
the footprint. That also means that we have to be mindful of all of the regulations.
And complying with those regulations is a very important aspect. That's why we're
not only just building a large footprint but we also have the broadest compliance of
any cloud. So that's what we're doing. But at the same time, I think we also work
within the framework of laws across the countries in order to ensure that there is
really security and privacy in our cloud. And that's something that we ensure for any
customer, whether it's a consumer customer or an enterprise customer. I don't know,
Brad, if you wanted to add...
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
No. I think that covers it. I was going to suggest, rather than make the guest who's
come the longest distance stand the longest amount of time to get to the

others at microphone 2 as well.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 14009902 <GO>}
I want to address the shareholders today, as I did a few years ago, the human
dimension of this situation as the gap gets greater between the haves and the have-
nots, the vertical gaps. We have globalized technology in athletics. We have not
globalized human rights and workers' rights, women's and children rights and
environmental security. Thus we have this tremendous climate explosion. We have
children in cages on the borders and army lineups to shoot refugees. So we're in a
crisis that must also be addressed by this vast, vast technology. We've seen some
progress along the way. Microsoft has led the way in diversifying its Board of
Directors. In fact, three years ago, there were about 3 African Americans on the
Board of Directors in leading tech companies, now they are 20. And you are leading
the way with literally a Chairman of the Board. Microsoft was instrumental in bringing
minority ﬁnancial services ﬁrms into numerous debt oﬀerings in over three years. In
three years, the minority ﬁrms have demonstrated their talents and capabilities,
participating in over 35 tech debt deals generating over $20 million in fees. You lead
in diversity. And supplier diversity programs have broken up the new doors of
opportunity. I think, Mr. Chairman, it must be addressed more meaningfully. But
despite the new initiatives, the hundreds of millions of dollars deployed,
pronouncements should do better and improve. The tech industry is still stuck in the
mud, (it's never let 2% problem is) still alive and well. There's not a talent deﬁcit,
there's an opportunity deﬁcit. I've said before, inclusion leads to growth. Where
there's growth, everybody wins. The 100 largest cities, a majority of black and brown.
2/3 of our neighbors in this hemisphere speaks Spanish. We cannot speak to each
other in the hemisphere. And we make enemies of our allies and our natural friends.
Over 100 million blacks and Latinos live in these -- the 100 cities. They must beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 21 of 28A - Michael Spencer
A - Satya Nadellaaddressed. And we want to copartner with you in such a process. We must close
ranks as never before. How can Microsoft deepen and expand its eﬀorts to
accelerate African American and Latinos represented at the company, vertically and
horizontally? Can you transfer this minority ﬁrm representation and its debt capital
market programs to include minority ﬁrms in 401(k)s, for example. And pensions.
Now tech ﬁrms have been in the front end. But perhaps (Verizon) led to addressing
that in a very meaningful way because our (somebody-ness) must not be taken away
and also don't run the danger of becoming technologically advanced but moral
midgets. Today, we are growing at a tremendous rate in our nation. And yet, the -- I
think about this that some of our children are in jail on unfounded smoke or weed or
some joint, locked out of by education, our seniors who don't have the mobility to
get to their medicine and to their food. I'm anxious to work together in some joint
venture, some shared way to work on these seniors who are locked out. As I listen to
the tremendous work by (Jamal) today, many people I know in these senior citizens
homes, this means nothing to them, my mother who just died included. Those youth
locked away in jails, when they come out, they're still ours. What do we do with them
and those at our borders? And one thing about Microsoft, there are no borders,
there are no more foreigners in Microsoft world, many languages, one message. I'm
anxious for us to work together on how we can make these technologies real to all of
us because if fewer and fewer have more and more, more will have less and less,
those who are locked out. The (strobe) was a privilege for the few. Thank you. So very
much.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you, Reverend, ﬁrst of all, for being here as well as your comments and the
prod and the suggestions. Maybe I'll start. And then Amy and Brad and John, you
can add to it. So the -- on the ﬁrst point you made around diversity and inclusion,
which is a very core priority for us, in fact, even our compensation, for me as well as
the senior leadership team, is tied to actually making progress on this year-over-year.
And just this -- a couple of weeks ago is when we released our annual report which
shows, in a very transparent way, all of our diversity statistics. And it's good to see
the progress we are making. Whether it is ethnic and racial diversity or whether it is
gender diversity, there is progress. But we are grounded that there is a lot more
distance to cover. And every year and every day, we continue to push. Speciﬁcally,
on the African American, black and Hispanic communities, one of the new initiatives
we started was to actually go to the 50-plus institutions, which are traditional HBCUs
as well as predominantly Latino colleges and Hispanic colleges. And we are now
able to attract a much more diverse student body. In fact, for example, the intern
class that I spend a lot of time each year is more diverse than ever before. Each year,
we are more diverse. And the entering class reﬂects that. And so one of the things
that we are also working on is inclusion. Because if you get diversity in, one of the
main things that's going to keep them at Microsoft is their ability to ﬁnd that sense of
inclusion and belonging inside the Microsoft community. So we are working that
every day. That means everyone at Microsoft needs to be trained and mindful and
practice the inclusive behaviors. And so that's really what we are doing. But it's sortFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 22 of 28A - Amy E. Hood
A - Bradford L. Smithof a very important initiative and an important priority for all of us. So maybe on the
ﬁnancial inclusion pieces, do you want to talk a little on that?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
I really do appreciate your acknowledgment of our leadership in terms of supplier
and partnering with many minority-owned ﬁrms. We continue to be proud of our
progress on that front. Your push on the 401(k), I appreciate. We will review that every
year. And I think we'll continue to look at a very broad group of 401(k) oﬀerings. We
remain incredibly focused on having the best oﬀers for our employees. So that's a
good push. And we'll make sure to look into it.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
And I would just say the other 2 things, ﬁrst, on your focus on senior citizens. It is
deﬁnitely something we're focused on. When we think about what it means to
develop inclusive technology, when we think of what it means to make our products
easier for everyone to use -- you saw some of that I think demonstrated here, just in
something like PowerPoint. When we think about what it means in terms of screen
readers, changing sizes of fonts, I beneﬁt from that myself directly every day. So we
are thinking broadly. You may sometimes walk into a Microsoft retail store and ﬁnd
someone who is older as well. So we recognize the importance of that. And we have
the opportunity to work with you, Reverend. And Rainbow Push. There are
opportunities in the future. And we welcome the opportunity to do more of that.
Then I would just say on privacy, we would agree that privacy is really one of the
issues of our time. Microsoft stood up and called for a federal privacy legislation in
the United States. And that was the year 2005. And so each and every year, for 13
years, we have consistently advocated for it. And I think the year 2018 is really a
watershed year for privacy here in the United States for a few reasons. First, we're
starting to see other industry leaders step up as well. When Apple stood up, when
Salesforce stood up, those were good days for our industry and I think for the
protection of privacy in the United States. Second, perhaps the biggest watershed of
the year came in June when the state of California adopted a landmark privacy law.
And it's clear to us at this stage that we are going to see more states adopt privacy
laws in all likelihood in 2019. And the day will ﬁnally come when we will get strong
privacy protection for the country passed by Congress. And that will be a good day
for people. And in our view, it will be a good day for the industry because it will give
people the conﬁdence they need and deserve when they are using our industry's
products. And ﬁnally, I think in some ways, the most interesting data point of the
year, Microsoft was the only company, when the European privacy regulation took
eﬀect in May, to say that we would extend the privacy rights that Europeans got
under that regulation, not just to the customers and consumers of Europe but to the
customers and consumers in the United States and every country around the world.
No other major tech company has yet followed us in doing that. And the most
interesting thing I think is this, in the months since May, in a region of over 500
million people in the European Union, 2 million EU citizens have made use of their
rights with our services. In the United States, a country that's only 3/5 the population
of the EU, almost 3 million Americans have used their privacy rights. And I think that
more than anything shows that this is an issue of interest to the American public. And
we will continue to take new steps. And we are committed to continuing to be an
industry leader when it comes to the protection of people's privacy.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28

I mean, ﬁrst of all, thank you for the comment. But what you just said about LinkedIn
as a platform for skills development and, most importantly, for allowing everyone to
reach their economic opportunity is what really got us together as Microsoft and
LinkedIn. And we're very, very excited. I mean one of the things to me, a daily habit is
when I use the LinkedIn app, is you not only see the newsfeed, which gives me all of
the relevant information around all of the topics and all of what's happening in the
industries that I track and the customers that I track and the topics of interest. But
also training. One of the most -- in the last year, if you think about it, there is so many
LinkedIn learning courses, which are these micro courses whether it's on leadership
or on technical topics or commercial topics, that are right there in the newsfeed
where you can go in in snack sizes, you can just get trained. So that you are better
equipped for the jobs of the future. Because the thing that is most exciting for us in
LinkedIn is there's a real-time feedback, which is what are the jobs, what are the skills
required for the jobs, where are you today and how can we bridge that gap. And so
you are absolutely right about the opportunity ahead. And I would say we are well
on our way to create that platform to be able to sort of really go after that.
{BIO 17030769 <GO>}
I think where I was going with that is really the next generation and some of the
youngsters, maybe even in high school, where they could use a little bit more
direction, a little bit more coaching in terms of what might be out there and available
to them with a little bit of guidance that they might not be getting right now. And
that's where I see the beauty. You've already got the professional networks sewed up
with the 570 million members. It's the, what I'll term, the next generation. But thank
you very much for allowing me to ask this.

I'm (Paul). And I'm representing the shareholders of the investment (inaudible) from
Bonn, Germany. I'm happy to be here. And I have a question. I would like to know
what your vision for Skype or the communication between users in general, what role
does Microsoft want to play.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I mean it's a very, very crucial part of Microsoft 365 today. We have Skype and Skype
for Business and Teams. They're all related in the sense that it's fundamentally about
bringing people together with video. But really, what we want is a rich scaﬀolding.
And I think Teams represents that next opportunity for us where video
communications is a super important element but so is text messaging and as well
as this ability to collaborate and communicate in situ with the communications. And
so that's kind of where we're going. Skype's an important asset. It's something that
we have now improved the quality of the back end. So that people using mobile
phones predominantly are also able to be good Skype users. Desktop to SkypeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-28

A - Bradford L. Smithusage is something that we are very focused on. And recently we did, speaking
about education, something called the Skype-a-Thon, which is the ability for teachers
and students in a given classroom to be able to tap into the wisdom of teachers and
students across the planet and make connections. And so that was a fun thing where
around the world, lots and lots of schools got connected just using Skype. So Skype,
I think, is that invaluable tool that still remains very popular and something that we're
investing deeply in.

Thank you for the question. Let's go to the back there, mic 3, please.
My name is Doug Kilgore. I'm the Executive Director of the Worker Owner Council of
the Northwest. We represent building trades pension funds and North American
pension funds. Our members are large and long-term holders of Microsoft. I want to
commend the company for its ability to improve shareholder value while making
substantial gains in social responsibility. And we appreciate the willingness of the
company to address issues that we've noticed on its projects here in Washington
state. When we look at the policies though that you've adopted for manufacturing,
we see some very beneﬁcial things within those policies but no policy that covers
construction. So I guess my question is, would you be willing to examine that subject
and look into adopting responsible contractor policy that would address its
construction needs throughout the world?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Brad?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
I think we'd be happy to take a look at it. I think we'll have some good things to
learn. We'll welcome the opportunity to learn from you and others. I know we have
people -- because we do a massive amount of construction work around the world,
whether it's our data centers around the world or, obviously, a huge construction
project that's just beginning on our Redmond campus. And it will beneﬁt us to
understand where our present policies sort of fail to miss the mark. And I think we
could sit down and take a look at it. So we'd welcome that.
{BIO 1986631 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Let's go back to mic 4.
My name is (Bart). And ﬁrst I'd like to compliment the early founders of Microsoft,
how prophetic they were in building buildings 1 through 10 that it sort of looks like
Xbox.

A - Bradford L. Smith
A - Michael SpencerWell Bill was a visionary and still is.
Which gives me a segue when you're talking all about education and everything.
When the buildings 1 through 10 are going to be demolished, you have space for
new uses of that area. I was wondering if you would entertain the idea, at least it's my
idea du jour, of building a -- having a building there that will be called a renaissance
school. I don't know if you're familiar with the term renaissance school, we had it
back in New York and I think it's still there. And it talks of the grades of K through 12.
And it would be on the campus of Microsoft. The building would rise from the
rubble. And maybe the name on the building could be called the mystical building 7.
Then to continue along those lines, possibly, the senior software architect can be
persuaded to come back to campus to become the dean or the principal of that
school. And what's more important in a curriculum than a music component? Now
the music component would have a music chair or a music person-in-charge who
knows a lot about music and who better than that would be Jim Allchin, who would
come back, be a teacher or the head of the music department. Then better than all
that, he'd be able to resurrect Uncle Bill's Blues Band. So what say you to my idea du
jour, I'm just saying?
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
I think we are better served by being inspired by your idea than perhaps pursuing
every aspect of its literal implementation. But let me just say, in all seriousness, we
really do think a lot about how to serve education because -- and how to reach
people and inspire people and give them new skills and tools. And there are
companies, including some great ones in this region that have sort of adopted a
school, that have built a school. And we haven't done that. And while we could bring
a school into our campus. And we would serve well every student who went to that
one school, our real goal is to bring technology and advancements in learning to
every school in this area and around the world and, ultimately, to reach every student
through devices like -- in platforms like LinkedIn Learning and, ultimately, to serve
not just the next generation but every generation because we're all living at a time
when we need to keep learning new things. So I would say you're giving us great
inspiration. We'll leave it to Bill what he wants to do with his time and Jim, what he
wants to do with his time. But I think you can assume that we'll all work hard to sort
of put your inspiration into some form of action.
Well I was hoping that, that would be a prototype, the renaissance school on
Microsoft. And then you would spread out.

My name is Tyler Eckel. And I have done some Microsoft testing for the blind. And I --
my question is what games do you have -- what are the games -- what games do you
have for the blind?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
It's a great question. I think I'll have to sort of go back and say what is the gaming
investments we are making as well as what are the accessibility investments we are
making so that people can play games because of the accessibility work. I mean
overall, the things that we have done, whether it's the Soundscape work or Seeing
AI, have really helped us make -- break new ground when it comes to, I'll call it,
information work or just empowering mobility in a much more general sense. But it's
a great prod. And let me sort of go back and sort of talk to the team and come back
and, maybe oﬀ-line even, get back to you on the speciﬁc set of investments around
game content that is addressing people with blindness and visual impairment. Thank
you.
