{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thanks, Tim. This was an extraordinary year. COVID-19 has changed the world. The
pandemic tested us all: nations, families, companies, ourselves. 18 months later,
many are still suﬀering. We must be prepared to stop any future viruses before they
ever reach this scale again. We moved quickly to care for our families and their
families -- and our employees and their families. We closed our oﬃces, asked
employees to stay home and moved our annual raises in by six months to put some
extra money in their pockets. Our people responded by raising more than $17 million
for COVID-related causes. With our people saved and cared for, we joined the ﬁght
against the COVID. We applied our superpowers to detect and treat the disease and
to speed the path to the vaccine. We joined scientists and researchers on hundreds
of initiatives. We worked with them to apply AI and the world's most powerful
supercomputers to understand the virus, create new ways of testing, generate
potential drugs, automate hospital functions and empower doctors and nurses with
new tools for diagnostics and treatment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-03
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11While the world fought for its life against the deadly disease, America was
confronted with a long overdue reckoning with racial injustice. At last year's
shareholder meeting, we made a commitment to do more as a company to support
our black employees and to create a company full of opportunities, and a place for
them to do their lives’ work. I'm proud to announce that we've tripled Black and
African American employees in the past year. We became a much more diverse
company globally, welcoming over 2,000 Mellanox employees from Israel and the
Palestinian authority. We appointed leaders focused on recruiting, inclusion and
retention as well as creating a more inclusive developer ecosystem. We can do more
and we will.
We're also deeply committed to our role in protecting the planet. From Day 1, our
technology has been architected for energy eﬃciency. The most powerful industrial
supercomputer in the world and the most energy-eﬃcient supercomputer are
NVIDIA powered systems. In fact, we powered 25 of the top 30 greenest
supercomputers in the world. We're committed to running our own data centers with
more renewable energy, with a goal to source 65% of our global electricity use from
sources like solar by 2025. Cambridge-1, in the U.K, will be our ﬁrst supercomputer,
running on 100% renewables.
Let me talk about our business results and the work that we're doing to create the
future. We had an outstanding year. I couldn't be prouder of the NVIDIA team. Full
year revenue was a record $16.68 billion, up 53% from $10.92 billion a year earlier.
Our gaming and data center businesses each achieved record revenues this year.
GAAP earnings per diluted share were a record $6.90, up 53% from $4.52 a year
earlier. We returned $395 million during the year to shareholders through quarterly
cash dividends. These results capped decades of innovation investment in our
singular approach to computing. NVIDIA makes computers that solve problems
traditional computers can't. We pioneered accelerated computing, which
supercharges computationally intensive applications like computer graphics,
scientiﬁc computing, artiﬁcial intelligence and robotics. We do this by innovating
across the entire computing stack, from chips and systems to software and AI
applications. With Mellanox, we've become a data center scale computing company.
With Mellanox expertise and networking and security, and NVIDIA's accelerated
computing, we're creating industry-leading oﬀerings for the entire data center. Our
work spans the largest data center and cloud data centers to tiny autonomous
machines, all running on the same software architecture. Our commitment to that
architecture has earned the support of more than 2.5 million developers around the
world, more than tripling in the last four years. Computer graphics is the driving
force of our company.
We invented the programmable shading GPU 20 years ago, deﬁning modern real-
time computer graphics. With our latest technology, NVIDIA RTX, we have
reinvented computer graphics again. This new rendering approach fuses
rasterization, programmable shading with ray tracing and artiﬁcial intelligence to
make PC games look much more beautiful and realistic, almost cinematic. The
culmination of 10 years of research, RTX has reset computer graphics. Real-time ray
tracing has arrived.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-03

Page 5 of 11RTX is a home run. The RTX 30 family is our most successful GPU generation ever.
Demand for the GeForce 30 Series is incredible, driving our gaming business to
grow over 40% this year. It's just getting started. We're at the start of the biggest
upgrade cycle of our user base since we invented the GPU 2 decades ago,
upgrading PC gamers from GTX to RTX. Meanwhile, NVIDIA-powered laptops are
among the best-selling PCs and reaching new gamers and creators.
Users are constantly discovering new applications for our powerful programmable
GPUs, and cryptocurrency mining is one of them. With rising ethereum prices, there
are indications that miners are buying GPUs. We've taken action to optimize GeForce
GPUs for gamers while separately addressing mining demand with cryptocurrency
money processors or CMPs. Our new GeForce RTX graphics cards have their
ethereum mining capabilities reduced by half, which we believe will allow our
partners to get more GeForce cards into the hands of gamers at better prices.
To address industrial ethereum mining demand, we're also announce -- we also
announced a new line of NVIDIA CMPs or cryptocurrency mining processors,
optimized for mining performance and eﬃciency. Because we don't meet the
speciﬁcations required for a GeForce GPU, they don't impact the supply of GeForce
GPUs to gamers. At GTC, we announced Omniverse one of our most ambitious
projects and the embodiment of all that NVIDIA has created. Omniverse is a platform
for simulating and connecting to virtual worlds. In the world of Omniverse digital
content creators can meet virtually to develop complex 3D content in real time.
Design tools like Maya, Facebook, Epic Unreal Engine and Rhino are portals into the
shared space. The output is visualized in photorealistic RTX and streamed to any
device.
Omniverse is a powerful simulation platform, built from the ground up to obey the
laws of physics. It can simulate particles, ﬂuids, materials, springs and cables, making
it a perfect training ground for robots, designing products or creating digital twins of
buildings and factories and cities. We're going to see some amazing things from this
platform.
Our data center business had a breakout year. NVIDIA is now a data center-scale
company, optimizing 3 fundamental processors to address the new workloads of
cloud computing and AI, the CPU for general-purpose computing, the GPU for
accelerated computing and the DPU for data processing of the data center
infrastructure. NVIDIA Pioneer GPU computing, the engine of AI and HPC. Building
on Mellanox's world-class networking, we're pioneering the NVIDIA BlueField DPU,
an accelerated computing platform for the infrastructure of the data center. This will
signiﬁcantly expand our total addressable market opportunity in the coming years as
we expect every server will one day ship with a DPU in addition to a CPU and GPU.
As just weeks ago, we shared our plans for Grace, NVIDIA's ﬁrst data center CPU, an
ARM-based processor that will deliver 10x the performance of today's fastest servers
on the most complex AI and high-performance computing workloads. DPUs are an
exciting new growth opportunity for NVIDIA, and we can't wait to share our progress.
In September, we announced an agreement to acquire Arm for $40 billion. Arm isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-03

Page 6 of 11the world's most popular CPU. With NVIDIA's AI capabilities, we can enhance Arm's
oﬀerings in mobile and embedded, and build a thriving ecosystem and advanced
computing from the cloud, smartphones, PCs, self-driving cars, robotics and edge
IoT.
Together, we have the opportunity to provide greater choice in the data center
ecosystem. The approval process is proceeding, and we're conﬁdent that regulators
will see the beneﬁts of the entire ecosystem.
This year, we introduced the NVIDIA Ampere architecture. NVIDIA A100 is the ﬁrst
universal data center GPU, capable of record-breaking performance in data
analytics, scientiﬁc computing and AI. The A100 is the engine of the most -- of the
amazing NVIDIA DGX AI computer. The new 5 petaﬂops DGX A100 is the most
powerful computer we've ever made. Powered by 8 A100 GPUs, it replaces
hundreds of CPU-only servers. Top universities and leaders across the large
industries -- the largest industries have advanced their AI research, thanks to DGX.
NVIDIA A100 is the most successful data center GPU we've ever built. On the fastest
ramp, A100 is now available from cloud services and computer makers all over the
world. Internet companies were the ﬁrst adopters of AI, applying state-of-the-art AI
to enhance their cloud services. We're now on the cusp of the next wave of
adoption, AI automation at industrial enterprises. The opportunity to automate is
endless.
From automatic retail checkout, autonomous forklifts, pick-and-place robots, grocery
and food delivery vehicles, hospital rooms that monitor and respond to patients, AI
assistance for radiologists, automated customer service centers, the speed of light,
fraud detection for ﬁnancial services. Until now, without deep learning AI, no
computer software was able to handle the diverse and seemingly inﬁnite conditions
in the real world. Enterprises need a fully optimized and turnkey platform for AI
purpose-built GPU servers with AI purpose-built GPU servers, system software and AI
tools to help them develop the AIs and deploy and orchestrate the services.
M&A [ph] AI enterprise software and NVIDIA-Certiﬁed Systems are launched at GTC,
and now going to the world's enterprises through our network of IT partners,
including VMware, IBM, Red Hat, Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo, Fujitsu, ATOS, among
others. Through our network of partners, we will bring state-of-the-art AI to 300,000-
plus enterprises in the world's largest industries: health care, transportation, ﬁnancial
services, retail, logistics to manufacturing and agriculture.
One of the most profound impact of AI is in transportation. AI is revolutionizing
autonomous machines, such as self-driving cars or robots. The computation required
is enormous. The software is complex and safety and security are vital. For robotics,
our platform is NVIDIA Isaac. For self-driving cars, we have NVIDIA Drive. Drive is an
end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles. It brings together our powerful AV
chips and computers, sensor architecture, data processing, mapping, software
development, simulation, point orchestration and road testing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-03

The car industry is going to become one of the world's largest technology industries.
This year, we announced that Mercedes has chosen NVIDIA to build the world's most
advanced cars. Starting in 2024, the entire Mercedes-Benz ﬂeet will be powered by
NVIDIA DRIVE. DRIVE has won $8 billion of revenue pipeline through FY '27 in
transportation, including auto brands, trucking companies, next-generation electric
vehicles and robotaxis. This has been a truly transformative year. For NVIDIA, we
were fortunate that it was a year of new inventions, excellent business performance
and successful acquisition and accelerating growth. From just 3 of us in Curtis'
townhouse, NVIDIA is now 20,000 families in more than 25 countries around the
world.
Through that great expansion of our business and despite the hardships we faced --
we all faced this year, NVIDIA has stood up to the principles we've shared since our
founding. We do hard and impactful work that creates a better future. As we look
ahead to our future fundamentally reshaped by this year, NVIDIA's role in
computing, science and industry has never been more important. I want to thank all
in the NVIDIA family for doing impactful work, caring for others and turning these
challenging times into one of our ﬁnest hours. Simona?

Thanks, Jensen. We'll now move to Q&A. I will read out each question or comment.
Where we received multiple questions asking about the same or similar topics, we
have grown those questions together to avoid repetition. Our ﬁrst question is, How
will you deal with a chip shortage while simultaneously ensuring that you can take
full advantage of the crypto and gaming boom?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Thank you. Our GPs are programmable, fast and ﬂexible. They can be used for a
variety of applications, including cryptocurrency mining. We have deployed a
strategy to help steer our GeForce GPUs to gamers while creating a separate
product called CMP, for crypto mining processors, to address the demand from
miners. These cards were made available just the past quarter. Simultaneously we
have limited the crypto mining hash rate on new GeForce GPUs, which means they
are less eﬀective for mining. We believe these eﬀorts will provide a greater amount
of GeForce GPUs available to gamers and still serve miners with a speciﬁc CMP
product.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-06-03

Thank you. what are NVIDIA's plans to increase the number of women on their board
and in senior management positions? Recognizing signiﬁcant experiences required
to serve as a director, what is the plan to gradually bring in younger persons to serve
as NVIDIA directors?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Diversity is vital across the company, in our boardroom, in our management and in
our leadership. Each of our directors have been nominated because of their
competencies, professional experience and background and ability to contribute
diverse viewpoints and perspectives to our discussions. That includes diversity of
gender, racial background, ethnic background and age. We have 3 exceptional
women on our Board. Dawn Hudson joined in 2013. Persis Drell joined in 2015, and
Aarti Shah joined this past November.
We also have 3 Board members who identify as ethnically or racially diverse. Aarti
and I both identify as Asian, and John Dabiri identiﬁes as black. Regarding age
diversity, 3 of our directors are in their 40s and 50s, including Aarti and John, who
joined last year. We continually refresh our Board so there is a blend of new
perspectives and ideas, along with experience and institutional knowledge. Beyond
the board, 2 of our 5 executive oﬃcers are women: Colette, our EVP and Chief
Financial Oﬃcer; Debora Shoquist, our EVP of Operations. We have amazing women
leaders throughout our company.
Still, we have more work to do. We're launching a women leadership development
program to invest in our future women leaders and provide the key experiences to

Thank you. Does the Board or management have a view when GeForce NOW will
move to mass service?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
I'm glad you asked. GeForce NOW came out of beta in September 2020 and has
great momentum. 10 million registered users -- 10 million registered members and
nearly 1,000 games from over 300 publishers, more than any other cloud services --
cloud gaming service. We're in 70 countries from 25 data centers. Members and
onboarded games both continue to scale rapidly. We feel very good about our
competitive position.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. Next question, What is the long-term plan if other chip makers decide to
pursue NVIDIA's primary market? What is the number one reason you can beat the
competition?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
The chip industry always have been rich with excellent companies. NVIDIA
specializes in accelerated computing, an approach we pioneered in which we have
dedicated our entire company to perfect. We apply our architecture to tackle the
greatest challenges that can make a great impact like computer graphics, scientiﬁc
computing like weather simulation, genomics and molecular biology, AI and
robotics. NVIDIA is a company that makes the most complex chips, but NVIDIA is
really a computing platform company.

Thank you. Next question. With NVIDIA chips being in such high demand, has the
company considered diversifying into its own foundries and fabrication plans?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
From a supply standpoint, we employ dual foundry strategy, which has helped the
market environment such as the current one. We believe this approach has superior
economics compared to alternatives, such as operating on foundry.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. What are the actions taken by NVIDIA to improve sustainability and work
against climate change eﬀects?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
The hallmark of NVIDIA's accelerated computing is energy eﬃciency. One indicator
is that NVIDIA powers 25 of the world's top 30 green supercomputers. Another is
how a single NVIDIA DGX system replaces hundreds of CPU servers when running
AI. Within our operations, we set sustainability goals. Our latest is committed to
source 65% of our global electricity use from renewable sources like solar by 2025.
We have solar installed in our Santa Clara's headquarter buildings, and we plan to
bring more online in the next 8 months. The architecture of our new buildings
maximizes natural light while minimizing the need to cool with AC. Last year, we
sourced 100% renewable energy for 17 oﬃces and data centers. We're also making
great strides in our product packaging. 80% of our packaging is made from recycled
materials, and we aim to increase this, this year. To continue our progress, we're
working on understanding the carbon footprint of all stages of our product life cycle
and how we can take full responsibility for it.
