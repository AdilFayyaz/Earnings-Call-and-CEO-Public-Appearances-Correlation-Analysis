Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's 2020 Investment Community Meeting.
Thank you all for being here, and thanks to those joining us on the webcast. We
appreciate your interest in Walmart. I know the executive team looks forward to
sharing the strategies with you, and answering your questions.
Now let me get a few of our usual statements out of the way. The information
presented in today's meeting should be viewed in conjunction with our press
release, and earnings materials that can be found on our website stock.walmart.com.
The presentations will also be posted on our website as they are completed.
Today's presentations include forward-looking statements that are subject to future
events and uncertainties which could cause actual results to diﬀer materially from
these statements. Please reference our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP
reconciliations on our website stock.walmart.com. Hopefully, you've had a chance to
review our earnings materials issued this morning, which we'll discuss in more detail
during today's presentation.
You can see today's agenda on the screens besides me. We'll kick things oﬀ in a
minute with Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO. Then you'll hear from our
CFO, Brett Biggs, and at that point we will have a 30-minute Q&A session to discuss
Q4 results and guidance. Following that we will have a brief break and then continue
with the rest of our program. After the segment presentations, we'll be doing
something new this year. We will have an innovation panel discussion to highlight
some of the many innovations across the business. We will then wrap up with an
hour Q&A session, and at the end of that session our formal meeting will conclude.
We invite you to join us upstairs for lunch, where you'll have an opportunity to spend
time with our executive team. With that let's get things started.

Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 91Good morning, thanks for coming. You're going to hear about our future plans from
several of our leaders today. Let's begin by talking about Q4. I'll give you a summary,
and then Brett will come up and share more detail about the quarter of the year and
our guidance going forward. We feel pretty good about the year, even though the
fourth quarter was not our best. Our momentum in Food and consumables within
Walmart US is continued, that's been our priority and it's good to have that strength
to build on.
Our volume in stores as well as through pickup and delivery remains strong. And it
was good to see our US e-commerce growth of 35% for the quarter and 37% for the
year. Our sales miss to plan in the US was in our stores and related to a few general
merchandise categories. Sales in November and January where what we expected,
but the weeks just before Christmas fell short.
We performed well in Electronics, Christmas seasonal, the Home categories and
health and wellness, but were short of plan in toys, media and gaming and apparel.
The sales miss to plan and less favorable mix of sales impacted operating income,
and a change to our attendance policy contributed to wages being higher than they
would have otherwise been. So a few things came together that aﬀected our results.
We know what happened, and we're already taking steps to address them. You'll
hear more details from John and Marc in a bit, but those steps include adjusting our
apparel assortment and presentation in stores. We were too opening price point
dominant this year, and we had too much of an investment in Christmas seasonal
apparel. Also we'll adjust some of the toy decisions we made which John will say
more about. And we changed our approach to layaway which missed sales plan by
quite a bit this year.
In addition to adjustments to our plan for stores, it's obviously important to
accelerate progress in eCommerce, given the ongoing channel shift. We'll continue
to build our e-commerce assortment by adding items and brands in key general
merchandise categories will improve our ability to ship eCommerce orders during
peak and make sure that customers know we can do it. We exited the quarter in
good shape in terms of the amount and content of our inventory. January sales were
on plan and February sales have started oﬀ well too.
Sam's Clubs fourth quarter sales were a little better than plan with Membership and
eCommerce performing well. Walmex, India and China were highlights in Q4.
Walmex is a real gem and we are really proud of that team. With respect to India, we
remain excited about the opportunity we have there. The way Flipkart and PhonePe
are scaling is impressive.
In China, we drove improved momentum in the back half of the year as Sam's Clubs
and eCommerce experienced strong results. We're managing the issues related to
the Coronavirus daily. Our primary focus is of course on our associates and our
customers. Judith and Brett will share more about our thoughts and actions, a little
bit later.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Great to be with you here in New York city and thanks
for everybody just joining us on the webcast. As always there a lot of exciting things
going on Walmart. This is my 20th year with the company, and I've seen it evolve and
I've seen it adapt, and I've seen it grow in remarkable ways. And even as I start my
ﬁfth year in this role, I'm still amazed at the number of things we've accomplished
over the past few years.
Walmart remains nimble. We're focused on building the world's greatest
omnichannel platform, and we continue to position this business for long-term
success. There are several things, I hope you'll take away from this morning. We
achieved most of our full year ﬁnancial goals, and while we didn't hit on all cylinders
for some of the fourth quarter, we had a good year.
Our ability to operate with lower costs provides competitive advantages and ensures
we continue to gain market share. We're leveraging expenses at levels not seen in a
while, and a sustainable. Our investments are paying oﬀ, and you can see this in
reduced associate turnover, store innovation, high eCommerce growth rates, strong
private brand growth, and I can name anymore. The productivity loop is alive and
well.
So in recent years we widened price gaps. We've increased sales. We've leveraged
expenses, and we've grown operating proﬁt in Walmart US at Sam's Club, Walmex
and other markets. We're leveraging our scale, our unique assets and ﬁnancial
strength to ensure structural competitive advantages. Our company's foundation is
extremely strong.
So, let's discuss the fourth quarter. As Doug mentioned, sales were good through
Cyber Monday as well as in January, and February has started oﬀ well, but the few
weeks leading up the Christmas weren't strong. Doug mentioned a few reasons, but
we believe also the compressed holiday season impacted stores more than e-
commerce. Adjusted EPS was within our guidance, but operating income was lower
than planned due to sales misses in a few GM categories and soft sales in a couple
of key international markets. We still leveraged expenses by 25 basis points, but we
could have been sharper in some places.
We also invested more heavily in technology during the quarter, which we expect to
continue this year. The technologies we've talked about is a key part of our strategy,
and will continue to accelerate progress on back-end activities on associate tools
and key customer facing initiatives. And I have great conﬁdence in our technology
teams to invest aggressively, but also intelligently.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.38, however, adjusted EPS would have been
about $0.05 higher except for two items. First, as mentioned when we gaveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 91guidance at the end of Q3, the unrest in Chile had an estimated negative impact on
operating income of about $110 million. We weren't able to quantify this, when we
gave guidance at the end of Q3. So nothing was included.
We experienced signiﬁcant disruptions in nearly three quarters of the stores at one
point, with some of them completely destroyed. And now, given the extent of the
disruption we don't expect the business to fully recover this year, which has been
considered in our guidance today.
In addition, we also recorded an unexpected legal accrual in the US of
approximately $75 million. As Doug mentioned earlier, we understand the factors
that impact the results for a few weeks in the quarter, and we're addressing them.
The core business that remains very, very healthy, and in particular the food and
consumables business around the world is strong. And in fact in Q4, Walmart US
grocery comps on a two-year stacked basis were among the best in the past 10
years, and we continue to take market share according to Nielsen.
So let's turn to sales for the quarter and the full year and you'll be glad, I'm not going
to go through all the various numbers live. So please reference the press release and
the presentation this morning. And I'll give you some highlights here. Total net sales
in constant currency increased to over $140 billion for the quarter, and reached $524
billion for the year, which is growth of nearly $14 billion. Walmart US comp sales
excluding fuel grew 1.9% in the quarter with roughly balanced contributions from
comp transactions and ticket.
As a reminder, these results include a 50 basis point headwind from lapping last
year's SNAP beneﬁt adjusted for the 53rd week this year. On a two-year stacked
basis comp sales increased 6% putting two year stacks at 6% or more for six of the
last seven quarters. For the year Walmart US achieved a 2.8% comp and a 6.4%
comp on a 2-year stacked basis. So, Walmart US sales grew by more than $9 billion
in FY '20, eCommerce sales were also strong, up 35% for the quarter. Grocery
remained strong, but we also had sales, good sales and several online GM
categories. For the year growth was 37%, which is slightly higher than we had
guided.
International sales increased 2.2% for the quarter with strength in Mexico and China
and India, and it was oﬀset by the unrest in Chile and some continuing challenges in
the UK and Canada. For the year, international sales increased to solid 2.8% in
constant currency. At Sam's Club solid comp sales continued this quarter, increasing
3.8% excluding fuel and tobacco, now eCommerce sales grew 33% on top of 24%
last year, in Q4 last year.
So let's turn now to operating income and EPS. For the quarter adjusted operating
income declined by 3.7% on a constant currency basis. For the year adjusted
operating income decreased by 1.9%, but excluding Flipkart adjusted operating
income would have increased for the year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 91Consolidated gross proﬁt margin declined 40 basis points for the year and that
primarily reﬂects a merchandise, channel mix shifts, price investments in various
markets, including in the US are things we've been talking about this year, and also
the inclusion of a full year Flipkart versus a partial year, the previous year.
The Walmart US gross margin rate was only down 14 points for the year, and even
with lower than anticipated sales we leveraged expenses of the company by 25 basis
points, excluding adjusted items in the quarter and 24 basis points for the year.
Walmart US operating income declined 3.8% in the quarter, but stores, US stores
operating income growth would have been slightly positive, if not for the legal
expense I mentioned earlier.
Now the eCommerce gross margin rate increased, and they leveraged expenses
however as e-commerce grows, it changes the mix of expense and margin rates for
the segment. For the year Walmart US increased operating income by 2.6%.
International adjusted operating income increased slightly for the quarter and
constant currency, but excluding the unrest in Chile adjusted operating income
would have grown by nearly 10%.
The International team delivered really solid expense leverage on an adjusted basis
in the fourth quarter. The dilution from Flipkart was as expected. Perfect[ph], I had a
great visit to Flipkart and to PhonePe a few weeks ago, and I always come back
impressed with the energy, the management depth, the ﬁnancial discipline and
entrepreneurial spirit that I see here -- see there and Judith will talk more about that
later on.
In Sam's Club solid membership trims contributed to an operating income growth of
8% for the year, so solid performance there. Now FY '20 adjusted EPS excludes a few
larger items that are noted in our release this morning. Adjusted EPS was up[ph],
slightly versus last year, which is within our guidance.
We ﬁnished the year in good inventory position with Walmart US and total company
roughly ﬂat year-on-year. Operating cash ﬂow for the year, continue to be strong
over $25 billion, and the company returned $11.8 billion to shareholders through
dividends and share repurchase. The operating cash ﬂow was down about $2 billion
year-on-year about half of that diﬀerence is due to the Asda pension contribution
that we made during the year. So here's the scorecard for the year compared to our
guidance to start the year. Now despite not ﬁnishing a strongly as we would have
liked from a sales standpoint, at the end of the year, I'm really pleased with what we
accomplished for the full year.
Now over the past several years, we've made great progress as we transforming to
win with customers and with shareholders and we've made strategic choices, and
the payback on those decisions is becoming more evident. And we're glad that
investors have been rewarded over the past several years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 91You can see how the company has evolved by looking at the composition of sales
and CapEx versus just a few years ago, we used to open 100 of stores each year in
the US, but we struggled to gain traction on comp sales. Today we're opening very
few new stores in the US, and we're driving more eﬃcient growth with solid Walmart
US and Sam's comps.
We used to have a global eCommerce business with just over $8 billion in sales. This
year we estimate global eCommerce sales will approach $50 billion, and that's
doubling just over two years. Now, while some of that come from acquisitions, we're
changing the nature of how we interact with customers. $50 billion in revenue would
put this well within the Fortune 100, even just on its own.
Just a few years ago we had no stores, no US stores with online grocery pickup and
we didn't deliver groceries. Now we have about 3200 stores with pickup and 1600
stores with delivery. We've added a great deal of new technology such (inaudible)
Sam's Scan & Go, Automated self scanning robots and a whole host of tools that
help customers and associates. So a lot has changed in a short period of time, while
we've been delivering solid ﬁnancial results.
This is such an exceptionally strong company and I don't want that to get lost. There
just aren't many companies in the world like Walmart. Total revenue approaching
$525 billion, an incredibly strong balance sheet with a AA credit rating, a diversiﬁed
asset base, physical digital assets and the most important markets around the world.
More than 265 million customer transactions a week, a 2.2 million strong associate
base and a strong stable cash ﬂow. And this ﬁnancial strength gives us the ability to
win now, and in the future. Most companies have to decide between protecting its
core business, or growing new businesses. But we can do both. We continue to be
guided by consistent ﬁnancial framework, which you've seen, and if we execute in
these areas we're going to win with customers and with investors.
In the year ahead we'll continued to focus on the most productive growth
opportunities. We'll prioritize comp sales and eCommerce growth. Walmart US has
had more than 5 consecutive years of positive comp sales and transactions. In
addition, eCommerce growth continues to be strong and we expect that to continue.
We expect total sales growth on a constant currency basis to be around 3% that
represents over $16 billion in growth. We expect the momentum to continue this year
with Walmart US segment comps of at least 2.5% and that growth fairly consistent
across quarters with each quarter expected to be at least 2%. Now, this growth
would imply two-year stacks well over 5%. We expect US eCommerce sales to be
growth to be around 30% with quarterly growth ranging from the mid-'20s to the
mid-'30s, and as you can see here, we expect eCommerce sales to represent more
than half of our total global sales growth.
In International, we expect to see solid sales growth around 4%, with strength in
Mexico and India, and will have some continued softness we believe in the UK and
Canada. Our China business also continues to operate well, and in particular, Sam'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 91Club. Now, certainly, the Coronavirus tempers our expectations some and I'll discuss
that more shortly. We expect Sam's Club to continue to have good sales momentum
with comp sales excluding fuel and tobacco of at least 3%.
One of the areas I'm most proud of is the team's work around operating discipline
and expense leverage, and last year we challenged the team with an enterprise-level
goal of 20 basis points of leverage and we exceeded that, excluding adjusted items.
The Walmart US stores team has leveraged expenses for 12 consecutive quarters.
The investments in training and technology are helping sales and they're helping
eﬃciency, and I'm very passionate about getting our expense rate down even further
in a smart and sustainable way. If this business achieves SG&A levels of 20%, or
hopefully, even lower we will continue to have options other competitors don't, and
as you can see, we are bending the curve on expenses.
Over the past couple of years, we've implemented smart spend initiatives across
most of the organization and you can take a lot of small projects. You can scale them
across the business and they can lead to impressive savings. We have hundreds of
opportunities underway and in the pipeline, but let me give you a few examples.
One example of combining a new technology with a new process is a type of store
automation called the FAST Unloader, some of you have seen it. Two years ago, we
didn't have any of this. Today we have them in more than 1,700 stores. If you haven't
seen it before the FAST Unloader automatically scans and sorts items coming up a
truck and it takes about a third of the time out of the truck unload. It makes the job
easier, requires less time, it automatically prioritizes product to ﬁll gaps in the ﬂoor.
Now since inception, these FAST Unloaders have prioritized more than 25 million
cases of merchandise that would have other otherwise results now to stocks. So you
can tell, when we ﬁnd technology and process that makes us better, we are moving
quickly to scale it.
We can also improve the business and the environment at the same time we're
investing in new technology that gives us enhanced visibility to the energy usage of
store equipment, so think Internet of Things. By centralizing the monitoring and the
maintenance of equipment, we expect to save around $100 million annually over
time, improve the customer experience and help the environment. So this kind of
initiative really demonstrates our save money live better purpose.
We're also seeing cost savings in goods not for resale or GNFR, we were doing okay
in this area before, but we weren't leveraging our scale as much as we should have.
For instance, just by changing our buying process and better utilizing our scale for
shopping bag, we anticipate saving more than $60 million annually.
Another example is, we're going to save 15% on the cost of associates vest. They're
made with recyclable material, which is more comfortable and it's more sustainable.
In Mexico, we're increasing the use of e-auctions in areas like transportation and
supplies, and last year we saved about 15% on a spend of nearly $300 million.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 91So these are just a few of many examples of how we're doing business diﬀerently
than we've done in the past and small changes can have a really big impact in this
company. We've made good progress on expenses and we expect to achieve
around 20 basis points of SG&A leverage again this year and over the next few
years, assuming consistent levels of comp sales.
As I mentioned earlier, the nature of our CapEx spend has changed dramatically
over the past several years. This year we'll continue to invest the vast majority of
capital in store remodels, eCommerce, technology and supply chain, to ensure we
give customers the convenience shopping experience that they expect.
We'll also invest more this year in technology to upgrade legacy systems and lean
into customer-facing, technology and technology of the future. However, quite a bit
of this spend will have OpEx versus CapEx. For the year, we expect CapEx to be
similar to last year at around $11 billion with slightly more going towards the US
versus last year.
I'm really proud that over the past 10 years we've returned close to $130 billion to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact over the past 10
years, we've bought back roughly 30% of the outstanding shares at average prices
well below the current stock price, this has been a good investment.
That's in addition to investing nearly $120 billion in CapEx over the past decade to
grow the business and the ability to do all of this makes Walmart a truly unique story.
With our announcement this morning, we've increased our dividend for 47
consecutive years and we also remain committed to our share repurchase program.
We have approximately $5.7 billion remaining on our buyback program and we
intend to complete that this year.
So here's how all this comes together and you can ﬁnd a complete listing of
guidance metrics in this morning's press release, you probably already seen. I've
mentioned, our sales and capital guidance focus it's little more proper guidance.
Now as always, we have several assumptions in our guidance, including general
consistency and economic conditions, currency rates and tax in the regulatory
landscape. The consumer environment is pretty healthy in the US and our
competitive position is strong. We are also performing well in a number of key
international markets like Mexico, China and India, while the UK and Canada remain
challenging in some respects. Based on currency rates today, FX would have limited
impacts on sales and operating income for the full year, but some slight negative
impacts earlier in the year. Of course rates can change. So we encourage you to
update your models as we go through the year.
Also, we have not included any potential future changes in the value of our
investment in jd.com. We're going, -- we're continuing to monitor the ongoing tariﬀ
discussions, and we'll continue to actively manage pricing and margins with
customers and shareholders in mind. We're also monitoring conditions in Chile and
our guidance assumes a relatively stable environment there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 91We're also continuing to monitor the Coronavirus situation. Our ﬁrst priority as you
heard Doug say is ensuring the safety and well-being of our associates and our
customers and we're taking actions in that regard. Currently, we do anticipate some
ﬁnancial impact of the China business in Q1, and potentially into Q2. Due to the
current sales mix landed heavily toward food and consumables, as well as some
increased expenses related to the outbreak we could see a couple of cents negative
impact in Q1.
We also continue to monitor how this might impact our sourcing operations. As of
now we aren't seeing major impacts, but if there are any longer term shipping issues,
it would likely impact our business. Because the situation is still so ﬂuid, we haven't
included any speciﬁc impacts related to the Coronavirus in our guidance, which I'm
going to discuss next.
We expect FY '21 EPS to be in a range of $5 to $5.15 which implies a growth rate
about 1.5% to 4.5% versus this past year's adjusted EPS. And this growth is expected
despite the increased tax spend, which I mentioned previously. We expect operating
income dollars to increase by similar growth rate as EPS and we expect Walmart US
operating income to increase by an amount of the upper end of that range. We also
anticipate Flipkart's dilution to be relatively consist with FY '20s adjusted results.
Now, with regards to Walmart US eCommerce proﬁtability, we expect losses this year
to be ﬂat to slightly lower versus last year. We've seen improvement in contribution
margins as well as variable fulﬁllment costs, and we expect that to continue this year.
We'll also beneﬁt some from the recent reorganization and consolidation activities.
Now to consolidated basis, we expect the quarterly cadence of EPS growth to be in
the low single-digits in Q1 and Q3, and in our near mid single digits in Q2 and Q4.
That is cadence is primarily due to the impact mainly due to the impacts of Chile
unrest, comping expense timing in the US segment last year and the timing of
increased tech spending, which actually accelerated in this past quarter.
As a reminder, fairly small shifts in the timing of expenses and other factors can
change this quarterly cadence. And again, to be clear, none of the guidance I just
mentioned includes any potential Coronavirus impacts, including the couple of cents
potential impact from the China business that I mentioned earlier. N Now typically
EPS growth is higher than operating income growth due to share repurchase. In FY
'21, we expect the growth rates to be similar, what you've seen due to lapping some
tax rate beneﬁts from last year, leading to a slightly higher eﬀective tax rate this year
as well as increased costs related to the Asda pension plan, which hits below
operating income. We don't currently expect these headwinds to continue past this
year.
So as I close, I hope you have a sense of why we're so excited about the future. Our
core business is really strong, and we're performing well. We are rock solid
ﬁnancially. We're leveraging our scale. We're leveraging our unique assets and
paybacks from recent investments are helping fund future innovations. ExpenseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

And with that I'm going to ask, Doug, to come back and we thought we would go
ahead and just take some questions on guidance and year and Dan, you want to
start us out?
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Yes. So we are going to have, as I mentioned earlier a separate Q&A session at the
end of today's program. So this Q&A session is really designed for Q4, and
guidance. We'll stick hopefully to that, and get through the next 30 minutes, if we
have that many questions, if not we'll continue the program sooner. We have our
mics. Karen right up here.

Oh, there is Karen (inaudible) in front row.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Hi, Karen Short, Barclays. Thanks for this. So just want to talk a little bit about
eCommerce growth. I think there is a view that or there has been a view that the
growth rate needs to slow much more meaningfully because you've been much
more reliant on the grocery aspect, and that you're lapping the growth in terms of
units and also the overall growth rate for click and collect.
So can you talk a little bit about the growth rate in -- if you could parse out a little bit
the grocery component and the discretionary component of the eCom growth?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, sure. I'll start and Brett you can add in, if you want to. I think we've got room to
run on both. If you look at the grocery side of things, the ﬁrst thing that goes through
my mind is product quality and what we're doing in the supply chain to make sure
the stores look great. Not only is that product, what we put in front of customers
every day in the stores, but it's what we pick and it's what we deliver. And our pickup
business as we've lapped anniversaried stores that we've rolled out has continued to
show strong comps and we have the opportunity to add more stores and then we're
layering delivery on top of that. And while we're up 1,600 stores with delivery, we still
got a run rate to go there to add stores and we've got comp numbers that we can
drive just on delivery from store to store.
So there is so many dimensions that we can build on to grow there and the stores
increasingly can start to pick general merchandise. So you will start to see a basketFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Bob Drbulthat it looks like it's broader than just food and consumables. Big GM assortment in
stores, a lot of items that are of tremendous value to customers and layer that on. At
the same time, we've got the walmart.com opportunity and with the action that Mark
and the team took earlier this year to expand the number of next day items that we
have, we've got that growth opportunity that number SKU count wise will continue to
go up and you'll hear more in a little bit about what we're doing with marketplace
and fulﬁlled by as a service. So there is a breadth of opportunities to drive growth
there and we think the number that we guided towards today is a number that we
can deliver and there'll be a combination of both.

Hi. Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. In ﬁscal '20 you return to proﬁtable growth. At
the beginning of the year, you did it with a little better sales and margin, and then we
ended a little soft. Going forward, we have next day food seems to be outpacing the
mix of other categories. How do you maintain this balance going forward and given
that the stake seem to be rising, was there any debate whether to lean back into
investments?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Well, we'll continue and we'll talk about this in a little bit as well. We'll continue some
level of price investments staying on the oﬀense and driving the productivity loop is
our mindset around those things. I'm not forgetting the fact that we make money in
food and consumables, and that with the mix of fresh there is proﬁtability there and
we're starting to do some membership sales, which are interesting. But there is a
particular focus in the company, especially after the fourth quarter on general
merchandise. As we walk our stores, we think we've got room to improve in several
diﬀerent general merchandise departments, as well as just adding brands and SKUs
like we've been doing so feverishly on walmart.com. So we've got to execute the GM
side of the box in addition to the food side, but we're very focused on it.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
And Simeon, as I went through the presentation this morning. The thing that so great
about this business. We have so many diﬀerent pieces of the business and so many
diﬀerent levers to pull that as we make these decisions, it just gives us a chance to
prioritize in a way that is always in line with the customer and still get proﬁtability
where we needed to be over a longer period of time.

Thanks, Dan. Peter Benedict of Baird. Just back to the online grocery discussion. Can
you give us a little more detail maybe how many more stores, you think you'll be
able to add this year? And this is the last year of roll-out from that initiative? And
then, Doug, you mentioned that you are seeing strong growth, I mean the comps in
this business as you get in years 2 and 3. Can you maybe frame it, as a, how strong, a
strong, is it double-digits? Just how it seems to be scaling at its point?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, I don't think we quantiﬁed the number on comps for grocery pickup and
delivery, but they are really strong and now we're to the point, Peter, where we can
see some stores that are in their second and third years. So that's also really
encouraging to see. I mean, a little bit we'll talk about the expansion of store
numbers with the speciﬁc numbers for pickup and delivery, but it's a combination of
adding some stores and driving that comp growth and then putting everything
together with the membership fee that's on our mind.
{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Hi, Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about
apparel, how much of the gross margin pressure during the quarter was due to
some of the weakness in that category? And how we should think about apparels
contribution to both comp and gross margin 2021?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, it was, as we mentioned earlier, one of the areas where we fell short and what
we think happen is we get really focused maybe even more so on opening price
points inside the stores and also very focused on Christmas seasonal apparel. We
looked like red and green, and could have been more basic and could have had
some kind of middle price points as suppose to opening price points and so we're
focused on that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Doug McMillonThere is a ton of work on SKU count, presentation that's been underway for a while
now, and we're optimistic that we'll be able to improve the in-store assortment of
apparel and in parallel, grow our apparel business online. We have a really big
opportunity to sell a lot more apparel online, and we're adding brands. We've had
some success this last year with some of the brands that we've launched including
Scoop, but there's a lot of upside for apparel online as well we need them both. It's a
really important category not only from the customer experience, but from a margin
mix point of view.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. And Kate, I mentioned about contribution margin increasing in eCommerce,
some of that is because of increased apparel sales, and we're doing better in
apparel online. We should say for just walmart.com apparel is growing faster than
the total. Apparel and home are both performing well. We just need even more from
them.

Hi, Greg.
{BIO 1507344 <GO>}
Hi, Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Brett, just to make sure I got the numbers right.
Given the EBITDA growth in the US. Should we assume that gross margin rate is
down 15 bps, 25 bps. That would be the corollary?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, I think the way we've guided, you can see that we expect operating margins to
be fairly ﬂat with what we've had here, and so when you look at the expense
leverage of around 20, that's a pretty good algorithm.
{BIO 1507344 <GO>}
And where is that gross margin pressure, if you were to put it and see price
investment or eCommerce investment or mix like, what's your shrink or where is that
coming from? And then Doug, I had a follow-up?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, it's a little bit of both. So we'll continue to invest in price globally. We've made,
John again, I'll talk about this more in the US. We've invested quite a bit in food and
consumables, you'll see a little more price investment coming in general
merchandise over time. And then globally, we're making price investments. Well, I
think we're, I like how we're doing. I think we're smart about it. We're strategic about
it. So, I feel good about the pace of price investments, but there is a mix shift as
eCommerce becomes bigger, you do see some mix shift if you saw some in the

Got it. And then, Doug, I think it was ﬁve years ago we had an Analyst Day here
where you talked about the imperative of invest in margin to get traﬃc growing
again and clearly that's worked. Right. So where traﬃcs consistently positive et
cetera. As we take away from today where do you think will be 3, 4, 5 years from
now? Is this the trend we should we should learn to expect that hopefully EBIT
margin stay ﬂattish and the goal is keep driving traﬃc up one or two. How do you
think about that balance as you think about the business out a few years?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I think growing traﬃc in that range would be a good accomplishment. But I'd
like to see more than that, especially when you think about it in an omnichannel
fashion and the combination of choices that we make we'll manage from quarter to
quarter and year-to-year, we can make investments at store level and price to help
drive the productivity loop. We can make investments in eCommerce to help drive
eCommerce and as we see eCommerce losses improve, it gives us some room to
make choices to do things like this year. The choice that we're making to accelerate
our modernization of technology, which we'll talk more about in a moment.
So the team works together in a really ﬂuid way to set these priorities to make sure
we're balancing all these things, including driving traﬃc growth, but overall, I would
expect that we can transform the company while maintaining a level of proﬁtability
that is in the range of what we're talking about for this year, but we only set guidance
one year at a time.

Sure, it's Mike Baker from Nomura. Hi, how are you? One bigger picture question,
then a couple of quick hit ones if I could. But, so it seems like eCommerce was a little
bit better in the fourth quarter. Stores, not quite as good. Is that a function of the
shorter selling period you think? Or is there something bigger, going on to think
about into next year? And then I'll just run oﬀ the quick ones, if I could real quick.
How much is Chile going to cost you next year in the guidance? Layaway what
happened there?
And then ﬁnally, I'll give this excuse to you even though you don't use it. Did the
weather hurt your apparel at all in the fourth quarter?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
This reminds me of Dan Binder's old questions that were (inaudible).
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
You may go ﬁrst.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Let me start with Chile. So what we've assumed for Chile is clearly had a big impact
to the business last year, and certainly our associates and our customers have gone
through a lot in that market. We're assuming in our guidance that the market remains
relatively stable. We don't expect the business to come back in full because of the
unrest and the damage that we had, but we assume basically how we came out of
the year is how we're going to go into next year.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
So yeah, eCommerce was ahead of plan and stores were behind plan, and some
combination of 6 fewer days, channel shift to eCommerce maybe even that weather,
where do you mentioned all those things factored into what happen and we wish we
could tell you precisely how it weighted out. I don't think we're going to be able to
tell you exactly what happened. But we do know that we've got room to improve in
terms of store merchandising and assortment, not to say that there aren't a lot of
strengths there. I mean we've called out the speciﬁc categories, I can't remember a
year where there wasn't a hot toy, the hottest toy this year was under 5 bucks many
brands these miniature mayonnaise jars and ketchup bottles I still don't completely
understand, but it didn't really drive a lot of volume.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Daniel BinderThere is not really another hot item. That's unusual. The calendars every few years
this happens, and I didn't feel very good the last time this happened and I'm getting
old enough to remember several articles now. So I'm not sure how to weight all that
out for you, but we do know we've got to keep getting better at eCommerce and we
got to run great stores and that's where our focus is on tactically.

We go to Michael Lasser, and then Oliver after that.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Michael Lasser from UBS. Thank you for having this day and we should get together
for all your earnings releases, we appreciate it. Formulating guidance for this year is
probably particularly tricky of an election, Coronavirus all these uncertainties. And
you just came oﬀ a period where sales didn't necessarily meet your expectations.
So how did you factor all of that in as you were coming up with your Walmart US
sales plan for the year? And as part of that did you assume that you can have to
invest more in price in order to drive the traﬃc recognizing that you already said that
more of the price investments will go to general merchandise versus consumables
this year?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. So we put a lot of thought into it. As you can imagine, and it's really the result of
a lot of work that goes on with this team over here and how we think about trade oﬀs
around the company. When you look at, we talked about sales through Cyber
Monday were good, sales in January were good. We started oﬀ the year well. The
food business around the world continues to be strong.
Traﬃc was up nearly 1% in the US. So the underlying part of the business is in good
shape, and I think that gave us conﬁdence to give what I think is really healthy
guidance for next year. There's a lot of pieces to the guidance, there are lot of things
that go into that and where the year-end up every pace[ph] work exactly like we
think it will, we know it won't, but within all those moving pieces, we felt good about
the guidance that we're giving.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Low unemployment, relatively low fuel prices really no inﬂation in the business and
which is interesting. The comps that we're driving unit result in a lot of tonnage. And
so that's great. I think there is room to make the price investments that we need to
make across the box, not just in general merchandise and the plan to drive this kind
of comp. But we assume that the customers going to be somewhat in the same place
that they're in right now.

On longer-term eCommerce proﬁtability and main drivers that you think about mix
and shipping as well as the consumer pressures around shipping speed and the
need for speed. Second question is on robotics and automation. You've been really
a pioneer in this space and rethinking the store, what are some of the priorities in
terms of automation? And how your balance CapEx both labor savings as well as
labor savings opportunities?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We'll wrap up this morning talking about technology and give you some examples
of things that we're thinking about as it relates to automation. But we do have an
opportunity inside the box grocery picking on the side of the box, as well as back in
our distribution centers to add even more types of software and hardware to make
ourselves more productive and I'm excited about that.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
On the e-Commerce losses, we're giving this year. But we're encouraged as I said, by
what we're seeing in variable fulﬁllment costs, we're encouraged by what we're
seeing in contribution margin as we see the mix change a little bit in that business.
We're going to continue to invest in eCommerce, and again it's up to us as a
management team to make sure all the pieces ﬁt together in a way that makes sense
for investors.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Does pieces include ﬁrst party, third-party services that support marketplace sellers
the way we manage stores and some of the other areas that were mentioned today?
We're thinking about the whole system. Do we think that eCommerce losses will
subside in time incrementally as we drive CP improvement and learn how to run a
eCommerce business better, yes. But it'll be a mix of things that will drive the
proﬁtability of the company.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}

Scott Mushkin at R5 Capital. So I wanted to poke a little bit more at the US grocery
business in particular, it looks like store sales -- well, I'll just say this. It looks like
almost all the growth is being driven by omnichannel which put some pressure on
your business. So how do you resist the temptation to what prices creep up a little
bit, maybe take some store speciﬁc labor out things that got you guys in trouble, a
little bit before, kind of the reset ﬁve years when Doug you took over.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We just won't let it happen. I mean we've lived through what that looks like, and
we're in the stores all the time and paying attention to what hours and structure look
like. I think that we would say that over the last year or so, our focus on grocery
shifted the store managers focus and others focus to really executing in stock and
grocery pick and deliver on the food and consumable side, and it may have
contributed some to apparel presentation and general merchandise.
So in this business, you got to run the whole box, and we're focused on that and
thinking about our staﬃng that way as we head in the next year. As we build new
products, I think this is kind of embedded in your question, Scott, launch grocery
delivery, charge a membership for it, and do other things. We've got to keep an eye
on a pure store P&L and make sure that it's not inappropriately subsidizing new
businesses. And we do think about that and keep an eye on it as we manage all
these variables. Hope that answers your question. Yeah, it -- follow up.
{BIO 7138867 <GO>}
Yeah, just quickly. You guys were really committed to certain price gaps in the
consumables business, which have been strong and we've seen continued
investment on that side of the business. Is that's still to be expected or not?

business in the back half of the year if there our backlogs? And I guess Brett, just on
the $0.02 of a potential (inaudible) ﬁrst quarter I guess just to clarify that's not in your

margin front?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Brett Biggs{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Let me start there, once you start--
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Let's start with store operations. I mean when Judith and her team wake up
and maybe you are getting some sleep they are thinking ﬁrst and foremost about
what's happening with our associates? What do they need? Are the stores being run
well? Are we taking care of customers to the extent that we can?And we do currently
have a majority of our stores with reduced hours. Looking back over the last few
weeks there have been a few times when we've closed the store for a little while, but
we like to keep stores open customers need us. We do it with hurricanes in the US,
we're doing in this situation in China. There is collaboration going on with the
appropriate government oﬃcials to make sure that we're doing all the things that
they would expect us to do. And our team on the ground is doing a great job
managing that.
The mix shift happens. So if you could imagine yourself in that situation you're
focused on fresh food, you focused on the staples that you need to have in your
apartment, your home all the time. You're not thinking about toys or apparel. So
that's occurred. And then another dimension that's change is delivery has gone up
even higher as you would guess. And so this relationship that we've got with Dada
for the last mile delivery or last few steps delivery from the store up to the apartment
those kinds of things that's enabled us to pick from our stores into delivery and fuel
some of that growth, but it will create a mix change to the P&L, and we don't know
what's going to happen next. One of the reasons why we couldn't put in our
guidance is because there are so many moving parts right now including sourcing
coming out of China, not only into the US but into other markets as well.
It's important for everybody to remember in the US, we do about two-thirds of our
volume with goods made in the United States, that other third comes from a
combination of countries especially China, Canada, Mexico, a little bit from India,
Southeast Asia. So how long will those shipments to be delayed? What can we do to
buy goods that are already in the US or made in the US to supplement some of that,
so we don't feel as much of it. All of that work is happening which makes it really
diﬃcult to call how it's going to play out the quarter. We're not even through the ﬁrst
month yet. So that's why we've made the decision we made.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We have try to make guidance as simple as we could, and so we got in discussions
about do we include this, do we not include that, and so where we had a little more
visibility was on the store side. Sales, I'm pleased that we can keep stores open to
the extent that we have, and be able to serve those citizens, those customers. Sales
have been okay in the market and this really is so far a mix issue. And it's an expense
issue as we look at just how to deal with associates, and wages and other things
we've got to make sure that we're taking care of people, and so it's led to increasedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

guidance we felt was cleaner. We'll go to Chris.
{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Thanks, good morning. Chris Horvers, JP Morgan. First, -- and sort of a year question
then the longer-term question. So, ﬁrst on the year, you talked about mid-20s to mid
'30s on the eCommerce growth rate around 2.5 or -- 2.5 or more pretty consistent
over the year. What drives the variability around the eCommerce growth rate over
the quarters? And then, I have a follow-up on Gen Merch.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah, sometimes -- anytime we have variability for -- in eCommerce or anything, we
have, it can be something that happen this year more times than not where we had --
it can be weather, it can be a week or two that were better than some, and so we are
just curious, there is little bit of timing diﬀerence, and it doesn't take much of a
change to move something from 25% to 30%. So, we want to give you as much
guidance as we can along that, but it just doesn't take much impact to make a
change. So, it's not as a variable as it seems when you just look at it, mid '20s to mid
'30s.
{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
And then does the sort of overall US comp therefore sort of follow that same ﬂow.
How do we think about the overall eCommerce growth rate, cadence wise?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It would be some, but eCommerce is still a fairly small part of that total segment
comp number.
{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Okay. And then just longer term as you think about new Head of US, new Head of
Merchandising, the push to grow general merchandise, remember meeting with you,
Doug one time we talked about, hey, how can we grow gross margin rate, when we
put general merchandise on sale, and we invest on price. How long does it take to
turn to Gen Merch business to something more signiﬁcant? Do you expect the gross
margin beneﬁt to sort of Ex-4Q[ph] comparison[ph] to increase throughout the year
or is that more of a 2021 opportunity?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, I think it's more incremental and we wouldn't put it on sale, we have roll it back
for at least 90 days, like it wouldn't be too temporary. We will be -- I think the way
we're coming across is probably being too dismissive of the strength of the General
Merchandise business in the stores. We have a lot of great merchandise and ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Scot Ciccarelliteams do a great job across the board and hard lines in some departments in
particular. So there is a strength there to build on. Do I think that GM needs to grow
faster than the total in stores and online? Yes. Do I think we've got room to make that
happen in terms of the product we select and how we present it, in store and online?
I do.
So I would just expect over time, these things to get stronger as the team gets really
focused on apparel and home and some hard lines categories and I think the
opportunity both in-stores and online is clear and an exciting, but it won't be a one
quarter switch and -- it's not that easy. If it was that easy, we would have already done
it.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
We'll go next to Kelly.
{BIO 16685675 <GO>}
Kelly Bania, BMO Capital. Brett, I think you said US EBIT at the higher end of your
range. So I think almost mid single-digit. Can you just help us think about how
eCommerce losses do impact that for the year? And maybe just how the FC's versus
groceries and the roll-out of delivery impact that? And if you can or maybe if you will
today, just over the next couple of years, really think about just a candid discussion
of how we should think about that?
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Yeah, there is a lot of things in that US segment P&L. It's a really big business. And so
as you look, one of the things is really important and underlies a lot of how we get
that proﬁt growth is what we've done on expenses. The business has been very
disciplined. How about, how they think about expenses, but doing in a way
sustainable, and doing in a way that helps customers and helps associates. So that's
diﬀerent than how we would have managed expenses, I think in the past.
Price goes into that certainly from a gross margin perspective. Transportation goes
into that. Having eCommerce losses that are ﬂat to potentially a little bit lower helps
as we think about proﬁtability growth in the US business, but it's really the
combination of a lot of diﬀerent things inside that business that allows us to grow
proﬁt at those levels. But you got 2.5% comp in Walmart US on that scale, the
amount of leverage you can get from that business is pretty amazing.
I think we have two questions over here. And then I'm going to probably wrap it up.

I don't know that we've quantiﬁed it, but we changed our attendance policy and tied
it to our incentive plans and people really showed up to work. And we of course
anticipated that we would see that, but not to the extent that it happened.

I guess the bigger question has to do with kind of like -- today's employment

Yeah, I think those are two separate conversations, and a little while we'll talk about
all the things we're doing with associates to attract and retain talent. So let's cover it

{BIO 18288790 <GO>}
Craig Johnson, Customer Growth Partners. Could you speak -- I'd like to drill down
on the traﬃc issue a little bit. And you showed 265 million customers assuming the
transaction --. Question is do you understand your customers well enough to know
whether you're getting same raw traﬃc, lower conversion, whether you're getting
few more or less trip frequency of existing customers? And if you're losing share of
trip missions do you know whether you're losing it to the all these in Costco and
Trader Joe's of the world?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Good question. We have a lot of data and have good visibility into where
people are shopping. What's happening with us and you know, I would say and I'll
say it again in a few minutes and the fact that customers that shop us both in-stores
and online are so much more connected to our brand spending 2X and spending
more in-store is a thing that we're really focused on. So we have a lot of data and we
can gather even more data, but I think I know what's going to tell us at the end. If
you win their most frequently purchased items you get the opportunity to serve
impulse items online and in-store and our focus is in driving that sweet spot.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Thank you. Appreciate it.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Thank you. Well as the video remains us we're driving a lot of change across this
business and I'm as excited as they've ever been about this company. The
combination of our unique strengths and assets, the new ways we can serve
customers and the capabilities we're building cause me to feel that way. From our
frontline associates to our store managers, tech team and leadership, we have the
mindset and culture to adapt. Innovation is happening across the company. We're
pleased to see our people solving problems in new ways and with increasing speed.
In addition into our strategy to serve customers. I'll share some thoughts on how
we're creating opportunities for our associates, our thoughts on technology and the
opportunity and responsibility we have to serve multiple stakeholders that Walmart
serves, shapes or inﬂuences. I'll start today by focusing on the US given how
important it is, but you'll see that these strategic themes have implications for our
markets outside the US. Our list of advantages starts with our supercenters. We have
a strong assortment of the best-selling items priced at tremendous values. We're
strengthening our fresh food oﬀer and delivering strong pricing and in-stock across
all of our food and consumables categories.
We have a large and growing pharmacy optical and OTC business. We're strong in
seasonal hardlines. Our home business is performing well but we have room to
improve with apparel. We prefer to sell brands for less, but we're also improving our
private brands and they're growing faster than our overall sales, 18 of them do more
than a $1 billion in sales and our largest private brand Great Value does more than
$27 billion a year globally.
Just as with merchandising, we have foundational strengths and room to improve in
store operations. Our team is focused on our people, our processes and our
technology to improve the customer experience and increase productivity. We've
improved associate education through our academies and we're seeing retention
increase because our associates are better equipped and more conﬁdent to do their
jobs.
We're empowering them with apps on their mobile devices that help streamline
their work and put information at their ﬁngertips. We're putting automation in place
to help us improve side counter modular accuracy and in-stock. We're testing new
technologies that will change our front ends work and how our distribution centersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

we'll keep making them better.
We'll keep improving our pickup experience and we'll build on that capability to
further scale delivery for customers who want it delivery will extend all the way into
their kitchen or garage as we learn how to keep them in stock on the items they buy
all the time. The customer retention rate of our in-home pilot in Kansas City.
Pittsburgh and Vero Beach is encouraging and the membership is $19.95 a month.
Our EDLP assortment with its strong opening price and private brand components
underpins a strong customer proposition and when it's purchased as part of a big
basket, which helps with pick and delivery economics, it's compelling for customers
whether it's purchased in store, picked up or delivered.
No one else has that assortment so close to so many customers and having
proﬁtable stores that function as pick centers is an advantage. The capital is already
placed and well positioned. There is a Walmart within 10 miles of 90% of Americans,
within 5 miles of 70% of Americans and fully half the US population is within just 3
miles of a Walmart. That's a unique position and we're taking advantage of it. We
didn't have a grocery pickup business a few years ago and now it's huge. We started
providing same-day delivery for our customers two years ago and now it's available
for more than 1,600 stores, covering more than 50% of the US population. We've
been learning to sell memberships for grocery delivery and that looks promising.
We've even built our own delivery platform for independent contractors to
complement other delivery providers, it's called Spark, it is now available in 31 states
and doing more than 30,000 deliveries a week. Over time, and as volumes grow,
we'll learn how to pick and deliver locally with more automation. As you know, we've
already started with our test of AlphaBot and self-driving vehicles.
As we're making the most of our stores, we're strengthening walmart.com. While our
customer scores reﬂect the progress we've made on assortment delivery, we're far
from satisﬁed. It's not only important because customers want access to a broad
assortment delivered accurately and quickly, but we need the margin proﬁtability of
a large eCommerce general merchandise business and that includes a well run
marketplace supported by fulﬁllment services.
Our interests are aligned with our customers and marketplace sellers. The losses
we're experiencing today are necessary to build a business model that can compete
and avoid being out mixed. Our data shows that a customer who shops in both
stores and through our app or website spends twice as much as a customer who
shops in stores only and they spend more in stores. It's obvious to us that people
want to shop a brand in a seamless omnichannel way that has little to no friction. So
we'll keep adding assortment and new brands online. We'll keep growing to
leverage our ﬁxed costs and look for ways to intelligently speed up the process. Our
assortment acquisitions such as Shoes.com, Art.com and Hayneedle which came
along with Jet for the home categories have added category volume and expertise
to the company as they've improved customer choice. Jet has enabled us to attract
new brands. As we described when we bought it, it's positioned as urban, youngerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Page 27 of 91and more aﬄuent than Walmart. We haven't invested in it because the traction we're
gaining with walmart.com and the eﬃciency of the investment in the Walmart brand
versus Jet.com because we made that pivot combined it with strong eCommerce
grocery -- grocery growth in the US and other markets and made the investment in
Flipkart, we now have a global eCommerce business that should achieve nearly $50
billion in sales in the year we've just begun. We've invested a lot to do it, but we're
now in a position to play oﬀense to win an omnichannel game. Our opportunity is to
weave all this together in a way that grows sales more proﬁtably. We've got a strong
set of chess pieces to work with.
Last year, I showed you this image of our portfolio. We're turning it into a set of
mutually reinforcing businesses that create a stronger ﬂywheel. We see the
opportunity to build a next-gen Walmart productivity loop that serves the customer
more holistically. The biggest customer funnel end of the ﬂywheel will be through
those items they buy all the time. But regardless of how they initiate their interaction
with our brand, we'll make it easier to experience all of Walmart. As they do, it will
enable us to continue growing advertising and ﬁnancial services. We think we can
learn how to drive alternative revenue and proﬁt streams by building on our core
businesses, learning how to build and launch digital products will be key.
Beyond advertising and ﬁnancial services, healthcare looks like a big opportunity.
Given our large pharmacy and optical businesses and our experience with ﬂu shots
and other in-store health events, we have something to build on. It's another
omnichannel opportunity that takes advantage of big boxes and big parking lots
close to people. The early results from our two Walmart health clinics in Georgia
have shown us that customers welcome us to participate in healthcare services. I
don't want to get too far over my skis here because we're just getting started and we
have a lot to learn and do. But after spending time in both of these health clinics, I
think there is something here. Our doctors and healthcare professionals like the
incentive structure. They're not being rewarded for sending people to a specialty
that they may not need, they're being rewarded for caring for patients and it shows.
That's a small sample size, but our NPS score related to wealth cared for is in the mid
90s.
We're learning how to equip these clinics with the right people. We will learn how to
support them with the right technology. We'll try various pricing structures, we will
be experimenting with the size and lay out and we'll be exploring opportunities to
add digital capabilities that extend outside of the clinics and eCommerce to round
out the experience. Our opportunities with healthcare, ﬁnancial services and
advertising will take time to sort out and scale. But it's clear to us that in an
omnichannel world where people can complement, our people-centric physical
businesses with new digital businesses, our opportunity to serve customers
holistically and proﬁtably expand beyond what we've done before.
Now, let me take a minute to look further into the future. I think we're headed
towards a time when customers won't really think about buying their routine items
very often. They'll tell us once or less frequently anyway and we'll take care of it. As a
teenager, I remember my mom leaving our house asking is there anything you needFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 28 of 91from Walmart? It's apparent to me now she didn't say I'm going shopping, what do
you need? She wasn't shopping around. Walmart was the default. And then so many
of our customers do today, she bought her big basket from Walmart and ﬁlled in
from elsewhere. Well, the next generation of that is Walmart InHome. Customers will
start to think of us like a membership service where we make sure the items they use
all the time are available in their homes, whether it's that service, the way we design
our store oﬀer, or the growth of our pickup business, we're out to win the big basket
stock up trip that's delivered on time at an everyday low price. When it's our job to
forecast their demand and keep them in stock, it's not as important to deliver in a
day or an hour, it's just required that their items will be there when they need them.
Price will matter. Our supply chain will support that strategy.
We'll have a human relationship with customers as they interact with our associates,
but we'll have a stronger digital relationship that saves them time and makes their
experience with Walmart more enjoyable. To create these digital experiences that
marry our people, our stores and clubs with our site and app, we're changing how
we work inside the company. We're adopting agile, working in small teams to design
experiences and solve problems. This change is an unlock to deliver seamless omni,
to drive innovation, become more productive and pick up speed. Working this way
won't only help us improve our core oﬀer, but will also help us build and launch
digital businesses that eventually form a new business model.
Sam's Club provides an early and good example of the beneﬁts of working this way.
It's become an innovation hub within the company. The Sam's team has created
time-saving innovations like Membership Express, which enables us to sign up new
members in less than a minute. New apps like Sam's Garage allow members to buy
tires in a fraction of the time it used to take and the Ask Sam voice app gets our
associates needed answers fast.
The technologies we're using to assist our associates and members at Sam's are
getting results. We've seen 16 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth in Sam's
excluding fuel and we have more members now than we had before we closed clubs
two years ago. Our overall membership count and renewal rates are up year-over-
year.
As I mentioned previously, a lot of what I've described for the US is relevant across
the world. We all want to save time and money. We all want to be pleasantly
surprised by ﬁnding an exciting new item. Outside the US, Judith and team are
working together to drive innovation. We oﬀer grocery pickup delivery or both in
nearly a dozen countries. We've got some strong well-positioned businesses in
Walmex and in Canada. Flipkart and PhonePe are scaling quickly with a ton of
runway ahead of them as we work to build platforms that support (inaudible) and
small businesses. It's helpful to a built expertise with our cash and carry business in
India too. We have strong leaders in place. They and their teams are being
aggressive. We're learning from them as they build out our ecosystem in this
important market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 29 of 91In Mexico, we oﬀer same-day delivery of grocery, consumables and thousands of
general merchandise items. (inaudible) and the team are building e-commerce
capabilities and becoming a digital enterprise. We opened 134 new stores in Mexico
last year, bringing our total for Walmex to more than 3,400. We're set up for omni in
Mexico.
Our business in China, particularly in Sam's Club, has been strong. With respect to
Walmart in China, we drove e-commerce growth of 95% as we continue to expand.
Walmart Daojia and JD Daojia. Daojia, by the way, means to the home and that's
where we're going with an average delivery time of 40 minutes. We own about 10%
of JD.com and have an investment in Dada, which provides delivery from our
supercenters. Along with the US, Walmex, Canada, India and China are our priorities.
Beyond those markets, we'll be working to set of other businesses for success. We've
shown we're open to alternative ownership structures. If you've seen us take action
in Brazil and attempt to merge our business in the UK, we'll be thoughtful about the
portfolio, make the right decisions for our associates, our customers and our
business. We'll be disciplined about positioning and where we invest and not just
geographically, we're making choices as we transform the company.
One choice we've made is to get more aggressive with regard to legacy technology.
We've been operating and innovating on top of a complex set of global systems.
We've decided to speed up the modernization process and do it in fewer years than
we had planned even a year ago. Doing so will enable us to drive more innovation,
speed and productivity.
We'll wrap up our session today talking in more detail about those plans, the
implications of which are in the guidance that Brett shared earlier. And we aren't a
tech company, we're a people-led tech-empowered company, but we're out to put
tech and data to work. As we do, we'll keep people ﬁrst. It's our humanity that
diﬀerentiates us. Our associate success is the company's success and we have an
opportunity and a responsibility to prepare them for the future of work.
The impact of technology on the workplace is amongst the most pressing issues of
our time. We design and manage holistic set of beneﬁts that support our associates,
including a fully loaded hourly wage that's now over $18 an hour including part-time
associates, quarterly bonuses that totaled $730 million last year and were earned by
a majority of our US associates. A 401(k) match where we invested more than $1
billion last year for 650,000 associates, an enhanced parental leave policy that can
provide up to 16 weeks of paid time oﬀ for a birth mom, a $5,000 adoption beneﬁt
and ﬂexible healthcare plans that start as low as $29 per pay period. Working with
partners like the Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins, we've created centers of
excellence for serious health procedures to ensure the best care.
We developed educational opportunities enabling our associates to be prepared for
their current role and prepare them for promotions. We will be a springboard for
them. More than 12,000 associates are enrolled in Live Better U, and as of last year,
they've completed more than 88,000 course credits, which have a total worth of
more than $42 million and it costs our associates about $1 a day.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 30 of 91Over the past ﬁve years, we've made incremental investments of more than $5
billion in training, education and higher pay for store and club associates in the US
alone. Without question, investing in our associates is the right thing to do and we
continue to see how our education oﬀerings are paying oﬀ. Our commitment to
supporting and developing associates isn't limited to the US. In fact, the academies
we launched in the US were copied from the UK. In China, we have a program called
Retail University that helps associates build new skills. In Canada, we oﬀer tuition
reimbursement for associates and their families at accredited colleges and
universities. We're bringing our workforce into the future with us. And we're not just
focused on customers and associates. We take a multi-stakeholder view. For many
years now we've taken action to beneﬁt the breadth of stakeholders that we serve.
Of course, our shareholders are our priority and we know they beneﬁt over the long
term as we serve customers well and create opportunities for our associates, as we
ﬁnd win-win opportunities with our suppliers and marketplace sellers, invest to
strengthen communities and take action to protect our planet. Without a healthy
planet and strong communities, there is no business. If associates aren't happy, our
customers won't be.
When the Business Roundtable updated our statement on the purpose of a
corporation in August of last year, I was surprised by the reaction from some. I'm so
accustomed to how Walmart practices stakeholder capitalism that it didn't feel like
news that company's balanced the interests of all of our stakeholders. We believe in
creating shared value. We're certainly not perfect and there's more we can do as a
business community, but there are plenty of companies taking action with tangible
plans to do more, and it's the same for us at Walmart.
We've accomplished a lot, we've set big goals and there is still more that we can do.
We're leading one of the largest private sector consortiums in the world taking
action on climate change. The goal of Project Gigaton is to avoid 1 billion metric tons
of emissions from our supply chain. To date, more than 2,300 suppliers are
participating and they report having avoided more than 200 million metric tons of
greenhouse gas emissions. Within our own operations, we're on track to meet our
commitment of an 18% reduction of emissions by 2025 and 28% of our current
energy needs are being provided by renewables. In the US, we're diverting more
than 80% of our waste from landﬁlls and incineration and we recycled more than
250 million pounds of plastics last year.
Our work isn't just environmental, it's broader. Our purchase orders provide inclusive
economic growth opportunities. We foster community resilience through disaster
recovery. We were included in the Bloomberg 2020 Gender Equality Index for the
second year, which is a recognition that we're helping to set an example through
measurement and transparency of women advancing in the workplace.
In short, stakeholder capitalism is good business.
Behind me you can see the talented leadership team that I get to work with every
day. Let me wrap up by saying a little bit about those who are in new rules or new to
the company and I'll start with Walmart US.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

follow him on social media, he is upfront with a pilot, he is serving drinks down the
aisle of the customers, and he has been washing airplanes and moving luggage,

Now, John Furner is going to take that foundation and build on it. He has a depth of
experience from his 26 years with the company that includes time as a Walmart US
store manager, market manager and buyer. He has worked in all three operating
segments of the company. He led merchandising and marketing in China, and he led
Sam's Club here in the US. He knows the details of our business, and yet he is a
forward-looking innovator. I've enjoyed watching and embrace new ways of thinking
about our business, and I'm excited about the innovation and speed he'll bring to
Walmart US. Succeeding John at Sam's is Kathryn McLay. Most recently, Kath has
been leading our Neighborhood Markets business in the US, which is performing
really well. She's from Australia, where she worked with -- for Woolworths with Greg
Foran and Roger Corbett, our former Board member before joining us in 2015. Kath
has supply chain internal audit and operational experience. She's a strong leader
and she will do a great job at Sam's Club.
Suresh Kumar joined us from Google in July as our Global Chief Technology and
Development Oﬃcer. He has 25 years of technology leadership experience that
includes 15 years at Amazon plus time at Microsoft before Google. We're excited to
have someone of his caliber in this role, and you'll hear more from him a little later.
Our newest addition is Donna Morris, she joins us from Adobe, where she had a 22-
year career. She'll increase our digital acumen and help us accelerate our
transformation. We have a deep bench, but we also understand the beneﬁt of
bringing in talented people from outside the company for their expertise and new
ideas.
As I said before, I'm as excited about this company as I've ever been. There is more
opportunity ahead of us than anything we've experienced in the past. We have a
meaningful purpose, a set of timeless values and a special culture. We inherit a DNA
from Sam Walton that embraces change. We're adapting and we're doing it from a
position of strength with great people and great assets. Our core is strong. We're
increasing innovation and speed while demonstrating the ability to execute and
deliver results as we transform. We're ready and able to take this company into the
next generation of retail and we thank you for being part of it.
Now it's time to hear from our other leaders and we're going to start with John
Furner.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Good morning. Look, I'm happy to talk to you this morning about the US business.
It's an exciting business and exciting time and I've been learning a lot in the past 100FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 32 of 91days to say the least. But it's been great just to see ﬁrsthand all across the country
how far the business has come in just the last few years. And it's been a while since
I've been in the business, but it's exciting to be back and see the momentum that's
going on.
So you saw our results and we had a good year. We grew sales, we leveraged
expenses, we grew transactions, we grew ticket, we added same-day grocery pickup
to more stores and we're going to continue to do that this year. Overall, we had a
strong year with signiﬁcant momentum in both food and consumables and we've
got an opportunity to expand that momentum all across the rest of the stores. Now,
last quarter, as an example, we talked about some of the misses we had in general
merchandise and those were in toys, apparel, media and gaming. You heard about
that earlier and I'll come back to that again in just a few minutes.
But I ﬁrst want to say this is a really, really healthy business. We've got momentum to
build on and we've got a lot to do that we can do with a -- lot we can do to enhance
the customer experience and the way customers use our brand all across the
business. And as I look ahead, I am mindful that we've got to do three things. Now,
ﬁrst is, we've got to build on our strengths. Second, we've got to manage our results.
And third, we're going to innovate for the future. So I'm going to talk about all three
of these.
So let me take our strengths ﬁrst. And as I said earlier, and I'm really, really
appreciative of what so many great associates that have been in on a stage like this
before me build, all across the country and throughout the business. And I grew up
learning about Walmart and our core values at home. My dad worked for the
company. So I heard about those values at the dinner table and those values things
like serving customers, respecting individuals, striving for excellence and then always
acting with integrity, I learned about those home and it's been great to see those in
associate how how they play out throughout the business.
But as I said, I'm appreciative of what's happened in the business in the last ﬁve
years. A lot has been done to help us get back to the fundamentals of retail, things
like cleaner stores, fresher produce, we've got great quality private brands and we've
got more eﬃcient processes that are helping us with in-stock and inventory ﬂow.
And I'm thankful for the investments that were made in the last ﬁve years, things like
lower prices, e-commerce capabilities. I'm thankful for the investments we made in
wages, scheduling, training and the other things for our associates like beneﬁts.
Now, these are big investments and the associate investments in particular, they put
a lot of pressure on our ﬁnancials. But I want to tell you that those investments they
are paying oﬀ. Now ﬁrst, turnover is down 15% over the last ﬁve years. Associates are
more productive, they're engaged, and we've leverage expenses each of the last 12
quarters, and we've also seen 22 quarters of straight, positive sales comps and that's
getting our productivity loop turning again. And this is the model that the US
business has always been based on, growing sales which allows us to leverage
expenses, then we can invest back in the business, grow more sales and that helps
us keep growing our proﬁt.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 33 of 91And throughout Walmart's history, we've seen that when we get this productivity
turning in the right way, that's how we get results. Now regarding the everyday low
price component of the model, as a former merchant, I know the value of getting this
thing right. So we're going to be really disciplined about EDLP. We've got more price
investments planned for this year and we're going to deliver EDLP in a very
sustainable way focusing on everyday low cost.
And as you heard earlier, there has been a lot of progress in the last few years to
help us become more eﬃcient leverage expenses. But I still see plenty of
opportunities ahead. We're looking at areas like signing outside services and we've
done some tests where we reduced the amount of signing in-stores to give the
customers a more clean view of the store and associates a more clean view of the
back room. And you can see by this photo of what we're calling the war room, we're
taking a look at everything, we're putting everything in one spot, we're testing things
in front of customers and making changes like this while it enhances the customer
experience on our scale, saves tens and millions of dollars.
Now another strength that I want to talk about is the Walmart Supercenter. And the
Supercenter is a really, really important part of our future. And as I step back and
look at the Supercenter, I see, arguably the greatest format in the history of retail,
and it's a competitive advantage. We've got the most 100,000 -- most productive
100,000 items ever aggregated into one location and we're now working to deliver
the entire store same day in the customers' homes.
And the Supercenter, it's a place that in many communities, it's center of the
community, like the heartbeat of the community. It's often one of the largest
employers in town, it's one of the largest grocers in town. And its shopping format is
powered by one of the most extensive supply chains in the world and that includes
both fresh and general merchandise.
Just last year alone, we shipped 8.3 billion cases of inventory and we did that while
being named the safest large ﬂeet in America for the sixth consecutive year and then
when you add in our neighborhood markets and our discount stores, that's over
4,700 locations putting us -- plus within 10 miles of 90% of the US population. So
that leads to how we're managing results.
Yeah, I know we can take this format to the next level. And to me, the next level is
ﬁnding ways to serve all of Americans a truly comprehensive in the end shopping
experience. That's an experience where they can come into a store, they can stop in
a parking lot, pick up a pickup order, they can have anything that they want
delivered to the doorsteps or they can even have their refrigerator stocked and for
many customers we know it's going to be a combination of all these things.
So that's scale that gives us a unique advantage. We serve all of America including
people who are looking for new services that can help them save not only money
but save time and we've got an opportunity to get customers to do even more
shopping with us. So while I'm committed of course in making our stores better. IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 34 of 91want you know I'm just as focused on improving our digital relationship with
customers, getting the diﬀerent shopping options we have to complement each
other and work seamlessly and we're something like same-day pickup, I see areas
we can get better and make the experience much more seamless for our customers.
Just the other day, my team and I, we decided we try to put in order and that would
reﬂect the way many customers shopping the Supercenter. So we tried to order
something from sporting goods, apparel and the meat department and what we
found is we had a lot of friction. We've got multiple apps, and it's hard to do and it's
hard to understand how you pick those things up and we're going to solve those
problems and we're going to make shopping in the Supercenter across-the-box very
seamless for the customer. But all that begins. We know with the relationship we
have with people. When it comes to grocery. Grocery IS essential to the customer
relationship. Now we're delivering strong sales in grocery and we're gaining market
share but to make it any more quality experience we're going to continue to focus
on even lower prices, fresh innovation, private brands, and then, convenience.
Now (inaudible) I'm seeing in produce, we talked about the improvements over the
last few years. And it's several times in the last quarter. It's exciting to hear Martin,
who leads the produce department talk about another record sales day, they've got
momentum and you can feel the energy when you talk to the team when it comes to
items and the way they're taking days out of the supply chain.
In the Deli and we've got a new Deli concept out on the street where we pull the
Hormel solutions up to the front of the store that makes it easy for customers that
come in and get dinner for the family. The meat department, another area where
we've really invested in quality and we've seen the comps accelerate.
Private brands l,ike Doug mentioned, we've got many brands over $1 billion and the
brands are improving. A couple of other things we've done in food in the last couple
of years, we've opened a plant in the milk area and dairy, we also open a meat plant
and these are helping us think through ways that we can provide even more quality
to our stores and to our ultimate consumer.
Now, when I look at general merchandise, I see enhanced quality and value in
several places around the store. We've got new private brands like (inaudible)
electronics and their quality levels typically you only ﬁnd in a specialty channel and
we also heard we've got a lot of strength in home it's been exciting to see how our
store team and our eCom team and home been particular have really worked
together to bring customers the best experience, the best items, the best prices and
it's paying oﬀ. I'm particularly excited about the investments we've made in our
electronics department. We've been successful with televisions and other big
consumer electronics categories. But, we also mentioned, as the fourth quarter
showed we've got some categories where we've got to do better. And, I'll just talk
about those for a second. In toys, we started the season with features that we
decided were too high on price points, and then our Layaway business was soft, and
we're thinking -- rethinking about the way we go to market with Layaway all across
the country.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 35 of 91And then in Apparel, as Doug mentioned earlier, our ﬂoors reﬂected too much
holiday. We've got work to do with our brands and fashion basics and when I think
about brands like Time and Tru that's on the ﬂoor today. We've got to make sure that
as we've narrowed our brands that every one of our brands has a proper place for
the consumer.
So, we've done a lot of great work over the last couple of years narrowing the
brands, but we've ended up pushing into these brands, a really wide range of quality
levels, price levels and sizing and we're going to rethink the way we go back to
market to make sure our brands are really clear to the consumer and we've got great
gift items that people can buy and give us, best gifts as season coming up.
Which leads me to our new Chief Merchant, Scott McCall. Scott, some of you
probably know, Scott's been with the Company for 25 years and his entire career has
been in the merchandising area, and Scott lead areas like consumables, health and
wellness, home, lawn and garden, entertainment, and Scott just lives and breathe
these items. Scott was telling me the other day, he can't walk through an airport
without noticing the color of people's luggage or the accessories that they're
wearing and he's always thinking about what else we should be doing to drive sales.
But the other thing you should know about Scott is, Scott's been a really big driver of
the omnichannel experience, and he believes in a digital relationship with
customers. And Scott just going to help us accelerate that. And as I mentioned
earlier, when we talk about price we're going to continue to invest in food and
consumables, but we're also going to consider places to add price investment in
general merchandise categories. Now with both Grocery and GM, we want to
prioritize pricing, but we also want to make sure that we're sourcing in the right way.
We know that our customers expect us to make a diﬀerence on key global issues,
and the increase in care about how items are produced.
Now, as I look outside the store I'm just going to start with curbside. The US team has
built an impressive business with the same-day pickup operation. They've got high
NPS scores, we are now in about 3,200 locations and we'll be expanding to about
another 500 locations this year. And we'll continue to see healthy comp growth, not
only from the new stores we're adding, but we're seeing healthy comp growth from
the stores that have been open for more than one year. And the work that's been
done in this business is what's made same-day delivery a reality. You know it's
essentially the same process for delivery the same process for delivery as it is for a
pickup order, it's just the associate is putting the order in a delivery driver's trunk
instead of the customers' trunk and we're now oﬀering same-day delivery in 1600
stores, and we expect that to be in about half the ﬂeet by the end of the year. In
same-day delivery is what a lot of customers want and we love our position there.
We already have over 100,000 items forward deployed within just a few miles of
millions and millions of customers homes and we've got diﬀerent options for
delivery, things like third parties, associated delivery and we have also launched our
own Spark delivery network, and you're going to hear more about that from Dacona
Smith, just later today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 36 of 91And when we started our pickup business, we made a really deliberate decision to
only pick food and consumables. Most in our merchandise -- general merchandise
items had to be ordered on a separate app, it have to be picked up in a tower or
they have to be shipped to home and we're now ready at the point where we can
start to combine these experiences and pick the rest of the store and add more
general merchandise selection to the pickup for curbside and same-day delivery.
And we know our customers are asking for that as well.
So as we pick more and more of the GM and the Supercenters for same day that's
going to help us do things like expand the size of the basket. It will help us with
margin mix in the basket, and it just be great for our customer to be able to order
their groceries and also pickup an HDMI cable or a sweater or something they can
top oﬀ the entire basket, we're going to make that happen. But we think this also
help our perception as a destination for general merchandise, which leads to the
longer tail in the eCommerce business that Marc will talk about in a few minutes.
So we know we can increase our market share, our wallet share on the head of the
assortment, and then we can walk all the way through the assortment as we get into
the eCommerce. Now, as I look ahead I want to prepare our business for the future.
And a lot of time and the team we say that loyalty in retail is the absence of
something better. So we're in a race with everyone else out there who wants to
provide something better for consumer and we want to be best positioned from
now and into the future to win with the customer. And as you've heard the US team,
they built a lot of tools that have helped us reach new customers, they have helped
us to become more eﬃcient, and they move quickly to scale a lot of these new
technologies. At the last Analyst Day, for example you heard about some of the
concepts around just a few stores, things like self scanning robots, autonomous ﬂoor
scrubbers and you heard about the FAST Unloaders earlier this year.
Well, by the end of this year, we'll have the self scanning robots in over 1,000 stores
and the FAST Unloaders will be in more than 2,000 stores. And I'm also excited
about something you've heard mentioned that's the AlphaBot technology. We're
testing this in (inaudible) in New Hampshire and this technology eliminates the need
to handpick individual items from store. It's made our associates in sale are more
productive. It's greatly increase the number of same-day orders can be processed at
a certain time and this year we're going to expand that to a couple of more sites. In
the last few years at Sam's Club I learned the power of new technology tools, and a
good example that you heard about is Ask Sam, and Ask Sam let's an associate open
a single app speak questions into their phone things like what else (inaudible), or
who is working in the bakery today to get answers.
It runs on voice and voice is a big idea, not only for associates but also for customers.
So associates in our stores today they're working across a site that's over 4 acres in
size. So there's a lot of time spent going back and forth getting answers or getting
something that you need to complete a task, and by using voice, and mobile, we're
able to get the associates the information they need to save a lot of the time they
spend walking back and forth. And this is going to help them free up more time that
they can serve our customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 37 of 91But I don't to miss the idea of voice, because voice is a big idea that can help
customers and associates and everything from maps, ﬁnding items, shopping list, all
across eCommerce, it's a really big idea for us, and the reason that I think Ask Sam
was so successful is it was designed from the very start to serve the end customer. In
serving the end customer, that's something we want to refer -- that refer to as having
a product mindset. And when I say the product mindset, I don't mean product like an
item like a soccer ball or pair of socks, I mean product like a technology product that
helps us identify points in the experience where there's friction. Friction for
customers, friction for associates and then we go back and work on processes and
technology and then we iterate on that, so that we can ensure that we're eliminating
the friction, and making our experiences for both of those key end users, very, very
seamless. And this is a big opportunity for the Walmart US business.
So whether in our stores, the distribution centers, the corporate oﬃces, we need to
be even more customer-driven. We need to think in ways that make the end user
have a better experience. So we can look at the things we're prioritizing, how we're
working and even some of the cultural behaviors we have inside the business.
Now, we're still going to run one great store at a time. That won't change, but it's
clear that great stores are an important part of the solution, and we've got to expand
our thinking to think about the entire solution and all the diﬀerent ways that a
customer wishes to be served in today's market. And we're going to keep the
customer at the center.
So we'll also be looking at new proﬁt streams. Ideas like services, and things that
help leverage the popularity and the power of the Walmart Supercenter. We're
testing partnerships with FedEx, -- rental car, Build-A-Bear, veterinary clinics, esports
gaming areas and you've seen our experiments with health and wellness, you've
seen the things we've done in pharmacy, we're working on our optical business to
modernize the look and feel of optical, and then the full service health-care clinics in
Dallas and Calhoun, Georgia. We want to be able to learn quickly how we can
deliver quality medical, dental, optical and even mental health services that in
aﬀordable price. And we think this is especially great idea in communities where
healthcare is lacking and out of reach for many.
And ﬁnally we can't run a great business without our people. Our associates are the
key to our future and our associates are our competitive advantage. And I see that
every time I'm in stores, distribution centers, corporate oﬃces, fulﬁllment centers, all
around the country I see what an advantage our associates are for Walmart. And we
want our associates to have a great experience, while they work, the ability to learn
and grow career, opportunities to get an education, things like Live Better U in
academies, and in past positions I've learned the value, investing in key positions
things like senior merchants, technologists, store leadership teams, department
managers those investments are important, and we're going to be targeting speciﬁc
about the way we invest in our people because we've got to not only attract, but
retain the very best talent for our customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 38 of 91Marc LoreSo that's what I'm seeing in the ﬁrst 100 days. And as I take on this responsibility with
over 1.3 million associates, 4,700 locations, I couldn't be more excited about what
lies ahead. But we've got opportunities where we can do more. We've got
opportunities to serve more customers in the way they wish to be served. We've got
opportunities to bring more momentum to the entire store including delivering
general merchandise same day. We've got opportunities to build technology and
keep the end user mind as we design solutions that solve their problems. So I think
there is a ton of upside. I'm really excited about the customer experience we intend
to build, and the results in the next few years and months.
Thank you for your time.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Good morning, thanks for being here. Here's what I like to cover this morning. First I
want to recap FY'20 and share what we expect for this year. Next, I'll share an update
on our strategy especially how we're leveraging our unique assets to play oﬀense.
And ﬁnally I'll walk you through a couple of projects we're excited about that have
the opportunity to shape the future of retail.
So let's take a look at how we did last year. We said we grow sales about 35% and
we exceeded that by growing 37% nearly tripling the size of the business over the
last three years. We also improved contribution proﬁt margins by about 150 basis
points year-over-year. The shift in product mix toward categories like home and
apparel, lower variable cost per unit and fewer packages per order all helping us
make progress here.
We're at 35% growth was strong in Q4, we know we need to do more with delivery
speed in merchandising. A top line growth was better than expected and that put
pressure on fulﬁllment and ship speed which led us to back oﬀ our shipping
promises was left sales on the table. This year we'll be laser focused on delivering
faster and longer into the holiday season, and we'll continue to improve our
merchandising.
We had a lot of brands and we'll continue to go assortment and gifting categories in
addition to more home and apparel and looking ahead, we expect to go
eCommerce sales by about 30% this year. Quarterly growth is expected to range as
Brett said between the mid '20s and mid '30s.
So now let's take a look at our e-commerce strategy. At a high level we'll continue to
focus on three areas. Knowing the fundamentals, leverage our unique assets to play
oﬀense and innovative for the future. Over the last few years you've seen how the
pieces of this puzzle ﬁt together, and it's still how we think about the business today.
We look at narrowing the fundamentals in terms of how we perform across the ﬁve
(inaudible) metrics of the CVI. We've made good progress across all ﬁve metrics.
We're most proud of what we've done to improve delivery speed. Three years agoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 39 of 91the average Walmart.com package took ﬁve days to arrive. Today it's two days.
We've done a lot to make this happen.
We started a few years ago by oﬀering free two day shipping and most recently we
launched next day delivery. We're able to oﬀer next day in a cost-eﬃcient way by
mirroring inventory in our warehouses. Our cost to delivery next is lower because the
inventory shipped in one box and it's close to the customer. And we could reach 75%
in the US in one day with a broad and growing assortment.
At the same time both on-time delivery and in-stock rates have increased
dramatically over the last three years. We've achieved all this by overhauling our
supply chain and building out a new team. This is why the CVI score keeps going up.
We increased more than 20 points since FY '17 which in turn has improved each
element of the customer value prop. And to keep improving this score, we'll have to
continue the progress we're making in other fronts, like expanding our ﬁrst party
oﬀering. That's really our habit metric and we're doing a lot here.
Over the last three years, we added 7,500 new brands, acquired companies like
Shoes.com, Moosejaw and Art to quickly help expand our assortment of
Walmart.com, and we're adding more all the time. We now oﬀer about three
quarters of the top 500,000 items in the overall retail mall.
In addition to ﬁrst-party, we're also expecting to improve CVI by expanding our
marketplace. The assortment on Walmart.com has grown to about 80 million SKUs
including marketplace as we remain focused on keeping the quality of items high.
And as a result, the marketplace businesses grown by 2.5 times since FY '17.
However, this is an area as Doug mentioned where we still have a lot more work to
do, while customer and seller NPS scores are improving, we also want to make
selling easier. Sellers are telling us they want more options and not all sellers have
the same capabilities, especially when it comes to fulﬁllment. So that's why we're
introducing Walmart Fulﬁllment Services.
We shipped our ﬁrst WFS order in August last year. The tech on the back-end works
well, our merchants are excited, and we like what we see so far. Sellers want as many
channels to sell as possible, and WFS gives them another option and it gives
customers faster delivery, more assortment and better pricing. We're really proud of
the experience we've built and something we plan to scale over time.
The fundamentals of our eCommerce business are improving, but as you heard
today, it's not enough to do the basics right. We need to leverage our unique assets
and start playing oﬀense. Take our 4,700 stores, as John said, this gives us a huge
edge and being able to do delivery in eﬃcient way. Our existing footprint is already
within 10 miles of 90% of the population and we have fully deployed inventory which
is the really expensive part.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 40 of 91In this case, stores already operating as warehouses. They're proﬁtable and there's a
low marginal cost for someone to pick the items. That's our existing assets like our
stores that allow us to oﬀer a service like same-day delivery to customers at such an
incredible value.
Customer can pay $98 a year and get unlimited Fresh Frozen Bakery, pantry staples,
consumables and select general merchandise delivered to their door for free. Our
1,600 stores that are doing delivery already reached half the US population. And
what we're ﬁnding is that delivery customers spend more overall with Walmart just
like our pickup customers. So now in terms of long-term growth, we've seen
opportunity to hook customers on the convenience of services like same-day
delivery as they come to rely on them we can expect to see them by more general
merchandise, health and wellness services and more. At the same time we're making
shopping with us even easier. For example we're combining the Walmart.com
grocery app and Walmart.com and the grocery app into one. Today we have what's
called the Blue app and the Orange app. The Blue app is the traditional
Walmart.com direct-to-home eCommerce app, although the Orange app is for
online grocery. With two apps we're not able to leverage the traﬃc from the head of
the assortment, the relationships we've built with the customer through grocery to
sell more long tail items, plus we're spending marketing dollars to send customers
to two diﬀerent places.
So later this year, we'll bring these two apps together. So the customer sees and
interacts with One Walmart. Walmart is playing oﬀense. We're leading with grocery
and same-day delivery to become the primary destination for all weekly shopping.
We see this as a critical step to in a greater share of wallet. So what's next, the third
piece of our eCommerce strategy is about innovating for the future. We're exploring
opportunities around conversational eCommerce, augmented reality, virtual reality,
delivery into the refrigerator and incubating digitally native brands.
As you heard, we've innovating to deﬁne the retail experience of the future, to
anticipate it, to shape it, take InHome Delivery. It's our latest innovation aimed at
giving time back to busy families, by delivery fresh groceries and everyday essentials
directly into their kitchen or garage. After initial testing approve the concept, we
rolled out a larger pilot in Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Vero Beach in October.
We're on the leading edge is something really big here. InHome is a powerful and
eﬀortless experience we want to grow it. We're exploring enhancements like
delivering items automatically before even realize you're running low. For customers
who spending hour or week shopping for food, this could be save a ton of time.
And we're looking at ways to leverage this new InHome relationship with customers
like No box delivery and returns. All our customer having to open a box and we have
something delivered, and then have to discard it or recycle it, but instead of getting
a product in a cardboard box imagine Walmart leaving the item on your kitchen
table, or you can leave item you want on your Island and we'll pick it up, when we
bring in your groceries. No need to print or return label or put the package in a box.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 41 of 91Needless to say, we're just starting to unlock the possibilities what the service can be.
Customers who've tried it already love it. InHome graduated from our innovation
incubator story is now part of the customer organization led by Janey Whiteside, our
Chief Customer Oﬃcer. An innovation mindset is taken hold at Walmart. And we're
dreaming of concepts, we're testing them, we're piling them and iterating. We're
speeding up the time between concept and delivery. Not all these things are going
to work and that's okay. We're going to learn, we'll pivot. Another area we're
investing is conversational commerce. What has surprised me in 20 years is the
majority of shopping is done by text and voice, but the machine needs to know the
right questions to ask, so you can get the right answers. When you ask your voice
assistant or send a text to order diapers, needs to know that your preferred brand is
Hello Bello, and that it's size 2.
We began building this engine with Jetblack and tested it here in New York City.
We're learning the customers really responded and love the ability to text. In fact,
members use this service nearly 10 times a week. It allowed us to understand what
types of items people want to purchase by text, groceries, birthday gifts and things
like that.
We're building machine learning capabilities that can help understand the message
you said and make recommendations in one, two or three best answers. As we build
capabilities like we have in Jetblack, we're presented with strategic options. We did
consider spinning it out and there was great interest from the investor community.
We also thought about investing more in the New York oﬀering, but the real
opportunity for customers and shareholders is when we can scale these innovations
with the mothership Walmart and walmart.com.
So what's next? While we're going to take those insights and leverage them against
the store base in a way that's scalable and sustainable. We've infused our learnings
from Jetblack into our customer -- or within Walmart US and we'll be taking these
learnings to Bentonville, Pittsburgh and Kansas City in the coming months. Think
same-day shipping from a supercenter or next day from walmart.com, we all text, it's
shopping in a way that's completely natural to customers and that's an exciting
opportunity for us.
We also have a startup called Inspirience [ph] tuning up ways to integrate virtual
reality into retail. VR has the potential to transform the shopping experience. Imagine
shopping without space constraints and being able to experience products before
you buy them. That's what we call v-commerce. All it takes us is a headset to instantly
transport a customer to a world where they interact with merchandise in a natural
environment, like being in your living room while you design it.
Let's take a look. (Video Presentation) Possibilities very exciting. We're moving
quickly and you could expect to see experiences like this in a few of our stores really
soon. As retails improve speed, assortment and price leave the game, we'll need to
shift to original proprietary content, has been one of the main diﬀerentiators
between retailers. Customers want amazing products and those products will
inﬂuence their choice of retailer. Early -- earlier I mentioned how we acquired aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 42 of 91Daniel Binder
Unidentiﬁed Speakernumber of brands to quickly grow our assortment like shoes, (inaudible) and art.
Those helped us add assortment on walmart.com, but beyond growing our
assortment, we also acquired a few digitally native brands like ELOQUII and
Bonobos that help us diﬀerentiate our assortment.
These aren't just private label brands. They have a soul, a social media following.
They give us the DNA to create these digital native brands in-house. You've seen us
do it with the launch of Scoop in Fashion and with Allswell. Allswell is a mattress
brand that oﬀers products at a price point that allows us to put them on walmart.com
and in stores. We started oﬀ with just a little bit of capital and we think it will
approach $100 million brand this year. Allswell was the Aha [ph] for us we realize that
we can create these brands and incubate them in a way to make them successful
across stores and online. We're integrating our digitally native brands like Allswell
into the company and we're going to keep moving in that direction.
As I wrap up today, there are lots of reasons to be excited about e-commerce at
Walmart. Our team is aligned on a winning strategy and the response from
customers shows that we're making great progress. We're working hard to monetize
our relations with customers through a better mix by selling more long tail category.
Building on the momentum from FY'20, we expect to grow about 30% this year and
continue to improve CP margins as well as Brett mentioned losses for this year will
be ﬂat to slightly lower. We're delivering growth in building a healthier business
overall.
Talked about a lot of initiatives today, some were tests, some were pilots, some were
scaling. Walmart is an innovation engine and all the things I've talked about today
are included in guidance. As I said, we're moving faster, gaining leverage, getting
the fundamentals right and playing oﬀerings to win primary destination, and while
we're doing all this, we're working hard to shape the future of Retai.l I'm really
excited about the year ahead. Thank you.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Marc. So that will conclude the morning session or the early morning
session. We're going to take a 15-minute break and we'll be back with the rest of the
program. Thanks.
(Music Playing)
Good morning, everybody. I'm really pleased to have a few minutes to talk to you
today about Walmart International. I'm going to brieﬂy cover last year's results, a
brief look at our outlook for FY '21, but I want to spend most of my time talking about
bringing to life strong local businesses that are powered by Walmart by talking
about four examples of just that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 43 of 91Walmart International is a $124 billion business, it makes us a top ﬁve global retailer
in our own right. We operate more than 6,000 stores across 26 diﬀerent countries
and those stores are at the absolute heart of our business. But just like the US,
omnichannel and e-commerce are becoming an increasingly important part of our
growth. In fact, last year e-commerce sales as a total of International were 10% and
are expected to reach 12% of our total sales this year.
Now across our markets, we operate a variety of businesses, banners, channels and
formats. What I can tell you is that one size does not ﬁt all. We will not be successful
by thinking like a multinational business. We will continue to be successful by
thinking like a multi-local business executing our strategy one country and one
business at a time.
So let me reﬂect brieﬂy on FY '20. Our sales grew at 2.8% on a constant currency
basis, which was another solid year of growth, underpinned by strong performances
from Walmex where the top line grew at 5.2% and China where we grew sales by
4.3%. Now Brett's already talked about some of the factors in our results for last year
and he mentioned speciﬁcally Chile and that impact. All I want to add to that is my
huge appreciation for our teams there who have done and continue to do some
incredible things and an incredible job under some very challenging circumstances.
I was personally pleased to see around the world, all of our businesses displayed
strong cost control last year and we leveraged 35 basis points of SG&A through
innovation and through operational focus. And our Japan and China markets led the
way. Now, I'm sure that you'll all be pleased to know as you heard from Brett that
Flipkart performed in line with our expectations and was within the guidance that we
gave to you, and just as a reminder, International has a December year-end and the
ownership of Flipkart only annualized last year in August and that fact alone
accounted for the majority of our year-on-year decline in segment proﬁt.
But let me turn now to FY'21. There is no doubt the levels of volatility around the
world are higher than they've been for some time. We faced some tough
environments and tough trading environments, but our EDLP position, our low cost
base and our ability to leverage innovation and best practice position is really well.
As a result, this year, Walmart International expects to grow top line by 4% with proﬁt
broadly ﬂat year-on-year. And those numbers do include the continued cost as
rebuilds and again re-opening stores across our Chilean business. Now Brett and
Doug have also mentioned and we talked about the Coronavirus. In addition to the
comments that you've already heard, let me tell you this that Yuen Tan, our CEO
there and his team are working extraordinarily hard to serve our customers with their
daily needs while at the same time taking every precaution for our customers and for
our associates.
Today, all of our stores remain open, albeit the vast majority of them with restricted
hours and some have got restricted operations. The spirit and determination of our
teams across our stores, our supply chain and in our home oﬃce is remarkable. And
at times like these, our people really do make the diﬀerence. But in certain times,
being a trusted retailer has never been more important and you earn trust -- youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 44 of 91earn trust by standing tall in diﬃcult circumstances, but you also earn it every day by
providing customers access to what they want, when they want it and however they
want it. And by innovating to make their lives easier. For me, this really comes to life
at a local level. And let me give you four examples, strong local businesses who are
doing just that.
I want to start with Walmex, it's one of our longest standing International businesses
and probably one of the best examples of what a strong local business looks like.
Walmex operates around 3,400 stores across Mexico and ﬁve Central American
countries. Last year, its sales were $33 billion and it has an operating margin of over
8%. Listed on the Mexican Bolsa, it has a capitalization of just under $55 billion, and
to put that in context, it's just slightly less than Target's market cap or if you want to
think of it in terms of international retailers, it's more than the cap -- market caps of
Tesco and Carrefour combined. In Mexico itself, our supercenters and Sam's Clubs
adapted for the local customer as well as locally developed discount formats
provides inclusion and access for all demographics.
And in fact, our BeData [ph] formats have reached the remarkable milestone of
2,000 units this year. The proximity and breadth of our formats give us own matched
access, and for example, across Mexico's big cities, 85% of the population live within
10 minutes of a store, that's just one of the factors that's enabled us to deliver comp
sales growth faster than the market there for 20 quarters straight.
But Gill Loureiro and his team are continuing to ﬁnd ways to grow the business by
leveraging our store network to increase access and reach with a growing
omnichannel oﬀer. And I'd share two examples of this that I really like. First is in our
BeData stores. We're installing digital kiosks to serve customers who are looking for
value that may not have easy access to the Internet or the ability to pay in-store. A
customer can shop the full range of Walmart online general merchandise from the
kiosks in the store, pay in the store and pickup from there later. And the average
kiosk purchase is 15 times the average ticket in store. It's simple, it's eﬀective and it's
truly inclusive.
The second example of expanding reach is in our supercenters where we've
expanded pickup and same-day delivery options for online grocery. Last year, the
team trialed 12,000 general merchandise items picked in store available for same-
day delivery in addition to the 33,000 grocery items that are already available. That
expanded range is now live in a 167 of our supercenters and we have plans to add
more by the end of the year. Moving forward, Walmex will build on its foundations
developing its ecosystem, for example, through its Cashi payments app to expand
customer access and loyalty.
But let me turn next to China. Similar to Walmex, Walmart China's foundations are
built on a successful local adaptation of the Walmart and Sam's Club formats. Today,
Walmart China is a $10 billion business with a quarter of those sales -- over a quarter
of those sales coming from Sam's Clubs. We're fortunate enough to have a well-
established brand with 26 clubs with strong brand equity. We opened three clubs
there last year, and we plan to open ﬁve more clubs annually going forward. Now inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 45 of 91FY20 Sam's Club China delivered its second consecutive year of double-digit comp
growth. And a little known fact is that our highest sales club or store anywhere in the
Walmart world is actually our Shenzhen Club which is located close to our home
oﬃce.
Now, we're really pleased with that level of growth. We recognize there is a need for
continuous and innovation to accelerate accessibility. Land is at a premium, but
we're ﬁnding asset light ways to supplement our bricks and mortar with new
infrastructure that improves our ability to engage with members digitally.
The heart of our omnichannel expansion has been Sam's mini fulﬁllment centers,
which we are calling Cloud Depots. Think of this as low cost mini distribution notes
in high-density urban areas which extend online access to our members for about
thousand at that most frequently purchased products. Their set up with the crowd
sourced delivery last mile partner Dada and that allows customers and members to
receive that orders in less than 1 hour. But the good news is that members still love
visiting our clubs, but the clouds enable more frequent shopping mission, and today,
we've got about 60 of them with plans for many more in the future.
Let me show you brieﬂy, how they work? (Video Presentation)
So omnichannel is critical for Sam's in China, and today around 30% of our
membership, shops both online and oﬄine and encouragingly for us the renewal
rights for those members are higher than the average. Sam's Club China is a great
example of taking one of our formats, and building such strong local business
through strong roots tailored to the local customer.
So, I've covered now two of our longest standing international markets. Let me move
to perhaps our two most recently added Flipkart and PhonePe. We made our
investment there 18 months ago, and we continue to be impressed by the business,
both with the teams, their strong culture and the way that they operate, right. I've
been to India ﬁve times last year, and I never seized to be amazed by the energy, the
spirit and the entrepreneurship[ph] of the folks in our businesses. Now, just as a
reminder, the Group consists of the Flipkart eCommerce business, which includes
Myntra, which is separate fashion platform, and PhonePe, a digital platform anchored
in payments.
At the last Investor Day, I talked to you about Flipkart. I'm going to give you a brief
update on that today, but also talk to you a little bit more about PhonePe as well.
We've been really pleased with Flipkart's performance, and Brett has even given me
permission to share a few numbers with you at today's event.
I can tell you that the health of the platform is strong. Engagement with Flipkart is
continuing to grow as Indian customers become more and more comfortable with
eCommerce, and the access and aﬀordability that it's providing. Flipkart is now
tracking to over 1 billion visits per month. And last year monthly active customers
grew by around 45%, and transactions per customer increased by 30%. What I reallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 46 of 91love is that Flipkart's heritage puts the Indian customer right at the very heart of the
business. Their strategy is simple, it's democratize shopping by oﬀering aﬀordability,
and access and they're using technology and data to solve every day customer
problems in ways that are tailored speciﬁcally for the Indian market.
They're launching things like innovations such as voice assisted transactions, and
vernacular capabilities in Hindi. That helps drive further adoption in tier 2 cities,
which are at the very heart of middle India. They are also oﬀering trade-in programs
in which we buyback customers all devices and appliances when they purchase new
ones. We also then refurbish those devices, and oﬀer them to resale creating real
value throughout the supply chain. They also look to oﬀer value added services
including demonstration and installation for large appliances. Only 10% of families in
India own smart TV, a washing machine or an air conditioner, and when they are sold
on our platform we use delivery as a moment to help teach customers, and give
them conﬁdence in how to use those new products. That in turn drives conﬁdence in
Flipkart.
And to help aﬀordability for customers Flipkart provides access to credit including
Buy now, pay later, low cost installment credit, and this year, launched a co-branded
credit card with Axis Bank. Now in addition to those customer facing innovations
Flipkart continuing to use data and insights to ﬁnd new revenue streams such as
through digital advertising, which grew strongly year-on-year. There a combination
of high quality data, unique customer behavioral insights and a powerful tech
platform mean that ad placement is speciﬁc and accurate, and that in itself creates
value for advertisers, but it very importantly it protects the customer experience.
Flipkart's ambition is to set the next 100 million customers, and I love the fact that
Kalyan, our CEO and the team continue to put the building blocks in place to do just
that. But now let me talk about PhonePe. PhonePe's ambition is to be India's largest
transaction platform anchored in payments. They build scale by oﬀering person to
person money transfer (inaudible), expanding use cases with merchants, and then
adding services for customers to grow their M&A all in a single app.
PhonePe's DNA is to build open and intelligent platforms. It's an open ecosystem for
customers, merchants and banks with the tech capabilities to automate and scale
eﬃciency.That DNA is actually what's key to PhonePe remarkable journey. This
business is just three years old, and in that time it's grown to almost 200,000
registered users 20 million of them are using the app on a daily basis and in total,
those users are making more than 500 million monthly transactions.
Today, that's generating about $180 billion in annualized TPV or Total Payments
Value. But PhonePe's has also expanded to merchants. 18 months ago when I ﬁrst
went to PhonePe they were accepted by about 30,000 merchants in India. Today
they're accepted by 10 million from (inaudible) and pop stores to fast food chains
and to rideshares. People like using PhonePe. Well, as a 90% of daily customers
repeat within 30 days. The customers using that increased scale combined data
science to reduce costs. One example is that more than 90% -- reduction in cost per
transaction and person to person in recharge category.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 47 of 91But PhonePe is not stopping there. The team is relentlessly innovative. In January
alone they had four new product releases. And one of those, I really like is PhonePe
ATM product. It's a revolutionary solution, it's got the potential to transform access to
cash in India. A customer can now request to cash withdrawal directly from their
bank on their PhonePe App. Go to a merchant that's local to them, that merchant will
then verify the transaction on their app and give them the cash that they've
requested. The service is available today, and over 1 million stores across the
PhonePe network. When you think about it, there are only 200,000 ATMs today in
the whole of India.
So this product just scaled the capability to withdraw cash for customers by ﬁve
times. It's a win for customers, the merchants and the banks. Sameer and Rahul, the
CEO and CTO and the founders of the PhonePe, are building a business that
continues to learn as it grows. And you're going to hear more about PhonePe and
the creation of its powerful super app from Karthik on the panel later.
But I'm going to leave you with it. That having it's core PhonePe is a massive open
transactions platform. It's took the business it's ﬁrst two years of life to reach the 1
billion transactions mark, but last year it crossed 5 billion transactions. We've really
excited about its future. So not only do those four business I've talked about
continue to grow, but we continue to learn from them as well and to share best
practice across our markets.
Their great examples all of them, a strong local businesses which earn trust by
consistently delivering value by providing customers access to what they want
tailored to how they want it. And they remain at the forefront of innovations that
make the customer's lives easier. Our businesses make up a strong global portfolio,
and we continue to be thoughtful about how to position each to be as successful as
possible.
Now, that means we avoid a rigid approach to ownership. And we leverage strategic
partnerships wherever they can make our business stronger. In some cases we're a
majority owner in others we're a minority partner. Our businesses can be private or
public, a path for strategic collaboration with strong partners such as Rakuten,
Advent, JD or Dada.
Before you ask, I have nothing new on this to tell you today. Success in this
environment for us depends on having a multi-local approach. And I hope you've
seen our businesses everywhere look very diﬀerent in diﬀerent markets. What's really
exciting in the way that we move forward is being powered by Walmart becomes a
reality. From adapting formats and sharing best practices and developing talent to
sharing and building and innovation of culture. What I can tell you is that our
business is changing, along with the expectations of our customers everywhere that
we operate.
This year, one out of every $8 of international revenue will come from eCommerce. In
every market, our customers are pivoting to the future faster than ever before, andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

{BIO 20989984 <GO>}
Good morning, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to talk to you
about Sam's Club and why we remain excited about the direction of our business. So
I've been involved for just under 100 days, and I've spent dozens of hours talking to
our associates and our members to ﬁnd out what's working in Sam's Club and what's
not. And a few things came through loud and clear. First of all, our associates love
working for Sam's Club; and secondly, our members are passionate about their
Club. And we have real momentum in the business. But what I also learnt is that our
people are ready to do more. Our associates want to get behind great items. They
want to leverage even more technology, and they want to create the best member
experience in the warehouse channel.
And our members passion for Sam's Club means their expectations are higher than
ever. They've paid to shop with us. So they do truly expect something special. So
while there is work to do, I am encouraged by where we are today. We have a strong
business, and we are well positioned to win, but more on that in a bit.
First, let me brieﬂy touch on our results. You heard us talk earlier today about our
fourth quarter and full year results. So for the full year, our comp sales excluding fuel
and tobacco increased by 3.8%, and our eCommerce sales grew by 32%. I'm really
proud of the team for delivering comps of 9.5% on a two-year stack basis. We
continue to be encouraged by our membership trends plus renewals and sign
(inaudible) membership income to grow at 2.5%.
So overall strength of the top line and combined with an increase in membership
income resulted in operating income growth for the full year of 8% including fuel. So
what that means is we achieved a really healthy operating income growth, while at
the same time strategically investing into people, price and technology.
So today, the business is positioned ﬁnancially to continue to provide strong value
and convenience, while transforming the shopping experience for our members,
both in Club and online. And there is a good reason for that strength the Sam's Club
model is pretty simple. And that's why it works. We oﬀer great items at disruptive
prices, and a seamless shopping experience.
That's what drives membership and membership is what drives Sam's Club. This
basic formula is powered by our strategic focus on people, product and digital, as
well as an obsession with serving our target member. A family with an income of
around $100,000 and 2 or 3 kids. So that strategy won't change because it's
working, but member counts and renewal rates are improving. But you will see us
take it up a notch and focus on how people, product and digital come together to
drive a great member experience both in club and online.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 49 of 91We've told our members to expect something special, and we will continue to
deliver on that promise. With our people we fundamentally change the way work
gets done in our clubs to provide a better member experience as well as
opportunities for our associates.
Last year we organized our associates into four working groups member,
merchandising, fresh and specialty to move towards a more team based approach.
We've consolidated our job codes. We've simpliﬁed the work and we have cross
training to ensure every associate complete the basic tasks of each team. So for
example on the member team we no longer have associates who purely run the cash
register instead, we have a front line member associate who knows how to sell
membership, and now just had to work the exit and helping Club picked up.
We've also moved all of our overnight associates to work during the days when our
members are actually shopping with us. And we've raised our hourly wages in more
than a dozen key areas like team leads, meat cutters and cake decorators and we're
seeing improvement in our results with reduced turnover and increased employee
satisfaction. And we're giving associates tools to make their jobs easier.
I was in North Carolina, recently and I spoke to a bunch of associates in a club, and I
said to them what's working in clubs and their answer within unison technology.
Associates now have more information on their mobile device at their ﬁngertips than
ever before, meaning they can spend more time on the sales ﬂoor with our members
serving them. Let's move to product. Sam's Club is an item business. We have
limited SKUs, so it's critical that every single item feel hand selected to delight our
members while delivering value and quality.
Before I talk about some of our speciﬁc products, I want to brieﬂy touch on our
eﬀorts to reduce our SKUs and to further invest into price. As club merchants, it's our
job to ﬁnd the best items and make the right choices for our members. Members
don't come into Sam's Club expecting to ﬁnd everything. They expect to ﬁnd value,
quality or something that they just can't ﬁnd somewhere else. And our members are
busier than ever and they're telling us they have more choices than ever. So can see
the curation a member -- a beneﬁt of membership.
In the past year, we've reduced SKUs in about half of our clubs, and that might seem
kind of counterintuitive, but actually our members give us better marks on breadth
of assortment when we have less SKUs in the club.
Members actually perceive we have more items when we present them with less. It's
good for business too. Our sales are open -- our labor hours are down. So looking
ahead, our plan is to continue to reﬁne our SKU count across the business. The other
component of membership value is of course price. We've invested in price, in a
signiﬁcant number of our clubs. Traﬃc in those clubs is growing and our members
are responding.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 50 of 91We're going to continue to assess price investment and target it over the next year.
Moving to items. We have this great opportunity to make Member's Mark special
and we are. But before I talk about that, I want to talk about some work we've been
doing with our private brands. And I'll share with you two examples of how we
partner with national brands to create unique items.
Our item obsession has led to increased innovation with our suppliers to bring new
products to market, and suppliers are excited to partner because they're sharing in
the growth with us. Let's take a look at our recent collaboration with Kellogg's that
brought Baby Shark Cereals to homes across the country.
(Video Presentation)
Good luck, getting that song out of your head. We brought another example with us,
our delicious popcorn partnership with leading Candy brands. So one of our
merchants ﬁrst discovered Candy Popcorn in an airport. It had no presence in
grocery or mass retail and we worked with the supply to improve the formula and
bring the ﬁrst ﬂavor, Butterﬁnger to the club. Our members loved it, and we've
continue to innovate, every quarter by working with the supply to bring tweaks with
and our latest OREO to market.
Sam's Club has exclusivity on this series for the ﬁrst 13 weeks, and we have more
amazing ﬂavors planned. I hope you enjoyed this some on your table, I hope you
enjoy it as much as our members have actually enjoyed it. Our Member's Mark
brand continues to produce innovative items at a amazing quality and prices, while
strengthening our overall assortment. We know that Member's repurchase Member's
Mark a more likely to renew with us. So we'll continue to invest in the brand across
the box.
Last year alone, we improved 383 items, and launched 334 new products. Take our
updated of Patio sets, for example. Jonathan Odell is a Senior Merchant, who
worked with Member's Mark team to completely reinvent our product line to appeal
more to our target member.
John has deep experience in the outdoor category, and he knew our members
wanted high quality construction and fabrics at a warehouse club price. All sets are
hand woven by master weavers, who must apprentice for years to earn that title, and
the weaver can take up to 15 hours to complete a single chair to ensure consistency
and durability of craftsmanship.
We also upgraded to some (inaudible) fabrics, which are much more resilient and
resistant to water and fading plus each set comes with the cover that would easily
retail for hundreds of dollars alone. The quality rivals an upscale home furnishing
store with similar sets would retail for about $10,000 or more. At Sam's Club our
members pay less than $2,000.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 51 of 91We've also made signiﬁcant improvements in fresh, which is a key driver for repeat
traﬃc across the Club. You know people are surprised to learn that you can ﬁnd
prime angus beef and Fresh Alaskan Salmon in our clubs. This year we expanded
prime angus beef to all clubs and we're now one of the top retailers in the prime
category. And we've been deepening our relationship with our suppliers to ﬁnd
unique items that can't be found anywhere else. Our Grape soda Grape is a great
example. Before I tell you about the product, I want to share a little bit about the Phil
Macy is one of our Senior Merchants and he has been with Sam's Club for 27 years,
always in our fresh business. For the last several years he has been focused on
buying grapes and stone fruits. Phil truly an expert in his ﬁeld and he travels to Spain,
Chile, Israel as well as working domestically through nurseries to identify the next
best thing for our members.
And you know what, this is no quick process. It can take up to 12 years to develop a
new variety and a lot of taste testing. Phil estimated that he probably tastes about
500 grapes a year, that's a lot of grapes. Phil was behind the creation of the Cotton
Candy Grape in 2017. And he worked with the same nursery in California to perfect
the taste and texture of the grape soda variety.
Sam's Club has a trademark on the name, and exclusivity with the grower. We sold
the grapes, soda grapes in select clubs last summer for two weeks and we are
planning to expand to more clubs this year. So while we becoming known for the
quirk and unexpected, our members are also talking about the quality too. Our fresh
net promoter score has improved every quarter this year with a 230 basis point
increase overall.
Now let's turn our focus to digital. Technology gives us the opportunity to empower
our associates and our members, it simpliﬁes work for the associate and removes
friction for members and enhances the overall experience of membership. You
probably, I hope you're familiar with Scan and Go. I believe it is one of the most
delightful experiences, we oﬀer our members at Sam's Club.
It's a great example of how we value members time and put control in their hands.
Think of the typical shopping experience, as a member moves through the club he's
mentally purchasing each item he puts into the cart. In fact he probably feels like
they're already his own, but then we ask him to stand in line to bring up those items.
Scan and Go ﬂips the scenario. It removes the friction and empowers our members
to own their shopping experience from beginning to end. With Scan and Go
members can scan an items barcode with their phones as they shop and then skip
the checkout line and pay through the app. And members value the experience.
We're seeing a repeat usage rate of about 85%. We're going to continue to innovate
with Scan and Go, and you're going to learn a little bit more about that during the
tech panel.
New implementations of technology, a great for associates too. You'll hear more later
during the tech panel about Ask Sam, but I want to talk to you now that Sam'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Page 52 of 91Garage. You heard Doug mentioned, Sam's Garage before, but I want to talk about
how it's driving sales. So Sam's Garage is a new application that's driving our tire
and battery business. Associates who work in time and battery centers in the past,
had to navigate bulky product works and massive paper works and ﬁve systems to
simply sell products and schedule installation for members. Sam's Garage
streamlines all of that into one single app, an average transaction time has dropped
from about 20 minutes to less than 5 minutes, and it's improving sales. So when we
combine the convenience of Sam's Garage with disruptive pricing during a recent
one day event, we saw a 55% increase in transactions.
Sam's Club continues to focus on emerging tech and pilot new ways to simplify the
business, which has in the use of computer vision to curb out of stocks and exit
technology that can help reduce theft. We even have drones ﬂying around in some
of our clubs to help better manage inventory, especially items, housed upon in this
deal.
And at Sam's Club now in Dallas, we're testing an enhancement to Scan and Go
called Item Vision. Members can point their camera at a product added to their
digital shopping cart, no searching for barcodes, the image of the item is all a
member needs to make the shopping experience even faster than ever. So these
innovations on in all clubs yet, but we think all of them have the potential to impact
Sam's Club and enhance the overall experience for members and associates.
Shopping with Sam's Club should be seamless, and we have to be relentless about
removing friction and providing an omnichannel experience. We give our members
choice and convenience no matter, how they want to shop with us, options like Scan
and Go, Same day Club pickup, grocery delivery and direct-to-home shipping, and
remember direct-to-home shipping is oﬀered free with our plus membership with no
minimums for most items.
Part of our membership story is a huge growth we're seeing online. Our members
love SamClub.com. Online sales at Sam's grew by 32% last year, which includes both
Club pickup and direct-to-home sales. We successfully converted several former
clubs to fulﬁllment centers to make our direct-to-home oﬀering faster and more
eﬀective, while also reducing the cost to ship.
We've also recently started testing ship from Club for eCommerce orders. This test is
in about 22 clubs and we're really happy with the early results. We're adding
membership value through our website too with features like travel and
entertainment, and home improvement services that have saved our members
million since launching earlier this year. And we've just added this personalized
perks portal, so members can see their individualized savings piling up.
Our focus on the target member and the value of the Sam's Club membership is
working. We're seeing growth in total member counts, and renewal rates. Plus
member penetration rates continue to see positive results, hitting an all time high
during FY '20 and improving 170 basis points over the last year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Suresh KumarWe expect more positive membership trends as we continue to improve in Club and
online experience for our members while enhancing the value of their membership. I
want to wrap up by highlighting a few key things I hope you all took away from
today. First, the changes we've made to simplify the business have made us stronger.
Our total member count, renewal rates and plus member penetration rates are
growing and our traﬃc numbers and comp sales excluding fuel and tobacco
remained healthy.
Secondly, we're in item business and we will continue to focus on bringing
innovative products at amazing quality and value to our clubs. Thirdly, Sam's Club
remains an innovation hub driven by associates and technology, we are developing
tools to make shopping and working at Sam's easier and more delightful than ever.
And ﬁnally, the focus on the target member is working and we will continue to push
toward a more omnichannel experience that empowers our member.
Today Sam's Club is a great business and we're tremendously pleased with the
progress we've made, but I know we're even more excited about where we're
headed and the opportunities we see in the future. We tell our members to expect
something special, and that's a promise I know, we can give keep. Thank you.

Great, thank you, Kath. So we'll have a 15-minute break as we transition to our

mentioned earlier, we have a innovation panel that we're introducing to the program
this year, and we'll kick it oﬀ with Doug and Suresh. And I'll let you take the lead on.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, we're going to take a few minutes and try to give you some examples of
innovation that's happening, that are happening across the company and we'll try to
do that with some speed and maybe talk a little bit about how it's happening as well.
I mentioned earlier that we've been innovating and operating on top of a legacy
tech stack that as you would imagine, through our acquisitions as we've grown
internationally and built a business historically ends up being a series of systems and
it needs to be simpliﬁed and modernized, as we do that we'll ﬁnd our way towards
more speed, more innovation and more productivity. And Suresh Kumar who I brieﬂy
introduced earlier joined us in July, came from Google. He's a type of leader who
can lead that type of investment, and lead it well and we're really excited to have
you.
Suresh, if you would start oﬀ with kind of that big picture question. Let's talk a little
bit about what it means to modernize the technology that we have at Walmart today.

Doug McMillonAbsolutely. So few pieces. Hiring the right talent, creating the right structures, and
then creating the right architecture that will allow us to incorporate new
technologies, whether it is vision or voice. These are the things that will allow us to
develop innovative solutions on behalf of our customers or for our associates.
Now we have great engineers. We have great data scientists, and other
technologies. We are creating structures to make them even more eﬀective, so that
they can drive leverage and reuse. We are creating deeper expertise, in areas like
machine learning and the cloud. And in terms of architecture, the cloud is at the
center of everything that we are doing. But we have not just taking our old legacy
complex applications and simply just moving them to the cloud, we are rebuilding
them so that they can take advantage of what the cloud really has to oﬀer.
So for example, in the store associates, while building applications to be cloud native
we can incorporate things like voice assistance into them. And this is something that
the legacy architecture would never allow us to be able to do. And so these are
some of the ways, in which we can go faster and be a lot more innovative.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I'm excited about the plan, and I'm excited about doing it faster. Let's go deeper into
the architecture and talk a bit more about what a hybrid cloud actually means, what it
means at Walmart?
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Absolutely. So we have built out a large and sophisticated cloud on which we are
building all the modern stack in the modern applications. So we have got a private
cloud that we have installed inside our data centers. We are partnering with public
cloud providers, and we are building out it's computing in our stores. So this
combination is a hybrid cloud architecture that is uniquely suited for what we want.
So, we can take workloads and we can move them seamlessly from the private cloud
to public cloud to make use of the ﬂex capacity when we need, this is something that
we did very eﬀectively last holiday season.
We can make use of the specialized compute capabilities that the public cloud
oﬀers, so that we can run our complex workloads, whether it is training machine
learning models, Big Data, these things run very eﬀectively on the public cloud. And
then ﬁnally, we can take our applications and use the edge, that we are building out
to move them closer to where our associates and our customer are inside the store,
so that we can improve the customer experience.
So it is, these three pieces that are coming together that form the underpinning of
the modern stack that we're building out.

Page 55 of 91Suresh KumarI hope this is starting to connect some dots for you. We want to get faster, we want to
get more innovative. We know we can use technology to be more productive and in
today's accounting world a lot of the tech that we build is more on the OpEx side
than the CapEx side. So we mentioned earlier, in our guidance, we've got this
increased investment in technology that in a period of years we can position
ourselves to be even stronger and better. It's one of the governors that we can use
as we manage earnings, how fast do we go? Does this happen in two years, three
years, four years? It's not a lot more than that, but it's also not in a year. So it's one of
the variables that you might keep in mind as you think about the guidance that we
gave you earlier.
So, now imagine the tech stacks has been modernized and all these emerging
technologies are now available to us to serve customers in diﬀerent ways and you
hear about all these various things, Marc mentioned, some of them earlier today
which ones do you think are most relevant and practical to move the needle for
Walmart?
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Absolutely. So, we are already incorporating a lot of the many emerging
technologies, and new technologies, whether it is IoT, Internet of Things, blockchain,
voice, vision, robotics and so on. But there is one technology that I'm particularly
excited about because it has relevance and pretty much every single thing that we
do, and that's Machine Learning, or ML. So with ML we can improve our customer
experience. We can make our associates life's a lot easier and we can reduce costs
by driving more eﬃciency.
So, let me give one example, this is a project that we call Smart Substitutions. So
imagine that you are an associate, and you're picking items on behalf of our
customers inside the store and as you are picking items, you'll ﬁnd that one of the
items, that the customer wants, just went out of stock it happens occasionally. So at
this time you want to go ﬁnd an alternate product, a substitute if you would, to oﬀer
to our customers, so that they don't get disappointed.
This used to be very error-prone [ph] manual it was a very diﬃcult task. In fact, our
associates used to have a piece of printed paper with a bunch of rules written on
them. So that they could go ﬁnd out what is the best substitute for that particular
product. Well, this is where we leverage the ML to come and help. We train the
model that extracted information from about the products that we sell in further
relationships between them combine that with customer preferences.
Now the result is that we automatically ﬁgure out the best substitute and we direct
our associates to go pick that, associates are very happy. They will not -- they don't
need to stop, what they're doing and go on to trying to hunt for the product, but
equally important, our customers are very happy because the product, that the
machine learning algorithm picks up is unique personalize for what the customer
wants, in that particular instance and so this is the power of ML that we want to
leverage everywhere in what we do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Suresh KumarThere's a lot of focus on the accuracy of ﬁrst time pick rate, but when we have to do
a substitution it needs to be as seamless as possible. So we'll try to eliminate them
and then the ones that we have will make better. Let's wrap up with data Walmart's
used information for a long time to help us within stock replenishment, our suppliers
have been very helpful in helping us manage information that we've had, but we've
never really focused on customer data to the maximum of our capability and there
are other places where we can monetize and use data more eﬀectively personalize
the experience for customers et cetera.
How do you view the opportunity in front of us as it relates to data?
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Absolutely. So Walmart is unique like I said, we have over 216 [ph] million people
walking into our stores every week, around the world. That gives us a huge, set of
information from which we can draw insights to help serve our customers even
better and that's something that we want to do, that we are committed to doing. But
we want to do that in a way that is extremely mindful of the trust that they place on
us. I talked about personalization, I talked about machine learning. Let me give you
another example, which is online grocery pickup. This is something that our
customers love to -- love as a future because they can book a slot, drive up and we
have the product loaded of into their vehicle. Nobody wants to wait for too long.
They don't want to wait for the slot and they don't want to wait inside. So this is
where data helps, right. So we looked at the data around how the slots are getting
booked, and we predicting which slots are going to get ﬁlled up soon, put that in
front of the customer, so that they could select with slot it is, that could work best for
them.
Similarly, we started looking at not just customer information, but we also started
getting data around how our stores are actually functioning, what the parking lot
looks like, and we combine that information and data surrounding the stores, traﬃc
patterns, construction, and so on. The result is that we can predict very very
accurately when a particular customer is actually going to show up for that pickup
order, meaning that now we can serve them just in time. Times go down, customers
are happy, but it also ends up creating a ﬂywheel eﬀect where the better we serve
our customers, the more deeply engaged they are with us, and that gives us more
opportunity to serve them even better.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Got it. Suresh, really excited about your leadership glad you're here at Walmart.
We're not going to wait to keep driving innovation until all of this work is done.

what if we could take one of the pain points or friction points in shopping, the
checkout lines and avoided altogether by giving people a point of sale, right on the
mobile phone they're already carrying. So they worked on this in late 2016 launched
it and members fell in love with the product instantly ahead very highly rated high

we added that over the course of this year.

Did that come up at about 5 PM on one day or all the time, we have Sundae's [ph]

in the core experience. So we integrated it into one app the Sam's Club app if you
went to the iOS store today it's 4.9 star, it's members just have the best things to say
about it. So they continue to push the envelope on innovation what they're working
on now is how do we eliminate the need to even scan the actual barcode.
So we've talked about Sam's Club now which is our tech innovation club in Dallas
and there we're doing a test where you just point the camera at the item and it
recognize it. So you just hold it over the avocados and it says -- Barcode or anything.
{BIO 16436526 <GO>}
No and it says would you like to add the avocados. They go right to the bag and
people look at that and they think, well that's like magic. That's really cool and that's

was like magic, that's a home run.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We've talked a lot about our Sam today, but I would appreciate if you could go
deeper into how that product was built. And when we get excited because we think
about all these footsteps associates all over our clubs and stores running all over the
place to get information and how eﬃcient it is it's been fun to see how ask Sam has
taken hold at Sam's. How did that story come about? How do you build something
like that?

Yeah, you know, it's interesting (inaudible) and John always talked about how do we
make sure that our associates can be on the ﬂoor helping our members, all the time.
We never want them to have to go get data in the backroom et cetera. And how do
we make, it really easy that we come to work at Sam's Club. It's very intuitive how to
work there. So, we thought well, if we could just take a voice assistant and have you
talked in the phone and let answer common questions like, how do I cut a rib eye
steak or how many plus [ph] members have we signed up today, that would make it
really easy.
So that's what we did. Take a look at this video of our associates using ask Sams.

Doug McMillonYeah, Spark is our in-house delivery platform and basically, which -- it uses cloud
source, drivers, basically what you do is, you go to drive4spark.com, you can sign up
to make deliveries, you have to pass a few checks, of course, so, but you pass a
couple of checks and you can download the app. In the app will tell, take everything
you need to do to complete a successful delivery. So if you're in -- I don't know, New
Orleans or Nashville on vacation and you need to make a little extra money, we can
help you out. You can go to Drive 4 Spark and we can put you at work, but it giving
us a lot of ﬂexibility. It's going to give us some ﬂexibility to understand the Indian use
of delivery, more options to serve our customers. And as you know, Doug, for over
the last couple of years, we've been expanding we've launched and really scaled our
same-day grocery delivery, and we've used last mile delivery partners to help us with
that.
So, if you think about Spark it can help us provide ﬂexibility and some learnings. So
that's, it will be really positive.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Just one of the ways, we'll solve last mile. Because we're working on autonomous

we're working on that. Thank you both very much. Appreciate you coming up. I will
invite a couple of more folks to come up.
Karthik Raghupathy leads Strategic Development and Business Development for
PhonePe. Karthik and Kathleen McLaughlin, our Chief Sustainability Oﬃcer. Karthik,
I'll start with you. We've covered PhonePe to some extent, but you've been there for
a -- the beginning and you understand this better than anybody else. In your own
words, how would you describe PhonePe to this group?
{BIO 19795229 <GO>}
So Doug, we are a technology company. And we are on a mission to unlock the ﬂow
of money and access to services. So in Hindi PhonePe quite literally means on the
phone. And we use the English connotation of the word Pay to create that
connection with everything to do with money on the phone.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Got it. So there is a use case that starts with payment in India and then it expands
from there. We've all seen what happened with WeChat and how Tencent led that.
These use cases as they grow, did they result in what some people call a super app?
{BIO 19795229 <GO>}

Karthik RaghupathyAnticipated that one.
{BIO 19795229 <GO>}
(Video Presentation) So the short answer to your question, Doug is yes. But in a much
more broad and powerful sense than the traditional notion of a super app. So at
PhonePe, we are driven by technology to oﬀer everyone an equal opportunity to
access money and services. And speciﬁcally, we think this manifest in three
dimensions of what we would call a super app, consumers, merchants and banks. So
ﬁrstly, on the consumer side, we believe in enabling equal access regardless of
location or socioeconomic status and we take great pride in the fact that more than
65% of our nearly 200 million users are from small towns and villages all over India. I
think this is a testament to the power of technology to really democratize access. So
secondly, on the merchant side, we work with about 10 million merchants. the
majority of whom are small and medium enterprises and we are actively working on
driving their growth by connecting them to our consumer network.
So, for example as Judith mentioned earlier, we recently launched the PhonePe ATM
which is a revolutionary ﬁrst in market innovation, that is totally transformed the ATM
landscape in India. It's simultaneously solves for a consumer paying point to have
access to ATM while also driving more footfall to our merchant partners and thereby
drives their growth.
And then thirdly on the banking side, when you connect consumers and merchants
together money lies at the heart of this intersection and all our used cases are aimed
at unlocking the ﬂoor money. So PhonePe users can use us to transfer money to each
other, to pay their bills, to spend money both at online and oﬄine merchant and
manage and grow their money using ﬁnancial product like gold, insurance and
mutual funds.
So yes, we are a super app.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Got it. So some people might be a little confused about the ATM reference. Actually
what's happening is India's generation skipping ATMs.

That's another example of how innovation is occurring in India and innovations
occurring within Walmart, we're really excited about PhonePe that's why we've talked
about it so much today, but we're just as excited about Flipkart, Myntra and the way
this as I've mentioned to you in our last meeting the way these pieces ﬁt together to
create a mutually reinforcing ecosystem is super interesting --, business models are
changing. The retail business model has changed and is changing and we're
learning a lot due to from what's happening in India and applying that across the
company in an increasing way and really appreciate of you and the team. Please
thank everybody for us.
It might surprise you to know that in my job sometimes things get announced at
Walmart that I've never heard of until I've read about them in the news. I know that's
not supposed to be the case, I'm supposed to hear about everything internally. But
actually today there is so much happening across the company that it's true that
we're solving problems and innovating in ways that I haven't heard about sometimes
until I've read about it and actually love that. Now I try to be careful not to ask too
many questions when that's the case, because it will slow people down and they'll
want to clear everything with leadership and we don't want them to do that. We have
common values, we have a culture, you know what problems you need to go solve
and go solve the problems. That's an important ingredient as it relates to speed. So
when we were talking about telling you some innovation stories in tech stories, it was
exciting for me to hear Kathleen McLoughlin her story and what her team has been
doing to take technology and put it to work to tackle some of the biggest problems
we face as humans. Kathleen as a global shaper as it relates to thought leadership
and policy and we're really thankful that she's part of Walmart helping us all become
Chief Sustainability Oﬃcers. And if you would Kathleen tell them about how we're
deploying to tech to help with things like climate change?
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Yeah, well, climate is one of the biggest issues that we face in the whole
environmental and social landscape and what we're trying to do at Walmart is take
issues that are relevant for our business for our customers, our associates,
communities and address them through our business assets in a way that not only
helps the world move quicker to transform to address these issues, but it's also good
for business and climate is a great example.
We've been working, Doug as you well know, since 2005 in earnest on our own
emissions from operations, we've doubled ﬂeet eﬃciency, we're on our way to 50%
renewable energy, powering all of our stores. We're working on energy eﬃciency on
refrigerants, all of these things, but of course for a retailer and in the consumer
goods industry in general 90% of the emissions are not in retail operations. They're
in the supply chain.
And it's things like agriculture, waste food, waste packaging waste, they design the
consumer products themselves, deforestation and things like this. So a couple ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 64 of 91Doug McMillonyears back, we set a Science Based Target for emissions reduction. We were, I think
the ﬁrst retailer to do so, and we said okay scope one, scope two, we've got it
question is how do we tackle all of those emissions in the supply chain. So we
launched an eﬀort called Project Gigaton which is powered by a digital platform to
help our suppliers engage and work with us to accelerate emissions reduction all
across supply chains.
And there is three things that are pretty exciting about it. One is it science-based, but
it's very practical. So we worked with World Wildlife Fund, with Environmental
Defense Fund to develop a bunch of super practical interventions that suppliers can
take in supply chains and translate them through calculators into emissions
reduction. So it's very easy for people to engage in this and get started, and start
working on emissions reduction.
Second thing is because of that it democratize access Karthik, you talked about this,
that's a theme that runs throughout Walmart. We want to democratize access to
things and this is no diﬀerent. We now have 2,300 suppliers working on this signed
up working on initiatives to reduce emissions and I think you mentioned this earlier,
Doug, we're over 200 million metric tons of emissions avoided is actually north of
250 at this point, just a couple of years in. So that's great, well on our way to that
Gigaton target.
And the third thing is the way we set it up with the platform and incentives and help
for supply it's a bit of an escalator in terms of ambition and impact. Right. So people
can come in, it's very easy to get started. But then we ratchet them up in terms of
their own ambition and what they're able to achieve. So we've got incentives from
what we call Giga-Gurus. These are upto 2300 suppliers the hundreds that have
smart goals, that have reported results and so on. And we're excited about that
because it allows us to keep the standards high of what does it really mean to be
making progress on this, but have a broad (inaudible) to get people in and move
them up that escalator toward that goal.
We just received an A from CDP on climate action, which are really proud about, I
think it makes us one of, I don't know, 30 companies out of 8000 that submitted to
CDP to get that score. So I'd just say watch the space, you know we're going to
continue to innovate here and with our whole ESG agenda to try to drive impact in a
way that really does create value as well for business.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I mentioned earlier, this idea of business serving multi stakeholders, I think you gave
us several good examples of how reaching out to suppliers or thinking about the
planet or communities is actually really good business because eliminating waste
helps us fulﬁll our purpose of saving people money so they can live better and
sometimes that waste takes the form of carbon, sometimes it's plastics and we're
trying to work across the whole system. These systems thinkers and drive an overall
optimization of our business model, not a sub-optimization. And I hope through
these examples you can see that culturally we weren't there, our mindsets there andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

I, there is a lot of collaboration. We spend a lot of time working together, thinking
about how we serve customers, whether it's in-store, pick up, channels and really the
lines are pretty blurry between eCommerce stores and how we think about omni.
And what I'm most excited about and energized by is thinking about putting the
customer at the center and then building everything in our ecosystem around the
needs of the customer and then between all of our businesses and the tools that
we've got available being able to serve the customer. Anyway they want to be
served, whether it's at home or direct-to-home, the refrigerator other services like
health and wellness. So thinking about it for us as we look forward, it's all about the
customer, ﬁnding ways that we can create new ways for growth and then layer on top
of it innovation that works across all the channels. But I'm really excited about the
work we've been doing.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yeah, I know, as John said, the lines are blurred. We think about the business is, one
is one US business and like John said, there is one customer at the center. We've
been on a journey now the last couple of years. We brought in the Chief Customer
Oﬃcer, Janey and brought the customer altogether. We recently brought together
the supply chain under Greg Smith. And so the (inaudible) are starting to come
together and I think it's working well both the Chief Customer Oﬃcer and Greg went
in supply chain, it's really helped us create a real true end-to-end omni experience
and I think merchandise is sort of the next area that we're focused on and looking at
right now, but even still underneath the people running both areas of eCom and
stores like the GMs, of those businesses are working very closely together more so
than ever before I think.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
In the late '90s, I was the General Merchandise Manager for electronics, books,
sporting goods, stationery and some other categories and could see what was
happening with eCommerce with e toys and Amazon starting to sell books and
those kinds of changes and going way back then we were even thinking about
spinning out Walmart.com and having it be a separate entity separate from Walmart
to create speed and the investment. From the late '90s all the way through until kind
of these last few years, I've seen ﬁts and starts with Walmart, trying to get really
committed to e-Commerce and make it happen, and would love to do some of that
over again if we could do it over again and kept some separation between stores
and eCommerce, because I had seen a large proﬁtable established business in large
and small ways diminish the emerging business, if I can call it that and Clay
Christensen's [ph] both the innovator's dilemma inﬂuence me a lot and having hadFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Page 67 of 91Edward James Yruma
Unidentiﬁed Speakerconversations with him and read the book and studied it. I concluded. We got to
keep this separate for a little while. But the issue is the customer keeps pulling it
together. They want one experience for the brand. And so what we've got to have as
we got to have a leadership team that gets omni and believes in omni and supports
the whole thing people that work in e-commerce that want to help stores people
who work in stores that want to help e-commerce and over time, this ends up being
one business and one thing.
So, Marc mentioned the customer -- in the supply chain or there'll be other changes
that come along. But we've got a set ourselves up, so that the whole thing can
innovate and move with speed in omni fashion, and I really do appreciate how
everybody has worked together these last few years, but there is a whole another
gear to get to make this happen in a faster way and I think it's time to really this next
year and maybe a little bit beyond kind of ﬁnish that oﬀ and have one omni still with
a great diverse team thinking about how we solve these problems. But in the end,
one customer proposition that seamless and you asked about what does that unlock
looking ahead, we just think about how easy. We can make it to do merchandise
returns when somebody wants to do a merchandise returns. Now think about how
we can connect our payment. I think about how we can use data when we have one
version of the customer.
We know who they are, and we know what they've consumed across the channels,
there are lots of little unlocks that will occur as we get even better at that and I'm
really excited about it. (inaudible) I think even across formats. Because I'm thinking
about my member base. What are the things that John doing really well with Mark
that we can then import across to Sam.
So if you think about even what you're doing with spot delivery. I mean that is great
as we are leading into ship from Club. So I think as you think about your format, what
are those things that we're working in other formats from an omni perspective that
you can just steal and go fast way? Next to Ed, on the far side.

Hi, thanks. This is Ed Yruma, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Quick question for you guys,

I think the ﬁrst one that I would speak about is, are the initiatives in health care and it

it 5,000 communities all around for just the second gives us an interesting ability to
be able to help a lot of customers with the things that they need another area when
they're in the store and they need to or on the website and they want to ﬁnance an

{BIO 3131258 <GO>}
Just a question on the Walmart --it's Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Question on the
Walmart apparel oﬀering, you know some of the learnings from December, but as
you think about the mix of business opening price points versus brands, I'd be
curious to hear from both you guys, if you could talk about the importance of brand
and apparel in the mix and like what you're doing online with branded apparel,
being able to maybe move some of it into the stores and sort of how you're working
together on making the apparel business better?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Traditionally, the way that, the merchants would think about apparel is, and I
mentioned this earlier, is called that the Fashion Pyramid, we've got basics, fashion
basics then we've got fashion at the top of it and in-store assortment, in the last year
or so, it's been focused at the lower end of that even at point where we need to
expand up, but having an aligned team between the (inaudible) and the Bentonville
working together, we can use the website for diﬀerent things that we can use the
stores for and they'll complement each other.
And I think, it's important to just, think of that thread that goes from the fashion
business into the basics and then there are diﬀerent items that we can share across
and others that, you may be able to do online that we don't do in the store.
Yeah, for example, SCOOP. It's a great example of Soﬁa Vergara, both those brands,
were online, ﬁrst and now in stores and we see that trend continuing. There are
opportunities for branded assortment that we create that's proprietary going into
across.com and stores.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think both home and apparel are examples of the two teams, working closely
together and then they can extend assortments in ways that they couldn't own their
own, and home we're talking about apparel but home in particular has had a lot of
success early. And Anthony and Jeﬀ, the two people that lead the business have

We've go to Chris next, and then Michael Lasser after that.
{BIO 7499419 <GO>}
Thanks. Chris Horvers, JP Morgan. Can you talk about the fulﬁlled by Walmart vision
a little bit more? How much of this is the tails of the assortment versus say that ﬁrst 1
million SKUs that you've talked about that drive 80% of all the transactions. Is this
sort of a recognition that, you're not getting the coverage as fast as you want or
maybe you're not getting the access to the brands as quickly as you want and this
just broadly, what's the puts and takes of 1P versus 3P?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah, Walmart for women services is a critical part of our strategy. You mentioned,
it's deﬁnitely brought it in assortment. So there are a merchants on third-party that
we want to have that simply don't have fulﬁllment capabilities, and so we're not able
to get that assortment on the website.
So that's really the ﬁrst priority is to really focus on those brands and getting
assortment for customers also just having the stuﬀ in our warehouse, allows us to
oﬀer a better customer experience, it allows us to co-mingle the product in the same
box when we ship it out with ﬁrst-party which helps the economics. So there's lots of
reasons to like the business. We're feeling good about the start, we've built the
technology. We've got a handful of sellers using it, they like it. We're seeing good
results. But it's something that we're going to take slowly, make sure it's right before
we really blow it out.
Just as a follow-up, it seem like initially it was well, if we get coverage up to that 1
million SKUs, we don't necessarily have to go beyond. So I guess what I'm trying
understand is what's changed now that you're doing it was more of like, okay. We're
good at this. Now, when we're moving to the next level or was there something that
you felt like the strategy wasn't addressing?
You know it was always part of the strategy, its just a matter of getting too it. The top
million SKUs is deﬁnitely an area of focus to get those in our warehouse because it
does represent a large percentage of sales, but the goal is still to carry everything.
So we deﬁnitely want to carry everything that a customer might want when they
come to walmart.com.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

1 million or 2 million being ﬁrst party versus everything. We never thought 1P plus 3P
was million or two million SKUs. We were focused on 1P as we were answering those
questions. So it will be a much bigger assortment, when you put 3P with it.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Michael Lasser, UBS. The markets' perception is that Walmart has been on, especially
in the US Walmart has been on been on this journey over the last few years, whether
it's been an investment in price, whether it's been an investment in people and now
the company starting to harvest those returns. So at the same time it's eCommerce
proﬁtability stabilizing such that the totality of the US business. The margin there is
stable and can continue to be stable from here. A, is that a reasonable expectation.
And B, what are the 2 or 3 factors that might have to -- that might arise to motivate
the company to say, we have to make further sizable investments and bring down
our proﬁtability from here.
And then, totally unrelated to that before Kerry takes away the microphone. Have
you won the war against the hard discounters or could the battle reemerge such that
those price gaps are going to shrink and you'll have to as all the (inaudible) just get
bigger and have more stores and you're more competition that we're going to see
ﬂare-ups of that over time. Thank you.
{BIO 20989993 <GO>}
Michael, I'll kick oﬀ. So we look at the kind of the proﬁtability, excuse me, the
proﬁtability of what you saw last year. In particularly the US business and you see the
guidance we've given this year pretty similar. And so I think we feel good about this,
can tag on a little bit. We feel good about that kind of algorithm so to speak for the
Walmart US business. We're always going to invest in the business ﬁrst, and if we see
opportunities for things that we think give us a long-term beneﬁt. I think Doug said
this morning, but might have some short-term pressure. We're going to be upfront
with you about that. What we're seeing today with the guidance is we think we've
invested in the things that we feel like we should to make sure we're there for the
customer now and in the future. But the customer is going to continue to change,
competition will continue to change and we've got to make sure that we have the

with, a lot of variables to make decisions around, and so I think we've described it
earlier in today and just now suﬃciently.
I think the sales number as Brett said earlier, that's about $9 billion of growth which is
a great number for the total business. And inside the box and online will always be
watching what competitors do, and I wouldn't underestimate any competitor any
time. We're constantly scanning and looking and making sure that whatever we've
got out to oﬀer is what a customer wants and it makes sense in terms of value. So
we'll always be looking, and we'll decide as we go.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
As it relates to like card discount, we don't underestimate them or anybody. Our
opening price points are going to have the right spec and the right size and priced
competitively and then we have this whole other assortment that we can work with to
make sure that we deliver proﬁtability for the business.
And I might just add on, having competed with hard discounters pretty much my
whole retail life, one of the diﬀerences for the US is that the price position is much
stronger already and that gives you the ability to compete on everything else. That's
not necessarily true in every market around the world, whether the price gap is much
wider. So you're already starting from a better position here, then I think you would
see in other markets.

Good morning, Caroline Conway from AllianceBernstein. I just wanted to ask you
about the supply chain support for the omnichannel eﬀorts in stores. It sounds very
clear that the Supercenters are going to be the hub for pickup of course and then
home delivery. Just curious if there also investments that you're considering for
things like each -- picking at the DCs or dark stores or pickup points or anything
along those lines? And then a separate second question for Judith, I just wanted to
get your perspective on the regulatory environment in India? And how that's looking
for Flipkart?
Hey, let me take the ﬁrst part. We showed in the presentation earlier this idea of
something called AlphaBot, and that's one experiment that we're learning from as IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 72 of 91Kerry Kotouc
Kathleen McLaughlinsaid, we're expanding in a couple of more stores this year and that in similar
technologies can work in distribution centers as well. So we are internally rethinking
the way that we would deﬁne supply chain. Historically, we might have thought
about supply chain as the part of the business that brings something from a supplier
to the back of the store.
But with all the -- all the things we're doing today, including Walmart and Home, the
supply chain goes from point of supply all the way to the refrigerator. So, every one
of those pieces has to be put together and optimize the right way. And there are
several diﬀerent types of technology that we'll be testing experimenting with the
fund, the best way to do that. We've got some -- a market where we're running
automated vehicles for example, then we've got Spark. Spark is our ﬁrst multi-tenant
platform that we've built inside the company.
We're tenant, number one, Sam's Club will be tenant two and that's a platform that
can be expanded. So just think of it from the point of -- that something is growing
manufactured, packaged all the way to the customer's home is the way we will
optimize this how whole -- entire supply chain.
{BIO 20989993 <GO>}
I was going to add one thing. Another way to think about how integrated supply
chain is starting to get. Imagine we have regional distribution centers that supply
stores in full truckload. Could you move product in truckload from fulﬁllment center
to RDC to the store and then ride the rails of last mile delivery to someone's home.
We're already delivering groceries in the GM package just rides. So there's just
things like that we're thinking through right now. It's certainly very sort of ﬂuid
process.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
So for the regulatory environment in India, what it say is sometimes people forget.
We've been operating in India for over 10 years. This is not something that we've got
used to 18 months ago when we made the investments we've had a strong cash and
carry business there, throughout that time and I think actually payments,
eCommerce, legislation around the world is shifting and changing everybody has
these businesses grow is learning diﬀerent ways to think about how to look at them
and in an emerging market like India with such a fast growing part of the business
that's no diﬀerent either.
We continue to work with the Flipkart and the PhonePe teams very closely. That focus
on the customer, ultimately, I think is the right thing to do keep doing that, and then
we work with the government. From a perspective of how playing a seat at the table
to talk about these things into work away through them, but it's something we knew
that was there when we made the investment and seeing the results we're seeing,
not just for the business itself but in the impact, making on broad two communities
creating jobs, really thinking about how those to support small micro businesses,
Kirana shops as well. I think it's all part of that one.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Thanks. Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. You've always done a great job with your
core customer typically in that demographic they spend a large part of the
disposable income and you're probably getting the lion's share. The key is breaking
into diﬀerent demographics that's the future, you're doing it, your eCommerce
business is growing, but can you rate your success maybe for you, Doug, John and
Marc, breaking into new customer demographics, have you -- any speciﬁc examples.
And then a second question for Judith on Flipkart, maybe for also Judith and Brett,
when will dilution moderate? We always talk about losses are consistent with what
you expected, I don't think we know exactly what you expected. Should they
moderate given that it's such a volatile environment? Thanks.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah, let me start with the ﬁrst question. Customers and demographics and as far as
the speciﬁc example, so I mean, I want to talk about grocery pickup. We've had a
large successful grocery business for some time and over the last few years, quality is
improved, the assortment range has improved and you've seen the business
accelerate and share go up, and when you can get into the baskets of what's being
shopped in grocery pickup, we see more Choice beef, we see Prime beef, we see
Wagyu beef show up as a higher percentage, organics and produce in grocery show
up. So it appears at least part of this growth is coming from other channels and
places, because we've been able to marry the assortment with a service that appears
-- that aligns well with some who's number starts and has a higher income level.
So inside the pickup business really encouraging to see what's happened and I think
those quality levels then enable us to be able to appeal to that consumer across
other channels like the work that Marc, and the team are doing online, but some
really great examples inside there item-by-item.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yeah, we've been pushing up AUR each year on.com as we start to break more
premium brands, and we're deﬁnitely seeing new customers come in especially with
the proprietary brands with ELOQUII, Bonobos, all the brands that we've formed.
Scoop is a great example a lot folks are new to Walmart and Walmart.com there.

{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Just want me to answer on the Flipkart piece of this. The way that I would think about
this is we've been really clear the dilution next year will be roughly in line with the
same as you've seen and I think that's the guidance that we are giving. Well, I'll tell
you about the business is no diﬀerent to the US, we are thinking about where we
invest, we are thinking about where we grow, we are thinking about where we stay,
we thinking about new revenue streams and the great thing about both Flipkart and
PhonePe is they both got lots of levers that they can pull be really thoughtful the
ways that they do that. Both of them, for example, I thinking about ad tech revenue
and they've got this amazingly powerful data engine that sits behind that and I'm
really encouraged by some of the results, I'm seeing from it.

supercenters. When do you think you'll be ready to talk about the cadence of the roll
out for the health centers. Is that something that we should expect this year, next
year. And how does that impact if at all, kind of your optical strategy, and what you're
currently doing in the stores. That's my ﬁrst question.
Yeah, I think we'll -- let me ﬁrst talk about what we've got open. We've got two
centers open in Dallas, Georgia. We just opened our second Calhoun a few weeks
ago and I think we're encouraged by the demand we are seeing. The number of
consumers are looking for options for health care that's quality and aﬀordable it's
encouraging. Now what we've got to do over the next few months is learn how the
model works and the right mix of services and how we price services. So that's
worked to be doing, but we want to be able to get through this and get a clear
understanding of where we're going with it over the next few months.
In addition to just those two services. We also got, we have a big pharmacy business
where we think there's more opportunity to serve patients in ways, other than justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

And then the second part of your question.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
So just how would it impact if it all kind of your current optical strategy that optical --
Yeah, okay. Optical is an important part of it, we've got a good optical business. So
we've got to remodel program that's very encouraging optical re-modernize the
shop and things inside it, then we've got a -- where we're learning about, checking
your vision from remote locations and using technology to streamline the consumer
experience. But both businesses are quite encouraging. We know there's a big
demand for it.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
And then Judith maybe one for you, just your latest thinking around the
monetization path for the Indian assets and as you think about assets like Sam's Club
and great value, maybe use those assets in markets that maybe you don't want to
operate in as a -- as a corporate entity is -- are there ways to kind of maybe swept
those assets a little more.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Yeah. So I think I've talked about the monetization path within the Indian businesses.
It's a really interesting one in terms of those learnings skills in new areas, but also
thinking about use cases that can create some proﬁtability as well for those. The one
that's interesting is actually the question on Sam's Club and how do you think about
that, you may remember that we did a transaction last year with Brazil and one of the
things we're doing in Brazil is we're still supporting the Sam's Club, although Avant
[ph] is the owner of those and they run and as part of that, we still provide some of
our Mamber's Mark products into that. We still talk about how the operation runs.
We still provide some training expertise to it as well. So it's a really interesting one
where we're learning how we could support that in a market where we already have
a 20% stake within it. So no further plans, other than to learn at the moment, but it's
an interesting experience for us to make sure that we can operate something in a
way that can be externalized.

update on how many customers you have? And then what would be the gating
factor on really aggressively more aggressively rolling it out?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah, let me talk about the shopping ﬁgures the ﬁrst. First the grocery pickup
business that we've built is a great oﬀer for customers. It's got a really clear way for
customers to shop in food and consumables and oﬀers a little bit of general
merchandise in the operations done a great job of growing not only with new stores,
but the comps have been encouraging for the stores have an open for more than a
year and some over two years.
And then on the other side, we've got an application that's, we call the Blue app, and
it has general merchandise and it mostly comes from the site or from the
marketplace, but inside that are embedded some really great applications for in
storage, things like maps, list and customers use those and they like us --a lot. So
what's going to happen over the course of the year, we've already got about half of
our users in an environment where they've got both apps in one place and then,
we'll be building out an experience where you'll have search that helps you look
across the portfolio, a basket where you can ring at multiple things and then we've
got a simpliﬁed Karen, the experience when you go to the store to pick up or when
you have something delivered to home.
It's just hard for a customer right now that time, you have to ﬂip back and forth
between the app and then you have to navigate diﬀerent fulﬁllment option. So we
want to bring that all together and make it more seamless.
On InHome the retention rates are high, we haven't disclosed how many customers
that are using at this time. It's only in three markets, but we're very encouraged by
what we're learning the NPS scores are high, and the customer satisfaction and
come along within the comments feedback are outstanding. And it's just one more
way that a customer can decide to have Walmart as a brand take friction out of their
lives and whatever is on your shopping list the most important thing is they come
home and those are in the refrigerator and constantly stock. So we're encouraged by
what we're learning so far.

with every delivery business, whether it's in-home or Spark delivery. One of the
challenges that we'll work through over the next few months is getting density in the
area, because the more customers you can deliver to in a neighborhood or a suburb
then it brings the eﬃciency of the delivery process in the cost down per delivery.
Also encouraging to see the percentage of customers that are due Walmart as well.
That's very exiting.
One of the things that I learned when I went to visit the Kansas City test a few weeks
ago is that our own associates are using the service, it's 20 bucks a month. While our
sample size are small, our associates make up a small percentage of that small pool,
but a bunch of them are delivering into each other's homes and they love it. So all
kinds of people are going to use this service it's been fun to watch them deal with
each other dogs and things like that.

Thanks, Dan. Again, Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. So I wanted to, about 70% of
your business is consumables there are pharmacy in there, it's clear that you guys
with omnichannel becoming bigger in that business, have a lead with what you've
done on click and collect and now delivery. I guess sitting back though, the race is
on to improve economics got Kroger partner with Kaddo [ph]. Amazon that now is
cut all their fees and doing it for free. So how do you guys defend your lead and use
whether it's micro fulﬁllment I'm a little surprised. There's only a couple of more of
those how do you continue this lead and maybe even grow share in an environment
where your competitors look right now that maybe they're going to have automation
sooner.
Well, step one is you have to run a great operation. We're really proud of the
progress that's been made in the stores and Suresh talked about something early
called the substitute ability engine, which is great. But the best way to do substitutes
as you should be in stock, the grocery areas we've got to stay in stock and what's
exciting about learning how to manage this pickup business in addition to the way
we manage stores over time is we've got an interesting inﬂow of information from
customers telling us all the things they want to buy and how they want to buy andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

store by store.
So pretty excited about being able to put this customer into everything we do inside
the store. The second is, we've got more stores to go and I don't want to say that
that's where all the growth is going to come from. But that will help that more
markets that we can cover and get the service out and then third adding on the
ability to be able to fulﬁll this and a number of ways that seamless is probably the
thing I've said this a couple of times of understating against what I'm most excited
about. Is bringing these two apps together and having a customer-centered view of
how we think of all the things in their lives, whether it's a busy Saturday and they're
trying to get refreshed it's for the soccer game or it's a birthday party or the weekly
grocery shop or daily that we can have either one of our associates go into or a
service pickup and run dinner home. We've got a really great portfolio there. We've
just got to build it all out, so that the customer thinks investors default, the way that
Doug has some other thought about when she went shopping at Walmart.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I think the speed of automation is important. It's also important to get the right kind
of automation and when you think about the stores as we've done with Alpha bot
having the same inbound freight and some of the last mile being shared with this
automation on side of the box instead of some huge center that does grocery
automation. That's an interesting choice that Tom will tell which one was the right
one.

{BIO 7542899 <GO>}
Okay. Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs. My question is on gross margin. It sounds like
you're implying that it will be down this year. I think that was answered earlier. But
what would have to happen for gross margins to be stable to up even if it is a
continued area of price investment?
We want gross margins to be stable or because we want to drive the productivity
loop. We just have to get the SG&A savings to be at a faster rate than the gross
margin investments that we make Kate. So I don't think there is necessarily a place
where we rest on gross margin. I think we're constantly going to be trying to ﬁnd a
way to give a better value to customers.

is by bringing the cost down in the best way to bring cost down, is to sell more
because cost is a denominator and then if you can continue to chase SG&A down

like margins to reﬂect the decrease in SG&A, because we want to give customers a

Thanks. Hi Greg Melic, Evercore ISI. John maybe to follow-up on that, if we went
back at Sam's a couple years ago, I think the decision to refurbish 60 clubs as
fulﬁllment centers and really move ahead on omni channel now that you've had a
few months in the Walmart US role. Do you see a similar shift in how you use those
assets to optimize for productivity going forward or is it a totally diﬀerent kind of shift
in the US?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Well, we're still thinking through the entire supply chain from end to end and so, I
don't think I'd be ready to say today the right way, is on the supply chain, whether it's
the fulﬁllment centers, distribution center stores or number of nodes. We've got to
work through and make sure we're serving the customers, the best way we can and
the stores -- our stores people shop in that also fulﬁll. So I don't want the message to
be that we're thinking in the stores as fulﬁllment centers where you shop. There are
stores that can fulﬁll and what we've done in the business I think is quite helpful is
maximizing and optimizing the number of slides and then creating the minimal
amount of disruptions of the stores can be great supercenters with the great
produce department bakery and have a really high functioning general merchandise
theory all throughout the building. But we can still fulﬁll orders at a pretty high rate.

Sorry, John I just going to add to that, which is if you've got, we've got a business in
the UK, which is home shopping business which is online shopping, which is 15 years
old. They've got some high densities already high pick rates, they've been at this a
much longer period of time and there is still, they don't have a completely diﬀerent
layout in the stores, but the density of pick in many cases will be higher.
So I think there is still a lot of learnings that we can do through that China if though

we're trying to sell some of the deliveries out in 40 minutes, so it evolves as well with
the customer oﬀer and we've got this beneﬁt seen around the world how diﬀerent
people are doing do it. Learning from how you drive density. So you don't have to
go to dark stores, but equally, if you do have to change that I-out [ph] a little you can
do that without disrupting the customer experience.

And Kath we are pleased with the eCommerce fulﬁllment. It's happening out of
those clubs that we're using?

Yeah, we are. So we've seen over the last year one had helped us grow so it gave us
extra capacity, but it also helped us substantially would use our shipment costs as
well our fulﬁllment cost side of it as well. The other part that I think is exciting is
looking at ship from Club, which should gives you an a whole another 600 stores,
which you can use as points to leverage as well and that -- if we look at Club pickup
shift from Club direct-to-home and using these clubs that we've dark, it's really given
us a great kind of network to go after the omni-sale.
Doug, my follow-up for that and pass it oﬀ as you want. If we think about how we
expand the addressable market for Walmart and also monetize all this great
customer traﬃc and productivity loop. I think we bought Chat, we bought Flipkart as
ways to expand Amazon built on $11 billion advertising business.
I think in the past you've talked about. (Technical Diﬃculty)

Products, which is part of the point of the panel you've now got a situation where
across the company, we're learning how to build experiences that you can monetize

much as grocery unlimited and just curious how that's going. What kind of
incrementality you're seeing, are you seeing people kind of your customers trade up

Yeah, let me take the second one ﬁrst, it's a mix. There are our customers who are
shopping in the store, who go straight to delivery others, who have moved from the

that are now using the service so, it's only been a few months but encouraging
results so far.
We're happy with the number of people who have signed up monthly, and then
annually. So, we're happy with that, and then the ﬁrst part of your question, just to
make sure, I heard. So we've got a percentage of the store now, that's available for
pickup in what we call the orange app and no priority one is to get the apps merged
together so that we can start expanding assortment and we can do things like
aligner catalogs that we know our customer and with knowing who the customers
are shopping that will help us understanding intent, they can emerge -- aligns us
with the catalog of products across the entire store and then beyond the store. So

Christopher Mandevillepicking GM and store during the course of the year. So just to repeat something that
John said, you can today go out on the grocery app, the Orange app and you could
buy back to school, and moms love it. So, just take their list from the school and it
populates. That's a great example of the fact that we can already do it, and how
much they want it, but we do have to stitch these two together as soon as we can
and obviously do that well.
I'll just add on One app and I think it is super important as John mentioned, but as
we start to bring these two together, we're not asking customers to have to
download two apps and so we could really start to leverage that relationship, we've
built on same-day delivery and delivery unlimited and pick to then sell more long tail
GM on Walmart.com.
We've already now -- we've got about 50% of the traﬃc on Walmart.com that seen
the grocery app and we're seeing a nice lift from that. So, hopefully, when we do it
the other way around we actually show Blue app at the Walmart.com to grocery
customers. We see a similar type of bump. So yes, it's a very important part of our
strategy.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
And I think that's an important point -- I think what's interesting is, there are
customers are only using one app or the other and unaware of the other one. So we
merge them together seeing customers who were using Blue, Orange vice versa has
been encouraging so far.
Before I get corrected, I think I said moms, can use it dads can use it too. I just said
moms because it's been moms, that have liked hugged my neck literally. When I go
to a store, I almost always go out to the pickup area and for two years in a row, when
I've gone out to that spot I've seen moms that have a grocery order with their back-
to-school list and they say things like I don't have to throw elbows with the other
parents to get my school supplies. Do you know how great this is. And one of them

seeing thus far? Thanks.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yeah, the way we're thinking about supply chain and I'll talk about the stores ﬁrst as,
we've got a number of experiments going on in the supply chain and one we're
working through a product called Symbiotic[ph] in Florida that helps us palletize
items for neighborhood markets and for Supercenters so that they can be delivered
on pallets by (inaudible) and we're pretty, we're pretty excited about the results
we've seen so far. But then -- associates in the store and was a result help me
associate helps the customer because we're in stock and as things come in from the
back of the store on to the sales ﬂoor, it's much easier for the product we taken
straight to the (inaudible) and put on the counter.
So all these things we're doing whether it's in the dry supply chain, the perishable
supply chain, the meat plant or the dairy plant. We're thinking about the end user in
mind and it's not just to point of assembling something to pull cost out of the Silo

analytics and an emerging topic for younger customers is also privacy transparency
around data? So would love your thoughts. And I had a follow up.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Let me start with ML and the supply chain. We are working on processes upstream to
help narrow down the positive rate of forecasting in other words eliminate some of
the component errors because the supply chain starts with the forecast, and then as
product moves from start all the way to ﬁnish variability and things like receiving
times or traﬃc patterns weather can create these rates. But as you narrow the
tolerance down transaction-by-transaction and work all the failure points out, we can
get to a point where inventories more real-time, there's less extra inventory in the
store and I'm pretty excited about some of the work streams that the team between
us Suresh and a person in 3 and you're working on so forecasting is a big piece of it.
And then we're thinking about, you've heard us talk about perpetual inventory
before we've got products that work in the stores that help us correct on hands if
they're wrong but we're also trying to serve solve the reason they're wrong with from
top to bottom. So the store associates have a better experience with on hands being
right, which helps us again within stock.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}

would stand up.
{BIO 21073281 <GO>}
Like you said the main thing about (Technical Diﬃculty) I'm mic'd up but I'm not --
the mic is not turned on. So in addition to what John was saying one of the things
that we are trying to do with ML is actually make use of the data that we have already
that we had already collecting right, it is a little, a bunch of data that we can bring it
together in such a way that we can train models on it and one of the things that we
are really excited about is that areas where we can -- where we can draw inﬂuences
about customer behavior in such a way that we can actually help the customer
experience. Are the areas where we believe that there is great exponential. Okay.
Whether it is, I mean I talked about substitutions that's one example, but there are
many areas where we can take the information that we have about our customers,
train models on it. So that we can go back and improve the customer experience
and that takes up the positive ﬂywheel [ph] that I was talking about. Supply chain is
just one area, but there are many, many of these customer experiences were ML is
actually going to continue to enhance the customer experience.

the company up to not only have an eﬀective business model, but manage privacy in
a way that accrues trust to the company even more so especially if we want to do
things like being customers home servicing them and groceries -- they have -- they
have to trust us and they have to trust how we're handling their data.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
So, Data and technology is such an important part of the company, it was coming up
in just about every conversation I was in. So I took my organization and pulled the
existing privacy resources and created a new SVP level. We call it SVP for Digital
Citizenship, which is a term that I came up with to convey that this is not just a legal
issue. It's about building trust with the customer there a lot of issues adjacent to
privacy like responsible use of AI. We want to do all of that in the way that fosters
[ph] the notion that trust as a competitive advantage for Walmart.
So we hired, what I'd like to call a world famous privacy expert Nuala O'Connor who
has recently been the President of an NGL. She is a real expert in both of legal and
sort of policy reputational aspects of privacy and all this issue. So we think we're on
the right track.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Can I just add on to that, to say, I think in the past two we've always used history
whereas we're in a position where now we can look forward. So if you think about a
forecast. It's always been, what do we sell similar weak last year. Now we can actually
scrape other people's websites to see what they've got on promotion. We can have
a look at social media and see what events are happening. And you also know the
individual buying patterns of your members or customers. So you can anticipate
what they're going to purchase. So it is ﬂipping the world in regards to how you
actually get in front of the purchase, and I think about it from a Sam's Club
perspective, we're now also tailoring our oﬀers in our Instant savings book. So on the
back-page of the book we will actually create oﬀers for individual members to start
to draw them along that purchase path, because we know that there'll be more loyal
and sticky. If we get them into Member's Mark. But we know, if we can actually get
them to use optical that becomes a customer or a member, who is with you for a
longer period.
And so how do we design oﬀers that actually encourage them to participate with us
even more than they have in the past.

you were doing that at Walmart and like, is there potential for a loyalty program at
some point at Walmart, may be, it includes the in-home service and some of the
other things like have you thought about something more comprehensive, because
at Sam's Club. You know the customer, you know exactly what they buy, but at
Walmart, you don't really -- what masses of people do, but how do you get more
tailored to that customer.
I think in today's world and tomorrow's, we have to personalized for customers and
Walmart got to create one view of the customer and then put it to work. One of the
key questions will be (inaudible) used cases. And we really believe in everyday low
price for Walmart supercenters, the beneﬁts of ﬂowing inventory and an EDLP
business model are signiﬁcant.
So what we wouldn't want to do is start down the path of an old-school loyalty
program and high low that creates all this disruption in the supply chain, but there
are plenty of use cases, you bought that tie, you like this one. Are you bought this
Nike top -- we don't carry Nike yet in the Walmart stores.
I hope they're listening, you bought this, so you want that. You bought a -- you
bought a printer see you need ink, or things that you're buying cyclical many use
cases that we can do using data that will help us earn more trust, drive the loop, and
we'll do those things and we'll do it as quickly as we can do it. But we need to be

{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
We go to Robbie next.
Thanks, Robbie Ohmes, Bank of America Securities. When -- lot of great questions
on pickup and the app, just longer term, I think somebody was asking this before. Is
there an opportunity to really meaningfully move general merchandise online
fulﬁllment to the store level and could that start to make your gross margin improve
in the.com business. Is there -- we obviously wouldn't see it in ﬁscal '21, but how
important is that relative to being a comp driver.
And how much further, can you go in fulﬁlling from store using shipping partners as
well. Is there -- are there real opportunities, over a ﬁve-year basis to dramatically
improve the proﬁtability of the US online?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
But we do a few things already, I think it would help answer the question. As we said
earlier, we've got the pick business. We have general merchandise categories thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Unidentiﬁed Participantwe are in that during seasonal times of the year and we have the ability now and
many stores to deliver from the store to the home. And then as we align these
shopping experiences, then we'll be able to pick more and more of the
Supercenters and deliver it same day. So we believe that's an important piece of the
solution and should have all the beneﬁts you just talked about, but again it's a part of
the solution. I wouldn't want to say that delivered from store is the answer, because
it's a part of the answer, part of the answer may be delivered from store and deliver
from an FC depending on the order or move all of it to the FC. So we're conscious
that think through the timing of all these changes and steps that over time, build out
the ability to do all those things.
And then on just keep in mind the marginal cost to deliver a GM item out of a store
when it's already going with the grocery is very small. So that's a big opportunity, as
we expand assortment just sort of leverage the basket, pharmacies is another good
example of being able to get that in the basket to increased size, but ultimately, I
think the real opportunity to drive mix is really in that long tail and we're doing that
in home and fashion in marketplace. I think that's the really big up opportunity.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
And increasingly happening with a membership fee that goes along with it. You're
right. We didn't talk about delivery unlimited as much. That was not necessarily
intentional. We have a membership program. We're starting to learn how to sell the
membership and it's something we can build on it with same-day delivery from the
Supercenters including GM.
And then just on pick up a couple of times I think Brett said it ﬁrst. So the stores that
are comping pickup what is driving the comp? Is it the same people using it more? Is
it new people still coming in and so therefore the pick ups are comping? What are
the bigger drivers to stores that are pickup and already comp?
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
It's both of those things over the last 3 years to 4 years as we've expanded we've
seen more frequent usage and we've seen new customers come in to pick up, either
from somewhere outside of the environment or from inside of the members. So just
a mix of all those and really happy with the growth rates we've seen over the last few
years.
And last thing, are there stores where pickup is too high, where it's creating
problems for the shopper experience and things like that? And how many stores?

inventory either through a van that's driven by a person, they're automated van or
autonomous vehicle so that we can move from place to place. So we are looking in
all the ways we can try to spread the volume out.
We do cap in, quite a few stores. The demand is higher than what we will fulﬁll,
because we don't want to destroy the experience in a store which brings you back to
how fast can you automate? Where do you automate? I think we probably have time
for one more or two more. Rupesh and then Ed we'll make you the last one. After
that --

Rupesh Parikh, Oppenheimer. So on the grocery delivery front, I was curious what
opportunities do you see the [ph] lower grocery delivery fees. And then if you look at
your consumer surveys, how important is it to your consumers grocery delivery close
to zero?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
What was the last part?
{BIO 15915617 <GO>}
How -- as you look at your consumer surveys, how important is free grocery delivery
for your consumers?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Free grocery delivery. We'll end up doing a membership in larger numbers and the
fee itself may go down some over time as we ﬁgure out autonomous and how we
pick, but our front foot will be on a membership fee.

Rachel BrandThat's right. So you've got options today where you can pay by the transaction, you
can pay monthly or you can pay 1 fee for the year. And so we're just now in the
beginning of learning which of those customers like the most and it's only been a
couple of months, but we'll learn.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Ed you get the lucky last question.
{BIO 6360445 <GO>}
Edward Kelly, Wells Fargo. So just a follow-up on grocery and as it relates to pick up.
You've clearly led the market in this strategy. What do you think the biggest drivers
of that have been. How much of it is the fact that you're not charging versus the fact
that your peers are? How much of it is related to the fact that operationally the
execution just seems better and then what happens when competitors eliminate
their fate. And how does that impact your business? And then unrelated, I did want
to ask you about supply chain related to Corona virus and the question there is, how
much of what you're selling is on true replenishment. How much inventory do you
have? How long before we need to start worrying about the fact that it could create
inventory issues, if supply chain in China really doesn't begin to open back up more
normally.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Let me take the ﬁrst question on pickup and I believe the question when you look
across the operation we have which is don't charge and we're able to fulﬁll
customers basket today what happens of others do it. I think the most important
thing that we would always focus on and I think what we're talking about this next
year and years to come is having the very best quality items in great values inside
the store, if you get the assortment, right in the mechanism for delivery, it makes it
much easier and much easier for us and the customer but and the reason I think the
growth is, it's about the customer people are busier than they've ever been. We're all
trying to tackle lots of things, and this is a great service that ﬁlls in a big void.
On the second part of the question. Like we said earlier, it's just early to tell. And
we're ﬁrst concerned about our supplier partners, our associates in the country, our
sourcing associates, associates who work in Walmart China's. So we're thinking
about them, ﬁrst and foremost and as we learn more about what's going on, we'll be
able to tell where the impacts I think some categories will be sooner than others, and
it just depends on the lead time and how quickly the supply chain move in the
categories.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
It is was John (inaudible) on one of the things that we've learned over the last years
through our global sourcing. But our merchants have got much closer to the detail
as thinking about how the ﬂow of products come into our business that they know
exactly which orders around which factories were not due to come in and what thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-02-18

Daniel Binderlooks like. And I think that, attention to detail as we go through this, even though is
such a ﬂuid situation will help us understand better as things become clearer exactly
what the impact for us would be in the future.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Great. With that, we're going to wrap up our Q&A.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah, I just -- we'll close by saying thank you, Brett may want to say a word or two.
We appreciate the relationship that we have with the investment community. We're
trying to do the best job we can for you of laying out what our opportunities are.
We've got a really strong team, not just the people that are represented in this room,
but 2 million, plus they are working to make these things happen. And as we walk
out of this room today we know yesterday. We're focused on driving speed,
innovation and execution. So that we can continue to have strong results. We
appreciate the engagement that we have with you.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Not that I need to encourage this probably, but keep giving us feedback on how we
communicate, what we're communicating, how often we're communicating. It helps
us get better as we think about these events and other things we do in the future,
but I really appreciate all the feedback you gave us.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Thanks everybody.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
So with that, the formal part of our meeting has concluded and our webcast has
ended. As I mentioned earlier, we have lunch available upstairs where you can spend
some time our executive team. Thank your for the interest.
