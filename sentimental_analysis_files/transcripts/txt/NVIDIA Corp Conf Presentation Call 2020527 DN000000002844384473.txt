Hi, good morning everybody. This is Matt Ramsay again from the semis team at
Cowen. Really happy to have the folks from NVIDIA, Colette Kress, the CFO and
Simona and Stewart Stecker from the IR team to join our conference and have a chat
about their -- lots of exciting things going on in the business. Just a couple of things
before we get started. One is, there is an interface, I think, for all the investors on the
line to submit questions. I can't promise I'll get to all of them, but there is a live
interface to do that. And I think we'll kind of take the conversation from there.
So, Colette thanks for joining. I just wanted to kind of kick things oﬀ for folks on the
phone and on the line that are interested in numbers. And Colette's been at the
Company seven years now as CFO, and I think the stock's up 20x over that period of
time. So, I don't know, it might be kind of interested to folks on the line, it's been not
always have straight line journey, but obviously lots of momentum with the business.
And, if you have a few words you might want to say to kick things oﬀ. I know there
was just earnings last week, but we will get into the Q&A there, but thank you all for
joining.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks so much for hosting and I appreciate we moving things to virtual and
still continuing our business. We did launch our earnings just last week after
probably one of the most I'd call inﬂuential, extraordinary times that we are in. And
we produced very solid strong results within the quarter for our business and
growing nearly 40% year-over-year, as well as strong overall sequential growth in
many of our businesses as well. This also marks the point where we close the overall
Mellanox acquisition. Mellanox acquisition has been working for more than 15
months, and we're excited to now almost hit the one-month mark of being together
as one Company.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Matt RamsayAdditionally, there were some great announcements right before we did our overall
earnings. Our GTC, which we normally hold in the March timeframe in San Jose, we
moved to a digital format. That digital format was a great format to introduce our
new architecture for Ampere. Ampere is in full production and did contribute to our
overall earnings that we reported within Q1. And so, a great summary of
announcements not only about the overall architecture and what A100 platform
brings, but also inclusions of software, which is very important part of our end-to-end
stack for the data center as well.
So, those are just a couple key things that we talked about at our earnings.
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Got it, now thanks for the introduction. I guess there's a number of diﬀerent topics
that are, as you say, it's an unprecedented time with the COVID-19 situation and
obviously hope that all the employees globally at NVIDIA are hanging in there and
doing well, but you mentioned the big news on the quarter and over the last couple
of months is the highly anticipated launch of Ampere, particularly for the data center
business now and then we'll see how that moves into gaming over time.
You mentioned that it did contribute to the results for April and obviously in the
guidance as well, but I thought it's also interesting that V100 and T4 also had very
strong quarters in the April quarter, if there's any help you could give us in breaking
down the data center strength across those three important product lines, I think that
would help folks as we think about the business going forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Great. Absolutely. So, our data center business grew sequentially about 18% and
grew year-over-year about 80% and reached for the very ﬁrst time more than a $1
billion within the quarter. So, we produced overall record results in terms of our data
center business. Our overall T4 and our V100 also had tremendous strength within
the quarter. Our T4, which we refer to as our inferencing product and is sold many
times to the cloud and or to end-customers to help them with their overall
inferencing is still solidly in the double digits as a percentage of our data center
revenue.
But now, our Ampere came in and our Ampere 100 is sold with its overall base board
with eight GPUs consolidated, contributed meaningful to a percentage of our overall
data center revenue. As we had articulated going into the quarter, we expected that
to be a part of our overall quarter, and it did prove out to be quite solid. Our visibility
into Q1 helped us with our overall Q1 results and we see that continuing as we move
to overall Q2.
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Got it. You mentioned also, I mean, the big, the other big news was getting Mellanox

Colette Kressenvironment is rather interesting, but congratulations on getting that done, and that
whole business from a revenue perspective, I think holds into the data center
business, and obviously is included in the guidance that you gave for the July
quarter. Maybe just remind folks what those contributions were and the growth rates
you've seen out of Mellanox in the recent periods? And then I have a couple of
follow ups on the operating expenses and how they move around with bringing that
into the Company.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Mellanox is incorporated for in full quarter in our Q2 guidance. We plan to see
it as incorporated into our data center revenue. So, we'll take all of Mellanox and
incorporate that. We helped in terms of with our guidance to help understand that
Mellanox as a percentage of the total Company will probably be in the low teens as
a percentage of our revenue to help people understand the comp, both sequentially
and overall year-over-year.
Mellanox, since we announced in March in 2009 has been doing quite well, in terms
of the market revenue that it is received. They enter into some of the very similar
customers and similar conﬁgurations that we do in many times. So, we have like
customers, we have like partners that we do -- that we use to take the overall
products to market. Now, what we've seen throughout last year, and turning the
corner into the March quarter for Mellanox is they were looking at approximately in
their high teens and sometimes in the 20% year-over-year growth.
So, solid execution from them and we're going to continue now working together on
things that we can do to both enter into the market of high performance computing,
continue our work in terms of AI, and using those overall interconnections between
systems to systems to help us grow that business.
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Got you. Just a follow up there. I had my own personal observations in the semi's
landscape over the last, I don't know, three or four years have been tons of M&A and
around you a lot of those deals, it bothers me a little bit as a technologist, rather than
put my technology hat on rather than my analyst hat on that a lot of those are, I don't
know, maybe not quite ﬁnancial engineering, but they kind of feel that way with the
ﬁrst couple of slides and all these merger decks talking about synergies here and
synergies there, and I get the sense that Mellanox for NVIDIA is exactly the opposite.
It's folding in a high growth technology franchise into a larger high growth
technology franchise is that -- is that the right way to characterize it and just following
up on that, can you talk us through OpEx, I know you gave some numbers for the full
year and they might have been a little higher than some folks that modeled. So, if
any, any thoughts there would be helpful?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 10Yeah. So, it's a really good question of what type of M&A is NVIDIA interested into?
And what was its strategic rationale when it purchased overall Mellanox? It's very rare
that we would make a decision based on ﬁnancial engineering. It says, hey, the
numbers look really great, because our culture is so strong. Our culture is extremely
high quality, engineering and leadership in most of the markets that we enter.
Mellanox was a unique piece out there for us to overall acquire, one that was very
similar in terms of being best of breed in its market for overall interconnects, and
very engineering focused, probably a more of a large startup, which seemed to
resonate a little bit with our Company and maybe where we were about 7 years to 10
years ago. And so there were so many likeness in terms of the culture, as well as the
focus in terms of high-end overall engineering and leadership, that we felt it was a
good combination.
That doesn't mean that we didn't look at it as what do we think we could do in
growth together. Because you're right, that was still an option for us to potentially
just partner together, but there was a great opportunity for us to work together and
build products together and really take the overall accelerated compute to the next
level and think about acceleration as a focus is about all the components around the
central overall compute in terms of inside the data center and Mellanox was that
perfect partner for us to do that with.
Now, incorporating it in, we wanted to make sure because we didn't have any
overlap with products to products, most of the things that you've seen people
indicating that there was overlap, there are things that we could be more eﬃcient oﬀ.
There are certainly things that we can be eﬃcient in terms of our G&A overall
organizations, as we integrate in terms of long-term. We believe we can do that, but
our focus has been on how do we create products going forward? How do we start
in terms of those engineering products to be not just a partnership and two things
inside of a box, but what can we overall build together?
You'll see that in the years to come more than you'll see that in terms of next quarter.
Now, when we look in terms of how we've incorporated this into our guidance, both
our guidance in full for the P&L, but also we provided full year overall OpEx. Now,
full year OpEx from a GAAP and non-GAAP, GAAP incorporates overall acquisition
accounting, probably all of our favorite things out there of the accounts that have
been working together on my team, probably for several months in terms of
determining what that would be.
The largest piece of that is the purchase price accounting. Two pieces of purchase
price accounting, which are important for our investors to see, of course, non cash at
this point, because those entries are just the opposite end of the cash that we use to
overall purchase the overall acquisition. So, in our overall GAAP results in OpEx, as
well as in COGS, we have the amortization of two things, amortization of intangibles,
intangible OpEx, as well as intangible overall COGS. That will continue for many
years. You'll see things in terms of in the 5 years to 7 years, in terms of that
amortization.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 10Matt Ramsay
Colette KressSecondly, we have a step-up of the overall inventory to fair value. And you will also
ﬁnd that in our overall COGS. That is one time in nature, one time for overall Q2
results. Thirdly, we have one-time items and deal costs, and other types of pieces
that will be in our Q2 OpEx as well. And then lastly, which will be a continuation and
just adding together with our existing stock-based compensation.
We have Mellanox overall stock-based compensation that we acquired and those
shares will continue to vast over their normal period of time. And we have a small
amount of retention, as well so that we keep that overall strong engineering team,
essentially the whole Company to assure that we can meet our future goals together.
So, those are the breakdowns of what is in our overall guidance. There's a very good
amount of it. That is one-time non cash that is incorporated into our GAAP results.
We'll provide more understanding once we get to the end of Q2 that you will see
the details of that type of accounting, but a good part of what we're seeing is non-
cash in nature and just following the overall rules of acquisition accounting.
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Got it. That makes sense. I just kind of back up and now that the deals closed and
you described the Mellanox revenue growth rate recently and you folded in the
operating costs. Just big picture as you think about growth of the top line of NVIDIA
or growth of the operating expenses, anything that -- I mean is it just a step-up on
both lines and I'm we're sort of on the same growth trajectory as an integrated
Company? Is that the right way to think about it or any diﬀerence in the way you
would see the business growing or the investments growing now that you've
integrated?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah, we're deﬁnitely spending time right now working on the growth across the two
Companies. There's many discussions about which team do we want to do that
engineering in, and we're actually spending that time to re-plan both of them
together. You can imagine that Mellanox was, given how much time it was taking to
overall close the deal, that they just continued saying, we've got to run the Company
as normal. So, we spent this last month working with them to help understand where
we will grow together now, as we are one Company.
There are many things that several of the organizations can do together more
eﬃciently in terms of their investments, but it's the same thing when we refer to the
overall G&A organizations. Keep in mind, we have to move the processes and the
systems together to one Company, because we do hope to have them integrated
fully within the next year, but then any types of investments we see as probably
something that we can cross invest, and not necessarily have to invest externally. So,
those are some of the things that we are doing. There's of course, some eﬃciencies
in the G&A that we'll see over time, after we feel that overall integration that we need
to do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Colette Kress{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Got it. Since we've been talking about data center and Mellanox there is one
question that always pops up and I think a couple of the prominent companies in the
data center space have talked about maybe a little bit of a diﬀerent shape to
calendar 2020 with some -- a lot of work from home-based and other types of cloud
spending in the beginning of the year, and then a little bit of, I don't know, concern
among some of the investment community about what is this -- what's the back end
of this pull-in or spending look like in the back half of the year and your Company is
at the -- right at the beginning of a big cycle with Ampere, but we had a little bit of
cyclicality and data center spending that aﬀected the business over the last couple
years.
So, you know, I think Jensen's talked about this in a couple of forums since the
earnings and you would speak -- spoke to it on the public call as well, what -- this
visibility that you have in data center now and maybe how the business is at scale
versus where it might have been a couple of years ago when there was a sort of
down cycle and spending and how you think you might manage through that over
the coming months?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yeah. So when we think about our turn the corner to introduce A100 this time versus
probably more than three years ago when we launched V100, there's a lot of
diﬀerences. I would agree with you on the scale. The scale of the business are
essential installed base as well as our partnerships. Our partnerships with
hyperscalers across the world, as well as a strong piece within cloud, and the
beginning of what we see in terms of enterprise workloads and what that means.
Now, when we introduced overall V100 and we started the work with the overall
hyperscales, that's time to incorporate one of the most important pieces, which is
called qualiﬁcation period. That qualiﬁcation period, depending on where they are
using it in their infrastructure can take time. We did a little diﬀerently with A100. A100
whether you think about the full software stack or you think about all of the diﬀerent
hardware components, it is sold with an overall baseboard and the overall AGP's
together.
So, you can synchronize everything and all of the hardware around it, as well as the
software to ease and improve the overall qualiﬁcation time period for that. That was
very helpful to our initial customers. They know that we have worked to ﬁnd the best
overall components to buy -- to ﬁnd the best overall software to run in all of their
diﬀerent types of environments. So, that is something that's very diﬀerent than what
we had with V100. We have begun overall sampling with them, and if you think
about our overall development process, it probably incorporated a good point of
input from the overall hyperscales in terms of what we need.
A100 is unique. A100 is maybe what you would refer to as a universal platform. It is
not geared just to training this time. It is not geared just to inferencing. It has theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 10Matt Ramsaycapability of a platform to do both. It also has the ability to create multiple instances
at the same time, so that you could choose to have part of those instances be overall
training, part of them overall be inferencing and many other diﬀerent types of
combinations around that.
Creating that overall ﬂexibility is really helpful when people are choosing their
overall compute workload that they want to do. We want them to say, I just have the
overall A100, I don't need to determine which one of the SKUs I need to overall
purchase through them. So, there's a lot of overall beneﬁts with A100 as this launch.
Now, yes, further about or what is demand? What is demand when we think about
where we are right now in COVID-19 as well as there are and can be sometimes
cycles in terms of the overall procuring?
Those cycles are pretty much a statement of getting the overall data centers ready, if
you are a large purchaser, and how you work through that process of setting up the
data center and getting all the pieces before you insert the overall compute through
that. We have indicated those we moved into Q1, as well as when we move into Q2,
we've indicated that we do have visibility. That visibility is strong as we go into Q2,
but we're going to need a little bit more time to think through what does that look
like for the second half of the year. This hasn't been a quarter in Q1 and or Q2 that
we refer to it as Poland's.
We don't have any view that there were any Poland's associated with the purchase of
overall Ampere or any other part of the overall data center business. This is a case
where AI can be and we hope it will be overall strategized as a key type of
investment that people make. An investment not only in hyperscales in the cloud,
but as the enterprise turns this corner, how do they remain competitive in this
environment if they are not overusing AI. We've seen overall COVID-19 though have
people turn to their existing compute, to use overall NVIDIA products to help them
both solve solutions, to solve the overall virus, whether it be looking for why certain
people get the overall virus versus others, but also looking how they can improve
their process.
As you can imagine, if you think about storefronts and retails as they are opening up,
they want to assure that they have the distancing. The overall distancing within their
stores, and they are keeping track of that with the overall use of AI. So, there's a
tremendous opportunity that the unfortunate virus brings, but this is also an era
where when you think about your future, you will think about how do I stay
competitive and use overall AI in those scenarios?
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Now, thanks for that. I think, just in the interest of time, we might want to jump in and
talk about gaming a little bit, considering it's such a big part of the Company, but I
just say that the team at Cowen has done quite a bit of work on Edge Cloud, and I
think it's very interesting to see Ampere bring inference and training into the same
piece of hardware that can be virtualized and I think maybe save that conversation
for oﬄine because I think there's a lot more work to do there, but just quickly divingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27

Page 8 of 10Colette Kressinto gaming that there's a push/pull with COVID there as well, a ton of people stuck
at home gaming, driving interest in demand for your products, at the same time
there's the iCafe market remains really challenged in Asia and I think there's been a
bit of a mixed change between desktop and notebook in your own business.
So, do the best you can talk about the moving parts as we get into the July quarter
with gaming and maybe an unusual year with some of the conferences moved
around and diﬃcult launch dates changed around as well as how you're thinking
about the next couple of quarters and gaming at the moment is there?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Let's start in terms of the base, in terms of what we saw in Q1 regarding gaming.
When we had announced overall guidance for the quarter all the way back at
Valentine's Day, we were in the initial stages of the overall virus. At that point, it had
not moved to a pandemic and it was really just taking place in the Asia-Pac overall
area. An important part of the market though for us, we indicated that we expected
impact to our overall gaming business. Now, during the quarter, this is what we saw.
We saw it move to an overall pandemic. We saw a shutdown of the overall retail
channel almost across the world. Additionally, the overall iCafes were shut down for
a period of time in overall China.
What that led to is, work from home, learn from home, and probably one of the most
important pieces, entertain gaming at home that says, if there's nothing else to do,
and you are in your home, it was a great opportunity to use that time in your spare
time for the overall gaming and we saw that consistently across the world. That
means in terms of people on our platform, whether that be steam, whether that be a
GFN, or other things that we could see people increasing their time gaming,
increasing the number of hours that they were gaming, but also those increasing just
number of people on our overall platform.
So, we're really pleased with those results, but let's talk about what we saw as that
movement from retail to e-tail during that quarter, fairly eﬃciently. So, you could
imagine that the overall channels of things going into retail versus e-tail is quite
diﬀerent, but it moves quite well. So, people were looking for some form of ability to
get the gaming that they could purchase e-tail and we also saw people probably
looking for things that are dual. Can I game and also have a compute mobile
workstation or work computer, excuse me, through at home. And so we saw some
strength in our overall notebook business as well.
Now, as we turn the corner to looking at Q2 and our overall guidance, we're going
to still, we believe see a solid interest in the overall gaming as much of the things
around the world are still in a bit of shutdown mode, and slowly improving. Our
iCafes are still practicing distancing as well in there. So, they may be open, but
they're not necessary open to a 100%. And that's something that we took into
account when we thought about our overall guidance, but I think the most important
thing is the underlying strength, even in the good times, and in probably some ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 10Matt Ramsay
Colette Kressthe more challenging times, gaming becomes front and center as a great overall
platform to overall entertain.
We've increased that over the last 5 years to 10 years as well, that it is probably one
of the most economical forms of overall gaming because it can be something that
you have with an existing platform that you purchase, and you can either have an
add-in card, or you can buy an overall (inaudible) -- overall notebook to do that. As
you know, we're also in the overall consoles on the switch. So, that has also helped
just the overall need for gaming during this challenging time.
So, you asked in terms of what we think in the next couple quarters. As you know,
we're all working virtually. We have so many conferences and we sit in front of our
little screen and on little videos, and I think that will continue. We're getting better at
it. We've been doing it now for about 12 weeks. So, I think the industry will adapt. We
were able to launch A100 from, you know, Jensen's kitchen. I'm not sure anybody is
going to worry about the conferences, I think they'll still get the information of the
great games that are going to be coming out.
As we get to the end of the summer, we're going to be starting to think about both
back to school, and we are going to be starting to think about the holiday. Those are
great times for games. And, when games come out, people also do that second
purchase as they purchase their overall compute, to play the games. So, we're still
excited for that. It's just going to be a diﬀerent format and in terms of how people,
you know present that information.
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Now that makes sense. I, yeah, I think you said, we're all getting used to this new
virtual world put together as we're doing now. Just in the interest of time I'm getting,
there's a little interface up here to my right that has red, yellow and green lights on.
Some lights are starting to beep at me, but I wanted to have you touch just brieﬂy on
the automotive business.
I know that the guidance was down 40% sequentially, but obviously a huge
opportunity for the Company over the next 5, 10 years in autonomous driving. I think
the near term revenue will be what it is, but maybe you could talk a little bit about
the level of investment that you're making in the automotive space and how you
expect that to sustain through the near term bumps in the auto market?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So, to remind everybody in our Q1 results that we've reported, our automotive
business did have some impact due to COVID-19, but as we guide it for overall Q2,
we do expect the automotive business to be down 40% sequentially. That is really
associated with our legacy infotainment systems as much of the overall automotive
industry both as manufacturing was signiﬁcantly injured during the COVID-19 and
also the overall demand for the purchase of overall cars. We continue to work with
them in terms of long-term, on the overall AV solutions and the work in terms ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-05-27
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 10Matt Ramsayproducing overall AV across a spectrum all the way down to ADAS up to our overall
robotaxis. Over the last several quarters, we've continued to work even in the
COVID-19 arena, on thinking through how best they can optimize the auto motive
spend on building out AV.
They like the idea of one single end-to-end platform that takes them to ADAS to the
high level types of robotaxis or overall self driving, and the reason why is the overall
testing, the overall software development is a lot of work, both for them, as well as
the work that we are providing individually. If they could standardize on a platform
that takes them all the way through those diﬀerent pieces, it helps them both,
possibly faster to market, but also really helping them with the overall time that it is
taking to build out these overall platforms.
Now internally, we continue to work with automotive companies in terms of building
out that software platform with them. In many cases, we have speciﬁc agreements
that we're working together for them. Now, when you think about our software
development, remember, we have a universal and uniﬁed architecture across the
Company that we use in terms of our overall hardware. And then the software is kind
of an added on top of that for the speciﬁc industries. And that's what you have with
automotive. And so we're able to really treat it as a vertical and our overall
investments there in terms of bringing out AV.
{BIO 17978411 <GO>}
Got it. Not to cut oﬀ the conversation abruptly, but I think we're getting the virtual
hook given the time we have together, but congratulations on Ampere and closing
Mellanox we'll be all awaiting, I think that would be Ampere launch in the gaming
space. And thanks to all of you for spending a bit of time with Cowen. We very much
appreciate it and thank you, everybody.
