Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's 2021 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. We're glad you could join us today. My name is Martin Viecha. I'm
Tesla's Senior Director of Investor Relations.
There will be two parts of today's meeting. First, the formal part of the meeting will
cover the nine items that stockholders have been asked to vote on. After the voting, I
will introduce Tesla's Co-Founder and CEO, Elon Musk. He will give a presentation
about Tesla's year in review. At this time, I'd like to thank the members of the Tesla
team and Board who are here with us today.
A representative from PricewaterhouseCoopers, Tesla's independent auditor, is
present on the phone with us as well. But before we begin, I'd like to introduce you
to Robyn Denholm, the Chair of Tesla's Board, who would like to say a few words.
{BIO 5964382 <GO>}
Thanks, Martin. Well welcome to the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting -- here in
virtual form this year. We hope next year be able to have our regular in-person
gathering just like we have over the last decade.
Since we last met as a shareholder group in September of 2020, a lot has happened
at Tesla. I want to recap some of the things that have happened over this last 12FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 2 of 24months.
So in the 12 months that ended September of 2021, we have delivered over 800,000
vehicles. We've also started new production lines in Shanghai. We've commenced
the pilot production of our own in-house battery cells. On top of that, we've
constructed two new gigafactories on two diﬀerent continents, including the one
that we're here today in Texas.
But maybe most importantly, our mission of accelerating the world's transition to
sustainable energy remains at the center of what we do. Over the last 12 months,
Tesla has continued to help shift the public perception of electric vehicles. It wasn't
too long ago that many people were still questioning the future of EVs. I would say
that today that's no longer the case.
There is no doubt that the transition to sustainable transportation and the
transportation industry is turning electric. In many places around the world, you can't
drive down the street without seeing many Teslas, which, to me, is an incredibly
proud thing and a testament to our progress.
While our performance to date has surpassed many common expectations, we
believe that we're only at the beginning of what the long journey ahead that we
have. As we disclosed in our impact report this year, by 2030, we are aiming to sell
20 million electric vehicles per year and deploy 1,500 gigawatt hours of energy
storage per year.
Our mission is clear. The automotive sector and the energy sector have to become
fully electric. There's no question about it. While producing and selling 0.5 million
cars in the last calendar year is more than most expected, we need to continue to
grow exponentially to create a true impact for the planet and for our shareholders.
I also want to acknowledge that Tesla's achievements so far and our future
aspirations would simply not be possible without the unrelenting eﬀorts of our
amazing employees. Each and every one of them who globally now number almost
100,000, are doing everything that they can every day in the name of our mission.
While our investors might recognize some -- a handful of Tesla executives or
directors, we know that Tesla's success is due to the creativity, the ingenuity and the
sheer hard work of our tens of thousands of employees globally.
As we expand into a truly global manufacturer, we are committed to making sure
that we employ, grow and retain people with a passion for what we do and are
aligned with our mission and our values and culture globally.
I also want to acknowledge and thank my fellow Tesla board members who've been
unwavering in their commitment to Tesla to help grow, guide and evolve the
company and its governance practices.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08

Page 3 of 24Martin ViechaAnd I especially want to call out and thank Antonio Gracias as this will be his last
shareholder meeting as a Board member after 14 years of unrelenting support and
being on the Board. He's made a signiﬁcant part of Tesla's journey, and a key
member of the Board for all of those years. Antonio, we appreciate everything that
you've done for the company, and we will miss you.
And lastly, I wanted to say thank you to you, all of our shareholders. You are an
intrinsic part of our journey and this unique journey. We're proud to say that our
shareholder base is probably the most committed, most active and most engaged
base I've ever seen.
Thank you for spreading the word for us, for being with us through our ups and
downs, and we wouldn't be here or where we are today without your support. We
are focused on into deliver to our mission and for you for many years to come. So
now I will hand it over back to Martin, who's the Chair of our meeting today. Thank
you. Thank you.
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
I will now call meeting to order. Please refer to the meeting agenda that is posted on
our virtual meeting site. The time is now 4:36 p.m. Central time, and I declare that
the polls are now open.
We have already received, over the past few weeks, voting proxies from our
stockholders, meaning that almost all of the votes that will be counted were already
submitted before this meeting. However if you wish to vote your shares or change
your prior vote, you may do so through the virtual meeting site.
Tesla's Board of Directors has appointed Computershare Trust Company to serve as
an inspector of election for this meeting. Computershare has taken and signed an
oath as an inspector of election and has certiﬁed that starting on August 26, 2021,
the proxy materials or a notice of Internet availability of the proxy materials were
mailed or provided to all Tesla stockholders of record as of August 9, 2021.
We have a majority of all the outstanding shares represented at the meeting, so I
declare that there is a quorum present and that we may proceed with the meeting.
These -- the items on the agenda are as follows. Number one, the election of two
Class I directors, James Murdoch and Kimbal Musk, to serve for a term of two years.
Number two, to adopt amendments of our certiﬁcate of incorporation to reduce
director terms to two years. Number three, to adopt amendments to our certiﬁcate
of incorporation and bylaws to eliminate applicable supermajority voting
requirements. And number four, to ratify the appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla's independent registered public accounting
ﬁrm for the ﬁscal year 2021.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08

James McRitchieTesla's Board has recommended that our stockholders vote for each of the director
nominees and for proposals 2 and 4. We have also received ﬁve stockholder
proposals as described in our proxy statement.
I would like to remind our stockholders that Tesla's Board has prepared a statement
in opposition to each of these proposals, which appeared in our proxy statement.
The ﬁrst stockholder proposal is an advisory vote regarding reduction of director
terms to one year. Our Board has recommended that our stockholders vote against
this stockholder proposal.
The stockholder proposal is proposed by James McRitchie, who is on the line to
present this proposal. Mr. McRitchie, I would like to invite you to speak, you will have
three minutes.

Shareholders should be able to participate in frequently -- frequent elections of all
Board members, preferably on an annual basis. This proposal should also be
evaluated in the context of Tesla's overall corporate governance. Shareholders
cannot hold special meetings backed by written consent, nominate directors
through proxy access.
At our 2020 Annual Meeting, 56% of shares voted in favor of my advisory proposal
eliminating supermajority requirements. The Board is now letting you vote to repeal
those supermajority requirements through proposal number four. However notice
the Board takes no position on this measure.
That probably means Elon Musk and his inner circle are voting against it. Without this
measure obtaining a 67% approval rating means the Board's proposal to move to 2-
year terms or mine to move to 1-year term will pass. This is essentially a way for the
Board to look like they want to increase the frequency of elections without actually
doing it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08

Thank you, Mr. McRitchie. The second stockholder proposal is an advisory vote
regarding additional reporting on diversity and inclusion eﬀorts. Our Board has
recommended that our stockholders vote against this stockholder proposal.
The stockholder proposal by Calvert Research and Management, whose
representative Kimberly Stokes is on the line to present the proposal. Ms. Stokes, I
would like to invite you to speak. You will have three minutes.
{BIO 19197052 <GO>}
Thank you. Tesla states in its 2020 Diversity Equity and Inclusion report that it is on a
mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We at Calvert
Research and Management heartily support this eﬀort and understand how
important it is to invest in companies that are leading the charge to a net zero
economy.
However we also know that it takes human resources to achieve these goals and ask
Tesla to demonstrate how the company's human capital management strategy and
speciﬁcally its diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, supports the level of
innovation and collaboration necessary to achieve this goal.
The business case for diversity is clear. Numerous studies demonstrate the beneﬁts
of a diverse corporate workforce. These include better ﬁnancial returns, superior
stock performance and importantly, research shows that diverse and inclusive teams
support more innovation. Tesla's 2020 DEI report last suﬃcient quantitative and
qualitative information for investors to adequately compare the company's
performance over time and relative to peer.
What the report does reveal is that Tesla's leadership is 83% male and 59% white
despite having what the company described as a majority minority workforce, all at a
time in which Tesla's customer base is evolving and growing more diverse.
Calvert asks that Tesla's reporting includes the process the Board follows for
assessing the eﬀectiveness of the company's DEI program and the results of that
assessment. We also ask that Tesla disclosed its full EEO-1 report, a comprehensive
breakdown of Tesla's workforce by race and gender according to 10 employment
categories, which is already collected and provided to the United States Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission every year.
In its DEI report, Tesla states, "We do the work required to ensure that our culture is
diverse and inclusive as it is collaborative and driven." However in order to fully
understand whether or not Tesla is executing well on its stated strategy, the companyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 6 of 24Martin Viecha
Kristin Hullmust be more transparent about its policies and practices and do the work to
provide investors with reliable, consistent and comparable data that we need to
make informed investment decisions.
We acknowledge that Tesla is committed to integrating DEI reporting into the
company's annual impact report but want the Board to understand that Tesla's
disclosure lags far behind peers. In 2020, Calvert analyzed the top companies held
in our core portfolio.
At that time, less than 20% were disclosing EEO-1 data, including Tesla. Following
our engagement, 70% of these companies have committed to disclosing their full
EEO-1 report on an annual basis.
As shareholders, we are concerned that Tesla's lack of focus on diversity, equity and
inclusion could hinder the company's ability to innovate in the future. We urge the
Board to commit some full disclosure rather than incremental ineﬀective action.
Thank you.
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. Stokes. The third stockholder proposal is an advisory vote regarding
reporting on employee arbitration. Our Board has recommended that our
stockholders vote against this stockholder proposal.
This stockholder proposal is proposed by Nia Impact Capital, whose representative,
Kristin Hull, is on the line to present the proposal. Dr. Hull, I would like to invite you
to speak. You'll have three minutes.

Thank you. Hello. This is Kristin Hull. Can you hear me? I am Dr. Kristin Hull, Founder

Proposal 7.
This resolution requests that Tesla's Board of Directors oversee the preparation of a
report on the impact of the use of mandatory arbitration on Tesla employees and on
its overall workplace culture.
Why is this report needed? After this week's headlines and many other employee
allegations of racial discrimination, we, as investors, need a look under the hood. The
use of mandatory arbitration limits employees' remedies when it comes to both
harassment and discrimination.
Precluding employees from suing in court often keeping underlying facts,
misconduct and case outcome secret, these clauses may allow harassment and
discrimination to continue, hidden from other employees and from investors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 7 of 24Martin Viecha
Michael GarlandBias, discrimination and harassment in the workplace create unknown and
uncompensated risks for investors, inviting unnecessary legal, brand, ﬁnancial and
human capital issues to a company.
On the ﬂip side, the beneﬁts of a positive and inclusive company culture with diverse
teams include access to top talent, better understanding of consumer preferences,
fewer blind spots when it comes to leadership decisions, more informed strategy
discussions and improved risk management. A diverse workforce and the diﬀerent
perspectives it encourages has also been shown to produce more creative and
innovative workplace environments.
Of particular relevance to Tesla, research shows a strong link between diversity and
revenue from innovation, where companies with above-average diversity produce
signiﬁcantly greater revenue from innovative products or services than those with
below-average diversity. Many technologies with which Tesla may compete for
recruitment and hiring such as Adobe, Airbnb, Google, IBM, Intel, Lyft, Microsoft,
Salesforce and Uber no longer use these policies.
Tesla simply cannot rest on its laurels, assuming its ﬁrst-mover advantage will last.
Given the allegations raised by over 100 past employees, these racial slurs,
discrimination in promotions, a retaliatory culture and lack of response from human
resources investors are counting on Tesla to step up and make human capital
management a priority.
Tesla is a known leader in innovation, and it's time now for Tesla to also lead when it
comes to promoting a fair and inclusive workplace. Tesla's Board is asked again to
complete the requested report to determine if mandatory employee arbitration is in
the best interest of Tesla, its employees and its shareholders. Thank you.
{BIO 17153377 <GO>}
Thank you, Dr. Hull. The fourth stockholder proposal is an advisory vote regarding
assigning responsibility for strategic oversight of human capital management to an
independent Board-level committee. Our Board has recommended that our
stockholders vote against this stockholder proposal.
This stockholder proposal is proposed by comptroller of the City of New York, whose
representative, Michael Garland, is on the line to present the proposal. Mr. Garland, I
would like to invite you to speak. You will have three minutes.
{BIO 17159207 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair, (inaudible) Board members and fellow
shareholders. The New York City pension funds are long-term Tesla shareholders
with roughly 1.3 million shares, representing nearly $1 billion of capital at risk.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 8 of 24Our proposal calls on the Board to assign responsibility for strategic oversight of
human capital management to an independent board committee that will, one,
review corporate policies and practices principal strategy and management of
workforce-related matters, including those related to addressing workforce equity
and inclusion and compensation for employees other than executive oﬃcers.
Two, oversee the extent to which Tesla's policy standards and requirements are
applied consistently across its operations. Three, oﬀer guidance on strategic
decisions that may have an impact on the workforce.
Investors are increasingly focused on the essential role that eﬀective human capital
management plays in creating long-term shareholder value and to the material risks
created by poor human capital management practices such as those exhibited by
Tesla. We had four of the ﬁve shareholder proposal at today's meeting focused on
work on human right to serve as a wake-up call to the Board.
Under new SEC disclosure rules, companies are expected to include human capital
measures and objectives that the company focuses on in managing the business.
Many boards, including at Ford and GM have signaled greater attention to human
capital management by deﬁning explicit oversight responsibilities in committee
charters.
In opposing proposal 8, the Board claims that independent Board committees
already perform the requested functions. The Board highlights the role of its
compensation and audit committees play in overseeing workforce management and
workforce issues.
However neither the compensation nor the audit committee list these
responsibilities in their charters or in the proxy statement. According to its charter,
the Compensation Committee's responsibilities are limited to compensating
executive oﬃcers and Board members and administering the company's employee
beneﬁt plans.
Finally, in opposing our proposal, the Board also asserts that our supporting
statements references one-sided allegations from media headlines, lacking context
and facts and that we are drawing speculative conclusions from them. Let me now
delineate some facts that underscore the need for the requested board
responsibilities.
In March of this year, the National Labor Relations Board upheld an earlier ruling that
Tesla active unlawfully when it ﬁred a union activist in carrigated and disciplined
workers issued a new restriction in response to workers exercising their labor law
rights. And by threatened workers against -- threatening workers against unionizing
via a tweet from CEO, Elon Musk.
And just this week, a jury ordered Tesla to pay $137 million to a former worker over
racist treatment. Unlike other Tesla employees who will -- racial discrimination, theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08

subject of Proposal 7 and able to pursue his case in federal court.
Our fundamental concern is that Tesla's weak labor management practices pose
material risks to the company's exponential growth. We expect the independent
directors we elect to provide the oversight necessary to protect the long-term
interest of the company, its employees and its shareholders. We urge shareholders
to vote for Proposal 8.

the Democratic Republic of Congo.
A similar human rights proposal signed by the sisters received nearly 25% investor
support last year. We again urge all Tesla shareholders to support Proposal 9, which
requests that the Board of Directors commission an independent third-party report,
assessing the extent to which Tesla is eﬀectively fulﬁlling its responsibilities to -- in
respect to human rights and engagement in responsible sourcing practices.
Today I challenge the Tesla Board and shareholders to apply the same eﬃcacy,
eﬃciency and high step quality standards to the supply chain from source to factory
to showrooms where Tesla's ingenuity and creativity excel in its latest models which
delight the consumer. 2021 is the international year for the eradication of child labor.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08

Page 10 of 24Martin ViechaThe UN agenda for sustainable development seeks to end child labor in all its forms

Under the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, Tesla has a
responsibility to respect human rights within company-owned operations and
through their business relationships, including suppliers. Pope Francis in May 2019
urged that mining be at the service of the human person and their ineligible
fundamental human rights, not vice versa.
Having human rights compliance at the center of your activities, we ask that you
acknowledge the harms done to people and planet through your current -- to your
current organizational model and recognize that today's world urgently needs social
and environmental sustainability, demanding a balance of economic growth and
holistic well-being of people and planet.
We invite you to join initiatives to advocate for better regulation and adjust
enforcement of existing laws by all duty bearers; ensure all supply chains are ethical
with zero tolerance of child labor; implement just working conditions, safety, fair
wages and hours for each and every person within the company; support with
funding local initiatives that promote a sustainable and diversiﬁed economic
development at the upstream of the supply chain; and ﬁnally, complete the ﬁnal

Welcome to the Annual Shareholder Meeting. Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
So we've had a fantastic year. Thanks to the great work of the Tesla team. I'd just like
to start oﬀ by just thanking the Tesla team for the incredible work over the past year
to get where we are. Well done.
So we have record vehicle deliveries, as we've already reported this. But you can see
that there's a pretty -- I mean I think this might be the fastest that any large
manufactured object has grown. Like -- yes. Certainly, one of the fastest, perhaps the
fastest. It looks like we have a good chance of maintaining that into the future, really
dependent on supplier challenges.
So if -- basically, if we can get the chips, we can do it. So hopefully, this chip shortage
will alleviate soon, but I feel conﬁdent of being able to maintain something like this,
at least above 50% for quite a while.
The Model 3 became the best-selling premium vehicle globally. So if any premium
vehicle -- I once got arrested at one point for claiming that we'd do 5,000 a week,
literally. Anyway this is great. We think the Model Y will be the best selling vehicle of
any kind globally.
So I think it will exceed the Model 3. I think we've got a good chance of it being the
best-selling vehicle by revenue next year and then I think quite likely to be the best-
selling vehicle in just -- of any kind, numerically in 2023. So basically, we need Olsen
to get online and Berlin to get online and reach volume production, and then I think
that's going to happen.
Cash -- in terms of free cash ﬂow generation, obviously we had some tough years
back then. I think we're looking a little dicey to say the least in 2017 and 2018. I don't
want to go back there again. But we got through that and now things are looking
really good. So I think we'll see continued strong cash ﬂow generation.
And especially as you multiply unit volume times autonomy, and increased eﬃciency
in the factories -- because I think over time, you'll see all manufacturers will make
electric vehicles. And eventually, all manufacturers will make autonomous vehicles.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 12 of 24And I think Tesla's open to licensing autonomy because I think autonomy will be
such a signiﬁcant lifesaver and preventive of injuries that it is not a technology to
ourselves. So I think it will be morally right to license it to other manufacturers if they
would like to use it. So ...
And of course we made a lot of progress on cost reduction. So despite our average
selling price actually going down signiﬁcantly because with the introduction of the
Model 3 and Model Y, these are much lower priced cars, we've managed to still do
decently well on gross margin. So this is getting the average price down and gross
margin up is very diﬃcult, but we've managed to do that. So yes, it's good.
Our goal really is to make the cars as aﬀordable as possible. We are seeing
signiﬁcant cost pressure in our supply chain. So we've had to increase vehicle prices,
at least temporarily, but we do hope to actually reduce the prices over time and
make them more aﬀordable.
So yes, unfortunately, we just expedite -- I mean the sheer amount of money we're
spending on ﬂying parts around the world is not great, but hopefully temporary. So -
- and we need a lot of batteries.
Hence, a Battery Day this is what this shirt means. We have to -- but we are going to
need a lot of batteries. This is going to be a combination of batteries from our
suppliers.
And in supplier discussions, some of our suppliers have just asked me outright, are
we going to just put them out of business or something? I'm like, not at all. As many
cells as you want to make and supply to us at an aﬀordable price, we will buy. No
limit. They're like, oh, okay. So like you want to have -- yes, increase by 100%. It
sounds good to me.
So the basic plan is we're really going to order a lot -- I mean we have ordered a lot
of batteries from suppliers, basically telling suppliers literally go as much as you can
make, we'll take. We'll prioritize batteries for vehicles, but then use any excess cells
that we have in the Powerwall and Megapack because over time, we think the
demand for stationary storage is going to be at least as high as the demand for
vehicles.
So sustainable energy, primarily solar and wind, is intermittent. So the wind doesn't
blow up all the time, the sun doesn't shine all the time, obviously. So you need
batteries to buﬀer that power. So the fundamental pillars of a sustainable energy
future are basically solar and wind. Those are the primary stationary batteries and
electric transport. If you have those 3, then you have a sustainable energy future as
long as that sun is shining.
So some of the people ask me about fusion, and I like it as an idea. And by the way I
think it's totally doable. But there's a giant fusion reactor in the sky that shows upFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 13 of 24every morning and zero maintenance. So I'm like -- it sounds like a good deal. I'll
always catch a little bit at sunlight and power earth.
A shockingly small amount of land is needed to power Earth. It's like a couple of
hundred miles by a couple of hundred miles of solar panels will power the entire
United States. So it's like, okay it's not that hard.
Then I believe we calculated you only needed one square mile of batteries. So we
think like, wow, a lot of batteries. One square mile of batteries. It's not that crazy.
So we've got a plan to reduce the cost per kilowatt hour of batteries. Our suppliers
have similar plans. So this is really supplemental to our suppliers. We'll make cells,
they will make cells, we'll use them all.
The fundamental good of Tesla, I think is by how many years did we accelerate
sustainable energy. This is the fundamental, I think way to think of the value of Tesla.
So if we are able to accelerate sustainable energy by more years, that is good.
Hence, the need to grow quickly.
We've got three new factories. Giga Shanghai has done an incredible job. And Giga
Shanghai now exceeds Fremont in production. So actually, I'd like to just give a
special hand to the Tesla China team. So it's the best quality, lowest cost and also a
low drama. So it's great.
And -- but that said, we are continuing to expand our Fremont operations and
expect to hopefully increase Fremont output by 50%. So -- and that's still where we
make old Model S and Xs are made in Fremont.
But it kind of makes sense, especially for the high-volume vehicles to have
production that's at least on the continent where the consumers are. Otherwise, it's
just -- it's also not good for the environment to be shipping cars several thousand
miles.
So the basic idea is have the high-volume vehicles be where the customers are
approximately at least. Then also great progress with building Giga Texas, which is
where we are right now and Giga Berlin Brandenburg.
So just hand for those teams as well. The these factories will have cell production in
them as well. So this will be really kind of raw materials in, cars out. So really, really
big. Yes. I mean these things will be in like units of Pentagon basically.
Let's see. So impact report. There's a lot of, I think interesting stuﬀ in our impact
report. We go into quite a lot of detail on all things we're doing. And Tesla is
certainly a company that's -- tries very hard to do the right thing in all respects. We
try very hard to do the right thing in all respects.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 14 of 24We do not always succeed. But if you're looking for a company where we say is that
company really trying to do the right thing? That is Tesla. Okay. We really tried.
Okay. I mean that's -- anyway. So as I was mentioning, we've got the three parts of
sustainable energy future, solar and wind. But I think primarily solar will be the main
source of energy of sustainable energy -- and energy in general. Then you need to
store that energy with stationary battery packs and then you need electric vehicles
and electric airplanes and boats and whatnot. So yes, great.
Yes. Then the average life cycle emissions in the U.S., this is only going to get better -
- as we move to a sustainable grid electric vehicles, then obviously we move to a fully
sustainable energy economy, which is where we want to get to as quickly as
possible. The sooner, the better.
And can there be a carbon tax? I mean what the hell? So people to say like, oh,
comment that would beneﬁt Tesla. I'm like, yes, but it would hurt SpaceX. So how
about a carbon tax, which is really needed.
So see battery materials are deﬁnitely in cyclable, burning gas is not. CO2 is an
extremely stable molecule. Mars' atmosphere has been primarily CO2 for billions of
years. It's extremely stable.
So as soon as people worry about methane, do not worry too much about methane.
Methane quickly breaks down into CO2. Methane is not a stable molecule, CO2 is
extremely stable. So -- and of course you can recycle battery materials.
So you can think of batteries as essentially high-grade ore. So you can either get
your lithium and your nickel and the various constituents of the battery from rocks or
from batteries. It is much better to get them from batteries. So batteries are basically
a high-grade ore. And Tesla has already started recycling and there are a lot of
companies are going to because it basically pays to do recycling for batteries.
We're seeing increased extreme weather events. There's like wildﬁres. And here in
Austin, there was a massive snowstorm that turned the power oﬀ. I was actually in
Austin for that snowstorm in a house with no electric, no lights, no power, no heating,
no Internet. Couldn't actually even get to a food store. If you could get to a food
store, there was no food there.
That went out for several days. However if we had the solar plus Powerwall, the car
would have had lights and electricity and actually, you've had a StarLink Internet,
you'd have Internet too. So all the things you need for a prepper basically. If doom's
day comes, could be helpful.
So in factory safety, we've done -- we made huge improvements on factory safety. So
we're now 18% better than the industry average. So this is a this is great. It's always
tough with safety as you ramp through production lines and as you start up batteries.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 15 of 24A - Elon MuskBut then once it's in steady state, then the injuries naturally decline because people
get used to it iron out the issues. So we're seeing excellent battery safety at Tesla.
Our goal is to have the savings factory on earth.
Then AI Day I think it was important to change the fundamental perception of Tesla
because people do -- they sort of think of Tesla as a car company, and yes, we made
cars, but the AI part of Tesla was not well understood. Tesla is as much a software
company as it is a hardware company. We also do the chips. So we designed the full
self-driving inference computer.
We're designing a training computer that's going to be able to, we think be the most
eﬃcient neural net training computer in the world by far. We're seeing a tremendous
response. So daily applicants by role. As you can see, it's basically on the y-axis
there. Then after AI Day that's the AI applicants increased dramatically. So I thought
that was a very successful day. Team did a great job.
And yes, it's going to be a very important part of the future. Self-driving is obviously
one of the functions. I obviously have mixed thoughts about AI, and we're going to
watch out for AI being a danger. But it's happening either way. So I guess if we do it,
we can try our best to make sure it is positive. Good AI, hopefully. Yes.
Then I'm excited to announce that we're moving our headquarters to Austin, Texas.
Just to be clear, though, we will be continuing to expand our activities in California.
So this is not a matter of sort of Tesla leaving California.
As I said, our intention is to actually increase output from Fremont and from Giga
Nevada by 50%. So -- but we're just hitting the sides of the bowl. I mean -- If you go
to our Fremont factory, it is jammed. I mean it is jammed. It's like whoa. When we ﬁrst
went in there, it was like -- we're like a kid in his parent's shoes.
It was ridiculous, like tiny -- in a giant factory and now we're like, -- you can't be here,
like how do we put more stuﬀ? And it's tough for people to aﬀord houses and a lot
of people have to come in from far away. So it's -- we'll take -- taken it as far as
possible, but it's -- there's limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area.
So here in Austin, our factory's like ﬁve minutes from the airport, 15 minutes from
downtown. We're going to create an ecological paradise here on the -- because we
were out on the Colorado River, it's going to be great. So to emphasize gain
continuing to expand in California signiﬁcantly, but even more so here in Texas. So
with that, we can go to questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Okay so when will Cybertruck production begin? And at what rate will the ramp-up
happen?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 16 of 24Well so this year has been just a constant struggle with parts supply. So just to be
clear, if we had like ﬁve extra products, we would not change our vehicle output at all
because we were just basically limited by multiple supply chain shortages, like so
many times, not just chips. There were lots of supply chain shortages. So the -- so it
really wouldn't matter if we had like the semi-auto Cybertruck or anything, we would
not be able to make it.
And the semi in particular needs a lot of cells. So it needs a lot of cells, a lot of chips.
So that will be -- we've got to have enough otherwise, is pointless. So I think most
likely what we'll see is Cybertruck stock production and the next year and then reach
volume production in 2023.
And hopefully, we can also be producing the semi and the new Roadster in '23 as
well. So we should be through our severe supply chain shortages in '23. I'm
optimistic that, that will be the case. We'll see.
Will we do a stock split? Well maybe not yet. Maybe we'll consider a stock split at
some point in the future. But I think we'll not quite do that quite yet. Will we see
4680 battery cell production in Texas?
I don't think we will see 4680 production in Texas this year. But we are making 4680s
in California at a -- our pilot plant, which is a big plant by normal standards. It's like a
capable of 10 gigawatt hours a year. So it's just a mile away from our vehicle factory
in Fremont. So it's -- that basically -- that factory will be able to make more than
enough cells for Giga Texas to scale production of Model Y.
And I do want to emphasize like from the point at which a factory is able to start
making cars to where it reaches high-volume production is typically about a year.
That's considered very fast. So it's -- it takes longer -- or at least in Tesla land, it takes
longer to build the factory than it does to reach volume production once the factory
is built.
So like in Shanghai, we built the factory in 11 months, but to get to high-volume
production took about a year. So I expect something similar here. We'll start
production this year, and we'll deliver -- comfortably deliver some cars from Giga
Texas this year of Model Ys.
But we won't reach high-volume production until probably the end of next year. So --
but then I also expect we'll reach high level production, the 4680 cell here in Giga
Texas next year as well.
More factories. Man, it's hard to build a factory. I've said many times that prototypes
are easy. Production is hard. Like -- or whatever it's like 1% inspiration, 99%
perspiration. But I think for have on production, it's like 99% perspiration.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 17 of 24So I think -- I mean we might start scouting for locations next year, but I think we can
do a lot with Berlin and Austin, and expanding in China, so -- and expanding
Fremont. So the nice thing is like having at least a factory in Europe and a factory in
China, a factory in North America.
We'll at least have factories where for our high-volume products where -- that are on
the continent where most of our customers are. This is great. So we do not -- like one
of the biggest challenges we had in Q3 was can we get enough chips because like
there was a huge chip shortage. So that was a challenge.
And that got stuck in the Panama -- I mean the Suez Canal, of course have a -- so
these things you don't expect these things, but they happen. So I don't know, we'll
probably get to new factory locations, start to investigate them next year. Maybe
make a decision in '23. Does Tesla plan to oﬀer dividends?
We do not currently have plans for dividends. I do kind of feel like the time when a
company oﬀers dividends is it's kind of cresting the hill, if you will. It's not -- usually
not -- they've run out of things to invest internally. We have not run out of things to
invest in internally by a long shot. So , can we provide a quarterly update on energy
along with automotive?
Yes. I mean we need to make more progress on energy. The -- yes, this year has been
limited, like I said, the chip shortage -- the same chips go into our stationary battery
packs as in the cars, and we prioritize the cars. So -- and we need the inverters for
solar and that kind of thing.
So this year has not been a good guide for progress in energy. I think next year, it
will be probably a good guide, and we can start providing updates that I think
people would interpret correctly as opposed to having to explain where we either
had to short cars or energy and we pick cars. So . All right.
Yes, Model 2 is not a car. There's no Model 2. The 3 means E. So we're -- Model 3, we
try to do get the -- we're going to call it the Model E, but then Ford runs to sue is. So
we said, let's call it the Model 3. So it's S, 3, X, Y instead of you know. Anyway.
Gigafactory is getting bigger with each iteration. Not all Gigafactories will get bigger
with each iteration, I think. But yes, most of them they will get more advanced, more
eﬃcient.
And looking at sort of taking a ﬁrst principles approach to manufacturing, you want
to look at volumetric eﬃciency of a factory and the average speed of a factory is kind
of like the rocket equation, where delta V is like exhaust velocity times the log of the
start to end mass ratios. So I think it's something similar to that for a factory.
And you also think about like a chip, like do you make chips -- get more out of chips
by making them bigger or by bringing things closer together and increasing theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 18 of 24clock speed? And actually, I think there's tremendous opportunity in factories to
actually bring things closer together and increase the cycle time or clock speed.
There's actually, I think tremendous opportunity to improve the eﬃciency of
factories.
And Tesla's long-term competitive advantage will be manufacturing because all
cause will be electric. Eventually all cars will be autonomous. The thing that's the
hardest to, I think sort of match Tesla on or copy is manufacturing. So I think that will
be the long-term advantage of Tesla.
Yes, limiting factors growth is engineering. Yes, there's really not a like factory
stamping out amazing engineers. So it's hard to -- you've got to basically recruit
people. You've got to train them in the right way and this just takes time. It -- like
sometimes companies think you just hire anyone with an engineering degree, slap
them together and get amazing stuﬀ. This is not the case at all. Often adding more
engineers to a program makes it go slower.
So-- and the excellence of an engineer matters tremendously. There are the huge
diﬀerences in engineering talent that are -- boggles the mind. But I do wonder today
like if Nikola Tesla applied to Tesla, would we even give him an interview? I'm not
sure we would. It's like we should, obviously. So that does concern me like, I think we
could do a better job of vetting resumes.
And really, we're just looking for evidence of exceptional ability. Like not whether
somebody graduated from a particular school or whatever. But like just three bullet
points, evidence of exceptional ability. And do you say wow, if you read those three
bullet points, then great. That should be the approach. Okay.
I'm actually a big fan of the original VW sort of bus. That was really cool. I haven't
really seen the new one. But yes, I mean I think over time, Tesla will make basically all
major variants of vehicle, why not? One in every signiﬁcant category, I think. Yes. All
right.
So I guess people can see these slides, right? So I'll just -- I don't need to read the
question. Yes. I think we're actually making rapid progress with Solar Roof. So lar in
general and energy in general, got kind of a short-changed for a couple of years
there because we're desperately trying to make the Model 3 and reach volume
production.
So we just moved everyone from anywhere in the company that could possibly work
on Model 3, I was working on Model 3. It was all hands on deck, as you know.
So there's just a couple of years where we just -- if we got to save -- if Model 3 fails,
the whole company is dead, so we just could move everyone from solar from every
to help with Model 3. So we're a couple of years behind on that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08
Tesla Inc (TSLA US Equity)
Page 19 of 24But I think we're now making rapid progress with the Solar Roof, and in particular,
with new homebuilders. Obviously the most eﬃcient way to get a Solar Roof is to put
it on -- put a roof on once instead of like -- doing retroﬁt is obviously fundamentally
more expensive than just than doing Solar Roof on new homes. So we now have
relationships with a number of new homebuilders. We expect that -- those to gather
signiﬁcant momentum.
Then we're going to have a campaign, which is kind of like, well, updating myself
here, I want my MTV. So I want my solar. Where is it? So I think so you were actively
asking in new home developments, well, does it have a Solar Roof in a Powerwall
because then you generate your own power and you can help stabilize the rest of
the grid. We're using the Powerwall. We're doing this in partnership with utilities.
Like the thing that I think people need to appreciate is that there's a lot more
electricity production that needs to occur as we move to an electric vehicle future.
For two homes where both cars are electric, power electricity usage will
approximately double.
And so if you don't have local power production at the homes with a battery
because the battery is got to buﬀer the power. Otherwise, if you just have solar
without batteries, it causes these massive waves in the grid. So you have to have the
batteries to stabilize the grid.
But those batteries can then act collectively to stabilize the whole grid. That's
software that we've developed that is -- I think we're ﬁrst going to go into Houston,
Australia, that's going to be, I think quite compelling.
But you really need for a sustainable energy future, you have to address electricity at
the homeowner level. This is essential. But there will still be very prosperous future
for utilities because electric power will approximately double. Then if you transition
heating to electric as well, it approximately triples.
So this is a lot of work both at the local level of electricity distribution and at the
utilities. Utilities better expand and there's got to be solar and batteries at the
homeowner level. But having a Tesla solar with battery means that you have power,
no matter what. If the utility shuts you for is for any reason, you still have power.
When I was here in the Austin blizzard, it's like I was just staying at a friend's house,
but you didn't have the solar roof in battery. So I'm sitting in the dark in the cold. I
was like, okay we really brings home the need for the solar roof and battery. So
anyway so I think that's going to see -- I think Solar Roof will see massive growth in
the years to come. 10.2 is (inaudible) Yes.
There is too much inside baseball on FSD. But the -- we're going to start rolling out

have a perfect score. Then we'll start giving it to people with 99, 98, 97 and so forth.
We'll probably have to have some cutoﬀ. It's like 60%. I don't know. But it's got to be
willing people who are extremely conscientious drivers for the beta program. So --
but it's looking really good.
I actually drove here from a friend's house I'm staying out in Austin, which is quite far
away and has quite a complicated drive, and the car took me all the way from my
friend's house to the Gigafactory with no intervention. So perfect drive. Yes.

the audience? Sure. Or you can just yell or whatever I don't...
(inaudible).
{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
When will we not need to do any more mining for batteries? Basically, it will be a
while because we've got to extend the ﬂeet. So the ﬂeet of cars out there is gigantic.
There's about 2 billion cars and trucks in use in the world. So that's a lot. So annual
global capacity for vehicles is $100 million a year roughly, which kind of makes
sense. Like cars and trucks tend to last about 20 years before they go to the
junkyard.
So that's important an important statistic to bear in mind, like even if all cars were --
and all vehicles were electric tomorrow, it will still take 20 years to change out the
ﬂeet. So I think people don't -- like you see a lot of noise and sort of stories about
electric vehicles.
But the ﬂeet is what matters. And -- so it basically rounds down to nothing. If you
look at total ﬂeet of vehicles on earth and electric cars at this point, I think are still
well under 1% of the ﬂeet. So -- but I don't know, probably 30 years-ish, 30, 40 years.
Yes, it's not bad. Yes.
Yes. I think clarify a few things that are sometimes misunderstood out there. Lithium
is extremely plentiful. It is one of the most plentiful things on Earth. It is not rare at all.
It's hard to avoid lithium.
If you said, where can we dig a bunch of rock that doesn't have some lithium in it?
You would have a hard time. It's in seawater. It's -- basically lithium is salt. So where is
this salt? There's a little bit of salt pretty much everywhere. So there's lithium
everywhere. So that's not an issue.
Also lithium is only like maybe you 1% or 2% of the cell. So the actual thing that
matters is the cathode. And most of our -- well, actually, our higher -- our long-range
vehicles use a nickel-based cathode, and people think it's a cobalt-based cathode.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-10-08

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantNo cobalt is used in phones and laptops, but we use nickel because nickel has
higher energy density for long-range vehicles.
But for our standard range vehicles and for stationary storage, I think all of that will
move to iron-based -- iron cathodes. Iron is also extremely plentiful. Nickel is not
rare, but there's -- some 10 to 100x more iron than there is nickel.
So moving to an iron-based chemistry, which is sort of ﬁnally at the point where it's
competitive on range when combined with an eﬃcient powertrain, I think that will be
the vast majority of batteries in the future will be iron based. So I do not see any
shortages. It's just a question of making all the equipment to kind of process that
into a cell and then into a pack.

Yes. I'll pick one up. By the way our safety score calculation is obviously imperfect.
That's why we try to emphasize very much that it is beta, if not alpha in safety score

accuracy substantially over time. This is really just -- it's a very early stage algorithm.

{BIO 1954518 <GO>}
Yes. Doing 100 megawatts in the Houston area. We're talking to ERCOT about doing
other major installations. The Tesla Megapack system is actually really great at
dealing with power ﬂuctuations. So if you look at power usage, it varies dramatically
during the day.
So you get particularly on a summer day or winter day if you've got electric heating
or electric cooling, then you're going to see big spikes on hotter or cold days. And --
so just even during the day you see big variances.
Then from when -- like in order for a power -- if a power grid has no sort of energy
storage buﬀer, then it's as resilient as the worst second of the worst day of the worst
year. So that's not -- that's obviously not great.
And they sort of -- they'll throw peaker plants in there, but the peaker plant is reliant
to natural gas, and then people start using natural gas for heating, which is kind of
what happened in Houston, people were using the gas to heat then the peaker
plants and have the gas. And like, okay but batteries would work great. So if there've
been Tesla Megapacks here during the -- waste power would not have gone out.

Tesla insurance. Yes. so -- like the degree in which insurance is a regulatory labyrinth
is insane. It was like designed to be hard feeling you guys. I don't know if it's -- but it
certainly is very diﬃcult. So there's a zillion applications, and you have to wait for a
bunch of time. And get it's come long and complicated and a lot of it is state by
state. Most of it is state by state. So we're just processing applications in states across
the country.
Then the states also have diﬀerent regulations. So you can't actually -- aren't legally
allowed to oﬀer the same insurance in every state. So you've got to adjust the
software to be diﬀerent every state. It's basically very complicated. But I think we'll
be oﬀering it in Texas very soon. And like maybe in a month or something. Next
week. Great. Phoned a friend.
So yes, so Tesla insurance goes live in Texas next week. I knew it was this month, but -
- and then we have it in California. We're going to be upgrading the version
California because in -- we want to have the same kind of real-time insurance that --
where your insurance costs are based on your driving history, which is like the right
way to do it.
But we're currently not allowed to do that in California for some reason. So we're
trying to get permission from the regulators to be allowed to give accurate scores
like that's the thing you'd want to do. Then hopefully, I don't know, we probably have

least dangerous ATV. So if you're going to ATV, well, you miss will have the least
dangerous ATV.
So we'll have a really low center of gravity because the battery pack will be down low

What about electric planes? Yes, yes. We have a lot on our plate here. But electric
planes, yes, I've been dying to do that for a decade, honestly. But we got to -- we got
quite a few ﬁsh to fry here. So maybe a one day the electric plane.
Battery energy density is improving every year. So that's an important metric to get
the sell energy density to around 450-, 500-watt hours per kilogram and have a pack
eﬃciency of around 400-watt hours per kilogram, that's when electric planes start to
get interesting.
So it'd be a fun problem to work on at some point. But we have a lot to do over the
next few years. So we're going to focus on these things, get them right and maybe
one day to do that. All right. Thanks, everyone, for tuning in. Thanks for being here.
