Good afternoon. My name is John DiFucci. I cover software at J.P. Morgan. And
welcome to the afternoon session of the J.P. Morgan Tech forum at CES. We are very
happy to have with us here today Bill Duﬀ, who is the CFO of the Operating System
business at Microsoft. We also have Lisa Nelson, the Director of IR in the audience.
Bill is going to open it up with some opening remarks. And then I'm going to ask
some questions. About midway through the session, I will turn it over to the
audience so please don't be shy. Ask whatever questions you like. I have enough
questions to get us beyond more than the half-hour we have. But please this session
is for you so if you have any speciﬁc issues you want to touch on, Bill will be the guy
to talk about it. Bill.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Thanks, John. I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to be here. This is
great. I wanted to brieﬂy talk a little bit about the Operating Systems Product Group
at Microsoft. So I'm the CFO of the Operating Systems Product Group. This product
group is where we develop the platform software and services that power a lot of
our devices across the Company. And so, we power -- we develop the operating
systems for Windows PCs and Windows tablets, Windows Phone, our embedded
operating system. And our embedded operating system business. And in addition,
we are developing the underlying Xbox software and Xbox LIVE services in this
product group as well.
So we have a broad diversity of products that we are developing in this product
group. And there's a lot of exciting things that are happening across the board. This
has been a very big year for us. On the Windows side, we recently launched
Windows 8.1. We felt like we drove great improvements to the platform. We are
seeing good uptake of Windows 8.1. We are getting excellent customer feedback on
8.1. And we were just overall very pleased with the product of the Windows platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Page 2 of 11We are also very excited about our hardware partners and the devices that they are
bringing to the market. So it's been great from that perspective after launching it this
fall.
On Windows Phone -- really 2013 was a big year for us on the Windows Phone side,
as far as growth and momentum. We launched the Windows Phone 8 software a little
bit over a year ago. And since that time, we've seen signiﬁcant growth in the
Windows Phone ecosystem. We are outselling iPhone in many markets. We've really
solidiﬁed our position as the third global mobile software platform out there. And in
many markets in Western Europe and other areas of the world we are exceeding
10% market share in those markets. So we feel good about the momentum on that
business.
The embedded business -- I don't know if everybody in the room is familiar with that
business. That's where we help our enterprise customers connect their industrial
products to the Internet; get them connected; get them managed. There is a
tremendous opportunity there. This is a business we have been in for a while but we,
again, think that over the next three years this is a signiﬁcant area for us to focus on.
We think there is a big opportunity there.
Then ﬁnally, Xbox. We launched Xbox One in the fall. And we feel great about the
product and great about our sales results thus far. Really we brought together the
Operating Systems Product Group to drive a single platform that developers can
target. And so, developers are incredibly important part of our ecosystem. And we're
really bringing together our core software platform and services such that
developers can really target the aggregate volume of Microsoft.
We have a lot of volume out there today. But generally developers have to target
speciﬁc products. Going forward and where investments are going to go forward is
to bring together that entire story from a developer ecosystem perspective. We are
also very focused on delivering consistent, familiar user experiences across these
diﬀerent products. That doesn't mean that the same user experience is going to exist
on the Xbox and on a large screen TV as on a Windows Phone. So we are going to
focus on tailored, targeted experiences for those devices. But we are also going to
invest in seamless experiences and familiar experiences across our entire device
category.
Then ﬁnally we are going to invest a lot in our core platform services. We've invested
a lot in Xbox LIVE and in Windows Live. And this product development team is going
to continue to focus on those core platform services and make sure that those core
platform services are delivered across our entire device family.
So there is a lot going on. There's a ton of new devices coming out. There's clearly a
lot of energy and excitement in the device ecosystem from PCs to tablets to phones
to embedded devices. And we feel good about the opportunity going forward. And
so, we are pretty excited.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Bill. That's a great summary of a lot of things happening in your
group. I guess at ﬁrst I want to just focus a little bit on the PC OS. Windows XP end-
of-life comes in April. We've seen more positive or more promising results out of PC
shipments -- especially corporate PC shipments. How much of an impact do you
think that the end-of-life support for XP has had on that? And do you think we will
continue to see that at least through the next quarter? But after that, do you think
we'll see perhaps a lull? Is Microsoft expecting -- if that is happening -- a lull after the
end-of-life comes and goes?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Business PCs have a relatively strong. It's been an area of growth for us over the last
couple of quarters. And we feel good about the business. We feel good about the
value we are delivering to enterprises. XP end-of-life certainly has had some impact
on that overall business, although it's very diﬃcult to parse apart. If you look at some
of the usage stats they came out publicly, you saw the XP install base decreasing,
whereas the Windows 7 and the Windows 8 install base increasing. And so, we feel
good about moving our enterprise customers onto our most modern platforms. But
it's really diﬃcult to say a couple of quarters out what the over overall impact would
be. There's other impacts that are going on in business PCs, the overall macro
economy, business hiring, things like that. And so, it is diﬃcult to sort of tease apart
the relative impact of XP. So I would say there is some impact. But not necessarily --
it's not the driving force, we don't believe, behind our business PC performance.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Turning to consumer PCs, are there any innovations because you have
to work with them and keep track of PC hardware vendors that you think -- are there
any new innovations that could perhaps renew the enthusiasm among consumers for
PCs?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
It's a really interesting question. I feel like there is a ton of innovation going on right
now in computing platforms in general, particularly on the hardware side. On the
software side, there is a ton of innovation is happening. You can see it with Windows
8 and all the diﬀerent form factors that are coming out and diﬀerent use cases.
We are pretty excited about that innovation. We're excited about some of the
devices that our partners brought to market for the holiday. We think they are great
devices, particularly on the low screen-size or the small screen-size tablets. There is a
number of devices, 8-inch tablets, that came out with Windows software on them
that are great devices. I've been using the Dell; it's a fantastic device. And we are
excited about the roadmaps going forward. In addition, touch is really interesting.
We made a pretty signiﬁcant bet on touch last year with Windows 8. And you are
starting to see, particularly in the US -- I think the latest stats I've seen is about 40%FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Q - John DiFucci
A - Bill Duﬀof the laptops that are being sold through the big-box retail channel in the US are
touch-enabled devices. So you are starting to see this innovation become more
mainstream. And we expect those types of continued innovations. And there's a lot
going on in PC land that's sort of broader when you sort of take a step back and
think what's happening with tablets with PCs with smartphones and just what's
happening overall in the computing landscape.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Since you mentioned touch, Microsoft has talked about optimizing Oﬃce for touch,
has been asked and talked a little bit about for iOS but also for Windows 8. Can you
give us any kind of update about where you think that is? And also, once you come
out with that and once -- because one of the things we've always looked at for
Microsoft to get a foothold in the tablet world was this is -- Oﬃce is something that
they own that makes them unique. But if you come out for touch and you also
expand it to Apple, well that expands the Oﬃce business. But it also may have a
negative eﬀect on your tablet business.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
I think -- I don't have any update on timelines or anything. I think we've talked about
how we are working on touch-optimized Oﬃce. Oﬃce, we believe, is in incredibly
strong productivity oﬀering and we are investing heavily in Oﬃce scenarios. I think
that just as historically Oﬃce worked across a couple of platforms, Oﬃce going
forward you should expect to work great on Windows devices. We don't necessarily
think about it as hurting the Windows value proposition. We actually think that once
we get a great touch-optimized Oﬃce experience on a great touch-optimized
Windows experience that we will have the best productivity experience out there.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. So Windows ﬁrst? That's sort of the --
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes, I think that we will focus on ensuring that Oﬃce is a great experience on the
Windows platform.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. I guess moving to something a little bit diﬀerent but also sticking with the PC
OS, I guess, what impact if any of you think that Chromebooks are having on
consumer and commercial businesses of Windows. We hear a lot of them. And I am
actually starting to see them a little bit more, within the consumer community
primarily. What impact -- has it been surprising to you to see some of the large PC
OEMs introduce Chromebooks in their lineup?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
In Chromebooks overall, we are seeing them in the education markets, for sure. You
are starting to see them a little bit in retail. You can see them at the big-box retailers
if you go into Best Buy. On the retail side or on the consumer side, it's primarily a lowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

low-cost devices in the channel. And we think we have a great value proposition
competitively versus Chromebook to have the power of a full Windows PC versus a
Chromebook. So we feel good about where we stack up competitively from a
product perspective. And as far as the overall ecosystem, I think it's a time of
experimentation. You are seeing it a lot at CES. You are seeing it pre-CES. It's a very
dynamic market right now. And I think people in companies are experimenting a lot,
along a lot of diﬀerent angles. And for us, really, the core focus is ﬁguring out how
we can deliver the best Windows experience and the best Microsoft services
experiences with Windows through our partners to consumers. And we are just laser
focused on that aspect of the business right now.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Okay. But have you -- you are seeing them out there. But I guess it would probably
be diﬃcult to note if it is having any eﬀect.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
You know, the statistics I've seen -- there's been a couple of reports that come out
over the holidays that, I think, slice and dice the distribution channel in certain ways. I
think from the numbers that I have seen, it's a single-digit share type thing when you
are talking about the overall US PC market. Then when you are talking about the
global PC market, even lower.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
I have a couple of questions. I'm going to move on to phone, your phone OS. You
mentioned Windows Phone has made some market share strides of late, especially
overseas. And we have been following that. What you think it will take to get greater
adoption and awareness in the US market? I noticed you had the 41-pixel camera.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Yes. And the 1020, which was great.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
It's a great device. But in the US -- but not only in the US but also another big market,
China.
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
We have seen strides in many areas of the world. And I think the last time that John
and I talked we talked about the global smartphone market is obviously enormous.
It's about in 800 million unit market. About 40% of the market is China. So when you
look at some of the global stats, it distorts diﬀerent platforms and how well they are
doing and in which customer bases they are selling to and things like that. And so,
whereas we have done very well outside of the US, in China, we are starting to get
better in the US. We are seeing share gains in US. And I think it's primarily just
getting the right devices out there, driving awareness. And making sure that we have
the right value proposition to our customers in the US.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 11Q - John DiFucci
A - Bill DuﬀWe are doing very well at the lower end of the market. So Nokia has a device called
the 520 that they are selling. This is a lower-cost device. It's much, much less
expensive than the latest iPhone or the latest Galaxy 4. And it's really hitting a sweet
spot in terms of price-performance trade oﬀ. And we're seeing a lot of customers
adopt that. So we are feeling pretty good about the sales growth and sales
momentum in the US. We would like it to be faster. We are certainly investing heavily.
We think the US is a critical market for us. And so, we continue to invest and drive
awareness and try to work with our partners, whether they be the handset providers
or the mobile operators, to get more devices out there.
China, the same type of issue. I think what we need to do there is we need to work
very closely with local partners and work with local carriers to penetrate that market.
It's complicated in diﬀerent ways than the US market. It is certainly a priority for us
and something that we are going to focus on. But I would say our highest priority
right now, beyond maintaining the momentum in the rest of the world is to gain
some momentum in the US market.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Have you been -- I guess the follow-up to that, have you been -- how has your
satisfaction then in regards to introducing devices that, in my view anyway, are
unique, with the camera. You are coming into a market that is dominated by two
other players. And you are the number three player. And to gain share you have to
do things that are somewhat diﬀerent, other than just putting Microsoft on the box.
How is that going? Because the cameras are certainly unique. And they are actually
pretty cool. And even if -- I even remember looking at phones and almost -- I didn't
buy a Windows Phone -- but realized that even the music system, the Zune system
for Windows phone at that time was actually, I thought, better then what else was
available. But it's hard coming in later. I guess how -- I do see the camera as
something unique. Are there are other things that you can --
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
You know, you bring up a good point, which is one of our biggest issues is continues
to be awareness, particularly in the US market. I'm not so much talking about
Western Europe or other markets right now. But in the US market, awareness
continues to be an issue. People just aren't aware of the devices that we have out
there, the value prop we provide. I think we have -- you mentioned music. Xbox
games are an area where we think we are somewhat diﬀerentiated. And just
productivity scenarios in general: our email client, our calendar client, our
integration with Exchange, if you use Lync in your enterprise environment. All of
these are great user experiences that are diﬀerentiated from our competitors. And
we are chipping away.
You mentioned a hardware feature where we introduced the Nokia 1020, which was
a 41-megapixel camera. It really blew away everything that was currently out there in
the market. And it's a great product. But you know it's getting the awareness. It's
getting the distribution channel to have enough critical mass where they are
investing behind the Windows Phone. It is getting developers to focus on getting
their best applications on Windows Phone. It's even as simple as having friends whoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Page 7 of 11Q - John DiFucci
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill Duﬀhave Windows Phones so they can demonstrate to show you, hey, look, look what my
phone does. It's valuable in this way or that way.
And so, we are still focused on awareness. We will still push on hardware innovation,
on software innovation. There is certainly more to come on the Windows Phone side.
But we think we just need to chip away.
What we found in Western European markets or other markets where we have
crossed that 10% threshold barrier is once you get up to a level of critical mass, you
get positive reinforcement and positive feedbacks, loops. And share gains begin to
get easier. So I think we are just at a certain stage in the US market. We are seeing
progress. We are going to continue to push on that progress.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Thanks, Bill. Any questions from the audience? There's one in the back here.
Staying on the theme of mobile phones, I would have two questions for you.
Number one is can you give us an update as to where your market share in the US is
currently? Then number two is I think you are about to close the Nokia deal. And I
may not have been paying attention. But I am curious. I would like to hear, what is
the strategy behind owning Nokia? Is it really critical for you guys to actually own the
hardware and the software?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
On the ﬁrst one, I am trying to think -- the latest stats, I think, are still in the mid-single
digits in the US and continuing to make progress. But we would like to make more
progress. With regard to Nokia, we entered into a commercial relationship with
Nokia a couple of years ago. And they adopted Windows Phone as their primary
smartphone platform. That was when we were shipping Windows Phone 7.
We worked deeply with them around those devices. And, really, once we started
shipping Windows Phone 8 and once we started that collaboration and that was
really a little over a year ago, that is when we saw more signiﬁcant momentum in the
marketplace. Both companies I think felt very good about where that business was
headed and that we saw that early momentum in the marketplace. But both
companies were also assessing their strategic objectives in mobile and where they
were going to head going forward.
Nokia was clearly assessing how they felt about the partnership and where they
wanted to take the business. We were doing the same thing. From a Microsoft
perspective, we saw signiﬁcant beneﬁts for acquiring Nokia and bringing them
internally. Part of it was to maintain existing sales momentum with Windows Phone,
which is incredibly important to us. We believe that the mobile business in general
and the phone business in general is important for us to have a strong position in.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 11Q - John DiFucci
A - Bill DuﬀWe felt like we could simplify and focus our eﬀorts as one company, as far as go-to-
market, sales, investments in marketing, investments in brand. Delivering on the
awareness that I had mentioned earlier was one of the things that we really needed
to drive, how we felt we were going to make faster progress in the market. And so,
that was certainly one element of it.
Then ﬁnally we saw an opportunity to work very closely with Nokia in technical
collaborations. We were still operating as two diﬀerent companies. You saw with the
Nokia 1020, which was the camera that John talked about earlier, that was the fruit of
a deep technical collaboration with Nokia. But there are things on both sides where
they would not necessarily share with us at an early stage. We wouldn't necessarily
share with them at an early stage where we can really move the needle on innovation
between the hardware/software layer. And we felt like that was an opportunity. And
so, over the summer we made the decision. And both companies made a decision to
put forward with the acquisition. And as you mentioned, we are still in the period
between announced and waiting for regulatory approvals and everything else for
the deal to close.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
I guess one follow-up to that because I think it's in an interesting topic. Microsoft --
and we are in the process of trying to ﬁgure out about what it is -- has done a really
good job, I think, recently in trying to monetize your patent portfolio. And we are
actually at this point trying to just ﬁgure out what the Android opportunity is. With
the Nokia patent portfolio, is there an opportunity there to do something similar?
IBM has done this fantastically for years. And it just seems like there's been a lot of
great development that's come out of Microsoft. But getting this portfolio from
Nokia, too, is there an opportunity to do that there?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
So the Nokia acquisition -- Nokia has one of the strongest intellectual property
portfolios in the mobile industry and has been a leader, obviously, for a long time in
developing their intellectual property portfolio. And in mobile, intellectual property
and licensing is a very mature and well understood -- there's mature business
relationships between all of the major mobile companies, as far as cross-licensing
patents and everything else.
And so when we decided to move forward with the Nokia acquisition, we structured
the deal such that we didn't acquire Nokia's patents or at least their core essential
wireless patents. So their intellectual property portfolio is retained by Nokia
Corporation and what's left behind with Nokia.
And really as part of the transaction, there were two things related to intellectual
property that were important for us. One is a signiﬁcant part of the value of the deal
was us signing a license with Nokia in order to use their patents. And we have the
use of their patents broadly across our product portfolio. This is something that we
would have had to do anyway or we were already working with Nokia on licensing
their intellectual property and their patents. And we already had ﬁnancialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)

A - Bill Duﬀtransactions with them. So as part of this overall acquisition, we have a license to
Nokia's core wireless patents.
In addition, the Nokia handset division had negotiated cross licenses with other
patent holders in the wireless space. Probably most notably, Qualcomm. But many
others, as well. And they were able, through their use of their patent portfolio and
through upfront cash payments, they were able to secure a very favorable -- what we
felt were very favorable IP licensing rates with other players in the industry. And as
part of our acquisition of the Nokia handset business, we are able to inherit those
patent agreements. So we are able to inherit the fundamental economics of those
patent agreements. Both of those pieces, as John mentioned, of the Nokia
transaction were very important as we thought about the overall value of the deal
and how we wanted to structure the transactions.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
I guess on the ﬁrst group, can you actually try to monetize those patents, or no?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
No. We are licensing patents from Nokia. And so, this is just a payment from us as
part of the overall transaction for us to license their intellectual property. There is a
certain number of patents we got as part of the deal that were design patents that
were more related to the hardware and other aspects of the assets that we
purchased. But I think the core of the way to think about the core of the Nokia IP
position stays with Nokia.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
Any other questions? Two. One here and then one over here. There's one right there
on the way.
Just two questions. One, how do you incent other partners in ACC, Samsung, other
guys in the environment to adopt Windows and Windows mobile in a bigger way? I
know you have historically charged for a license. What can you do to incent people
to do a few more designs of Windows over Android? Then secondarily on the cost
side in terms of supporting the Microsoft Windows OS, I'm sure you cannot talk
about be absolute levels. But what has been the trend? Has this been a business that
demanded 15% or 20% increases in the OpEx support to run this business? Is it now
at a stable level? What is the right way to think about that kind of going forward?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Let me take the ﬁrst one ﬁrst. On the Windows Phone side, what we are seeing is
increased momentum in market is going to drive -- it's the end-user customer
demand that is going to help us continue to partner with other hardware partners
around Windows Phone. And so when we look at over 2013, Nokia was by far our
largest hardware partner. We have other hardware partners that continue to ship
Windows Phone. And really what we need to do is continue to demonstrate end-userFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Bill Duﬀdemand for Windows Phone and work with them in ways that those hardware
partners can make money with our devices. I wouldn't say -- I would say that our
software royalty model and our software royalty strategy with Windows Phone is not
signiﬁcant friction in the overall scheme of things as they think about the opportunity
to make money with Windows Phone. So we continue to work with other hardware
partners besides Nokia. And we are looking forward to working with many more as
well. And actually over the past year, there has been increased interest in Windows
Phone because we are starting to see those market share gains. And they are
starting to see that there is customer demand out there.
With regard to your second question about the overall level of the business, we
restructured our ﬁnancial statements. And I think the ﬁrst -- I'm looking at Lisa -- the
ﬁrst time we reported with the new ﬁnancial statements was last quarter. And we are
really focused on we are going to have -- our ﬁnancial statements, the way to think
about them is we are going to have devices and consumer software licensing. And
we are going to report that as a segment, overall, from the revenue and COGS. So
revenue and gross margin perspective. And I think that that will give you a lot of
visibility as far as how we think our software licensing business is evolving over time
and what investments we need to support that going forward.
I think that over the past year we've invested more on the marketing front. You can
see a lot more advertising in terms of Windows and thinking about Windows
ecosystem broadly. That's a broad statement. That's not necessarily a speciﬁc -- one
speciﬁc product statement. You can see that from our advertising. And I think we will
continue investing in that marketing to draw that end-user demand into the
Microsoft Windows ecosystem.
{BIO 4099352 <GO>}
I'm sorry. I think we are out of time. But there was one last quick question, maybe.
I know there is a lot a focus on Windows Phone and the consumer side of the
business. But the bulk of the business that you manage is really enterprise client
devices. My understanding is also the vast majority of that revenue is really what we
would consider recurring revenue or annuity-based. Can you just talk about what
that looks like to you and how that grows over time with the base that you have?
{BIO 18415528 <GO>}
Thank you for pointing that out. There is a signiﬁcant chunk of our business which is
focused on enterprise and commercial licensing of Windows. We talk about in our
ﬁnancials we have the Windows Pro business which is generally software licenses
sold for PCs that are used in commercial environment and Windows core. But in
addition to those two licensing models, which are upfront licensing models where
we get paid when the device is shipped, we have a software assurance model. And
this is a recurring license that we sell directly to businesses that provide them
enterprise features on Windows. And it is sold more as a subscription model; it's
over a three-year period. We continue to see growth in that overall market. And so,
as with our Windows Pro business where we've seen growth over a couple ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-01-07

A - Bill Duﬀquarters, if you look at the Software Assurance business that has shown growth over
a longer period of time. And it's been a very consistent grower. And we expect it to
continue along that trajectory.
I think we announced in the past year that was about a $4 billion business, the
Software Assurance piece. Not in addition to the Windows licensing piece, the per
unit Windows licensing piece.
