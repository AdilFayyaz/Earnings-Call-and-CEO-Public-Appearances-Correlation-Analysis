Greetings and welcome to the Microsoft conference call.
(Operator Instructions)
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce
your host, Chris Suh, General Manager Investor Relations for Microsoft. Thank you,
Chris. You may now begin.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on the conference call today.
With me are Frank Brod, Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Oﬃcer. And
John Seethoﬀ, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel. Today's call is being
webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live
transmission in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the
call and view the transcript at the Microsoft investor relations website until
September 26, 2014.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements which are predictions,
projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on
current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

conference call. And in the risk factors section of our form 10-K, form 10-Q. And other
reports and ﬁlings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not
undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Last week, at our ﬁnancial analyst meeting, our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Amy Hood,
shared with you our new reporting segments. Today, we will review these segments
in more detail and we will provide the recasted ﬁscal 2012 and ﬁscal 2013 segment
information. We will also discuss the key performance indicators, or KPIs, that we will
be providing at our next earnings release in October. We are sharing these metrics
today so that you will have a better understanding of the information that you will
have available starting with this quarter-end.
On our website, Microsoft.com/investor, is our slide deck, which is intended to follow
our prepared remarks. You can also ﬁnd the related 8-K ﬁling and our recast
historical quarterly segment results on our webcast -- website. We will not be
discussing quarter results or any topics other than segments and KPIs today. Our
First Quarter ﬁscal 2014 earnings call is scheduled for October 24. And we'll provide
the results for the quarter at that time. Thanks again for joining us today. And with
that, I'm going to turn the call over to Frank.
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone. We announced last week that we are
changing our ﬁnancial reporting segments, eﬀective for ﬁscal year 2014. The new
segments reﬂect the organizational structure announced in July and the view used
by Management to analyze results and allocate resources. We had several objectives
in mind as we thought through this new segment reporting structure. Our goals were
to provide insight into our business model, transition and economics, to show
progress against our devices and services strategy. And to deliver increased
accountability on gross margins. Our new segments have been aggregated with
similar product and service activities and gross margin proﬁles. For example, all
hardware is now reported together in the hardware segment. This will enable us to
better monitor and manage our businesses.
The accounting and disclosure rules also require that Microsoft report its results in
the new segment presentation, beginning with the ﬁrst period in which the business
is managed on a new basis. So beginning in the First Quarter of ﬁscal year 2014, we
are monitoring performance internally at a business group level that results in ﬁve
new reporting segments plus corporate. On slide 5, for those of you who are
following along, the ﬁve segments roll up into two broad groupings, devices and
consumer. And commercial. Under devices and consumer, we have the hardware,
licensing. And other segments.
And under commercial, we have the licensing and other segments. We will also have
a corporate and other line, we will reﬂect one-time revenue deferrals and
recognition here, including things like tech guarantees and presales prior to general
availability of our new products. We will also continue to record corporate-levelFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

Page 3 of 15Chris Suhexpenses that are not attributable to a segment here. We will report revenue and
gross margin for each of these ﬁve segments. We will report operating expense and
operating income for the devices and consumer group and the commercial group.
Moving to slide 6, from a reporting segment perspective, we have changed from a
product view to one that is based on business model and customer segments. As
you would expect, our accounting methodology has not changed. The revenue and
cost of revenue, we will continue to directly attribute to the segments. Chris will walk
you through the revenue product mapping in just a few minutes. For operating
expenses, sales and marketing was previously directly attributed or allocated across
the segments. These expenses will now be recorded directly or by identiﬁed
customer segments.
In the past, the majority of our research and development expense was mapped by
product, with some shared across segments. Now R&D will be primarily shared, with
others mapped directly to the segment grouping. An example of direct expenses
would be our Xbox First Party games. The value of that expense only accrues to
devices and consumers. So it is appropriate that that expense is reported there.
The reason for sharing operating expenses across segments is that these expenses
drive value across the platform as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across
devices, whether on premise or in the cloud. In many ways, it is similar to our new
organization, which is now aligned functionally rather than by product. The new
ﬁnancial reporting structure will provide our Company with more transparency,
greater accountability. And better execution, not only for today. But also for the long
term. So now, I will turn the call back over to Chris, who will provide further details.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Frank. In order to help you update your model from the old reporting
segments to the new, we will now walk through the product mapping in detail. To
help facilitate this discussion, I will leverage numbers we have previously disclosed,
Unless otherwise noted, I will be referencing the Fourth Quarter of ﬁscal 2013. While
the framework uses last Q4, you should be able to leverage the mapping to
extrapolate to other periods.
So let's start with the Windows division here on slide 7. Last quarter, we reported that
OEM revenue accounted for approximately 65% of the division's total revenue. And
non-OEM accounted for the remaining 35%. All of the Windows OEM revenue is
now reported in the devices and consumer licensing segment. Non-OEM revenue
included surface devices and accessories, Windows volume licensing, hardware such
as keyboards and mice, retail Windows. And Windows services. Surface and
hardware are now shown in the devices and consumer hardware segment. Windows
volume licensing is primarily reported in commercial licensing.
There is a small portion related to academic or students, which will be included in
devices and consumer licensing. For retail Windows, approximately 90% of it will be
reﬂected in devices and consumer licensing. The remainder that is reported inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15devices and consumer other is related to the retail versions of Windows sold in retail
stores. And ﬁnally, Windows services is 100% reported in devices and consumer
other.
Okay, now let's move to slide eight to discuss Server and Tools. This one is a little bit
easier. As we've discussed previously, product revenue, including transactional and
multi-year licensing, was about 80% of the division's total, while enterprise services
was the remaining 20%. Going forward, all of our traditional licensing, including
server and CAL, will be mapped to commercial licensing. Enterprise services and
Azure will be reported in commercial other. Okay, moving to slide 9. For the Online
Services Division, Bing and MSN will now be 100% reported in devices and
consumer other.
Slide 10. In the Microsoft business division, business revenue accounted for
approximately 85% of the division's total, with about 70% related to annuity sales
and 15% being transactional. For annuity revenue, most of this revenue is now
reported in commercial licensing, with the exception of Oﬃce 365 and Dynamics
CRM Online, which will be reported in commercial other. All of the non-annuity or
transactional sales go to commercial licensing. For consumer revenue, which
accounted for roughly 15% of the total, is largely mapped to devices and consumer
licensing. The portion related to Oﬃce 365 Home Premium. And retail stores, are
now in devices and consumer other. As you look at prior periods, keep in mind that
the strength we have seen in our business annuity revenue in recent quarters has
resulted in business revenue becoming an even greater percentage of the revenue
within that segment.
For our Entertainment and Devices Division, Xbox revenue now lands in two
segments, console revenues, Xbox LIVE subscription. And second and third party
games are all recognized in the devices and consumer hardware segment. We do
include the Xbox LIVE and games revenue together with the console, as these
businesses are inherently linked to the Xbox console itself. First party games and
marketplaces, such as Xbox LIVE transactions, are reported in the devices and
consumer other segment. Windows Phone and IP licensing are mapped to devices
and consumer licensing. Skype will be reported in the commercial licensing
segment, consistent with the opportunity that we see within the commercial business
as we bring the technology and products of Lync and Skype together.
Okay. So that's the detailed mapping of the old to new product mapping. Starting
with the old segment ﬁrst, on slide 12, we bring it all together, now organized into a
new segment view. We think this is a helpful view that shows both the movement in
the numbers across a single table. And the underlying logic also becomes evident in
this matrix view as well.
Okay, I'm going to move now to slide 13. We want to provide you with a preview of
our updated KPIs. The best starting point for a thorough KPI discussion is to put
them in the right context. With each quarterly earnings release, we share our results
in a variety of ways. Our earnings press release, a slide deck of quarterly results, our
earnings conference call. And in the MD&A section of our quarterly ﬁlings. AcrossFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 15these various components, we provide our actual ﬁnancial results, as well the
material drivers of business during the quarter.
The KPIs are intended to be metrics that supplement the information we provide in
the earnings release and MD&A. The goal is to provide additional insight that helps
you understand our results. And also to gauge the progress we're making as our
business continues to evolve. We believe that in total, the information shared across
our earnings results, the MD&A, supported by KPIs. And combined now with the
addition of gross margin reported by segment, provide for a fairly comprehensive
and meaningfully improved way to understand how our business is doing.
So let's get into the details by starting with slide 14. I'd like to spend the next few
slides talking you through what is changing in the rationale. To ease an
understanding of the changes, these slides have been structured to start with the old
KPIs structure in the old segments. And then show you what has changed and what
has not. On this ﬁrst slide are the KPIs that are consolidated across Microsoft. At the
all-Microsoft level, we have historically shared with you bookings, unearned revenue
by segment. And the contracted not billed amount. For FY '14, we plan to keep all of
these KPIs. The bookings and unearned revenue are good representations of the
health of our business beyond the current quarter.
The contracted not billed balance, as you know, is the amount associated with multi-
year (technical diﬃculty). These KPIs together, we believe, are helpful, especially to
understand how much of our business continues to shift toward annuity and
subscription billings and recurring revenue streams.
Now let's go to slide 15, which, along with slide 16, are the segment-based KPIs. For
Windows, we are providing the following additional KPIs. First, within OEM revenue,
which is now reported in devices and consumer licensing, we'll share with you the
growth of Windows Pro and Windows non-Pro revenue. Second, in the commercial
licensing segment, we will provide you with the Windows volume licensing revenue
growth. These KPIs together will give you a fairly comprehensive way to gauge the
health of the Windows business. Also, starting in Q1, we will report quarterly the
revenue derived from our Surface products and related accessories as well.
For the Microsoft business division, we remain largely unchanged from the current
disclosures of consumer and business oﬃce and Microsoft business solutions
revenue. However, we are adding two important new KPIs, both related to our fast-
growing Oﬃce 365 business. First is the Oﬃce 365 Home Premium subscriber
growth. At our analyst meeting, Amy announced that we had reached the 2 million
subscriber mark for our consumer oﬀering. The second is Oﬃce 365 commercial
seat growth. These are primarily sold as part of a multi-year licensing agreement
diﬀerent from the consumer subscription. And hence we thought it was valuable to
provide this separately. For server and tools, we continue to provide you -- we will
continue to provide you both product and enterprise services revenue growth
metrics.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

OperatorNow let's turn to slide 16. For entertainment and device (technical diﬃculty), we will
continue to report Xbox console unit sales volume. Xbox LIVE and Skype are both
big services with many millions of members and users. And as such, we will continue
to provide updates for the user account as part of our earnings release materials
when we achieve notable milestone levels. Finally, online services. We will enhance
the current KPIs with the addition of our search share in the US.
Okay. So that's a lot of detail to walk through. Let's look at slide 17, where we put it all
back together in the new segment taxonomy. And this is what it looks like. The blue
items represent items that are new or materially changed. And we do think it is a
good step function improvement versus our current KPIs. And it does supplement
the rest of the earnings disclosures in a way that is both helpful and meaningful.
Finally, let's move to slide 18, which is our ﬁnal slide before taking questions. We are
now less than one month away from our Q1 earnings release, earnings release date
October 24. On that date, we will report our results of the new segments, including
all ﬁlings, commentary. And any forward-looking statements. At the same time, we
will publish the new KPIs, starting with the Q1 results. And as we've previously said,
we will still provide a supplemental table of the Q1 results in the old segments to
ease the transition and help bridge back to any forward-looking statements we
made last quarter. So with that, Frank and I will take some questions. Again, please
limit your questions to items covered only in today's call. Operator, please go ahead
and repeat your instructions.
Questions And Answers

Brent Thill, UBS.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
As it relates to your guidance and how you expect to get back, going forward, you
historically have given some metrics around each of the divisions. Is that -- in the new
reporting segment, is that the way that you anticipate helping the street understand
your forward look, as well, going forward?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes. When we publish our results in Q1, we will -- any forward-looking statements that
we make with the Q1 earnings will be discussed within the construct of the new
reporting segments. And so very similar to the old segments. But updated for the
new taxonomy.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
I'm wondering, Frank, if you could talk about the other allocation you had before,
how large you expect the other allocation to be here on expenses going forward?
And any changes you have made in terms of that bucket, given all the new
segmentation?
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
When you talk about the other allocation, are you talking about the other segment?
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Yes. The other -- more the corporate overhead. Should we expect to see a similar
amount of expenses attributed to corporate overhead? Or have you more granularly
allocated some of the previous corporate overhead that you had in the past?
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
You will see two separate allocations of other. One being at the gross margin level,
which will be more of the adjustments for large GAAP deferrals, like revenue
adjustments and all. On the operating expense side, I think you will continue to see
the same sorts of expenses in there that we had before. That represents our
corporate IT function. And ﬁnance. And G&A, ﬁnance and HR and things. So we
really don't have any meaningful change in that -- in the way we're doing that.
Corporate R&D had been in there, our basic -- the futuristic R&D had been there.
Now that, because of the way our R&D is being managed across the entire platform,
that is now being allocated.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Got it. Then just on Xbox, it looks like the game royalties in Xbox LIVE revenue is
going into hardware, which is a little strange, given that those are royalty licensing
type or subscription type revenue streams. That plus -- it doesn't look like you're
going to be breaking out the Xbox LIVE base anymore in terms of the numbers. I'm -
- it feels like we are taking the spotlight oﬀ of the Xbox LIVE. And -- which has been a
nice growing revenue stream. I'm just curious, the rationale behind that.
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
Our Xbox platform is monetized in several diﬀerent ways. We sell the consoles. We
sell accessories with that. We have a royalty model on second and third party games,
which are sold utilizing our technology. And we have Xbox LIVE, which is primarily a
subscription service. We look at those as being completely linked together. They
don't function without each other. Xbox LIVE is a key component. It allows for multi-
gaming for players. It provides downloadable game content through the store there.
It also has the ability to bring in TV services as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

Q - Keith Weiss
A - Chris SuhBut when you look at that together, that is all very much connected into our Xbox
strategy. And it's the way that our management team looks at the business. It looks at
it together. As -- what I will point out is, as the business evolves over time, the drivers
of the changes in revenue and proﬁtability will always be brought out. So you -- it's
not like you won't hear about Xbox LIVE anymore. But you will hear about the Xbox
platform in its total, especially as we launch Xbox One later this year.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
And -- this is Chris. I will just add to that, as I said my comments, we will continue to
discuss and talk about the membership numbers and other momentum as part of
our earnings materials, especially as we hit milestones. So okay. Thanks, Walter. We
will move to the next question, please, operator.
Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Thanks for doing this presentation. And giving us all this new information. Sounds
like we're going to get a lot more visibility into the business. First, a high level
question for Chris. As you were putting together this new reporting structure and the
new segment structure, any high level trends that you guys were trying to highlight?
Or do you think it better exposed to this reporting structure that you would like to
make us aware of?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, Keith that's a good question. I think probably the most important
nail[ph] that I will call out is the change to gross margin as part of each reporting
segment. Gross margin really is the primary ﬁnancial measure by which we are
tracking the health and the performance of each of these businesses. And as you can
see, the way that we've structured these segments, you can see actually fairly
diﬀerent gross margin proﬁles in each of the segments. And I think that is a good
and clear metric for you to be able to watch over time, to see our improvement in
gross margin, both from a percentage and a dollar perspective. So I think gross
margin is really the thing that I would highlight as the incremental improvement in
transparency and accountability in the new segments.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And is there any chance that we will see any -- for the new KPIs that your guys
going to be giving out on a go forward basis, any chance we are going to see any
historical data sets on where those KPIs had been over the past year or so?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes, I think where it makes sense, we will do so. Some things just -- looking back at
historical growth rates don't make sense, like I'll take Oﬃce 365 Home Premium.
Given that it's only really several months old now, we don't -- the growth rate goingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

A - Frank Brodback eight quarters will either be nonexistent or not meaningful. So to the extent that
it's an appropriate and meaningful metric, we will deﬁnitely give historical context on
it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And then maybe if I could sneak one last one in. When you guys closed at a
Nokia devices and services transaction, am I thinking about this right? That you're
going to have a big chunk of revenue that is currently in devices and the devices
licensing that's going to move into the hardware bucket? And once comes on
board? If you just give us an idea of how that would slot into the new reporting
structure?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
When you talk about movement, are you saying any current revenue that we
generate as a royalty from Nokia?
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Yes, I'm thinking that Windows phone licensing moves from one bucket into the --
from the licensing bucket into -- that would then be a hardware bucket? If you're
selling -- because then you would be selling the whole device.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
The hardware, no -- I think -- the ﬁrst point is, I think it's probably too early to say
deﬁnitively. But I don't -- I think the best way is to, once we close the transaction, we
will deﬁnitely update it. I think it is not unreasonable to think the hardware will land
with hardware. But I don't have any deﬁnitive statement on the royalty piece of it that
we currently get, that we'll have to sort that out once the transaction closes.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Just conceptually, wouldn't that be similar to a Surface device? Let me try to
understand. When you sell a Surface device, does the operating system on top of
the Surface device, that all goes into DNC hardware?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
That is true.
{BIO 3446588 <GO>}
(multiple speakers) We have -- yes, let -- Chris, maybe I can help you with that. Today,
we do move product from one segment to another. So a Windows license would go
in -- so what we do is value that license at a cost basis, moving from one segment to
the others. So there is a small amount of inter-segment revenue today. We will have
to look to see, now that that becomes more expensive after the Nokia acquisition,
whether we look at that policy. And look at what the most appropriate inter-segment
pricing would be. But the -- I would suspect it would impact both the -- where the
phone revenue is recorded as well as the hardware revenue.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

Jessie, can you move to the next question, please?
Mark Moerdler, Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
A couple quick questions. On the commercial side revenue growth, is that going to
be a dollar amount or a percentage growth? And which products are included in
that?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
It is a percentage growth. And it is comprised of all of the commercial cloud
oﬀerings that are reported in the commercial other segment. So that primarily
includes Oﬃce 365, Azure. But also Intune, CRM Online. It is the aggregation of that.
We -- it is a good measure of the performance of Microsoft's commercial cloud
business, if you think about us as a leading cloud vendor for business customers
around the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay. And on the MDD ones, on the Oﬃce, both of those are seats and a percentage
growth, correct? Rather than a dollar amount?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes. Those are seat growth totals, not revenue. And the seat growth -- for the Home
Premium, we did talk about hitting the 2 million mark very recently. And so that's a
good starting point, there.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Okay. And on the commercial seats that, if I have one product or I -- that -- the cloud
-- the Oﬃce 365, or I exchange online, for example, where I have the desktop
subscription, that counts as a seat. And if I have both, it -- that counts as one seat,
right?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
(multiple speakers) The cloud products or the SaaS? Yes.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes. A seat is a seat, if you -- whatever form of Oﬃce 365 that you happen to
subscribe to, a paid seat is a paid seat.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
And whether it's cloud or whether it's subscription?

Yes, I think that will become clear. As I said a little bit ago, to the extent that it makes
sense, if there is a good historical track record that fairly reﬂects the performance of
the business. Like I said, some of these new business, having a growth number that is
eight digits because it compares against, literally, an nonexistent number doesn't
make sense. And it probably does is not helpful. So we would show it. But to the
extent that there's an actual number that make sense, we will deﬁnitely show it.

Kash Rangan, BofA Merrill Lynch.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Hope you get some time oﬀ after investing the time to do this wonderful
presentation. My question is on the gross margin variability. Looks like, on the gross
margin side, you've got the devices and consumer hardware. You've got Azure and
you've got online. To what extent are you guys going to be able to provide us some
directional gross margin, considering there's a fair amount of volatility, variability in
this particular aspect of the P&L? And also, just wanted to clarify with respect to your
guidance. I think Brent asked this question. I just wanted to revisit that. Are you guys
going to be framing your guidance based on server units, PC units, as you have
done so the past? Or are we going to be constructing guidance in a diﬀerent way?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Okay. So I will start with the latter, which was the guidance question. We will be
sharing the framework -- the business driver framework at our Q1 earnings. We will
try to provide as much color as we can across the diﬀerent things that drive the
performance of the business. But I don't have the speciﬁc metrics and measures to
share with you today on that one, Kash.
On the ﬁrst question about -- I think your question was, are we going to provide
some sort of a road map on gross margin? And I will say that I think the new addition
of gross margin into the P&L's does help you see the performance of these diﬀerent
buckets of categories, if you will, of products. So hardware diﬀerent from traditional
licensing and diﬀerent from services. And I think, over time, you'll be able to see if
we are making progress from a gross margin percentage and a gross margin dollarFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

A - Chris Suhperspective. I don't anticipate at this time that we will provide a speciﬁc number as a
road map. But we will continue to evolve our thinking on that over time, I'm sure.
{BIO 22095432 <GO>}
Got it. Just if I could follow up very brieﬂy. I know that -- I respect the fact that you
may not be able to provide a gross margin guidance. But are you able to
qualitatively talk about the trade-oﬀs that you're willing to make? Are you going for
share on the Nokia side or share on the Surface side, at the expense of some short-
term hit to gross margins? I'm just wondering if there are ways to think about how
the margin outlook for the Company progresses?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes, I think it is a good framework. I think it is good for us to talk about the things in
each of these categories that drive our margin performance over time. Amy talked
about it at the analyst meeting, which we talked about speciﬁc to Azure and the
capital expenditures. And how we are investing in some sense ahead of the curve.
And that does result in some near-term margin pressure. But over time, as that
business gets to scale, that we anticipate the margins improving. So that is the type
of rationale and logic I think that we can apply to help you all -- share with you the
way that we think about things. And obviously, as we get more -- as we all, you with
us, get more and more accustomed to talking in the new framework, the new
reporting segments will continue to evolve and improve, hopefully, over time as well.
Next question, please.
Gregg Moskowitz, Cowen and Company.
{BIO 5721834 <GO>}
First question is the expected revenue recognition of unearned by quarter that you
will be providing. Will that be over the next 12 months, the remainder the current
ﬁscal year, or some other period of time?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
That is a four-quarter, forward-looking recognition schedule.
{BIO 5721834 <GO>}
Okay, perfect. Then going back to cloud, we all know that revenue is a lagging
indicator for any subscription business. You mentioned that you will be providing
commercial cloud revenue growth. But why not report commercial cloud bookings
growth as well?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
It's part of the total bookings growth. But it is good feedback. We will take it under --
we will go back and take it under advisement. And take a look and see if there is a
meaningful breakout of the bookings that may make sense and be helpful. And weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26

Operatorcan talk about it, maybe, on some of the earnings calls. But it is good, Gregg, I will
make a note of that.
{BIO 5721834 <GO>}
Okay. Great.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Operator, I think we have time for one more question, please.
Rick Sherlund, Nomura Asset Management.
{BIO 1504922 <GO>}
This is one of interpretation. I'm looking at slide 21. It shows hardware gross margin
going down from 2012 to 2013 quite a bit. So maybe if we can drill into that number
and understand that a little better. I think you probably have the charge, $900 million
on Q4 charge. And that, I presume, for Surface. Xbox units were down. So there is
less of a hardware gross margin -- gross proﬁt contribution. Xbox LIVE would have
grown. The second party titles -- software titles were down year over year. So that
might have contributed to it as well. I'm just curious what that number is telling us? I
think if I -- as I analyze it, it looks like there are parts of that business that have lower
gross proﬁt contributions. But ﬁrst, I guess, is the charge in there? And is there
anything more you can comment on in terms of the hardware piece itself. And what
this might be telling us about the margins on the hardware side?
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Yes. The ﬁrst oﬀ, yes, the charge is charges included in there. And so that is one of
the drivers of the margin -- year over year margins that you are seeing there. So the
$900 million charge that we took a couple quarters back is reﬂected there. Then I
think you are actually hitting on the right things. What is going on with Xbox, as we
get closer to end of a cycle on the current console, as well as the implications -- or
the impact of Surface. Those are the two things that I would point you to. I think you
are spot on.
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, all. So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's
conference call. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And thanks for your
participation. If you have any follow-up questions, as I suspect you will come as you
are updating your models, please do reach out to the IR team. And we will be happy
to help where we can. Okay. Thanks again, everyone. And we will talk to you soon.
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You
may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-26
