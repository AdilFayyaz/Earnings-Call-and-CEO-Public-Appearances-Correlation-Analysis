Seema ShahAnd with that, let me turn it into Anurag to give us a quick overview of the topic and
heads. Anurag?
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Thanks, Chen. So what we observed in last couple of quarters was really good results
from some of the IT services and software vendors that were speciﬁcally talking
about increased technology spending in the retail vertical. So, as a group, we
decided to dig through this issue.
There are a number of things that are happening right now. The declining cost of
sensors and data storage, along with the availability of wireless networks, which is
really proliferating connected devices throughout the ecosystem, whether it be the
front oﬃce or the retail store, or the warehouse. We are seeing a growth in Internet
of Things, machine learning, artiﬁcial intelligence, robotics, supply chain
management; and we will try to address some of them today in our brieﬁng.
So ﬁrst topic that we're going to talk about would be the increased use of robotics
and virtual reality in the store. Seema, our hardline analyst, would give you some
insight about how she is seeing those trends in her space.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Hi. Thank you, Anurag. As the robots and robotics has been around for a while and
now we're seeing them increasingly used in the hardlines retail space. One example
of robotics use is at Lowe's through their Orchard Supply Hardware stores in
California. They have a robot called the Oshbot, which you can see on the screen,
that's basically an in-store shopping assistant that helps customers ﬁnd products,
and it also displays ads and promotions and it's a good way to integrate other in-
store technology because we can see where the customer is and use that to
promote or to purchase certain item or to help the customer.
Amazon also uses robots. They have over 15,000 robots made by Kiva Systems, and
their performance that are -- they're using to sort and retrieve products for their
employees to pack it. So in the longer time, we'll probably see this trend continue in
diﬀerent aspects of the retail space within fulﬁllment[ph] or in the store itself, and it
may help retailers reduce the number of employees needed to provide the same
service, that could be a potential margin booster at long term.
In virtual reality, which is another technology we're seeing increasingly, again Lowe's
is at the forefront of technology, it has a 3D virtual room that allows customers to see
how diﬀerent merchandising color combinations would ﬁt in their home. Wayfair, the
online home furnishings company recently, I think, yesterday partnered with a
company called roOomy to display 3D images on two of its websites, so their
customers can experiment with textures, fabrics and get a good look at how this type
of furniture what they're buying would look in their home.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 3 of 16Anurag Rana
Chen GrazutisAnd I think these technologies allow the customer, particularly for big purchases to
get a better feel about what they're buying, they may be less hesitant to purchase
such a big item if they can see how it look in their home, so that may drive
conversion in same-store sales, and it may also help the company has lower the cost
for themselves because they need to have less physical inventory, now they don't
need to have 10 colors, they can show their customers the 10 colors online and
people can buy it and then order it. So you can have more just-in-time inventory
versus having it sit there and possibly going obsolete.
And lastly related to this, I would say, as Anurag mentioned, there is an increasing
trend of Internet of Things where you have increased number of connected devices
in your home. And Lowe's and Home Depot are two retailers who have created
programs called Iris and Wink, that help customers manage all these diﬀerent home
devices from diﬀerent manufacturers. And as that continues, it could be good for
them because it allows them to maintain the relationship with the customer along
after the sale is closed. So they're always with them and that might help drive future
sales.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Thank you, Seema, for that. The next area of discussion for us is smart cloud,
wearables. This has been a big driver for the consumer electronics industry for the
last few years. We have seen Apple talk a lot about it, everyone has heard of Fitbit.
This is becoming a big deal in the technology vertical, what we are seeing that is
actually keeping its way in the apparel area as well, and then Chen can give us some
insight of what he is seeing in his -- some of his companies that he follows.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Thanks, Anurag. So when, like you said, when we come to talk about wearables, we
probably are focused on what's available right now in the market, and like you
mentioned it's what we wear in our wrist.
At this some point, some of it is, the iWatch by Apple, which is kind of an example for
a smart accessory. And then the Fitbits, which are more like health tracking focused
accessories. We just heard the other day of Target making the big deal with Fitbit,
ﬂying over 300,000 of those bracelet to their employee.
In terms of the numbers IDC projected, they're going to ship 76 million wearable
devices this year, which is basically double what they did last year, and going
forward they see it growing over 20% on a yearly basis all the way through 2019. So
obviously the demand is there.
I believe this is just the ﬁrst step when it comes to wearables. I think the big
opportunity and lead time is the technology advances we are going to start seeing
the closing itself become what we call smart, the closing articles actually
communicate with other components of the system.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17

Page 4 of 16Anurag Rana
Poonam GoyalOne of the ﬁrst versions of this we saw a couple of weeks ago, and it's kind of a
surprising player in this market, the PoloTech shirt by Ralph Lauren. The shirt actually
has a built-in device that records work-out in real time and give you some
information about your performance. It comes at a healthy price, it costs about $295
which kind of lacks the appeal for the mass market.
What I think the future is that products may go beyond is simply capturing the data.
We might have built-in sensors that are going to be provide us with deeper insight
about our performance, that is going to give you some ways to improve it. At the
same time, they might have some predictive abilities kind of alerting you on an injury
that might occur, just interacting with the way your muscle moves. That's a really
interesting part of the business.
It's probably reasonable to assume that all the big athletic brands like Nike and
Adidas are in some stage of developing this product, we just heard yesterday from
executives in Under Armour in their Investor Day. They estimated that within 5 to 10
years, every article of clothing will have some kind of a chip in it. They will
communicate with an system that is going to be able to track what we do, how we
sleep, and kind of let us -- give us way to improve our performance in terms of our
sport activity or even just improve our health. So I think there is a big market down
the road, but we're not going to see it probably for another ﬁve years.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
That is very useful, I can't wait to wear one of these shirts. So, moving onto the next
area which is mobile, and since I cover technology, software and services, I'm going
to give you some insight of what's happening there.
Over the last few years, we've seen an explosion in mobile devices, in fact smart
devices in the workplace. That has completely changed the habit of how we operate,
needless to say we want information on our ﬁnger tips, whether it's work related or
whether it's personal related. So their lights have blurred quite a bit of how you work
with and then how do you shop.
Mobile applications are becoming a much bigger piece of electronic commerce at
this point, and what we are seeing at our end is, a lot of software and IT services
companies are creating new applications for companies such as, you could name it, I
mean, from Macy's to Target to Starbucks, all of them are using some kind of an app
to make sure they can give you either customized service or some kind of
customized coupons, or even payments through the system. So that is becoming a
mainstream item.
This topic, I think is applicable for all of our retail analysts on the call. I'm going to
start oﬀ with Poonam who covers Department stores.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 5 of 16Seema ShahThanks, Anurag. So as you said, mobile is obviously very important for retailers. And
any retailer that isn't or haven't already started investing in mobile is at risk of losing
market share.
So how are retailers investing in mobile? It's about 15% of more retail spending, and
retailers such as Amazon, Apple, eBay, Target, Macy's, you name it, they're all on the
mobile and they're all making huge investments to grow share through the mobile
device. You can see in the chart that Amazon, Apple, eBay and Target all stand out. If
you look at the right-hand side of the chart, more than 70% of their users time is
spent on a app, leading the pack is Apple, where 99% of the shoppers browsing
time is on mobile, so it's obviously very important.
How are these retailers driving time on the mobile? Various ways. One is through
mobile coupon apps, as you've seen Target has Cartwheel, which has been a huge
success and has driven many, many users new and existing to their mobile app and
to their sites. And it's all about making it easy to use, making it accessible and having
where it could be used in the store or online. And I think there is many more
examples whether it's the mobile app or it's J. C. Penney's mobile app, which
includes GPS based location ﬁnders.
So if you're near a J. C. Penney store and you've checked into it, you can actually ﬁnd
coupons for the retailer and walk in, that's a huge win for the retailer, any retailer that
has that app, as they can detect their shoppers and their interest, and get them to
come into the store. We know traﬃc has been dwindling at malls, at retailers. And if
you can ﬁnd any way to get the shopper back into the store, it's a huge win; and the
mobile helps you do that, because you always carry the mobile device with you, and
that's one easy way for retailers to reach out. I think Seema has some interesting
examples as well that she can share.
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Thank you, Poonam. Yeah, just to add to what Poonam and Anurag had said. In the
hardline space, mobile is increasingly an important component of the omni-channel
strategy. And we're seeing this, it's particularly as the size of smartphones increases
and most of mobile had been on tablets, but now with the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
you're seeing more people use their smartphones for mobile commerce.
And as Poonam mentioned, it helps shoppers make on the spot purchases or do
research while in store, and retailers can also tailor their mobile apps with their in-
store weekend to drive in-store conversion and close the sale.
In the hardline space, particularly one of the, I guess most integrated retail or online
and physical store presence, it has is at Williams-Sonoma, and last year I think they
saw an 80% jump in their mobile revenue as they focus on improving the
functionality and personalization of their mobile app.
Other retailers in the space like Home Depot, Tractor Supply and Auto-Beauty have
also improved their -- and reﬁned their mobile app. With the push, then the idea atFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Anurag Ranathe end of the day is that the customer will have a better experience, will have more
personalized content, better functionality. So wherever and whenever they want to
shop, they'll be able to see the content, get the content in their car and close the
purchase.
Overall, retailers, it's important push for retailers as the M-commerce market is
forecasted by eMarketer to reach 153 billion by 2019. Chen, do you have any
additional comments may be in.
Sure. I think it's interesting to look at a company like Under Armour that outside of
just using mobile devices for M-commerce, kind of took it to the next level, they
acquired a few apps a few months ago. I think, it was a little over $0.5 billion in
acquisition, and what it gave them wasn't just like an M-commerce platform, but it
actually created a community, people go in, they plug-in the work out, they plug-in,
while they eat on a daily basis, and they gave them 170 million people that are part
of community that kind of share with each other what they do or just basically give
themselves an indication of how they like to look on a daily basis.
The numbers that they gave, the few numbers they gave sound very interesting,
about 30% of those 170 [ph] users go on the app at least month to month to plug-in
their workout or their food. Another very, very interesting data point was that from
survey work they did, that (inaudible) people that actually use the app since the
acquisition, they visited and purchased 30% more than they did last year on the
Under Armour website. So using that app -- and being part of that community
actually push them to buy more, and average order value is also up 30%. So there is
deﬁnitely correlation as to how much a person use an app and use the mobile
platform, and how much he purchase from the same brand down the road. So, and I
thought it was very interesting.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Thanks, Chen. The next area where we're seeing a lot of traction right now is omni-
channel. Now retailers were talking about it for the last few years, the IT Services and
the software company has been talking about it last few years. But it's actually, this is
kind of a gift that's been keep on giving for the technology vendors for a while, and
this has made -- retailers are still spending a lot of money.
One of the things that we think here as a team, our retail team and the tech team that
is, Amazon is one of the major drivers of why this is happening. Amazon, same day
delivery, in order for any other retailer to compete with this level of service, I mean,
forget same-day, even if it's next day or three day delivery, you need to have a
thorough understanding of your supply chain, you need to understand what prices
are in diﬀerent parts of the companies. When I say companies, it could be the
diﬀerence between your Internet store, your retail store, your store that's part of a
department store. All of these inventory that's lying it on, you need to have a very
good handle on it before you can you give out this level of service to your
customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Seema ShahSo, now with that in mind, a lot of companies are completely overhauling at IT
infrastructure and spending a lot of money on it. And again, from the tech side, this
is for good for the IT services companies as well as the software vendors that are
giving us -- and selling the software. But I want to get some comments from our retail
analyst as to what is that, you know what is happening in their end. Seema, what
about your area, what are you seeing over there?
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Sure. Thank you. I just wanted to start oﬀ by stepping back, in case any of you are
new to the retail space or to understanding what omni-channel is. And just like a
brief background, omni-channel is basically in all -- a the term which describes the
integration of multi-channel retailing. So if you're selling in a physical store, online or
catalogs or through mobile is how is it integrated from the retailer side and from
your customer experience.
So it's not just the mobile app, it's not just what you see in the stores, it relates to
back-end infrastructure, such as inventory management systems, customer
relationship management systems and any other supply chain systems, how you're
going to get the product from the warehouse to the store or directly to the customer.
It's very important for retailers to build this infrastructure out and have a seamless
process as Anurag mentioned in order to compete with online players like Amazon,
but also to drive customer engagement, loyalty and eventually boost conversion and
sales. So, in the hardline space, in order to compete with Amazon, home
improvement companies are Lowe's and Home Depot at the forefront within their
sub sectors, together they sell over a million items online, and despite the size and
bulkiness of their items are able to ship to mostly the U.S. between 24 hours and 48
hours after the order.
And because of the way that they've managed their inventory and supply chain
systems and the delivery, there are diﬀerent warehouses that are able to get the
products out quickly to customers when they want them. They also have other
options which is increasingly common with retailers is to have a buy online pickup in
stores, the customers like it, they see it on their way home from where they can pick
it up, or ship directly to store, which may be cheaper for the customer if he don't
have to pay for shipping, or again it's on your way home. And customers basically
want to have choice. So that's what these retailers are providing.
Other retailers, such as Mattress Firm, they announced a deal yesterday to have an
online-only product to grab the attention of millennial customers who are not
comfortable making large purchases online without seeing it in the store at all, and
Mattress Firm is also working with Wayfair to oﬀer same-day delivery of mattresses.
So basically using mattresses for -- Mattress Firm over 2,000 stores as distribution
centers, so that went away from make the sale on mattress. Mattress Firm will deliver
it in the same day. So this, so what you're seeing is not just online, it's not just the
store, it's a combination, even Amazon has experimented with physical stores andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 8 of 16Poonam Goyal
Chen Grazutishas their Amazon Locker. So customers like the idea of having multiple -- have
choice, having a physical store, buying online, and that also makes the return
process easier, necessary. So, Poonam, do you have any other thoughts on omni-
channel.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Yeah. I think, one thing that you also want to keep in mind with omni-channel was
extremely important to be omni-channel integrated, you also have to understand
that it helps you save on the margin. So most recently, clothing[ph] exporters said
that had gross margin compression due to free shipping charges, or shipping
expenses, which are rising as both UPS and FedEx have been increasing their
shipping rates on each year for the past three years, as far as I can remember.
So what omni-channel also helps you do, and Seema touched on it brieﬂy, ship from
stores, pickup in store. As if you are a customer and you order an item in New York
city, there is no reason to have it shipped from California, a New York City store
should be able to sell that order. And what that does is, that also helps prevent the
fourth or ﬁfth markdown, so if you have excess of inventories in the address that was
just ordered, you can ship it from the store where there is excess inventory, or you
can ship it from a nearby store, which helps save on the shipping expense. So omni-
channel not only does it help drive sales, it also help save on margins by making sure
that your inventory is well-managed and well-distributed. So there isn't an overhead
with any one store or one location.
Macy's was probably the ﬁrst retailer that I can think of that moved in omni-channel
integration after the May acquisition about a decade ago, and right now they can
oﬀer same day shipping, which none of their peers really can in 17 markets; that's up
from eight last year. And that's just a start, we'll probably see more retailers come
and say to oﬀer a same day delivery as they all have to compete with Amazon in
order to gain share and avoid having to close stores.
And I think Chen has some examples to that he can probably share.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Actually I'm going to jump in and try to talk a little bit about the increase in spending
from some of the services vendor and the software vendor in this space.
Now, what this omni-channel has done is, it's given that if you have one single
infrastructure talking about trying to connect technology from one end to the other,
it's the neighbored companies to be more proactive when it comes to analytics.
They're able to do much better data mining of their entire customers behavior
records, and as -- in addition that, the data that they already own, plus the data that
they can mine from third-party areas such as Facebook or Twitter.
So the manage[ph] of structured and unstructured data is creating great
opportunities both for the retail industries in order to better understand theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 9 of 16Poonam Goyal
Seema Shahcustomer or the technology industry to sell their new solutions, which is driving
growth for both the areas. In fact, we can comfortably say that retailers that are not
investing in analytics would ﬁnd themselves a disadvantage going forward.
So with that, I'm going to try to get some insight from Poonam as to what she is
seeing there. And then after that I'll give you a quick background of what kind of
softwares we are seeing -- software spending we are seeing in this area.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Thanks, Anurag. As you said, data -- big data, I don't think anyone has mastered this
yet. But if there is a retailer that isn't moving towards that and may be left behind.
Data (inaudible) about that, retailers can't make target of eﬀorts to drive better
results. So in order to drive results, in order to drive consumer spending they have to
make targeted oﬀers as consumers are just inundated with too many oﬀers at this
point. So you need to be targeted, you need to make sure you give the consumer
what they want, and there is no better way to do that than to do it through data.
And the data, as you said helps drive loyalty, which is very important today as
consumers are more ﬁckle than ever before. So how they are doing this? And there is
one example, it's on Macy's, which I think is a pretty neat concept. So, I'm sitting at a
room with a bunch of friends and I like a dress that one of friends' friend is wearing,
but I'm too embarrassed to ask, I don't want to ask, I can take a picture, scan it on the
Macy's app, see if there is dresses that look like it and make a purchase if I ﬁnd one.
So the key here is as to build the successful app that can actually locate the item that
you scan precisely and match it to what you're looking for. That not only gives you a
purchase, but it maybe also gives you a customer for life, because you've now
helped that customer save time by going to multiple retailers, or even shopping
online and spending hours looking for something similar. And that's been a huge
success, or can be a huge success for retailers that can do it properly.
We also have seen Macy's launch, Smart Fitting Room app, which is also I think a
great way of just looking at what your consumers are shopping for, what they want,
what sizes they're looking for. Imagine yourself in a ﬁtting room and you picked up a
dress, and you're like oh! it's too small. And you want to know their size, but you're
too lazy to go out there and look for another size. But there is an app right there that
you can touch and say, I have a size two, and I want a size four, and you see it's
available here; order it online right away, or go pick it up in the store. That's also
going to help retailers to have drive sales in the future.
Anurag, do you want add some more thoughts? Or Seema?
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Thank you. I just wanted to add we know that data analytics are being used as
Poonam and Anurag mentioned, and also I'm seeing increasingly in the hard space,
mind space, people are linking their loyalty program, they're becoming more hi-tech
I should say their loyalty programs, that they can learn more about the customer andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 10 of 16Anurag Ranasegment their data, and as Poonam mentioned, have personalized direct marketing
messages.
GMC for example is able to send personalized promotions and messages to each of
its members of its GMC Gold card, and based on how the consumer is shopping or
what they've bought previously and that special relationship in connection helps to
drive converting into online or get people on the store and drives traﬃc.
Pier 1 has seen its direct marketing jumped 25% in the last year, and also in the
hardline space we've seen analytics in the products themselves. Select Comfort
Sleep IQ bed is actually using sensors and collecting data about a person's sleep
cycle which can then be analyzed, the customer is interested in understanding how
their sleep is aﬀecting their health and things like that. But I see increasingly, you're
seeing analytics use in the marketing aspect for these retailers to better -- they can
better understand their customers, they don't want to just spend money on
marketing, they want to spend money smartly. And the best way to do it is to target
the customer of what they want and what you think they will actually buy based on
prior experience with them.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Thanks, Seema. So, I just wanted to spend a little more time on this topic. This is I
think one of the single biggest area of spending amongst almost companies from
every vertical, and then a great growth driver for the software and services industry.
We just heard a couple of days ago salesforce.com launching its Internet of Things
Cloud. Oracle is really a big head, S&P is really big head, IBM has been championing
it's Watson product, but the real frequency[ph] here is that the manage or the
combination of structured and unstructured data, it's something I've touched upon
brieﬂy. But what is happening here is, initially what -- let's go back a few years ago, 5
year to 10 years ago with loyalty programs, retailers were able to identify what a
customer is doing based on their spending habits. They know exactly what they buy,
so they could send them coupon books at home ﬁguring out. But they only had one
piece of the information as to what they're buying in their store. They didn't have any
information on other preferences of the customer, or what are some of the future
things they are likely to buy. Then came the combination of structured and
unstructured data.
Companies are able to mine data from Twitter feeds, from Facebook posts, from
other areas where you could say sending emails to somebody and they're able to
mine as to what exactly could be something that you're looking for in terms of your
taste.
So with that in mind, a number of companies have developed these applications that
they do some predictive analytics, also called cognitive software. IBM's Watson is a
very good product over there or an area that is catching a lot of attention. It can go
through a lot of text based data and try to predict what could happen in the future.
It's this kind of technology that's emanating from a lot of software and services
vendor that's been included in a particular retailer's sales strategy or futureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 11 of 16Poonam Goyalmarketing area. So, lookout for companies that are across the ecosystem all the way
from data mining to visualization, and it's becoming increasingly important.
Segmentation of one, this is just part of something Seema just brought up about
GNC sending emails to each and every customer. What used to happen previously
was, you have -- customers were divided by whether they are male or female and the
age group, let's say plus or minus ﬁve year. So if you're a male between 20 and 25,
you have certain habits that people would market down in a particular category, and
you will market at certain products.
With analytics, and with this big data, they're able to segregate two people of let's
say if there are two 25 year old males, they will -- they could have and I'm sure they
do have separate habits, they could target products very diﬀerently to them, this has
become really important in space; and as Poonam said, if there is a company out
there not doing this, it would be a disadvantage going forward.
Now moving on to the next topic and I'd say, I'm not sure everyone is, anyone who
follows the retail industry or the software industry is very, very interested in this area,
and that's the area of security.
Over the last few years, we have seen an acceleration in cyber attacks[ph] across the
ecosystem, and more so in the retail vertical than probably any other largely because
they have a lot of credit card data, and it becomes extremely important once
something like this leaks out, and it can impact retailer's reputation and sales.
So that's an area of increased spending for the software spend, software vertical, I
want to get opinions of both Poonam and Seema as to what they're seeing in their
respective companies as to what is the -- what kind of scare at this point.
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Thanks, Anurag. I guess we'll start with the most recent data breach that actually had
a large impact on the retailer, and that was Target's data breach in 2013 if any of you
remember, during the Christmas holiday season, it couldn't have come at a great
time for Target as then. And I think when we heard about the breach, a lot of us had
thought that, it's okay Target will get pass this, the stock really didn't move much, in
order their investors have as much concern as they did on before, but I think what
we saw happened shortly after the data breach was that Target had cut its earnings
and sales guidance and the stores were left empty.
The breach cost Target, and I think the counting is still going about $250 million plus
that includes insurance proceeds, if you strip those that's about $160 million, that's
still a lot of money, but not only the money that it cost Target, it left shoppers astray, I
mean shoppers were forced to go somewhere else as they were concerned about
their data and it being breached.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17

Chen GrazutisAnd we saw a similar example, not too long ago with other retailers even markets
was also privy to this data breach. And while it didn't impact it's sales as much,
because it didn't occur in the peak holiday season. Retailers are now investing more
in cyber security, and Target itself has set up a center where actually it monitors now
what's happening in the cloud space to make sure or to at least be alerted if another
measure was to happen or another breach was upcoming they could probably to
detect it faster and be cautioned.
And we saw similar examples outside of the apparel space. And I think Seema has
one that she can share which didn't have as much impact, but it also was a recent
data breach.

Thanks, Poonam. In the hardline space, there's been a couple of breaches, one was
Sally Beauty Holdings, they've actually been breached twice, once in March of 2014,
and again in May of 2015. I think the second breach was caused by malware that was
deployed on their point of sales system. Their sales had been weak in the last year, a
combination of company-speciﬁc issues and possibly the lingering eﬀect of
customers being wary of visiting the store and having their credit card data
breached and just the risk that someone will ﬁnd their information.
Home Depot, much larger had a breach in September, August-September of 2014. I
think there was a slight woe to their image, but really had a very negative -- it didn't
impact sales very much at all. Home Depot quickly address the problem though and
was very forthcoming about what happened and what they've done to improve their
security.
So unlike the Target breach, the breach at Home Depot was not, I guess, the peak
selling time and also did not have much of an impact on the sales and that might be
that Home Depot's also being helped by other secular trends in their favor unlike the
recovery in the housing market and other things like that. So it's less susceptible.
There is not as many alternatives also for consumers in that space, perhaps.
But overall, I would say these breaches have forced other retailers to really consider
their data security, because the risk of a breach is really a risk to their public image
and in the Target's case, a risk to their sales.

I'm going to try to go through this entire segment without mentioning Ashley
Madison, but it's really hard. So there I did it. Now seriously though, I had to go back
to the Under Armour apps, but yesterday they mentioned the interaction that their
app is going to have. And they give an example, when we talk about health tracking
apps, there is the opportunity to connect health insurance companies like they did
with Wellness Management providers and there when we get to that level of
interactions between all those companies using a mobile app.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17

Poonam GoyalIt's one thing to have your credit cards stored and where you can actually cancel it,
but you get to a diﬀerent level with hackers can get access to your actual health data.
So I'm guessing as we get more and more of those interaction between all those
app, even these companies will have to signiﬁcantly increase their investment in the
cyber security, because then we're dealing with a very sensitive data, much more
than just a credit card number.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
The security software vendors have been actually doing extremely well over the last
12 to 18 months driven by a lot of breaches across almost all verticals. But what's
happening also right now is there a lot of emerging technologies, upcoming
technologies that are helping retailers to prevent such breaches in the future and
one of the most important ones right now is tokenization and end-to-end encryption.
So what a lot of retailers would be doing, following Apple's lead of the Apple Pay
example, where when you swipe a credit card through the terminal, what will happen
is, it will -- that the card will be, that the number would be converted into a particular
token and that's the token that's going to go across the network and even if
someone taps into that token, they won't have the technology to unlock it and that
can make things a lot more secure.
With -- retailers are also increasingly using security and service monitoring advanced
threats as lot of vendors out there that are providing the services right now. Now
what has happened is, advanced threats that cannot be detected by traditional
signature base, technologies are then becoming increasingly pervasive in the space
that you have these attacks that never have happened before through a particular
malware that is brand new. Those kinds of things are -- cannot be easily detected by
your legacy ﬁrewall technologies and there are the bunch of companies that are
oﬀering software and services, security and the service oﬀerings in this area that can
help to secure things a little bit better.
We are also seeing increased security software spending on virtual devices, a lot of
virtualization in the data center and sometimes they are not as secure as the physical
hardware machines, so there is a lot of focus that are coming out of that as well.
So what we're going to do now is, we're going to reach out and look at all the Q&A
that we have received from the audience. One of the ones that is very interesting for
us is, what defensive strategies work for brick-and-mortar retailers compared to as
the world moves towards e-commerce. So I will ask this to Poonam. Poonam, do you
have any insights on this questions, Poonam?
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
Yeah. I think, what you're seeing right now is basically -- as you just asked the
question, what's happening and what are we seeing, it's really the integration of
technology that I think is most are in. Hello, can you hear me?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17

Hello?

Hello, we can hear you.

I can jump in here and I think that the lot of the defensive mechanisms that the
retailers actually have is to increase the experience, the shopper's experience within
the stores. They have to be very creative about it and part of it is to put a lot of
investment of how the store look, what kind of experience they give to the shopper
as he comes in, the way that the shops are actually -- the merchants as they
presented.
I think that the companies that will have more advantage there are the companies
that actually have the story to tell. If we look in a retailer, just to give an example, like
Ralph Lauren or like the North Face, brands that have some kind of a story to tell and
niche, let's see, if we talk about North Face, it's an outdoor retailer, so people that
are interested in that kind of activities will go into the stores. They will still have that
value add to go in and actually look at the merchandise and kind of see or speak to
a customer representative. And that store gives them a diﬀerent experience than go
online or go on Amazon. Seema, you wanted to add something?
{BIO 18919310 <GO>}
Yeah, I would just say that, also I think it's an opportunity for retailers to focus more
on the customer service or sales associates can be more knowledgeable.
So if you're looking for a paint and you go to Home Depot and now you can talk to
someone who is knowledgeable about the area, the diﬀerent brands, you can see
how it looks through their technology, where the tablets of Lowe's, how it looks in
your home, so that diﬀerentiate experience means you don't just go online and pick
a diﬀerent blue oﬀ of Amazon, you want to go into the store. And I would say, lastly,
stores are so important because people still return items and the fact that you don't
have to pay for shipping to return an item and you can do it, that also may drive
some consumers to certain retailers over others.

Chen GrazutisI think also instead of ﬁghting that e-commerce threat, I think a lot of us have to
embrace that, then I would give that example of the shoe store that -- and I haven't
personally many times encourage that problem, when you go in and you look for a
certain pair of shoes and you ﬁnd a pair of shoes and you love them, but
unfortunately they don't have your size. To embrace that e-commerce part and have
that sales rep with the iPad just in front of you, ordering a shoe in the size you need
and tell you they're going to have it by tomorrow night. I think it's very powerful and
actually what it does, it just increase the conversion.
To get the same amount of people that come into the store, to that 10% of people
that went out because they couldn't ﬁnd the size, that they couldn't ﬁnd the color. If
you do enable your sales rep and you give them the -- you empower them to do a
kind of transaction using the technology and using the e-commerce capabilities of
your companies, I think that part of the defense you play, but the best defense is
oﬀense, that's my opinion. Here anyone?
{BIO 16489913 <GO>}
I do agree with you Chen, I'm sorry about earlier. Basically what I was saying was
that, the way to be defensive is actually to go head to head and compete with these
online retailers and that's why retailers are investing in the technology and the
infrastructure to go ahead and not let go of the share that they have been giving up
to e-commerce and try to win it back. So the investments in the e-commerce are a
huge way to get back that share and in addition to that personalization services
we've heard, customization and just being unique in what you oﬀer.
You can oﬀer what everyone else is oﬀering. You have to diﬀerentiate and that's
really the way to win the customer back and you also have to oﬀer value. I think if
you're competing just in the mid-market you can oﬀer what is a staple item, it's not
going to really when you back customers unless you can oﬀer once again price or
experience and we've seen retailer shift either one spectrum or the other, either they
win on price and they oﬀer the best price or they oﬀer the best experience that you
can get to get the customer back into your door.
{BIO 16090672 <GO>}
Thanks, Poonam. We have another question; it says, how do we track these retailer
technology trends on the terminal? I would say a couple of things; one would be, we
have a lot of dashboards in both the verticals on technology and retail that
addresses a lot these things through same pieces that we do. Second is, a lot of
services and software company breakdown their revenue by diﬀerent verticals. And
that's the very interesting area, because if you see kind of the organic revenue
growth in some of these verticals that has been accelerating over the last few
quarters, and those are some of the better areas to pick it out from what exactly our
customer is spending on. We will see, if we have any other questions.
We have one question, asking if we're going to have the transcripts? The answer is
yes. And I believe the link is going to be mailed to you in a couple of days. It seems
like there are no other questions at this point.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-09-17
