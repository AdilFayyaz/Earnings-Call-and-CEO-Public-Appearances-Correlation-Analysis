{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Welcome back. I going to say would never be in this position with out Microsoft. I
started as the developer in the 90s on Microsoft platform at a little bank [ph] called
Piper. So thanks for being here, Chris.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
My pleasure.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Chris has spent a cool 31 years at Microsoft. I think we were talking before, one of the
things he did was help Bill Gates in his presentations has some great, great stories.
So done a lot, and maybe we'll just address the headline today of the reduced
guidance and I think that was mainly due to FX and no other reason. So think
everyone just love to get this out of way.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
High level what are you seeing on the macro, what was today's announcement? And
we also have Brett Iversen, Brett raise your hand, he runs IR here as well. So thanks
and his team mates. Thank you gentlemen for being here.

Christopher C. CaposselaBrett. Thanks for having me, obviously, it's great to get a chance to talk with all of you
and be here today. As you mentioned, my name is Chris Capossela. I'm the Chief
Marketing Oﬃcer at Microsoft. I also run -- so I do marketing for all of the products at
the company, but I also get to run a couple of our sales organizations that are on the
sort of consumer sales side. So talking to retailers around the world and then all of
our direct sales where somebody just comes to our website or our digital storefront
and buys an Xbox or Azure, believe it or not we do a lot of Azure direct. So that's a
little bit about my responsibility. I'd say if you saw the 8-K today, it was purely -- it was
purely foreign currency (Technical Diﬃculty), continued to strengthen the dollar
essentially is what we talked about in that ﬁling. And we're obviously incredibly
bullish on just about everything else that we have. That's one thing we can't control.
It's important for us to focus on the things that are in control. But we're not immune
to the macro environment that everybody I think is seeing and so, Amy, and the team
decided that, it's important to our ﬁle that 8-K with a little bit of additional detail on
foreign exchange that we're seeing. But broadly speaking, I don't think we could feel
much more bullish about our position. There is no doubt we're not immune to the
macro economic factors that the -- that the world sees. We've certainly seen
continued supply chain challenges in which -- for our OEM partners and for own
(technical diﬃculty) Is a headwind for us to deal with. But we deal with it, that's the
part of running a business. Doing a lot of works of matching up supply and demand
on on the PC side and currency ﬂuctuation, how much we do about that and so I
think that's about it.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Maybe a little bit of your day-to-day. It's a big role, where are you
spending your time?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Well, there is sort of three big things we -- that my team focuses on. And I'd say that
this would be exactly the same for everybody on the senior leadership team, all of
Satya's direct reports, but probably most of them would give some version of this. A
big part of what I spend my time on is driving growth after the company. Satya and
Amy are very clear and -- on our ambitions to continue to grow really well despite
our size. And so a big part of what my team does is to look for those growth
opportunities. We do all of the business planning for the company and close
partnership with ﬁnance. So pricing and licensing and build management, our
business models that we run, that transition from traditional device based business
models to consumption based and subscription-based and transaction based to ad
based, like advertisers (technical diﬃculty) people do that.
That trend -- those transitions are a big part of my team's time, how do we transition
to the future business models. I spoke a lot of time on culture, believe it or not
building a culture, people who behave the way we want them to behave and have
the skillset that like we category creation is a big part of the culture. So rather than
just shipping features in an existing product, ﬁnding ways to create a brand new
category the world hasn't really discovered yet. Building that category and having a
Microsoft product in that category, Microsoft Viva would be (technical diﬃculty)FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

Christopher C. Caposselawhere that's an employee experience category and now we have a suite of products
in this space. Game Pass, Xbox Game Pass would be an other example there weren't
really any cloud-based subscriptions for gamers that was a brand category. So
culture is another big part and then of course brand. Because if I were the CMO and
needed to take a (inaudible) brand love, creating fans for the company, that's a big
(techncial diﬃculty). Those will be -- those would be three, that if you were ﬂy on the
wall at my staﬀ meeting or if you are on one-on-one with Satya, you'd hear we talk
about these three.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
What do you think the thing is opportunity is what you said, when you think about
we keep hearing this as -- if we are going to and dip more diﬃcult environment...
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
That there is a seam of consolidation that ultimately, what you can do as a platform is
pretty powerful, like we authored a pretty big deep dive on Power Apps, and
everyone's like I had no idea like, oh my gosh, I didn't know you could build these
apps for the mass market and -- and you look at what's happening with Azure, what's
happening with Oﬃce. Can you just talk about what you're seeing as it relates to
these comments from your clients and broader platform?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah, it's a big -- it's obviously a really big question. We're in essentially ten diﬀerent
businesses that we call customers (Technical Diﬃculty) apply at. It's really hard to
pick a couple of to focus on. But I'll pick two that I think are somehow under talked
about because they're -- that we're very excited about. One would be security and
you look at vendors consolidation, average commercial fortune 1,000, probably had
(technical diﬃculty) security vendors, that they're paying. And so when times get
hard and people are looking at vendor consolidation, security is an obvious place
and our end-to-end security portfolio that was really, really oﬀensive and it's not
focused on Microsoft tech, focused on customers tech. So we secure other clouds.
We secure other productivity solutions, be our security platform, if you bought
nothing from Microsoft, but all of your tech from everybody else, security actually
might be and you would start with as a Microsoft Suite even if none of them are
writing any Microsoft technology, then I think security for me is one that, as I look
into FY (technical diﬃculty) it's probably one of the biggest most exciting (technical
diﬃculty).
Second one I'll throw out there that people don't (technical diﬃculty) is the data
space. For us, I would say it's not just data, but it's also analytics and it's also
governance, and we put these three things together and what we call the Microsoft
Intelligent Data Platform and the products themselves, there is a whole variety of it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 10Brent Thill
Christopher C. CaposselaBut I think the data estate is where so many more companies are now realizing they
have to start as they digitally transform, start with the State and they're turning to
fewer and fewer companies for help bringing that to the cloud and modernizing it.
And then once you have that data stayed in place then something like power apps,
the power platform becomes a (technical diﬃculty) unlock value, but if you force me
to pick two, I'd say, security and data two of the ones I'm most excited about. If you
let me do a third, I'd throw in gaming because there are 3 billion people (technical
diﬃculty) digital games and our opportunity to bring that expertise across devices
not just the console, we love consoles, but if you look at all the consoles sold
compared all of the iPhone sold, very small number. So bringing gaming to iOS,
Android, many, many other devices and having it be cloud powered. We're one of
the few companies as this cloud platform. Right now, you can go to xbox.com/play
and you can stream Fortnite to just about any device and that's us putting Fortnite in
our data center and letting you play in ﬁve seconds. That's a -- ﬁve years ago that
would have been unthought -- unheard of. And so I'd throw in gaming.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
That's great. We were having dinner last night and our head of infrastructure was
mentioning to Brett, he was at your headquarters he's like I want to want to talk
about Oﬃce and then you're like how about Azure will talk -- let's talk about Azure.
Everyone was talking about Azure including lot of your employees, so how does
Azure tie into this and you've come a long way, you also have a very large
competitor in front of you with AWS. Give us a sense of what the landscape looks like
there?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean just in terms of importance, it is the -- it is the foundation for every other
(technical diﬃculty) we have and Xbox doesn't do well without Azure, right. The
whole cloud streaming (Inaudible) all based on the Azure infrastructure. So, you
should just think of it as the oxygen that the company runs on. And Azure in itself has
multiple businesses to it. Obviously, there is the infrastructure that's growing
incredibly well and we're gaining share and were predicted to gain more share,
which we're very humbled by and we have to execute really well, but there is
wonderful growth on the infrastructure. I mentioned, obviously the data was one of
the ones I mentioned, that's obviously foundation to Azure and Azure has. There's
still a lot of opportunity to move workloads from on-prem to cloud and we ﬁnd that
sort of the gateway into the cloud and they're doing new things on them. Running
premium workloads, SAP on it, obvious (technical diﬃculty) happy to be the market
leader at workload, but getting Tier 1 cloud workloads (technical diﬃculty) is another
huge opportunity.
So, if you just look at infrastructure, you just look at lift and shift (technical diﬃculty),
you just like Tier 1 workloads, then you add data on top, you add gaming on top, you
add business on top. It is the backbone of the entire Microsoft and we're very bullish
that we can now grow Azure (technical diﬃculty). We love that it's consumption base.
I don't think people will be able to build very powerful consumption (technicalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

diﬃculty) customers. The number of $100 million plus Azure contracts as over
doubled year-over-year (technical diﬃculty). So we are seeing bigger and bigger
investments for a long-term contracts where people won't just pay for this segment.
We want to extend it because we see that this is going to take a while, digitizing my
entire company, embedding on and so longer contracts, bigger contracts, those we
think really healthy and oﬀ the right track even if there is wonderful (technical
diﬃculty) not just data (technical diﬃculty).
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
We were 20% cloud as a ﬁrm, we're obviously ﬁnancial services, so we're going to
move a little slower, maybe the most, but our goal is to get 50%, 60% and our Head
of Infrastructure has noted that even if things slowed in the macro and we had a
slower IT budget that would not slow, because we are going to physically just shut
down data centers move workloads to you and other. So when you think about
ultimately where we're at in this journey and it seems that one of the questions we
get is again any tougher environment, can you just gain share relative to what's
happening with some of the legacy infrastructure?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Of course, we would certainly say for sure. Like there's still a lot of legs in just the
straightforward business of enterprises moving on premise to cloud, and not every
industry is going to move at the same pace. But honestly that's kind of the -- what I
say, we're betting on that to happen. Real value is once somebody does that, now
what do they do. What are the premium workloads that they add on top. Because
just shifting your Linux servers and Windows servers to the cloud it's ﬁne, we love
that, if you like that business, but it does and unlock the value. It's really looking at
what is the data state that you have, what's your data strategy, your data governance
strategy, there is a lot more than just turning oﬀ your data center and having that
exact same data center run in one of our regional data centers. So I think that's sort
of just the starting on, that's kind of getting to ﬁrst base in a baseball metaphor. The
real value -- the real margin is obviously the other thing.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
My favorite, Microsoft product is (inaudible) Teams.
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}

Brent ThillIt's just show up, yeah.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
I see. But it seems like there is so much more room to go think about audio, video,
I'm using it for internal calling, I'm not using it for external, but there is a big
opportunity that there is obviously a big opportunity for external video. You look at
what runway that you have there. Can you talk about the next engines of what
powers Teams?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah. Well you know speaking of vendor consolidation, obviously a lot of customers
have looked at, this is what I spent on Slack, this is what I spend on Zoom. This is
what I spent on Google. I don't need to do that. With Microsoft, you essentially have
Microsoft 365 and that presses those three vendors into one vendor and that's -- so
that dynamic has fueled a lot of our growth something like 270 million monthly
active users now. I think I was the latest number we can imagine the higher since we
announced that number. Some of that vendor consolidation is driving that.
Obviously COVID has driven a lot of that. The product has gotten far better. I think
the people don't get about Teams is that it's not just a Slack and Zoom and sort of
Google replacement or vendor consolidation opportunity, what we're seeing more
and more now is people adding what we call Teams Rooms. So taking up for
average conference room in your -- in your facility, which might have 5 or 10 people
in it and making that a Teams room. So a remote person can experience a meeting
really, really well, seeing everybody in the room as if they're sitting in the front row.
They may not have that we are weird bird's eye camera that shoots the room and if
they're not in the room, all you see is that we are -- that weird corner shot. So Teams
rooms is a big opportunity that we in the hybrid world more and more customers are
looking to (technical diﬃculty) far better. Their physical (inaudible). Teams phone, the
ability to use the Internet essentially to take voice calls, so you can reach anybody on
any device, whether inside your company or outside your company. Assign
somebody a phone number, that's theirs, handle all of that and obviously if you are
looking at any building, why would you put SDN in that building, why not just use the
infrastructure.
So those would be a couple of obvious ones beyond just chat and meetings. The last
one would be essentially business process automation in the Teams itself. So when I
approve an expense reported at Microsoft, I'm not getting an email, I'm not going to
expense tool, I'll literally just get a notiﬁcation in Teams. I click on it. When I do a
learning modules do training inside the company, it happens with inside of Teams
Viva [ph] learning, which is inside of Teams. So taking business processes like
expense management, like approvals, like training you know, et cetera. And having
those be built in Teams with third parties bringing thousands of applications, that's
obviously a new growth opportunity, (technical diﬃculty).

Unidentiﬁed ParticipantLet me turn it over to my partner Joe, who we call Cyber Joe, he does a lot of
security work for us. I'm sure he's going to want to follow up on the Security thread
and thanks so much for being part of the conference.
Awesome, thanks. Yeah, maybe just starting on the security element, you mentioned
it as the number one focus area. Microsoft has certainly evolved and really, really
improved over the last ﬁve years. How is that messaging changed and you view
yourselves as a security provider or more of a ﬁduciary responsibility to secure your
own products given such a large attacks (inaudible)?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah, it's a great question. We sort of think of it in two ways, ﬁrst there is what we
would call sort of foundational security that we have to build into every single
product. So if you buy a Windows 11 PC today it's far more secure than a Windows 8
PC was. We just have Microsoft Defender built in to that Windows Windows -- that
windows experience and that would be foundational. If you buy Microsoft 365 from
us, it comes with security baked into it. And then we think of advanced security,
where we basically can build and sell solutions to customers, who want to secure all
of their devices no matter who they buy it from. They want to secure all their
employee identity, no matter if they're using Azure Active Directory or some other
solution. They want to secure all of their employee data, whether it's created a
Microsoft tools or in somebody else's tools. They want to secure all their applications
and most of those applications are for Microsoft like there are thousands of
applications the companies have. So think of it as foundational data for the products
we build, foundational security for the products we build and then think of it as
advanced security solutions that will secure any cloud from any vendor, any
application, any piece of data, any identity any device and that's where we obviously
see huge additional growth on top of what we already do in, let's say, Windows 11.
And that's where, when we talk about being a (inaudible) security vendor, the largest
vendor in the world, that's where that money is coming. Not Windows 11 on my home
PC, which is super secure.
So that's how would say. There is an additional layer that you know all about which is
the role we have in watching the cyber attacks that are happening around the world
and then contacted government leaders and enterprise customers to share the
threat intelligence that we're seeing 24 trillion signals a day. I think we're looking at
to see, patient state bad actors, all sorts of thing. And that goes even beyond our
revenue growth or our products, and that is a little bit of a responsibility of the
position we have as a public cloud to make sure that we're keeping patients safe and
we do that by working hand-in-hand with governments around the world. That's a, I
guess a third layer to what you asked.
And what's the next journey for the security business? Is it awareness making your
customers even aware of what's possible with Microsoft, because maybe ﬁve yearsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

Christopher C. Caposselaago, they didn't think any of this, but ever come to fruition or is there a product area
investment that you need to build out more?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
I think the biggest thing people don't understand is that we can actually secure
other clouds. So that's probably a big opportunity for us to do, sort of a marketing
and storytelling and selling perspective. It isn't just about securing Microsoft 365. If
you're running things on somebody else's cloud, we have security solutions for you. I
think that's a big go do as we would say for me and my team and and Judson, who is
our Commercial Sales leader. The other obvious one is the vendor consolidation, just
see (technical diﬃculty) and that's a big opportunity.
You mentioned I think number three was gaming I'm a customer...
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Well three, are you may be picked three. So I chose gaming, but
But I mean you clearly have put a ton of investment dollars and that business has
done very, very well. What's the future of that business look like over the next couple
of years?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah. The thing -- I mean there's many things to love about the gaming business, but
one thing maybe folks here don't understand is what a multi-dimensional business
from a business model perspective and amount of (technical diﬃculty) perspective.
Because you typically think of gaming as, oh, yeah, there is a console that some
applies, then you attach a few games onto it and that's the gaming business. In fact
that was the gaming business. But today of course the --the variety of ways (technical
diﬃculty) is making, got the console, you've got games, you've got transactions. I
mean look at game like Fortnite, it is a free game and yet they generate huge
amounts of revenue from actions in the game. You look at something like a Candy
Crush, it's a free to play game and yet, tremendous revenue associated with it. You
look at gaming subscriptions, where 25 million Game Pass subscriptions, I think was
the last number that's it amazing business model.
So, I think one of the things I love about it is that there is multiple ways to monetize
and it's a very rich ecosystem perspective, we love that. Content is certainly
incredibly important. See us looking to do acquisitions like the Activision, one that
we've announced, like the Bethesda and ZeniMax when we already did. Content is
just everything. Community is really important. Most people don't understand that
gaming is very, very social. The days or somebody sort of playing alone in theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

Unidentiﬁed Participantbasement are kind of over where people do that, but it's far more of a social
experience where people want to come home from school, they want to play games
with their friends, while they talk to them. So a safe community is super important
and then of course the move to the cloud is very, very like we've got strong head
start. So when you think about gaming, think about content, think about safe
communities and think about cloud. And that's the recipe that we use to put the
game at the center and we talk about it has led to play the games they love with the
people they love and the devices they love.
Other than gaming, on the consumer side, you said you run the sales organizations
and the digital motion, where are you guys spending marketing dollars your
investment dollars? What are you most excited about and how resilient can that be if
there is a recession?
{BIO 6054036 <GO>}
Yeah, so consumer demand is deﬁnitely very spiky. We've seen it over the past few
years. Commercial demand on devices has been really strong and we predicted it to
be very strong. Emerging market consumer has been very consistent, but developed
market consumer has been quarter-to-quarter, if you got look at the last 12 quarters,
it's always up and down. And I bet that that will certainly continue. We always have
need to spend money on windows, it's such the fabric of so many thing from
downstream. But I think if you were to look at how I'll spend marketing money in the
coming year, you'll see on the consumer side, you'll continue to see investments in
gaming, you'll continue to see some investments in Windows. I think you'll see a
shifting of our investments to what we would consider the post sale monetization
opportunities on the windows.
And so for us, that means, things like Game Pass for the PC, that means Microsoft
365 the consumer versions. I think, these things like Edge, Edge our browser
continues to take share on the (technical diﬃculty) that leads to bigger queries
(technical diﬃculty) advertising revenue for us. So if you just ask me the question
about marketing spend, I think you'll see a subtle shift in some of the post-sale
modiﬁcation opportunities with knowing that the supply chain challenges are there.
Knowing that consumer demand is spiky, that has been. In one quarter it looks great,
the next quarter, you think wow, it's very. And so I would predict those spikes will
continue and our opportunity is perhaps a little bit on the post sale (technical
diﬃculty) with the edge progress, really excited to be a big advertising customer.
We're not immune for the impact of the economy has on ads if (technical diﬃculty)
ad companies suﬀer, but luckily we're incredibly diversiﬁed. So we can usually make
(Technical Diﬃculty) ups and downs on part of our business.
Same question on the commercial side, maybe outside of Azure where you guys
shifting investment dollars?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02
