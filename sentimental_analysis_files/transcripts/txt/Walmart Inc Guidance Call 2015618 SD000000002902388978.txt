Presentation
So good afternoon, everyone. On behalf of Heath Terry once again we want to
welcome you to lunch in the middle section of this day. Thinking about the
progression of our program today, we have already heard from one of the world's
largest retailers in Home Depot.
Certainly some of the world's smallest but most exciting retailers on some of our
panels this morning. And some really interesting innovative and disruptive
companies including those in some of those in businesses where Walmart, in fact, is
operating with dominant market share thinking about Instacart and Ocado.
And I think we have a very appropriate, robust back-to-back couple of sessions here
obviously ﬁrst starting art with Neil and then, after you eat, with our private equity
panel.
It is my pleasure to introduce Neil Ashe to you and to engage with Heath in this
discussion this morning. Neil is the President and CEO of Global eCommerce for
Walmart. And as you know, Walmart operates an e-commerce business well in excess
of $10 billion globally --.
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
$12 billion.
Fair enough, in excess of $12 billion globally. He joins --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18

$2 billion is a lot of money, you've got to count.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
You've got to update your model, Matt.
Neil joined Walmart in 2012 to lead the Company's global e-commerce division
which developed strategies, platforms and applications across the Company, once
again on a global basis. Prior to that he had been the President of CBS Interactive
and prior to that he was CEO of CNET as well as other roles and functions in the
past. And we are delighted to have you join us at a Goldman conference --
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Thank you.
-- and particularly at this one, which we have been aiming for for many years and we
have moved away from your annual meeting in part to try to make this happen. And
we are very happy that, thanks to your help and Carol's, we were able to make that a
reality.
So the ﬁrst question I would ask you relates to your customer base as you, as an e-
commerce enterprise, really spread your wings. To what degree do you expect that
your e-commerce eﬀorts will broaden your customer base beyond your existing
Walmart retail customers?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
So ﬁrst of all, thank you all for spending some time with us. Thank you for the
generous introduction and I am excited to be here with you. And I hope we are both
a big, exciting and innovative Company to hit on all three of your points of
introduction.
So maybe I would start by saying what is commerce and where do we think that is
going and then how does it relate to the customer of Walmart. If we look through -- I
bumped into -- you mentioned CNET, I bumped into some CNET investors on the
way in here.
And we have all, many of us, lived through the progression of the Internet, Heath as
well. And you have seen the -- as the diﬀerent ways have changed the customer'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 18Matt Fasslerexpectations have cumulatively changed. And seem to clarify over time around what
they want.
And in commerce we think that is going to happen signiﬁcantly, which is that
commerce is going to clarify for the customer. And we think the customer is going to
have less relationships, not more relationships. And they are going to look for
people that can provide them the services, the goods and the manner in which they
would like to receive them.
And so, if I paint a picture of commerce for you in the future where you can go to
someone you trust, you can ﬁnd everything you need at a low price and you can get
that in any way that you want it. And not every person wants it the same way. And not
every person wants it the same way every time.
So if one could create an experience that is pan device to acquire. So whether that is
your mobile phone, your tablet, your desktop or your (eyes). And it is -- you can
procure that, whatever it is that you want to buy, wherever it is that you want --
whether you want it at your home, whether you want it to be placed in your car in a
pick-up setting or you want to walk in a store and get it, that to us is the future of
commerce.
And so, to do that we have talked about building best-in-class e-commerce,
marrying it with the assets of the retail to win this vision we are describing as the
integration of digital and physical. So we think, Matt, that that applies to all
customers.
So -- and then if you put a ﬁlter on kind of Walmart's customer, Walmart's customer is
a value conscious individual. So I don't know the exact numbers. But round numbers
85% of the people that in the US are going to shop at Walmart at least once this year.
So we think about this e-commerce and this integration of digital and physical as a
way to both expand that addressable market, because that means there's 15 that
we're not, to develop a deeper relationship with those customers who are shopping
with us, whether that is for general merchandise or for grocery. And it is to add an
element of service to our brand that is not traditional in a mass-market discount
retailer.
And so, we think that Walmart has brand permission to sell everything to everyone
and our sweet spot is that value conscious customer. And now with the integration of
digital physical we can oﬀer them price assortment, experience and access in ways
that no one else can.
And if I can just follow on that brieﬂy. So I live in an apartment building in Brooklyn,
New York and there is no Walmart in Brooklyn, New York. And I do see Walmart.com
boxes in the lobby, which is really one of my ﬁrst ways of assessing who isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 18Neil Ashe
Heath Terry
Neil Asheprogressing into organic scale outside their core customer base, if you will. What are
you seeing in terms of actual penetration beyond customers you know to be or think
to be core Walmart customer so far?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
I had this conversation -- when I ﬁrst got to Walmart a few years ago I was talking to
Mike Duke who was the CEO at the time and we were talking about trying to get a
store into New York and we've been working at it forever. And I said why are we
working so hard to get a store in New York? And he said, well, because it can do
hundreds of millions of dollars. And I said we already have a hundreds of millions of
dollars store in New York.
And there is, Matt, there is -- it universally true that we can expand the platform. So
obviously we are serving a signiﬁcant user base in New York City, all ﬁve boroughs,
we don't have a store here. We see that both on a delivery perspective as well as
from a pickup perspective.
So on a pure general merchandise site the two largest stores for pickup surround
New York City. So that is the pull of demand for Walmart, everything you want at a
low price. And so, that is kind of where we started.
Now as we expand the oﬀering and we have a signiﬁcantly higher quality e-
commerce experience that we've built over the last three years. So over the last
three years we have built a talent dense environment in Silicon Valley.
We built an Internet technology company inside the world's largest retailer, which
has allowed us to re-platform, both on a technology and a fulﬁllment perspective. So
that we can do what I said earlier which is deliver a best-in-class e-commerce
experience, we expand even further.
Then when we add tests like grocery home shopping in Denver we start to see it all
come together for our customer -- we can provide them literally everything that --
everything that they want.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Great. And so you touched on that a little bit when you talked about building a
technology company inside the world's largest retailer. How do you ﬁnd the
competition for talent -- bringing talent in Silicon Valley into Walmart and especially
as you start to expand your footprint outside of that area?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Yes. So, I think that was candidly the biggest question we had when we started on
this journey was can we get the talent that we need, can we compete eﬀectively inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 18Heath Terry
Neil AsheSilicon Valley for that talent. And so, we set about a very purposeful strategy to do
that.
I am obviously not a retailer by background; I grew up in the Internet technology
world and all of my team is the same way. We have brought some people over from
the retail organization. But we are largely consumer Internet folks that --. And so, we
built this company as an Internet technology company that was relevant inside of
Walmart.
So the ﬁrst thing we did was deﬁne an associate value proposition. So everyone who
has come to join our team has heard some ﬂavor of the following which is come for
the purpose, help people save money so they can live better. Come because you
want to solve really hard problems because we've got them, strategic, technical,
operating, ﬁnancial. Come because you are intrigued by scale. We can solve those
problems in ways that others can't. And come because we are putting together a
group of people in an environment and a point of time that is special and that you
would want to be a part of.
It has been incredibly successful. So over the last three years the job market in
Silicon Valley ebbs and ﬂows. But we are always over an 80% close rate on oﬀers that
we make. The people that we are competing for to get from and/or competing to for
talent are the people that you would expect -- Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo,
etc. So we are really, really pleased about that. And that has allowed us to do this re-
platforming exercise and it has allowed us to scale.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Can you talk about the platform so you have (inaudible) and we hear about it on the
Street and your customers experience it? But if you could talk about what it has done
and go from the theory of to what the application has been and how you feel it has
upgraded your capabilities and customers' experiences.
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Yes. So those of you who know when Internet companies go through a re-
platforming it can be a daunting experience. So we literally changed the plane in air.
We didn't change the engines on the plane, we didn't change the seats on the
plane, we can change the fuselage, we changed the whole plane.
We built a cloud, we built a backend logic system, we built sites, apps and mobile
web experiences. And we built all the tools necessary to run a commerce business.
So we built a commerce operating system. And we have done that inside of three
years.
And so the beneﬁt of that, Matt, is ﬁrst of all from obviously the customer's
perspective. So they have a signiﬁcantly better experience at Walmart.com that has
allowed us to signiﬁcantly scale their assortment. So we have gone from selling
700,000 items to selling over 7 million items.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 18Heath Terry
Neil AsheWe -- you now have a personalized shopping experience that you didn't have on
Walmart before. We have built obviously a very eﬀective and highly scalable
personalization capability. We built a search engine so you can ﬁnd what it is that you
are looking for on Walmart.
And also we can serve that. So the we platforming goes all the way to how you ﬁnd
an item. So we serve a promise up in every item page where and when you are
going to get something. Then we have complicated algorithms that determine
exactly how to serve that so we can meet the customer service -- and customer
service requirement as well as deliver eﬃcient cause.
We have built new fulﬁllment centers, these are physical assets but powered by the
technology that allow us to serve that more eﬃciently. I am on my way to see one of
them after I leave you guys here today.
So those come online so that we can now have a holistic experience that says, okay, I
can come, I can have the highest quality Internet experience, global app experience,
I can ﬁnd everything that I am looking for and I can get it served in a manner in
which I expect.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Great. You touched on this when you mentioned personalization. But what kind of
eﬀects have you seen from personalization, particularly as your search engine has
gotten better and you have taken this from being sort of a product catalog online to
more of a shopping experience?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Yes. That is a great question and where does it go even from there. So we think
about how we interact with a customer on a pull basis. So we want -- we have
increased frequency 30% over that period on a per customer basis. We have
increased depth of relationship with customers on a per customer basis through
that.
So we want you, Heath, to be able to come and feel like you belong at Walmart, not
at Walmart.com or in the mobile app but at Walmart. And so, that we are also taking
that experience with you on your mobile device when you walk into a store. So now
you can take -- e-commerce brought the store to the web and now mobile is
bringing the web back into the store. So that holistic relationship improves as you go
through the store also.
You see things like Savings Catcher and other ways that we are doing that. So that
we are starting to tie together the entire experience for a customer which is driving --
which is driving our frequency and will ultimately drive the economics of the
business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18

Heath Terry
Neil AsheCan you talk about how purchasing behavior diﬀers online from in-store? Is it a stock
up purchase? Is it a ﬁll in purchase? What does the composition of the basket look
like both quantitatively and also category wise, if you would?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Yes. So, I think we are statistically relevant or equivalent to e-commerce in general
which is that your general merchandise shop online is generally a handful of items.
And it spans the category which you all know the penetration of as well as I do
online.
So started in the transaction categories like electronics and it is moving to home. I'm
sure you saw Niraj, I am guessing he is here, at Wayfair, home category and to
apparel and two other categories and then kind of grocery is that big one at the end
which is very diﬀerent.
Our shop online mirrors the diﬀerence between an e-commerce shop and a store
shop. Obviously the supercenter was the ﬁrst place that brought all those things
together. So you could go shop for bananas and TVs in the same place. Well
Walmart.com now is starting to do the same thing as we start to expand the grocery
oﬀering and provide that.
So the online shop is not deﬁned by that kind of shop in my opinion, Matt. Now
grocery is entirely diﬀerent. What we are saying there in ASDA and Seiyu in Japan
and in our -- where we are doing it also in Yihaodian in China, now what we are
launching in the markets here is that you're very much trading the customer to the,
okay, I understand this is my weekly or biweekly shop and we would expect that kind
of path to continue.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Great. And so, how do you end up leveraging and how important does the store
network end up being for you? Right now you are fulﬁlling primarily out of the three
distribution centers. Does that store network ultimately end up being an asset for
you in terms of getting closer to customers?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
So we think of the -- I will start from the customer and work our way back in. So back
to that vision I described of the integrated experience. We want to be where you
want us to be. So do want us to get this to your door or to you -- whether it is at
home or at work. So that obviously requires some last mile delivery.
But we have 4,500 points of presence and 600 -- 500 or 600 clubs around the
country where someone can interact with us. And so, we are -- and people want that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 18Heath Terry
Neil AsheSo there is a customer interaction point.
Obviously not everything we sell online is in each one of those stores. And the
fundamental economics of commerce, as you know, are throughput economics. We -
- you need to have throughput to drive down cost and order to make low prices.
And so, we don't use every one of our stores as a fulﬁllment node. But we use many
of them.
Then as you alluded to, three is not the exact number. But we have built these
backbone e-commerce dedicated fulﬁllment facilities which carry signiﬁcantly more
items and are high throughput and have the ability to pick that out of one at a time.
So all of that. And this is very important, is tied together by one of the most eﬃcient
transportation networks in the world. And part of the reason it is one of the most
eﬃcient is it has the highest amount of throughput.
So I think the way to think about this going forward is the stores are one piece of this,
the transportation is one piece of that. But we are leveraging the throughput of the
retail network to lower our cost to serve on the e-commerce network.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
And just to follow up on that, what kind of popularity have you seen in terms of
pickup in-store?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
So right now we think about general merchandise and grocery separately. So over
time we think the customer will kind of merge those. But they don't now. And so,
they are diﬀerent so it varies. The pickup portion of our general merchandise e-
commerce business has trended down. It was as high as about half and it has
trended down.
Part of that is the oﬀer that we are giving you to get items at home. And part of it,
candidly, is we needed to improve the pickup experience in the stores which we are
doing. So that will trend down, I think it is 25%-ish now.
Grocery has behaved diﬀerently. So at ASDA in the UK where delivery was the ﬁrst
option, obviously delivery was 100%. As we have added pickup, click and collect and
that in the UK it has shot up as a percentage.
And it makes sense, right, because who here likes the cable guy and who wants to
be there when -- so you have to be there when your groceries are -- generally you
have to be there when your groceries are delivered. That is pretty -- that can be a hit
or miss proposition no matter how good you are.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 18Matt Fassler
Neil Ashe
Matt FasslerSo -- and so that is a -- I am already driving past Walmart, I can pull in, have my
groceries in my car in 5 minutes and be on my way. That is the customer experience
that people would want.
So in trying to project where we are going to be. And back to this what I think sets us
apart, is we can get both of those right. We can get delivery to your door right and
we can get the pickup experience in our store right. Then you can choose which one
you want when.
And we think that is what the customer wants going forward. We want you to have a
relationship with Walmart and we want to serve that relationship more eﬀectively
than anyone else can.
I would like to follow up on one of your answers to Heath's question on what it takes
to get pickup optimized for you. What are the enhancements that you are making in
your stores and in your network to get that where you want it to be?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
A couple things. One is we have improved the technology that powers kind of the
online equivalent of where is my order (whizmo), we are improving that. The second
is we are improving the physical experience in our stores. So it is easier for you to
ﬁnd the -- it is more obvious where it is and how to do it. And the third is we are
improving how we staﬀ that experience. Then ﬁnally we are improving how we know
you are there. So how you can check in.
We haven't spoken about Sam's Club at all. So I'll use them as an example here. So if
you were -- if any of you were at shareholder's event and went to the Club there, we
have dramatically improved the pickup experience at Sam's Club. You can check in
at the front door via a kiosk or a drive-through kiosk, you can have -- we have
positioned the pickup experience in the front of the Club. We will load your car or
truck and you are on your way.
As a result of that, Matt, the -- both business members as well as advantage
members, consumer members have increased their shop. So we are trying to -- we
have always given customers that price and value and now we are trying to give
them back time as well.
So I am going to move on to the question of the economics of e-commerce which
could be I think an entire session in and of itself had we the time.
Starting oﬀ by -- you have probably more so than most a full on e-commerce direct
delivery business and you have an omni-channel business. And they are of courseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 18Neil Asheone and the same. But they probably have diﬀerent economic proﬁles. Can you talk
about the diﬀerence in economics for Walmart based on a fulﬁllment mode and
what the customer chooses here?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So let me talk about kind of the macro kind of Walmart and then dive in
and I'll use Walmart as the speciﬁcs for a second. So ﬁrst on the macro, obviously we
are investing pretty aggressively in e-commerce for really three reasons.
One is because we know that is what we need to do for our customer to meet this
vision that we described. The second is because we are demonstrating we are
getting pretty good at it. And so we are increasing the conﬁdence of the enterprise
as we go through that. And third, because we can aﬀord it, it is the right amount of
investment for us to do the scale.
And so then -- but the last piece of that also is we are doing it in multiple places. So
we are doing it in the US and we are doing it at Walmart, we are doing it at Sam's
Club and we are doing it in international markets. So we are growing these
businesses all at the same time. So were we an independent entity we would be
scaling these more sequentially than we are right now.
So then if you break down the unit economics, I will tell you a bunch of things that
you already know. Commerce is a throughput business. So -- and that is throughput
on the fulﬁllment side and that is throughput on the customer relationship side.
So ﬁrst on the fulﬁllment side, it is a law of physics problem. You need inventory
close to where someone is and you need to get it there as eﬃciently as possible.
And so, that is why we have turned on stores as the outer ring of that network and
that drives that cost down.
So we think about it as fulﬁllment (inbound) transportation, what does the
transportation cost get you the item, the inbound and fulﬁllment. The eﬀectiveness
of our stores depends on what you buy. So if you are buying what is in that store they
are highly eﬀective and we get you those. And that's the things that you would
expect -- consumables, higher DIM and lower margin items that are already in a
supercenter.
Then the fulﬁllment network is highly eﬃcient if you buy more stuﬀ at the same time.
So again throughput. Then ﬁnally on the customer, we want to drive frequency and
we want to drive share of wallet so that that traﬃc umbrella is eﬀective for us.
We have been very successful in the last three years scaling the traﬃc piece of the e-
commerce business. So at Walmart I think in comScore we were -- we passed Apple
last month so we are now the third largest traﬃc site. And that is candidly without
fully activating the stores yet. So those are largely new customers on top of stores.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 18Heath Terry
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Neil AsheSo we think that closing the loop with those customers and then delivering a
branded experience that is Walmart or Sam's Club provides another step function of
growth for us. That -- so taken together a deeper penetration of relationship with --
more customers, deeper penetration with those customers. Then a throughput, a
higher share of their purchases and then eﬀective throughput through the fulﬁllment
network ultimately drives the economics.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
We do have some microphones around the room, if you have a question raise your
hand, we will get them to them in the time that we have. So let's start with the one in
the back.
Questions And Answers
What is the best way -- you have been talking about for a couple years now I think
increasing investment into e-commerce. What is the best way for us as shareholders
and investors to think about that or look at that as being proactive positive growth
versus defensive competitive issues?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Well I think about this -- I am not sure that they matter, to be perfectly honest with
you. So I am used to have living in a smaller environment. So a smaller company at
which point you are trying to get big, right. So that was one of the -- I told you about
the associated value proposition. We were like, okay, what is the mission as we bring
people into the organization.
If you were recruiting at silicon valley and said we are going to build the biggest
commerce company in the world, people -- okay, we are already that. So what is the -
- how do we think about that? I think about that the same way from this customer
perspective is we want more customers and we want a deeper relationship with the
customers that we already have. Is that oﬀensive or is that defensive?
I think the answer is yes because we are already always so big obviously there is
share shift. I don't think it is a secret that we were, as an organization, probably slow
to this because we couldn't get our heads around cannibalization, which is ironic
because, as you know, every physical retailer, when they add new square footage,
contemplates the concept of cannibalization. So I am not sure why it is any diﬀerent
in this environment.
So I think ultimately we will be measured on did we grow the enterprise or not. And
that is how we feel -- that is how we think about it and are we growing Walmart, are
we growing Sam's Club, are we growing over penetration in Brazil and China and
the UK. And are we investing the appropriate amount to do that? And we feel really
good about kind of where we are going on all three of those.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Neil Ashe{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
So we have got one here and then if we can get a mic up here, please.
I had two questions, one on economics and then one on the diﬀerence in fulﬁlling
grocery versus general merchandise. So on investments this year for you guys, you
have talked to a $0.06 to $0.09 hit from incremental investments in e-commerce.
If I add up all the increments over the last several years that would suggest that you
are over $1.5 billion in losses for e-commerce. Is that software engineers or what is
that number? Because it is a big one. Then what is the duration and path to
proﬁtability?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
So I think you might have overstated a little bit. But let's call it a big number for
round number purposes and where is that. Really three key areas, one is people, two
is the technology platform, three -- well four -- three is the fulﬁllment networks and
then four are scaling markets. And let me kind of reverse those.
I mentioned this earlier; we are doing all these markets at the same time. So that is a
-- that is going to cost us in an investment level.
Two is on the fulﬁllment networks, as you build these; they are a little diﬀerent than a
store economics in that you have a higher upfront capital and the growth rolls into
them and is ultimately larger over time. And you would expect the economics of that
facility to be a lower margin but higher return in general on the fulﬁllment
capabilities.
Then on technology on a percentage of revenue basis you would say we are
probably a little over invested versus what the ideal would be as a standalone entity.
But we have had signiﬁcant performance through that platform. And that platform
then has applicability to -- think of it as a commerce operating system. So it is
everything from what the customer sees to what the merchant sees to what the
operator sees.
And a lot of the analytics and capabilities that then can apply to -- so for my
colleagues, if Dave Cheesewright were sitting here he would tell you -- who runs
international, he would say what you guys are doing is really, really impressive and
really cool. But if we can ﬁgure out how to apply that the rest of the business it is a
total game changer.
So how will that investment level go over time? And I report to the Board on a
quarterly basis. I report to Doug and Charles on a weekly/monthly basis. So there is a
lot of scrutiny to that number and it is pretty smart folks that say, hey, this is the rightFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18

Page 13 of 18Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Neil Ashe
Q - Matt Fasslerlevel and maybe some think we should go faster and we want to prove out the
economics.
So you will see us continue growing faster than the market, which is obviously where
we are. And you will see us improve proﬁtability over time. And I think candidly the
lines will blur also as you start to see the beneﬁts of what we are doing from this
commerce operating system, customer relationship, e-commerce impact the
broader enterprise and the Walmart brand and the Sam's brand.
Neil, you brieﬂy mentioned your reporting relationships. Could you speak to the
success metrics that you and your senior colleagues have measured against,
particularly the portion of those success metrics that that show up in variable
compensation and then how that might vary between your shop and all the diﬀerent
stores in terms of stuﬀ that the stores fulﬁll on?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Yes. So I think you guys all know how we are compensated. But what I would do -- it
is highly performance driven; it's a combination of annual incentive compensation,
which is largely driven by operating income. In our case operating income and sales.
Then longer-term performance shares which are driven by -- largely by sales and
return on investment.
The e-commerce businesses are compensated based on total company
performance. So I am paid on total company performance. Then my team is paid,
which is the same as my colleagues, my peers, Greg and Dave and Roz and such.
Then our team is focused on that and they are paid on that and then they are also
paid on the individual performance of both Global eCommerce and then the folks
that work out of Walmart are the folks that work on Sam's Club.
So -- and that is also performance driven across the enterprise. And so, back to the
talent question. We are part of the broader enterprise and we want to be part of the
broader enterprise and we are incented to drive the performance of the broader
enterprise.
That means we lose out on some talent because we don't oﬀer a lottery ticket. But
we do tie to the success of the enterprise. And I feel that that is very important,
because ultimately -- back to basically these two questions which are, okay, show us
how this investment performs for the customers.
We should have a deeper relationship with customers at Walmart and that should
drive a better ﬁnancial return for the enterprise. So we need the organ to be grown
inside the organism eﬀectively and we don't want either to reject the other, candidly.
And we feel like we have found a balance that has proven successful for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18

A - Neil AsheWhile we get a mic over to the corner I want to make sure there is a question that I
get in for our team and for Heath and that relates to groceries. So we have had so far
today Ocado, we have had Instacart, there is a lot of diﬀerent business models that
are growing and making their way across the market. It might be that all of them will
work.
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Might be.
You are the biggest grocery retailer certainly in the US if not the world -- I don't know
the latter for a fact. But the former I do know. And you know an awful lot about
logistics. And you have moved pretty slowly I think relative to perhaps some others
in grocery. But you seem to have picked up the pace with certainly with testing and
experimentation.
How do you expect this to shake out for you based on what you have seen? And
particularly what you have seen with pickup, which you have been talking more
about as an organization?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
So retail is a hard business, Internet is a hard business. So Internet retail is a really
hard business. Grocery is a hard business. So grocery Internet retail is a really, really
hard business. And we like that.
So you know we have been at this grocery home shopping thing for a while, we have
been 15 years at ASDA I think, or 10 or 15 years -- way beyond my tenure. And Seiyu
in Japan. So we have -- and Superama in Mexico and we are doing it. So we kind of
have some experience about it.
And you have seen now the spectrum. If you have seen Ocado you have seen a
dedicated ﬁeld of dreams model, build it they will come. And built demand to it. And
push proﬁtability out and you see a crowd source model eﬀectively with Instacart go
pick up from some people's stores. Each is a hard business.
So the reason you haven't seen us go faster in the US is that the customer hasn't
really adopted it yet. And obviously the diﬀerence between the UK and the US is
obvious. What is it, ﬁve times the number of people and 25 times the amount of
space? So the question is, how and when?
So do we believe that there will be e-commerce for groceries and that customers will
-- yes. Are we building the ability to serve those customers eﬀectively? Yes. We are
testing in multiple markets that look diﬀerent, Denver, Phoenix, Huntsville, Northwest
Arkansas. And we are taking everything that we have learned at ASDA and we are
applying it to how we are doing it here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18

Q - Heath Terry
A - Neil AsheThe customer reaction so far has been very positive. So we feel -- and yet it is a really,
really hard business to execute. And so we feel like we are -- you hit on the key
themes, one is we are around the country. Two is we serve a lot of customers. Three
is we are really good at logistics. And four is we have a lot of throughput. Then ﬁve,
we have got great technology and consumer Internet experience.
And so, now you put all those things together and we feel like we have got a right to
play successfully with groceries over time. We have got to move at the pace of the
customer. So will we continue to do what we are doing? Absolutely. Will we look to
do more? Sure. And we are pacing it with the customers.
It's a lot of about this being a very customer centric set. So you want to be indiﬀerent
to what the customer wants to do, whether it is purchasing online or purchasing in
store. At what point do you guys become ﬁnancially indiﬀerent to what the customer
does? And even if it is not, hey, it's Third Quarter of 2017, what are the things that are
going to be required in order to get to that point?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Yes, I think that is a great question. We need throughput at each of those diﬀerent
pieces and then it all works. So -- and we need to combine our fulﬁllment capabilities
in ways that others can't to realize that advantage, largely around inventory
placement and transportation.
So we are indiﬀerent when we get enough customers doing any one of those things,
which we are conﬁdent that we can do because we have a lot of customers and we
already have a lot of -- we already have a lot of those nodes in place. So it's -- they
vary. That is true of grocery home shopping, that is true of pick up, that is true of the
(Aegis) fulﬁllment.
And we are on that path and we feel good about the direction. When exactly? It
varies based on place. But we feel really -- those are the keys and we feel like we are
down range on them.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
You know, Neil, one question I wanted to ask, because you guys recently made an
investment there, is China. It has been tough for just about everybody that has tried
to do it, whether traditional retail or online. What do you think Walmart brings to that
and what do you see as being the opportunity there?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Yes. So for those of you that don't know, we own 51% of a business called Yihaodian,
which is basically like our businesses, it is focused on value conscious female, maybe
a little higher-end Tier 1 cities, largely around what in China they call home goods
which is really groceries, consumables, essentials. And we feel really good about that
business. We also operate China retail.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18

Q - Matt FasslerWe -- that market is obviously highly competitive and has changed. But we feel really
good about that collection of positioning. So female head of household, value
conscious, home goods, a combination in the future of our Internet and our retail
assets is a diﬀerentiated market position there. So -- and we are -- it is a big market
and a long haul. So we will be there.
Another recent -- a recent announcement -- I don't know if you call it an
announcement. But certainly a revelation is that you are launching ShippingPass,
which is essentially, for lack of a better way to describe it, a parallel program to
Amazon Prime. You are going to charge a fee, an annual fee and provide free
delivery. I am sure you will clarify the deﬁnition as you would --.
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
I would present it diﬀerently.
No doubt, all due respect. In any event, if you would talk about what your game plan
is there, what your thought process is in launching that, how you expect it to evolve.
And in particular the diﬀerences from Amazon that are in the terms that have
emerged for that program?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
So we would present it as unlimited shipping at a low price. So for $50 a year you
can buy over 1 million items as many times as you want and have them delivered to
your door in three days or less. And I think the positioning is obvious, it's for those
who want reliable shipping at a predictable cost and that's -- this is for them.
We spent a lot of time talking to customers about what they cared most about and
we hit that sweet spot. They cared about -- they cared about predictability and they
cared about low cost. And so that is what we have delivered.
As you know, we have launched it as an invitation only and we have done that for a
combination of reasons. One, we want to make sure we can do it. Two, we want to
make sure that we understand what the customer behavior is.
And we ultimately think, Matt, that it will drive frequency, that it will drive a deeper
relationship with Walmart. And we think it provides an interesting contrast, which is
highly brand relevant, it is what you exactly -- I think what you would expect us to do,
be reliable and deliver a low cost.
You have a Marketplace. I think the investment community probably doesn't
understand that as well as anybody. You have a Marketplace, I believe you have
millions of SKUs -- 7 million to 10 million SKUs, something along those lines. Can youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18

A - Neil Ashetalk about the role of the Marketplace in your broader e-commerce eﬀort and talk
about its results and the success that you have had, challenges, etc.?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
Yes. So ﬁrst and foremost we think about the Marketplace as the opportunity for
assortment expansion. Assortment expansion allows us to have a more consistent
relationship with the customer whether or not they buy that stuﬀ from us. And we do
think that there is a -- you don't sell everything you oﬀer obviously.
And so, we are focused on providing access to everything that you would want so
that you would shop with us more. And that has been highly successful for us. As you
can see from our results, GMV is outpacing sales growth as we have grown that in
the US and in other markets, China, Brazil, etc., around the world.
And we will continue to do that because we think, number one, ﬁrst and foremost it
drives that deeper customer relationship that I was describing earlier. Over time also
it is a ﬁnancial driver. So it is -- it is a commission business. And so, we don't take
inventory risk or execution risk. Then ﬁnally, put that altogether and we want to be
the footprint that you, the customer, trust to come shop with us.
Great. We have time for one or two more questions from the audience or up here on
the podium.
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
I think we have worn them out.
Not at all. I guess last question, Savings Catcher. And this is kind of a broader
question, Walmart has no traditional discount oriented loyalty program. And I know
you have been talking more and more about the diﬀerent ways you have to capture
data, obviously your business being probably one of the key ones. But I want to talk
for a moment about Savings Catcher. What is that teaching you, if you will, for the
online business about the way customers are thinking about pricing?
{BIO 5665242 <GO>}
So as many of you know, I am sure everybody knows, Walmart is founded on a
principal of Everyday Low Price. And that Everyday Low Price means that you provide
the same access to all of your customers and you smooth -- you don't do high-low
and those sorts of things. And so, we never had a pay for you loyalty card.
I think we think we are entering a new environment on the relationship status which
is that we don't need to pay you to be our friend. And if you look at the breakage on
loyalty programs I think that is borne out whether it is airline miles or other things.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-18

A - Neil AsheBut what we do need to do is provide you services that are of value so that you want
to be a part of them. So Savings Catcher is an outstanding example of that. So it is a
service, it is an element of trust that says, hey, I have a relationship with Walmart, I am
trusting you to save. And obviously it is a win when you don't get any -- and the vast
majority of the transactions don't. But we have initiated a relationship.
And so, when I describe that full loop of now taking the e-commerce platform
experiences in mobile device and taking it back into the store with you, that is where
we're headed with that. Which is that we want you to want to tell us your (inaudible)
when you show up at Walmart so that we can provide you a better service and we
can do it more eﬃciently via technology than any retailer ever could have done it
before.
Whether that is Savings Catcher, whether it's pickup in the store, whether that is
extended aisle when you are in the store, those sorts of things. We are now closing
that loop so we know who all our customers are and we can scale that relationship
with them. We know a lot about them, of course. And we want them to want to get
beneﬁt from telling us who they are and allowing us to cater an experience to them.
Thank you for that. Next up in this room -- don't go anywhere, we have our private
equity panel. But before that starts, please join Heath and I in thinking Neil for his
time (inaudible).
