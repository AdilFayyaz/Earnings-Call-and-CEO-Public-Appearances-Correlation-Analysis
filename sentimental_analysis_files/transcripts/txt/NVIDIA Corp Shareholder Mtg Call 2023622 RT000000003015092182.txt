Thanks, Tim.
There are two simultaneous fundamental shifts happening in our industry. The ﬁrst is
the end of CPU scaling, the ability to get 10x more performance every ﬁve years has
ended. At the same time, a new era of computing has arrived. Generative AI is a new
kind of computer, one that you can program with natural human language and
automate the generation of valuable information. These two forces require a new
approach, and accelerated computing is widely recognized as the path forward.
Accelerated computing is a full-stack challenge. You have to re-engineer everything,
from the chip to the systems, to the system software, new algorithms, and optimizing
the applications. It's incredibly hard, but the rewards are high. With accelerated
computing, with accelerated computational science by 1 million times over the past
decade, accelerated computing and AI have arrived.
ChatGPT was the iPhone moment of AI. It all came together in a simple user
interface that anyone could understand. But we've only gotten our ﬁrst glimpse of its
full potential. Generative AI has started a new computing era, and will rival the
transformative impact of the Internet.
With AI, every student can have Aristotle as a tutor, and Newton, and Einstein. They
can turn to Jane Austen for guidance on writing, and Ada Lovelace for help with
math. AI will let anyone be a programmer and democratize the power of computing,
bridging the technology divide. In the arts, this remarkable tool will both be teacher
and apprentice, working with creatives to tap into the history of art to make inﬁnite
drafts and inﬁnite palettes that help the next generation of artists, musicians, writers,
and ﬁlmmakers express their visions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-22

Page 4 of 11The productivity of our businesses and factories will soar as we oﬄoad the menial
tasks and optimize the complex processes of the world's objects industries. Our
transportation system will be radically streamlined with AI at the helm. Autonomous
vehicles will transform community into leisure time while improving safety. With an AI
assistant by their side, doctors and nurses will have superpowers. AI enhanced
medical imaging can help every doctor identify and diagnose disease like
specialists.
AI is turbo-charging drug discovery as well. Currently, drug discovery costs about $2
billion for a drug with a 10 year plus year discovery process and a 90% failure rate. AI
has the potential to generate new targets and drug molecules, predict how potential
drugs might behave in the body, and discard dead end compounds before they
leave the computer.
AI is already helping us address the most complex scientiﬁc challenges. It is helping
process data from the James Webb Space Telescope so that we can see the universe
as we've never seen it before. Perhaps most urgently, this technology will help us
tackle one of the most intractable problems, climate change.
ForecastNet, the AI model of NVIDIA's Earth-2, can make week-long weather
forecasts in less than two seconds, orders of magnitude faster than current
simulation models and with greater conﬁdence. The aim of Earth-2 is to be a digital
twin of Earth's climate to predict the impacts of climate change so that scientists,
policy makers, and companies can develop the best strategies for mitigation and
adaptation. We've only just begun to witness AI's immense potential.
Data center workloads are skyrocketing and already account for about 1% to 2% of
global electricity consumption. It is imperative that data centers are accelerated. If
we switched workloads from CPU servers to GPU accelerated worldwide, we
estimate nearly 12 trillion watt hours of energy savings. That's roughly the annual
electricity used for nearly 2 million U.S. homes. We must accelerate every possible
workload to reclaim power so that computing can be sustainable. Accelerated
computing is sustainable computing.
NVIDIA is built like a four-layer computing stack: hardware, system software, platform
software, and applications. Each layer is open and available for integration into the
world's diverse data center architectures. More than 40,000 companies are already
running on NVIDIA to speed up, scale up, and unlock previously impossible to solve
problems. We oﬀer over 300 acceleration libraries and 400 AI models, with 100
added or updated in this past year alone.
NVIDIA acceleration library is built on CUDA, and all NVIDIA GPUs are CUDA-
compatible. 4 million developers are working with CUDA, and CUDA has been
downloaded more than 40 million times. It took 12 years to reach two million
developers, but we've doubled that number in the last 2.5 years. NVIDIA-accelerated
computing has reached an inﬂection point and is now a globally adopted computing
platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-22

Page 5 of 11This past year, we had some of the biggest innovations in our company's history,
opening new markets and creating new capabilities for our customers and partners.
The NVIDIA Hopper architecture is now powering the next wave of supercomputers.
The Hopper-based NVIDIA H100 packs 80 billion transistors and delivers an order of
magnitude performance leap over its predecessor, the Ampere-based A100. H100
HGX with eight H100s connected by NVLink into a giant GPU is the engine for
training large language models.
GH200 is our brand new CPU plus GPU superchip, known in the industry as Grace
Hopper, this revolutionary computer is designed for hyperscale data centers to scale
out and deploy large language model-based generative AI services. H100 HGX
trains the models. GH200 deploys the models. Both are in production. NVIDIA AI is
the engine behind the generative large language model breakthrough and the
foundation of the modern AI factory. Half of the Fortune 100 companies have
installed NVIDIA AI supercomputers. The rest use the cloud through one of NVIDIA's
cloud service provider partners. NVIDIA is in every cloud.
NVIDIA AI starts with an AI optimized GPU, but is much more. The most advanced
networking is essential. The network is the nervous system, the data highway of the
AI factory. NVIDIA Quantum InﬁniBand provides unmatched performance for the
largest scale AI infrastructures. For Ethernet-based AI clouds, the new NVIDIA
Spectrum X is an end-to-end BlueField to spectrum switch platform to achieve the
most eﬃcient AI processing.
Someday, every company will manufacture intelligence and NVIDIA can be their AI
factory. This past year, we introduced a new AI service that helped companies create
their own custom generative AI models. NVIDIA AI Foundations give customers the
ability -- the capability to build, reﬁne, and operate custom large language models,
and generative AI trained with their proprietary data and for their domain-speciﬁc
tasks.
The service includes pre-trained models, data processing frameworks, APIs, and
NVIDIA engineering staﬀ support. Once models are ready for deployment,
enterprises can run in our cloud or elsewhere. We announced key partnerships for AI
Foundations with ServiceNow and Adobe. AI is digitalizing heavy industries. The
largest industries from auto manufacturing to pharmaceuticals will be reinvented
and become some of the most advanced technology industries. Omniverse, our
platform for industrial digitalization made possible by NVIDIA RTX and NVIDIA AI,
enables companies to make and operate physical things to ﬁrst do it digitally.
Amazon has over 200 robotics facilities that handle millions of packages each day.
Using NVIDIA Omniverse and Isaac Sim Robot Simulator, Amazon Robotics is
building AI-enabled digital twins of its warehouses to better optimize warehouse
layout and ﬂow and train more intelligent robotic systems. Lowe's used Omniverse
to design, build, and operate digital twins of its stores to optimize operations. BMW
Group is using Omniverse to build a fully functioning factory digital twin before
building it in the real world. Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover are both using
Omniverse to generate scenarios to test and validate the next generation ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-22

automotive industry from design and engineering to manufacturing, autonomous
driving, and customer experience.
Although the past year was challenging, our teams worked through it -- our team's
work through it was all amazing. All of their hard work has positioned NVIDIA at the
forefront of this new era of computing. Our engagement with the world's industries
as they race to reinvent themselves for the era of generative AI is broad and
accelerating. NVIDIA now has over 26,000 families in 35 countries worldwide. We
have stuck to the principles we've shared since our founding to do hard, impactful
work that creates a better future.
To our incredible employees doing their life's work at NVIDIA, I thank you. Your
brilliance and craft and the culture we've created are NVIDIA's superpower. None of
this would be possible without our people. We also thank our partners, customers,
and shareholders for believing in and supporting our vision.
{BIO 3936302 <GO>}
Thanks, Jensen.
The time is 11:19 a.m. And the polls are now closed. The preliminary report of the
Inspector of Elections covering the proposals presented at this meeting is as follows:
First, each of the 13 Director nominees on the ballot has been elected to serve until
our 2024 annual meeting and until his or her successor is elected or appointed.
Proposal 2 to approve the ﬁscal 2023 compensation of our named Executive Oﬃcers
has been approved.
Proposal 3 to approve one year as the frequency for holding a vote on the
compensation of our named Executive Oﬃcers has been approved.
Proposal 4 to ratify PwC as NVIDIA's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm
for ﬁscal 2024 has been approved.
A full tally of the votes will be published in our Form 8-K, which we expect to ﬁle with
the SEC within four business days.
That concludes the formal portion of today's annual meeting, and I now declare the
business portion of the meeting adjourned.
I'll turn it over to Simona for stockholder questions.
Questions And Answers

A - Simona Jankowski(Question And Answer)
Thank you, Tim. And we'll now move to the Q&A portion. I'll read aloud each
question or comment. When we receive multiple questions asking about the same or
similar topics, we group those questions together to avoid repetition.
For our ﬁrst question, can you discuss how the company approaches ESG matters,
including diversity and inclusion, and how it balances ESG with creating shareholder
value?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
NVIDIA is focused on advancing accelerated and AI computing and the people, who
build it. We invented accelerated computing to solve problems that normal
computers can't. Our technology is revolutionizing computing and advancing
humanity by accelerating progress in areas like healthcare, autonomous vehicles,
and climate science, all while being incredibly energy eﬃcient.
The historical exponential trend of CPU scaling has ended. Increasing CPU
performance, coupled with only moderate power and cost increases is no more.
Data centers are already about 1% to 2% of global electricity consumption and
growing. And computing demand around the world is still increasing. This is not
sustainable for operating budgets and our planet.
Acceleration is the best way to reclaim power and achieve sustainability and net-
zero. For computing to be sustainable, data centers must accelerate every workload
possible. Accelerated workloads can be orders of magnitude, more energy eﬃcient,
and cost eﬀective. NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing and has built a large
installed base and a rich ecosystem of developers and applications available
everywhere. Accelerated computing is sustainable computing.
And regarding our people, our employees are our greatest asset and play a key role
in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. NVIDIA's top 100 leaders have
been with us for 15 years on average. Our top 1,000 leaders have been with NVIDIA
for over 12 years.
Our attrition rate so far this year is exceptional at less than 4%. We created an
environment for our people to do their life's work at NVIDIA, deliver excellent pay,
and take care of our families. We believe diverse teams with individuals representing
innovation and excellence are the heart of our core values. We want NVIDIA to
attract individuals from a range of backgrounds, who choose to stay here and build
their careers over their lifetime. We seek the best talent and build teams that will
continue to advance NVIDIA's business.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. Next, we received a few questions on how NVIDIA is approaching
possible artiﬁcial intelligence regulation, including how it respects the power of
artiﬁcial intelligence, and how it will be involved in future AI guidelines?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-22

AI is the greatest technology force of our time. Holds great promise to revolutionize
industries and improve human condition, and must be advanced, safely and
responsibly. AI software technology delivered as a product or service. Like any
product and service that aﬀects people and society, we believe AI should be
regulated. At NVIDIA, we have -- we are committed to developing AI that is
trustworthy and aligned to our values and principles and compliant with regulations
of the industries we serve.
For example, NVIDIA is a world leader in AI computing for autonomous vehicles and
robotics. Our AV system is designed with diversity and redundancy to achieve the
highest level of safety and able to function properly and safely even in the event of
system malfunction or failures. In generative AI, we partnered with Adobe, Getty, and
Shutterstock to oﬀer text-to-image generative AI models that respect and protect the
rights of artists and IP owners.
Another example of our AI safety focus is a software toolkit we recently made
available called NeMo Guardrails. This helps develop and deploy AI models that are
accurate, appropriate, and on-topic, and secure. Advancing AI capability and safety
must go hand-in-hand, we're dedicating to advancing AI on both fronts. We believe
future regulation will instill conﬁdence in a marketplace to adopt AI products and
services, which in turn will help expand and grow the industry.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Next: can you talk about how we select the product markets we target, the types of
products we sell, and our competitive advantage?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We choose to enable or participate in markets, where accelerated and AI computing
can lead to breakthroughs and advancements that otherwise would not be possible,
where a deeply challenging technical problem is far from being solved, and where if
solved, we can make a profound impact. Generative AI, autonomous systems and
robotics, computer-aided drug discovery, climate science, and digitalization of the
world's heavy industries are all examples of deeply challenging problems and
impactful opportunities. Each of these challenges require full-stack innovation and
data-centered scale to edge computing expertise to solve and the support of large
ecosystems of partners and application developers that give our platform reach. If
successful, we can make a signiﬁcant market impact while building a strong
competitive moat.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. We also received several questions regarding our capital allocation with
some stockholders asking if we will increase our dividend. We also received
questions on whether we would consider splitting the stock again.

A - Simona Jankowski
A - Jensen HuangOur company generates a signiﬁcant amount of cash. Allocation of our capital is a
top priority. First and foremost, we invest in organic growth. As we have an excellent
innovation engine and tremendous opportunity ahead of us, the vast majority of our
investment is organic. We also consider M&A opportunities if it is a good strategic
and cultural ﬁt. Our acquisition of Mellanox is an excellent example of this.
After investing in our business, a key capital allocation priority is share repurchases.
During the last ﬁscal year, we repurchased 63 million shares for $10 billion. We have
about $7 billion remaining in our current authorization through December, 2023.
We are committed to maintaining our dividend. With respect to the question on
splitting our stock, we have split our stock ﬁve times since inception, most recently in
2021. We review this periodically, and we consider a stock split if it is in the best
interest of our shareholders.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
And does NVIDIA have any acquisition plans for the future?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We've historically invested in the business organically to drive long-term growth. We
can also augment organic growth with M&A if it's a good strategic and cultural ﬁt.
For example, Mellanox, our largest acquisition to date has been an unquestionable
home run. The business has grown signiﬁcantly since we acquired them and have
been instrumental in our data center computing initiatives. And we expect a lot more
growth in the future.
We've also done a number of smaller M&A transactions over the last few years.
These have helped us with key engineering and technical talent or vertical domain
expertise to augment our platforms with key technologies and capabilities. We take
a disciplined approach when it comes to M&A guided by these criteria.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Would you speak to the company's compensation philosophy with respect to cash,
equity, and beneﬁts? How did NVIDIA determine its equity granting guidelines for
employees, executives, and directors? Is the company focused on stock repurchases
to oﬀset employee equity issuances?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
NVIDIA is building a one-of-a-kind company that invents the future, builds amazing
technologies, and strives to achieve the highest level of craft. To achieve this vision,
we must attract and retain a high-caliber board, executive team, and employees
while balancing our stockholders' interests. We believe that equity grants align our
oﬃcers and Board interests with stockholders, creating long-term value in the
company.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-22
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 11A - Simona Jankowski
A - Jensen HuangWe aim to be a top-paying company to attract the world's best talent. For executives
and oﬃcers and directors, we provide compensation which is competitive with
market practices, aligns to stockholder interests, and for our executives and oﬃcers,
includes at-risk equity pay to align compensation with company performance goals.
Along with our annual review of compensation practices against our peers, we allow
our stockholders to cast non-binding votes on our oﬃcers' compensation each year.
Our Directors and Oﬃcers are required to meet stock ownership guidelines. We
believe these ownership requirements display the conﬁdence our Directors and
Oﬃcers have in the company and align their interests with stockholders. More
information on equity grants and holdings of our Directors and Oﬃcers can be
found in our proxy statement.
We're focused on repurchasing our stock to oﬀset the dilution of employee equity
issuances. As we discussed earlier during our last ﬁscal year, we repurchased $10
billion in stock, and we have about $7 billion remaining in our repurchase
authorization.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Our next question is: how do you think about Board composition and the
nomination process?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Our nominating and corporate governance committee strives to maintain an
appropriate balance of tenure, professional experience, and a diversity of
background, skills, and education on the Board. Each year, NCGC, our governance
committee, and Board review each Director's individual performance and
qualiﬁcations, including the Director's past contributions, outside experiences and
activities, and committee participation, and determine his or her experience and
skills continue to add value to NVIDIA and the Board, given our current and future
business models.
The speciﬁc rationale for each Director's nomination to our board is included
following their respective biographies in our proxy statement. The committee and
the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment. While the Board
beneﬁts from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer serving
directors bring, it has also brought in new perspectives and ideas through the
appointment of two new Directors since 2020. The Board has regularly rotated
memberships on and the Chairman of its committees. We believe this helps to
promote diversity of viewpoints on the Board committees.
Our longer tenure directors are familiar with our operations and business and help
to oversee our activities in a variety of economic and competitive environments. Our
newer Directors have brought expertise and brand development and cybersecurity
and familiarity with technology developments at leading academic institutions that
are important to NVIDIA as it develops new products and interesting markets.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-06-22

ethnically or racially diverse. The Board continues to seek highly qualiﬁed women
and individuals from underrepresented groups to include an initial pool of potential
Director nominees. We expect Board diversity to increase before our 2024 meeting.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
And what is NVIDIA doing to prevent or minimize the possible theft of company
ideas, strategies, and intellectual property?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We take intellectual property and data security seriously. We continuously monitor
our systems and endpoints for internal and external threats. Our teams are required
to operate within industry standard security controls to be resilient to unauthorized
attack or access. Like many global companies, we face a constantly evolving and
sophisticated threat environment. We partner with external parties to access and
update our security measures to meet this challenge. We also follow patent
protection on our key technologies and regularly review our patent portfolio to
strengthen our intellectual property protection.
