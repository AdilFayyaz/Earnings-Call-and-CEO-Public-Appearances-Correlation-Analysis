Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I really love the incredible energy in
that opening. It represents the way we feel about California. California has always
been a place for people with big ambitions and big dreams. A place where people
are fueled with optimism to make things better, to make things that can change the
world. It is such an important part of who we are at Apple, and inspires us in
everything we create and do. We're proud to call, California our home. We have a lot
to talk about today.
Let's get started with Apple TV+. Apple TV+ is a home to the world's most creative
storytellers and continues to expand with award-winning programming. Apple
Original series, ﬁlms and documentaries have now been honored with more than a
130 wins and over 500 nominations in less than two years. We're still proud this year
that Apple TV+ has 35 Primetime Emmy nominations, including 20 for Ted Lasso, our
record for the ﬁrst season of a comedy series. And we're just getting started. Let's
take a quick look at a few shows that are premiering this fall.
(Video Presentation)
I can't wait for all the new shows and movies coming to Apple TV+, including the
second season are one of my favorites. The Morning Show, which starts this Friday.
Next, we are thrilled to share our newest product announcements. Starting with iPad.
There is no other device like iPad, and today it's more popular and more essential
than ever. And the reason it's so popular is it's amazing versatility. They can transform
into whatever you needed to be. With advanced displays users can literally touch
their content unlike any other device. With powerful and eﬃcient Apple design
chips, iPad delivers breathtaking performance all day long. And with fast
connectivity, advanced cameras and accessories like the Magic Keyboard and AppleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14

Page 2 of 18Melody SiganporiaPencil, iPad becomes even more versatile, extending what users can do on iPad, and
where they can do it.
At the heart of it all, is iPad OS, delivering powerful features while maintaining the
simplicity of a touch ﬁrst experience. What makes iPad even more versatile or the
over one million apps designed speciﬁcally for it's large cameras. The iPad business
has never been stronger. We've grown by over 40% this past year. We have a great
line-up today with industry-leading customer satisfaction, and it's about to get even
stronger. It starts with our most popular iPad, which delivers the full iPad experience
at an incredibly aﬀordable price. And today it gets even better. This is the new iPad.
And to tell you all about it, here's Melody.
This new iPad is packed full of updates. So let's jump in. Under the hood is the more
powerful chip, A13 Bionic, and it pushes even further than the speedy A12 from last
year's iPad, with 20% faster performance in every aspect of the chip, from the CPU
and GPU to the neural engine. A13 is leaps ahead of the competition. In fact, it makes
this iPad up to three times faster than the best-selling Chromebook, and up to six
times faster than the best-selling Android tablet. And it means users will see even
more responsive performance for all the things they love to do on iPad.
From everyday uses like messaging and browsing the web, to playing immersive
high-quality games, and as users explore more advanced apps like Adobe Fresco
with its super realistic water colors, A13 delivers the performance they need and then
some. And the more powerful neural engine in A13 makes next generation machine
learning experiences like Live Text in iPad OS 15 even faster. The upgraded image
signal processor in A13 also means the real camera captures great photos with
improved autofocus in low light and better selﬁes from the front camera as well. Now
the front camera on iPad is essential for things like remote learning and connecting
with family, and that's why we're so thrilled to give it a big upgrade. It's now a 12
megapixel Ultra Wide camera that produces a huge leap in image quality and
enables a super popular feature from iPad Pro. And that's Center Stage.
We're bringing the magical Center Stage experience from iPad Pro to this new iPad,
enabled by the Ultra Wide front camera and the neural engine. Center Stage makes
video calls more engaging by automatically detecting people and dynamically
adjusting the frame as they move around or as more people join in. It works in
landscape orientation and portrait, so users can enjoy Center Stage in all the ways
they use iPad. Not only does Center Stage work in base time, it makes video calls
more natural and other popular apps like Zoom, BlueJeans and WebEx, and it's not
just for video conferencing, users can record stream and post Center Stage video in
apps like Double-Tick explain everything and TikTok. It makes you more productive
on iPad, and it's simply more fun.
Another new feature coming to this iPad that users love is True Tone. It adjusts the
display. It's the color temperature of a room to provide a more comfortable viewingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14

Unidentiﬁed Speakerexperience. And by retaining the same popular design, this iPad supports a vast
array of accessories, including the Thin and Light Smart Keyboard and third-party
keyboards like Logitech's latest Rugged Combo with Trackpad for schools. And of
course this iPad supports the ﬁrst generation Apple Pencil, where iPad OS makes the
experience of using Apple Pencil as easy a natural as Pen And Paper. And this new
iPad will ship with iPad OS 15, which is packed with great new features.
For example, you can place widgets among your apps, making important
information available with just a glance. New multitasking controls make it even
easier to launch and use multiple apps. Quick Note gives you a fast and easy way to
take notes anywhere, and the list goes on. iPad OS is so immensely capable and so
easy to use. When you combine it with a beautiful display, great cameras, broad
accessory support, gigabit class LTE, and all-day battery life, this iPad delivers
enormous value, because this new iPad starts at just 329, and that's with twice the
storage, starting at 64-gigabytes. For schools, it's even more aﬀordable at just 299. It
comes in Space Gray and Silver and cellular models are available as well. You can
order the new iPad today, and it will be available next week. With the power of A13
Bionic, a new 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage, True Tone,
double the storage and the versatility of iPad OS 15. This is a giant upgrade for our
most popular iPad.
Now back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
We're excited that our most popular iPad is now so much better. And now, let's talk
about iPad Mini. There is simply no other device like iPad Mini. It gives users all the
power of iPad, it is most portable form, which makes it indispensable for a wide
range of uses like when it secured to the lack of a pilot in ﬂight, are pulled from a
doctor's lab coat to care for patients in the ER. iPad Mini is in a class of its own. And
today, we're giving our little less iPad, its biggest upgrade ever. Introducing the all-
new iPad Mini.
As Tim said, we're giving iPad Mini a huge set of updates. Our complete redesign
that puts everything our users love about iPad, right in the palm of their hand. The
all-new enclosure features a beautiful all screen design with narrow borders and
elegant rounded corners. The design is remarkably thin and light and absolutely
stunning. And iPad Mini now comes in a gorgeous array of new colors, purple, pink,
starlight, and space gray. And this design features a brilliant Liquid Retina display.
With this new design, we were able to increase the screen size all the way out to 8.3
inches, while keeping the same compact footprint with wide color, True Tone, 500
nits of brightness and the lowest reﬂectivity in the industry, everything you view on
iPad Mini will look great, wherever you go. And delivering this edge to edge screen,
meant ﬁnding a new location for Touch ID. So just like iPad Air, we put it right in the
top button of iPad Mini.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 4 of 18Touch ID is fast, easy, and secure, whether you're unlocking your iPad or using Apple
Pay. iPad Mini is already the fastest device of its kind. And the performance of the
new iPad Mini is simply remarkable. Compared to the previous generation, the new
iPad Mini sees a 40% jump in CPU performance and a whopping 80% leap in GPU
performance. So, whether you're using four ﬂight to navigate your ﬂight plan with
live wind speed overlays or playing the graphically rich game Star Wars Hunters,
online with your friends. The new iPad Mini will power right through it with ease.
And the neural engine for powerful machine learning applications also takes a big
leap forward on the new mini, increasing performance by up to two times over the
previous generation. Combined with the CPU and the GPU, the neural engine
enables apps to deliver next level experiences. Like the new translater in iPad OS 15,
which can automatically translate a conversation in real time. The performance of the
new iPad Mini is on a whole new level. And we know that iPad users rely on ultrafast
connections. Well, the most mobile iPad is about to get a lot faster and even more
versatile. iPad Mini now has a USBC port. So you get the same great USBC
functionality that we brought to iPad Air, which means it's up to 10 times faster than
its predecessor.
So iPad Mini can now connect to a vast ecosystem of USBC accessories, which is
great, whether you're a photographer, who needs to connect to cameras when
shooting on location or a doctor in a remote area using butterﬂy to conduct an
ultrasound. And when users are on the go, it's crucial to have access to the fastest
regular connections, and that's why we're bringing 5G to iPad Mini. Download
speeds can be up to 3.5 gigabits per second. This is key when you need to stay
connected on the go. Like when technicians use Splunk AR on-site to access real-
time data, performance analytics and complex schematics, or if you're using Share
Play to take a Masterclass with your friends. 5G keeps you connected.
Next, let's talk about the cameras and audio. Users rely on iPad Mini for face time,
taking photos and videos and experiencing AR. So we've updated both the front and
back cameras. The back camera now features a 12-megapixel sensor with focus
pixels and a larger aperture to capture sharp vivid photos. And we added a True
Tone ﬂash to many for improved photos in low light. With a new ISP, users will see
enhanced photos with Smart HDR, which improves image quality by recovering
details in shadows and highlights. And now with the ability to record in 4K, iPad Mini
becomes your mobile movie studio. On the front, iPad Mini features the new 12-
megapixel Ultra Wide camera, which means that also supports Center Stage.
As Melody mentioned, this has been a huge hit on iPad Pro, and now it's coming to
iPad Mini. And iPad Mini also features a new speaker system with stereo in
Landscape. Great for listening to your favorite playlist, or doing an Apple Fitness+
workout in your hotel room. And iPad Mini's versatility is further enhanced by it's
amazing accessories. There is a new set of slim Smart Folio covers in beautiful
coordinating colors that complement the new iPad Mini ﬁnishes. Perfect for
expressing your personal style. And now, iPad Mini supports the amazing second
generation Apple Pencil, which magnetically attaches to the side of iPad Mini. So it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14

(Video Presentation)
With its all-new design and huge boost in performance, the new iPad Mini starts at
just 499, and it will be available in both Wi-Fi and cellular conﬁgurations. You can
order it today, and it will be available next week. So this is the all-new iPad Mini,
featuring a brilliant Liquid Retina display, superfast performance, new cameras front
and back, Center Stage, 5G, support for Apple Pencil and all new colors. With all of
these new features, this is by far the most powerful and versatile iPad Mini ever.
And with both the new iPad and iPad Mini, we continue our commitment to the
environment. Both of these iPad models are built with a 100% recycled aluminum
enclosure. And this marks a milestone for iPad. Every single iPad in the lineup now
features a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure. This is just one of the many ongoing
eﬀorts we have underway to reduce the environmental impact of our products.
Now back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
With the even more capable new iPad and a phenomenal new iPad Mini, our iPad
lineup is the best it's ever been. Next, let's talk about Apple Watch. Apple Watch is
an indispensable daily companion that keeps you connected to the people and
things you care about most. It encourages you to be active and get more out of your
workouts. And it monitors your health, helping you live a better day. I am so inspired
by the impact we've had on people's lives. And we continue to push the boundaries
of what Apple Watch can do. To tell you about what's next, here's Jeﬀ.
{BIO 16886071 <GO>}
Being more active is one of the best ways to stay healthy, and it's been at the heart of
Apple Watch, since the beginning. Well, today we're adding new features to Apple
Watch for everyone who rides a bike. Watch owners say will detect when you begin
riding and remind you to start to work out, and it will automatically pause and
resume, if you stop temporarily. And Watch owners say as fall detection to cycling or
sensing the unique motion and impact of falls or riding a bike. And Apple Watch
now better supports e-bikes with an improved workout algorithm to more accurately
calculates calories. These cycling updates join all the other great additions in Watch
owners say, like the Mindfulness app, in memories and photos. And this year, we
focused on making these features and everything you do on watch bigger and
better. Introducing the next generation of Apple Watch.

Jeﬀ WilliamsThis is the incredible Apple Watch Series 7. It takes all the great features of Apple
Watch and combines them with our largest and most advanced display ever. The
new retina display on Series 7 is nearly 20% more screen area than Series 6, and it's
an even bigger jump over Series 3 with over 50% more screen area. The Series 7
display has been completely re-engineered to reduce the borders to just 1.7
millimeters, that's 40% thinner than on Series 6. It's an incredible innovation that
maximizes the screen area, while barely changing the dimensions of the watch itself.
And the shape of the Watch has also been reﬁned. Both the case and the display of
Series 7 have softer more rounded corners. The new display refracts lighted it's
edges for a subtle wraparound eﬀect, creating a seamless integration with the
curvature of the case. And it's also up to 70% brighter indoors when your wrist is
down, making it even easier to discreetly check the time. This new display is an
industry ﬁrst and we fully optimized the user interface for it.
Here's Lauren to tell you more.
Across the user interface on Series 7, buttons have been redesigned and enlarged to
complement the size and shape of the new display. Like in stopwatch, activity and
alarms making them even easier to tap. It can also ﬁt nearly 50% more text on screen
then Series 6. This helps you read messages and e-mails with a lot less scrolling.
Series 7 also features new ways to input text. There is a full keyboard that you can
either tap or slide from letter to letter with quick path, which uses machine learning
to predict the word you're typing.
There are also new watch faces designed speciﬁcally for Series 7. The dynamic
contour face animates on risk rates, pushing the dial right out to the edge. And a
new modular face leverages the extra screen area with two large data rich center
complications. All of these improvements give series 7, the best user experience of
any Apple Watch. We also improved durability which is another a central aspect of
Apple Watch. Series 7 is the most durable Apple Watch we've ever built. It has our
most crack resistant front crystal, thanks to a stronger and more robust geometry. It's
also the ﬁrst Apple Watch to have IP 6x certiﬁcation. So you don't have to worry
about wearing it industry environments. And of course, it's still so improved with
WR50 water resistance.
With our best ever durability, you can take Series 7 anywhere you want to go, and
use it all day long with the same great 18-hour battery life. Series 7 also has an
improved charging experience. It charges up to 33% faster than Series 6 with an
updated charging architecture and new fast-charging USBC cable, it takes just 45
minutes to go from zero to 80% charge and eight minutes of charging is enough for
eight hours of sleep tracking. We think customers will love the optimized user
interface, best ever durability and faster charging of Series 7.

With Apple Watch Series 7, the most advanced smartwatch ever and the incredible
new content and features in Apple Fitness+, we can't wait to see the impact. They're
sure to have on our users' lives. Now, let's talk about iPhone. iPhone has forever
changed the world. Every single day, people rely on iPhone from their most
demanding task to capturing the moments of their lives, streaming their favorite TV
shows, playing their favorite games, staying up to date with the news of the world
and connecting with friends and loved ones. This is what drives us to create the best

beautiful and durable designs with water-resistance and great battery life, with
industry-leading performance and the world's most advanced camera systems and
with privacy built-in. People love iPhone, and we keep making iPhone better, more
powerful, more capable and even more fun to use. Today, we are thrilled to
introduce our next generation of iPhone. Here it is.
This is iPhone 13. To tell you more, here's Kayane [ph].
(Video Presentation)
Let's take a closer look at iPhone 13, starting with design. It has the sleek ﬂat edge
design that people love. It's also incredibly durable with our exclusive Ceramic
Shield front, tougher than any smartphone glass and has industry-leading IP68 Water
Resistance. iPhone 13 has a new look for the advanced dual camera system with the
lenses arranged diagonally. The aerospace grade aluminum frame is beautifully
formed and really shows oﬀ ﬁve new colors and all new Pink, Blue, Midnight,
Starlight and Product Red. On the front, the TrueDepth camera system has been re-
engineered to provide more display area. Everything inside, including Face ID, the
most secure facial authentication in a smartphone ﬁts into a space that's 20%
smaller.
IPhone 13 is designed with the environment in mind, using many recycled materials.
For example fees and channel lines use up-cycle plastic water bottles, an industry
ﬁrst. Under the hood, iPhone 13 has been completely re-architected to make room
for new technologies and a bigger battery. This beautiful design is the same across
two sizes; iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. Both feature a more advanced Super RetinaFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14

videos with the incredible contrast ratio of our OLED display. This new brighter
Super Retina XDR display delivers an immersive viewing experience with support for
Dolby Vision, HDR 10 and HLG.
Now, let's talk about the chip, that powers iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. Frankly, the
competition is still playing catch up to our chips, not just from last year, but even
from two years ago. And today, we're extending our lead with A15 Bionic. Here's
(inaudible) to tell you all about it.
Our silicon is the engine of iPhone. With A15 Bionic, we have innovations across the
entire system to deliver more performance and power eﬃciency. At it's foundation,
A15 uses ﬁve nanometer technology, which enables us to include nearly 15 billion
transistors. You'll absolutely ﬂy through demanding workﬂows smoothly and
eﬃciently. Thanks to our powerful new six core CPU with two high performance and
four high eﬃciency cores. With increased performance of our CPUs dedicated
machine learning accelerators, that power experiences such as advanced text-to-
speech in Siri, and on-device processing of directions in maps. It's the fastest CPU in
any smartphone, up to 50% faster than the leading competition..
For graphics intensive tasks like advanced games, A15 Bionic features our latest four
core GPU, enabling more eye-catching visuals and lighting eﬀects. It delivers up to
30% faster graphics versus the leading competition. And we continue to push the
limits of machine learning with the new 16-core neural engine that is perfect for ML
tasks. It's capable of an astounding 15.8 trillion operations per second. We design
our neural engine together with our camera hardware and software teams. This
unique vision in integration brings to life leading capabilities in video and mH
processing. This means faster ML computations for experiences like life text with iOS
15. Point your camera at text on the go and instantly take action like buying tickets for
getting directions.
The ML advancements across our entire chip will empower developers to do even
more in their apps. Like SwingVision, which can smoothly run powerful core ML and
AR models on A15 Bionic, for real-time short-tracking, video analysis and remote
coaching. PeakVisor helps you navigate the outdoors to identify mountains and
explore detail rich 3D maps while hiking. And seek uses a machine learning model
trained by over 20 million photos to instantly identify plants and animals around you.
And all the processing is done on device. A15 is a powerhouse. In addition to core
performance improvements, there is a new display engine, new video encoder and
decoder and twice the system catch [ph]. There is nothing in the world like this job.

Page 11 of 18Johnny TrenhA15 Bionic also powers the amazing camera system on iPhone 13. It combines our
powerful cameras, next generation image signal processor and computational
photography to create our most advanced dual camera system. The only wide
camera, let you take stunning shots in any situation, like this photo, full of color and
texture. It gathers 47% more light for less noise and brighter results in your photos
and videos. This is enabled by larger 1.7 micron pixels that capture more light and a
wide at 1.6 aperture. It's the biggest sensor we've ever put in our dual camera
system.
IPhone 12 Pro Max introduced in amazing advanced technology, censorship optical
image stabilization. And incredibly we are bringing this to iPhone 13 and iPhone 13
Mini. Here's a low light photo from the new wide camera with censorship OIS. The
larger sensor captures nearly 50% more light, hard to believe this photo was taken in
a dark room with just a little light coming through a window. Night mode shots are
even more impressive. Capture times are shorter too for sharper images of your
subjects and ﬁnd details. We've also custom designed a new Ultra Wide camera that
will reveal more of the dark areas with less noise like you see here in the walls and
ceilings. Capturing fun creative perspective is easy with the Ultra Wide and now it's
even better on iPhone 13.
Now let's switch to video. iPhone already has the highest quality video in a
smartphone, and iPhone 13 brings a brand new feature cinematic mode. Now over to
Johnny to tell you more.
Filmmakers if you spoke is changes to tell engaging stories for decades. It's a
technique called rack focus, that require skill, planning and creative vision. You've
seen rack focus used in all your favorite ﬁlms. It brings a whole new dimension to
storytelling. Well, we're bringing this capability to iPhone in a simple and intuitive
way, so you can capture cinema style moments, even if you aren't a professional
ﬁlmmaker. And guess what, the movie clip you just saw was shot on iPhone, and
we'd love to show you more.
(Video Presentation)
It's remarkable and so easy to use. Just start recording and cinematic mode will hold
focused on the subject, even when they're moving. Focus transitions happen
automatically in real-time, like from one subject to another. Cinematic mode
anticipates when the subject is about to enter the frame and intelligently racks focus
to them when they do. I want to subject cases away from the camera, iPhone itself
changes focus and then back.
To create these automatic focus changes, we extensively studied the art of
cinematography. And the creative choices, directors of photography make to guide
the viewers attention. We combined these learnings with computational algorithms.
So you can eﬀortlessly create cinema grade videos. For more creative control, you
can tap to shift focus at anytime. Tap again to lock and track focus on the subject.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14

sensor and the incredible power of A15 Bionic, which grades each frame in Dolby
Vision live while you're recording. And that's cinematic mode.
Now back to Kayane.
IPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini have advanced new camera systems with censorship
OIS, fantastic low light performance and cinematic mode also on the front TrueDepth
camera. Next, let's turn to 5G. Millions and millions of iPhone users are already
experiencing 5G every day for superfast downloads and uploads, lower latency and
new experiences on the go. And on iPhone 13, we've innovated further on custom
design antennas and radio components that let us add more bands, so iPhone 13
works on 5G with the latest speeds and in more places.
The world is moving quickly to 5G. We're collaborating with more carrier partners for
the best call quality performance, coverage, and battery life. By the end of the year,
we will double 5G support to over 200 carriers in 60 countries and regions. That
means you can beneﬁt from 5G in more places than ever to bench watch your
favorite shows together using Share Play on Apple TV+, and even more streaming
partners for video and music. You can be ultra competitive in multiplayer games,
share surprise greetings from a celebrity in High Res over cameo or take the sound
at any live event to a whole new level with mix halo. 5G is taking over and iPhone 13
is ready with the best 5G experience.
Now let's talk about battery life, which is really important to our users. iPhone 13 has
a faster chip, faster 5G speeds, a brighter OLED display and the most advanced dual
camera system ever in an iPhone. And with all these new capabilities, the iPhone 13
lineup has better battery life. On iPhone 13 Mini, most users will experience an hour-
and-a-half longer in their day then with iPhone 12 Mini. And on iPhone 13, two-and-a-
half hours longer than iPhone 12 for incredible all-day battery life. This amazing
battery life is delivered by A15 Bionic, more power-eﬃcient components, a bigger
battery, and power optimizations from our deep hardware and software integration.
Like smart data mode, which intelligently conserves battery life by automatically
shifting your iPhone to LTE when 5G speeds are needed.
We also look at every opportunity to improve privacy. With iPhone and iOS privacy is
built-in from the beginning. What's iOS 15, Siri uses on device speech recognition,
meaning your Siri audio requests do not leave your iPhone by default. Intelligent
tracking prevention now prevents trackers from proﬁling you using your IP address.
And mail privacy protection hides your IP address and prevents centers from
learning about your mail activity. Another huge beneﬁt of owning an iPhone is the
vast ecosystem that extends what iPhone can do. That includes MagSafe, which we
introduced last fall, it has been ahead. From multi-chargers and swilling charger
stands to cases, wallets, tripods and car mounts, along with our own accessories for
charging like the MagSafe battery pack.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14

Unidentiﬁed SpeakerFor iPhone 13, we have leather, silicone and clear cases in stunning new colors and
engineered to work perfectly with MagSafe. We also have a new MagSafe leather
wallet that supports 5Mike. You can now be notiﬁed of the last known location where
your wallet was separated from your iPhone. iPhone 13 is loaded with new
technologies, including cinematic mode, A15 Bionic that's faster than the
competition, our most advanced dual camera system with censorship OAS, longer
battery life, 5G and so much more. With all this, iPhone 13 still starts at just 699. We
also have some fantastic oﬀers from Apple and our partners, including up to $700 oﬀ
in the US, when you trade in a qualifying iPhone. And we are increasing the starting
capacity to 128 gigabytes for double the storage, and adding a new 512-gigabyte
option. iPhone 13 is impressively powerful. Let's see it in action.

Now back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
We are so excited for iPhone 13. With all of its power and capability, we can't wait to
see what our customers will do with it. And we're not done yet. Our Pro lineup
pushes the limits with our most advanced technologies for our users who want the
very best iPhone, best-in-class performance, best-in-class camera experience, great
durability, larger displays and incredible design. This year we build on that in a major
way. Let's take a look at our most Pro iPhone ever.
(Video Presentation)
This is iPhone 13 Pro. To tell you more, here's Joss.
IPhone 13 Pro features our most Pro Design, with exceptional materials like these
surgical grade stainless steel bands. Each band goes through a physical vapor
deposition process to create an Apple custom ﬁnished that is so elegant, yet
incredibly resisted to abrasion and corrosion. iPhone 13 Pro comes in four striking
ﬁnishes, a rich deep graphite, gorgeous gold, beautiful silver, and this all new Sierra
Blue. The Sierra Blue required an entirely new process using multiple layers of
nanometer scale metallic ceramics applied across the surface were a stunning and
very durable ﬁnish.
IPhone 13 Pro has a newly designed front with the TrueDepth camera system that's
20% smaller. On the back you'll see our incredible new camera system with beautiful
stainless steel trim that perfectly surrounds the sapphire crystal lenses of each of our
three new cameras and a beautiful textured back glass, that feels great and shows oﬀ
the standing color. On the front, it has our incredible Ceramic Shield that is tougher
than any smartphone glass. It also has industry leading IP68 water resistance. And
the inside has been completely redesigned to support our latest pro technologies
including the all-new camera system, incredible new display and a bigger battery.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 14 of 18iPhone 13 Pro also supports MagSafe in the ever-expanding ecosystem of really cool
new accessories, and it's joined by the larger iPhone 13 Pro max.
Now let's talk about performance in the powerful new A15 Bionic. As you heard from
Hope, A15 bionic features a CPU with two new high performance cores and four new
high eﬃciency cores, and a faster neural engine, as well as our new ISP, which
provides improved noise reduction and tone mapping. And for these Pro models
A15 Bionic includes our most powerful graphics ever with a new ﬁve core GPU. It
provides up to 50% faster graphics performance of the leading competition. In fact,
iPhone 13 Pro has the fastest graphics performance in any smartphone ever. Rate for
high-performance gaming and our most powerful camera features like Apple Pro
Raw and 4K Dolby Vision video. And the A15 Bionic chips, new ﬁve core GPU, and
custom display engine combined with an amazing new display, it takes the iPhone
experience even further.
This year we're proud to introduce an entirely new Super Retina XDR display. With a
new, more eﬃcient OLED panel, the display now supports up to a 1,000 nits peak
outdoor brightness, as 25% higher than last year, and for the ﬁrst time we're bringing
Pro Motion to iPhone. With our latest technology, this Pro Motion display can refresh
from as low as 10 hertz to as high as 120 hertz. Pro Motion is designed to respond
dynamically and match your content. The advanced customer architecture produces
fast frame rates when you need them and preserves battery life when you don't.
We also optimize iOS to take more advantage of this. For example, when swiping
between apps are scrolling, the system adapts to frame rates to precisely match the
speed of the users ﬁnger. The result is an incredibly responsive experience that is
fast and ﬂuid. Of course promotion is also great for apps, providing more responsive
inputs, smoother graphics, and more precise game play. I'll provide a few
developers to see what they can do with it, and the results were amazing. Alright.
Let's go. I work on the title called MARVEL Future Revolution.
(Video Presentation)
The new Super Retina XDR display with Pro Motion comes in two great sizes; 6.1 inch
and 6.7 inch. And the custom designed OLED panels work across diﬀerent lighting
conditions and content types maintaining incredible color accuracy and contrast.
Now let's talk about the all-new iPhone 13 Pro camera system. This is our biggest
camera advancement ever. To tell you more about it, here's Luce.
IPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max introducing all new camera system. Starting
with the new 77-millimeter Telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. Our new Ultra
Wide camera with autofocus and a larger at f/1.8 aperture with a 92% improvement
in the light, and a new wide camera, it has a larger f1.5 aperture and 1.9 micron pixels
for our largest sensor ever, with up to 2.2 times improvement in low light, to get
beautiful photos in any situation. The larger sensor of the wide oﬀers more light
gathering for less noise and faster shutter speeds and even longer brackets. We're
shooting night mode photos with the tripod. The new 77-millimeter TelephotoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14
Apple Inc (AAPL US Equity)
Page 15 of 18enables beautiful classic portrait photos and 3x optical zoom for photos and videos.
For a total 6x optical zoom range on iPhone 13 Pro. With the new Ultra Wide low light
photos are brighter and sharper with more details like you see in herdress or omni-
couch [ph].
The Ultra Wide camera also enables something entirely new on iPhone. Macro
photography. Macro photography typically uses the special lens. They can focus at
close distances. The new Ultra Wide lens design and autofocus system enable
incredibly sharp focus and can magnify subjects with a minimum distance of two
centimeters. So you can get detailed concepts like of this beautiful red daisy, the
sales in this lease [ph], or the water droplets on this machine. And for the ﬁrst time,
all of the cameras, including the Telephoto have nine mode, which is made possible
by advanced computational photography. With high integration between hardware
and software, our cameras can do even more. To tell you all about it, here's Rebecca.
Once turning the iPhone camera system, we shoot and review thousands of photos.
Analyzing all of those photos allows us to deliver features like Smart HDR 4, which
automatically brings improved color, contrast and lighting for each subject in a
group photo, including for challenging shots like this. Our software and ISP, adjusts
for diﬀerent lighting and we've made improvements for skin tones. So, everyone
looks even better. We are also introducing a way to personalize their iPhone camera
with photographic styles. This is a feature that pro photographers are going to love.
Photographic styles bring your individual preferences right into our advanced image
pipeline applying local at it's like a photo editor would, but in real-time as we run
through the photo. That means we get all the beneﬁts of our multi-frame image
processing pipeline with the ability to customize it, in the way you can never achieve
with a simple ﬁlter. Select from one of our four default styles before you shoot, for
example, rich contrast for a bolder look, or vibrant for a punchier look, each uses our
deep cemented understanding to intelligently apply the right amount of
adjustments to diﬀerent parts of the photo by preserving skin tones. You can also
customize the styles further with Tone and Warmth, which combine multiple
attributes for a look, that's all your own.
Stoves works across scenes and subject types. You don't need to set it every time. So
you can deﬁne your style and use it across your photos. And that's photographic
styles come into iPhone 13 Pro, and we're excited to bring into iPhone 13 as well.
Now back to Joss.
The all-new Pro camera system combined with the power of computational
photography will allow users to capture beautiful images, better than ever before.
The new iPhone 13 pro-camera system also provides our most advanced video
features. The all-new camera system along with Dolby Vision HDR recording
produces incredible pro-level video. So we asked two-time Academy Award-winning
director Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar nominated cinematographer, Greig Fraser to
show us what they can do with the power of iPhone 13 Pro.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14

Everything you just saw, including the behind the scenes footage was shot on iPhone
13 Pro, with major updates across the wide, Ultra Wide and Telephoto cameras, it's an
incredible device for ﬁlm-making. The new Ultra Wide camera enables amazing
macro slow mo videos, thanks to the new lens design. And the new 3x Telephoto
allows you to zoom even closer to the action and oﬀers a great new focal length for
video. This is really awesome when using our all-new cinematic mode, which uses
machine learning a disparity to create a depth map that's built into the video. So you
can change the depth eﬀect, including the level of Boca and where the focus is
applied even after the capture. This is another iPhone ﬁrst. As iPhone 13 and iPhone
13 Pro are the only smartphones that can do this.
We also have another Pro video feature coming later this year and that's ProRes
video. ProRes oﬀers exceptionally high color ﬁdelity and more eﬃcient encoding for
use in Pro video at any apps like Final Cut Pro. That's why it's widely used by video
editors as the ﬁnal delivery format for commercials, feature ﬁlms and broadcast. A15
Bionic has hardware acceleration for progress. And in combination with our
advanced video encoders and decoders, as well as our faster ﬁle system and ﬂash
storage pipeline you can now record up to 4K at 30 frames per second in progress,
right in the camera. iPhone 13 Pro is the only smartphone provided end-to-end Pro
workﬂow, allowing you to record and added in ProRes or Dolby Vision. This will
transform ﬁlm-making with a device that can simply slip into your pocket.
Next, let's talk about battery life. This is our most Pro iPhone ever with our fastest
performance, most advanced display and most powerful camera system ever in an
iPhone. They see eﬃciency of the A15 Bionic and iOS 15, as well as a larger battery,
iPhone 13 Pro delivers incredible all day battery life. iPhone 13 Pro last more than
one-and-a-half hours longer in your day than iPhone 12 Pro. And iPhone 13 Pro Max
will last more than two-and-a-half hours longer than iPhone 12 Pro Max. That means
iPhone 13 Pro Max has the longest battery life ever in an iPhone.
The entire iPhone 13 lineup has been carefully designed to minimize its impact on
the environment. We redesigned the packaging to eliminate the outer plastic wrap
saving 600 metric tons of plastic. This brings us closer to our goal of completely
removing plastic from all of our packaging. iPhone uses 100% recycled rare earth
elements in magnets and 100% recycled 10 in the sorter [ph] of the main logic board.
So, that's iPhone 13 Pro with our most advanced technologies, in all new camera
system with three new cameras, ProRes video, cinematic mode, the new Super Retina
XDR display with Pro Motion, A15 Bionic with ﬁve core GPU, 5G, MagSafe and
incredible durability features. These iPhones push the boundaries for what's possible
in a smartphone.
Even with all these incredible technology, iPhone 13 Pro still starts at 999, and iPhone
13 Pro Max still starts at 1,099. We also have amazing oﬀers from Apple and our
partners, including up to $1,000 oﬀ in the US, when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.
And this year we're introducing a new one-terabyte storage option. This is a great
addition for our pro iPhone users. The one-terabyte joins our 128-gigabyte, 256-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14
