{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
All right. Good morning. I'm Joe Moore from the Morgan Stanley semiconductor
team. Very happy to have with us today Colette Kress from NVIDIA. Colette, thanks
for coming.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
CFO of NVIDIA. So let me just walk through, it'll take about 30 minutes, walk through
the business portfolio a little bit. And then we'll have some time for audience
questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Let me just start with gaming, your gaming business, 57% of revenues, grew 36% last
year, a pretty impressive year. And you did that really without the product cycle up to
the big product cycle number the year before. And as I said, you sort of have 3
components of that. You have core gaming, your mobile Nintendo business and also
cryptocurrency. So I'd like talk about each of those. Maybe a question in terms of
gaming. Again, for a year without a product cycle, you had a very strong year. Can
you talk about the drivers of that strength. And how you perceive the long-term
growth for that segment?

Page 2 of 13Q - Joseph Lawrence Moore
A - Colette M. KressSure. Just to remind everyone of our market segments that we do have. The
company is really based on one single product in terms of a GPU. And we do have 4
market segments that we've partaken using that overall GPU that spans from our
gaming overall business; our pro visualization, which is taking graphics to the
enterprise; our data center business, which has been quite front and center over the
last couple of years as a focus in terms of accelerated computing, accelerated
computing for AI as well as accelerated computing for high-performance computing
and many other pieces; and then our last business is our automotive business, which
is a sister to much of our work in terms of in the new data center and working in
terms of on -- future autonomous, self-driving cars going forward. But to pause in
terms of our gaming business, our gaming business has been one of our strongest
parts of our portfolio, the longest standing. We grew this company based on
graphics inside of PCs earlier. Gaming has been a great use case of that overall
graphics and we've a seen tremendous growth over, not just this last year. But
probably over the last 3 to ﬁve years in terms of the growth. But a lot of this has to
do not necessarily with the underlying piece of hardware in speciﬁc. But the overall
market itself and the overall growth that we've seen in the market for gaming.
Gaming has really transformed over the last decade tremendously. Gaming used to
be a place where you would partake in terms of gaming inside your living room with
your overall PC. It's moved to an overall social platform. And that social platform has
added gamers at new ages, both starting younger, staying longer. But their ability to
play with their friends online is of a particular interest. Our overall platform for
gaming is the leader in terms of -- in the PC. We stand there with probably the
largest market share of all of the overall PC gamers that are out there. And our
platform, although this is in its second year, it's still the strength of all the diﬀerent
kinds of platforms that are out there that you could buy. Additionally, what is key in
terms of inﬂuencing the overall upgrade cycles and the adoption of our overall
gaming platform is really looking at the overall games that are hitting the market.
There's a tremendous amount of great popular games that inﬂuences gamers to use
this opportunity to upgrade their platforms. Whether that be here in the U.S.,
whether that be Europe or worldwide, even in Asia Pac area, strong games are one
of the key areas that we see that are inﬂuencing the overall growth. So this is
probably the key underlying piece in terms of why our growth, I think, in this last year
was so great.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
And you've talked about competitive eSports sort of spectator-oriented eSports as a
driver. How do you think that drives hardware sales because obviously that's a small
group of participants who are playing -- streaming competitive games. But it seems
like there is some pervasive beneﬁt for the broader base of gamers.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. When you think about eSports, eSports is really about inﬂuencing and
watching other's overall game and the overall community that are watching the best
of breeds in terms of overall gamers, learning key tricks in terms of showing them
how to play. But essentially, now it's a spectator sport in terms of what you can do
with gaming. What is diﬀerent though is people inﬂuencing friends, how does it
inﬂuence you actually buying the hardware? The top gear that your top inﬂuencers
have in terms of gaming is very popular as well as with all the gamers as well. InFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

A - Colette M. Kressmany cases, in life, we know that we purchase overall equipment or the gear to
match some of the best of the breeds in terms of gamers. And so we're seeing that
whole inﬂuence in terms of the gamers. But also inﬂuence the overall gaming
developers in terms of what they are building because now everybody is watching
the overall key features inside of games to determine what they need to build next.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Then one of the areas you talked about more recently is mobile
notebooks. You've had a pretty high-end gaming experience now on a fairly thin and
light notebook. Where are we in the evolution of that as a business?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So when we think about the overall mobility front, which has been around for
several years, what has been key to watch is the need in terms of mobility in a form
of thin and light. People aren't going to change and go backwards on that thin and
light. They really key into that as being the key feature. But now they also are
interested in that high-end performance. So matching those 2 together has been
one of the key proponents that we have done with many of the OEMs around the
world, leading up to good current cycles that we have in terms of Pascal, our latest
overall architecture. What we are seeing is more and more gaming notebooks
exclusively using thin and light, using that high performance that allows a gamer to
go anywhere. Sure, they still have many of their desktop types of infrastructures
where that can incorporate their monitors, their screens, their controllers. But now
the mobility of a high-end type of gaming notebook has been very key. We're in the
early stages of seeing this overall rollout. But I think our overall OEMs like it as it also
brings a tremendous value to them in terms of selling the higher-end notebooks to
the overall industry.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Then I do have one shorter-term question on gaming in the sense that
you've been operating in a fairly supply-constrained environment for the last two
months. Availability of your product at retail is typically above MSRP at this point.
How is -- I guess, that entirely cryptocurrency that created that situation? And how is
it running your business in that situation? How do you decide where to allocate? In
that sort of tighter supply environment, how are you prioritizing things?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So we did talk about this at the end of our Fourth Quarter that we just ﬁnished and
discussed the challenges that we have right now in terms of being supply
constrained in terms of the channel. The channels had been inﬂuenced by not only
the strength of the overall gaming that we had seen for the overall holiday season.
But also the large uptick that we've seen in the overall valuation of cryptocurrency.
That inﬂuenced not only those buying our cryptocurrency boards that we have
available. But also moving up to the stack and using overall high-end GPUs to do a
lot of the cryptocurrency mining. So trying to serve both of those markets with the
overall GPUs, we became supply constrained. We're going to look forward. The best
thing that we can do is not necessarily an allocation because our allocation,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Q - Joseph Lawrence Moore
A - Colette M. Kressparticularly for our gaming GPUs, is largely geared towards gamers. We want to
make sure those gamers worldwide receive the cards that we want to do. So we're
working quite fast in terms of with our partners, with our suppliers in terms of picking
up overall supply that we can get overall out to the channel. Yes. In the short term,
you have seen retail prices potentially be a little bit higher, not something that we
overall beneﬁt from, primarily just our channel providers are beneﬁting from that
because we've already sold them the overall units for them.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay, that's helpful. Then, I guess, on that topic of cryptocurrency, you guys have
done a pretty good job of trying to help us understand the impact to that over the
course of the last few quarters. But you have also said it is hard to quantify because
you don't always know. And particularly since it's moved away from specialized chips
and more maybe towards GeForce. I guess, how should we think about that
business? And obviously, it's a great business you want to take advantage of. But
how should we think about modeling that as we move through the course of the
year? And things like your expectations are fairly prudent long term about where
that goes.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So if we think about really what our goal is as an overall company, we have
signiﬁcantly large TAMs in front of us that we are executing against. That is
associated with the gaming, associated with our data center, associated with our self-
driving cars. Being assured that we can manage to those overall TAMs and be able
to serve them is going to be our ﬁrst overall priority. In the case of cryptocurrency,
we do believe we can serve them primarily with those specialized cards and that's
going to be our goal going forward. The volatility in the short term of the overall
price of mining and the overall proﬁtability -- merge them into the overall gaming.
But we're going to really try our hardest to really focus our overall GPUs for gaming
for overall gamers going forward. Why? It's becomes very challenging us -- for us to
determine exactly how much of the mining is. It's sometimes we see a gamer actually
doing both in terms of the gaming and overall the mining going forward. So you'll
see us continue to focus on building speciﬁc cards for the overall mining and we
think that is the best of breed and we can do that quite easily given our overall ability
to produce many diﬀerent types of GPUs for these markets.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Then it's a little tricky talking about what the year looks like for you guys
because you typically don't talk about products before they come out. But you've
been typically on a 2-year cadence. I would assume that there are products coming
out over the course of this year. And yet you have this situation where inventories are
extremely low at the moment. Is there anything we should think about, any context
we should have in terms of how you're going to manage through the rest of the year
when you have that combination of constrained inventory and new product?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Q - Joseph Lawrence Moore
A - Colette M. KressYes. So historically, our architectures, we have kept everybody on their toes. We
don't preannounce our products. We do like to excite our overall gamers. Our
overall cadence has been probably 2, 2.5 years over the last several diﬀerent
architectural increases that we've done that. So we still haven't even met the overall
2-year mark in terms of our overall Pascal bars that we have in the market. They are
still, remember, the best of breed in terms of overall performance against anything
that is out in the market and we're still selling quite, quite well. So we're going to
continue to focus on that as we move forward and stay tuned. And we'll see what we
can do in terms of announcing much later.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. So shifting gears to talk about your HPC cloud, your data center-
oriented businesses, 133% growth last year, now up to 20% of revenues. It's pretty,
pretty solid I think. Obviously, it's been some great opportunities. Can you just give
us a little bit of an overview around that business? Then I know there's multiple
segments, multiple diﬀerent ways you can parse that. Just give us a little bit of an
overview of that and then your thinking.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Over the last several years, we've now increased the overall data center
business. So we're looking at a $1.9 billion business as we ﬁnished this last ﬁscal year.
The business is really broken down into 5 diﬀerent pieces. Under the underlying
fundamentals that says as we move forward and think about the overall range that a
CPU can beneﬁt from the future in terms of our architecture, there's not much
upward movement. In terms of the overall goals of using acceleration and using GPU
acceleration, it's front and center as it relates to our overall data center business. So
what we have seen is the emergence of not only acceleration in terms of one of our
businesses, high-performance computing under the data center business. But we've
also seen the data center expand tremendously focused on artiﬁcial intelligence and
new techniques to solve modern AI. We're seeing deep learning to be a primary
focus, deep learning in the form of training overall data. So one of our key
underlining businesses is overall training. Training started with our overall high-
performance computing cloud service providers using it for internal applications and
that still remains a very signiﬁcant part of our business. Additionally, over the last 24
months, you've seen the overall growth in terms of cloud instances. This is giving the
opportunity for many of our AI researchers, our start-ups, our enterprises to get
quick access to the ability to do AI without self-building overall infrastructures. So
you've seen the overall cloud, a second business, also grow quite nicely. So with the
3 of them thinking of training, our overall cloud and high-performance computing,
those are the majority of what we have in our data center business. But we have
other emerging types of businesses within there as well. The fourth one, thinking
about our inferencing business. Inferencing is looking at AI from an incremental data
perspective and the ability to use an overall GPU in both scenarios as well after
you've already trained that data. Still in the early stages. But a very large market in
front of us. Then the ﬁfth one is thinking about the AI on the edge, AI for industry that
could also continue to grow. Still in its early stages, it started mostly with cloud
service providers. But we also see that as a very large business.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Okay. Great. Then the deep learning piece is the part that, I guess, has really
captured a lot of people's imagination, including us and your developers conference
is coming up later this month, have actually been the last couple of those and just
seen track after track of diﬀerent industries reporting on all the things they're doing
with deep learning. It's pretty fascinating. How do you, when you're at the beginning
of something like this, how do you think about that growth opportunity? How do you
predict it from quarter-to-quarter, from year-to-year? It just seems like it's kind of
growing everywhere. But obviously we have to put a number around it. How are you
guys thinking about forecasting that business?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So it's really interesting when you attend our GPU developer conference that
we've had. GTC is later in March. What it is, is it's bringing together all of the
diﬀerent developers that now stand more than 700,000 developers worldwide and
giving them the opportunity both to see what is happening in the ﬁeld of AI, in the
ﬁeld of data center or just the ﬁeld of in terms of accelerated computing. We can't
always see every single opportunity that is out there. But the overall putting it in the
hands of AI researchers, a platform that allows them to see a lot of diﬀerent
opportunities for these GPU really brings us all together in terms of in the
conference. You'll see all diﬀerent types of industries being represented. You'll see
all cloud service providers being represented as well as all diﬀerent types of
enterprises there in terms of attendance. When you think about our data center
business, it's not about us crafting speciﬁcally how the GPU will be used. But
allowing an underlying platform that can serve the masses. So the masses of any
type of development that will be out there and allowing them both the ability to
both use it on-premise, about the ability to put it in terms of any cloud or use it in
terms of any OEM that's out there. What is particularly a focus of us is focused on the
platform, focused in terms of the software, focused in terms of the frameworks that
are necessary to do this AI and keeping that all completely together. Our overall
business and the overall growth is really an add-up one by one of all of the diﬀerent
projects that are occurring. It is not a scope of a top down at this time and to move
an overall TAM because I think we're still in the very early stages of AI. It'll probably
be with us for decades going on in the future. So our focus is to keep current with all
of the initial changes that we see in the industry, which is enormous. Every single
day, those frameworks continue to change. New developments come forth. And
we've got loads of engineers and software talent that is focusing on improving the
overall capabilities of AI using the overall GPU platform.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
And I guess, on that note, I mean, maybe we could talk a little bit about emerging
competition from your own cloud customers who have developed, at least one that
we know of, has developed their own custom silicon and press stories about a
second. What are the beneﬁts of that approach for somebody running these larger
homogeneous workloads? And what are the limitations of that approach in terms of
getting broader usage?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Page 7 of 13A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Joseph Lawrence Moore
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Joseph Lawrence Moore{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, it's really kind of going back to that overall strategy. Our strategy is really
to serve the masses, to really allow and excite any type of AI developer out there, the
access to the latest of tools, the latest framework without limitations in terms of a
certain cloud and/or certain framework because we're not exactly sure -- any of us --
in terms of the direction that this will move. We'll keep an overall platform that's
synonymous across all of our diﬀerent GPUs, together with an overall CUDA
development platform that is used by hundreds and thousands of diﬀerent
developers and keeping that as current as possible. That's going to be our ﬁrst
scope in terms of the overall vision that we see moving forward. Sure, there's an
opportunity and possible area where people will create very speciﬁc chips, very
speciﬁc chips for both certain clouds, certain frameworks. And again, a piece of
hardware, not necessarily thinking about the full dynamics of the software needs that
is going to be necessary to do this AI as well. Those may serve them well in those
cases. But the overall purpose of ours is a platform overall.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, it seems clear that you're going to be in a strong position regardless. But
I guess, is that the competition that we should be most focused on? Or should we
think about -- obviously Intel is going to -- has multiple product families to come
back at you with -- other GPU vendors, AMD will be participating. Is that ASIC really
the top of mind consideration? Or are you guys just sort of focused on optimizing
NVIDIA silicon.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The reality is we're not exactly seeing much in terms of anything from any of those
competition. Each one of them is either both in store in terms of development mode
and also really looking at their overall ability to serve the market with the overall
software needs and the overall development language. It's just really challenging for
a lot of them. AI researchers want to go where the masses are, where are the masses
developing and they'll stick with that overall group. So we'll see. We'll see in terms of
whether or not those developments move through. In the meantime, we're busy at
work considering all the diﬀerent changes that are happening in the environment
every day and revising where we are. We're not sitting still. We're continuing, as you
know, to build products every day.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yes. Okay. Great. Then you mentioned inference. The use of sort of specialized
silicon for inference is still pretty new, like most of this is done in the cloud, on CPUs.
But even Intel has been very clear that they see this migrating to specialty silicon. I
guess, it was initially not intuitive to me that the same chip is good for both training
and inference. One is very sensitive to diﬀerent type of computing than the other.
But you guys have made such good strides on software, TensorRT 3. As we talk to
your customers, it seems like there's a real opportunity. So how should we measure
you on inference? In software, it seems like a lot of your wins are sort as a service
types of wins that are visible. But where will you see it ﬁrst deployed? And where will
we externally be able to see to measure your progress?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Page 8 of 13A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Joseph Lawrence Moore
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Joseph Lawrence Moore{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Within our data center business, you are correct. Inferencing in the past has
primarily been focused in terms of on a CPU. And we do know that it has diﬀerent
characteristics in terms of what you will do for overall training of new data. A
diﬀerent form of precision is often necessary in terms of the overall inferencing and
it's really about the images per second that can do it -- be done with the overall GPU
at that time. So what we're seeing right now is there is a lot of beneﬁt that they're
seeing in terms of leveraging the GPU that they have been training for -- a lot of the
high-end inferencing that we're going to see going forward. Not the simplistic type
of inferencing at an overall individual device. But thinking about the autonomous
machines, particularly when you think about automotive as well as other high-end
types of inferencing that will take place. There is a real world beneﬁt in terms of the
success that we're having right now both with our TensorRT, which is really focused
in terms of our inferencing software as well as our diﬀerent overall GPUs there. Still in
terms of the early stages of that. But you will probably see a lot of it take place in a
lot of our cloud instances as well as with our overall cloud service providers using it
for internal labs.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Then the other segment that you'd mentioned was high-performance
compute. And you gave us numbers from time to time that really surprise me in
terms of the underlying growth that we're seeing in that part of the business
because it's not intuitive maybe. And we don't see systems growing at the same rate.
So there's obviously a GPU-speciﬁc element to that growth. Can you just talk about
why that is? Why that's -- that part of the market has accelerated?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. I think the underlying reason really focuses on the Moore's Law, Moore's Law
slow down and the understanding of what that means in terms of these large
supercomputers that are being built around the world is the need to really focus in a
form of acceleration, a part of the business that we've been in for more than 10 to 12
years. But now the urgency of improving overall performance is absolutely necessary
now. But there's also an ability to merge what we're seeing in terms of the AI as well
as what we're also seeing in terms of supercomputing. You can actually do both of
those things together with these high-performance computing. So the design wins
are long-standing. We continue to move in terms of accelerating all of the top
applications that are out there. And you're seeing a larger percentage of all the new
supercomputers that are coming onboard using overall GPU acceleration in terms of
those. All of these fundamental reasons is why we're seeing such an increased
overall growth in terms of high-performance computing. It can be, in some cases,
sometimes growing as fast as the overall data center business as a whole.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Then just a ﬁnal HPC cloud question. I mean, how do you run a business
that's growing this quickly from a CFO's perspective? How predictable is it? Did you
know you were going to grow triple digits again last year when the year began, IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 13A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Joseph Lawrence Moore
A - Colette M. Kressguess? And how do you think about things like headcount? Like how do you grow as
fast as this business sort of justiﬁes from a resourcing perspective?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
To say that we have any form of ability to look all the way out there multiple years
and overall forecast the business is not necessarily a perfect science by any means.
What we do is we look at, though, how large the overall TAMs are that we're
addressing. We know that these are large TAMs. We also know that these are
extremely hard and diﬃcult TAMs to track and also solve with the overall products
that we're doing. So we stay focused on that. We're quite agile in terms of how we
think about overall investment. We think every day how do we think through in terms
of where the next area that we should be growing. And so the best that we can do is
to assure that we have these engineers well focused in terms of the large TAMs that
we have in front of us, focused in terms of building the overall software and really
establishing the overall infrastructure that they need to do their overall jobs. But it's
not a one-for-one in terms of revenue growth here, investment. We will think that
through extremely carefully. But right now we just know that these TAMs are large in
front of us for investment.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, it really is just remarkable how quickly that business has evolved. So
maybe shifting over to cars a little bit. CES was -- has turned into more of an
automotive trade show at this point. You guys had a lot of developments there.
Obviously, the number of customers that you've announced is fairly impressive. Can
you just give us a little bit of an overview of that opportunity and then maybe talk
about where we are today? I mean, obviously, your core revenue base is not really
growing until you get to the point where you start to deploy this also. Let's talk
through a little about that opportunity.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So it's been several years now focused on self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles
of the future. Every single year, we become more entrenched in terms of the
industry, understanding how it's going to evolve from a Level 2, Level 3 all the way
up to a Level 5 going forward. CES was a great opportunity for us to both showcase
our latest overall platform focused on Xavier and its availability for customers' overall
sampling. Xavier is probably the highest performance chip that we have completed
from an SOC for this underlying platform. It allows people to begin working and
thinking about this platform inside cars in the future. So they're able to sample it
today. We're probably more than two years ahead of any other competition focused
on a platform of this kind. What has been a focus over the last couple of years is an
understanding that self-driving cars is an AI problem. The amount of compute, the
amount of data that needs to be processed from so many diﬀerent parts outside of
that car, whether that'd be cameras, sensors, LiDAR, radar, is enormous. The overall
processing capability that needs to occur in the car is huge. What you've also seen is
in terms of a bifurcation to say this is not necessarily just about high-end premium
types of cars that we've seen in the past and the overall infotainment system. This is
really changing the overall transportation industry as a whole as we think about
transportation as a service, as we think about overall trucking, as we think of overallFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantpassenger cars in Level 2. At the same time that we may see the features and the
needs for a self-driving features in terms of passenger cars at Level 2, high-end Level
2, Level 3 we may also see in terms of robo-taxis, shuttles that allow us in a small,
conﬁned community area for there to be overall self-driving. So our partnerships that
we have, broad and wide, probably more than 320 diﬀerent partnerships with both
OEMs, Tier 1s and many of the start-ups that are focused and their adoption of the
overall platform has grown quite tremendously over the last couple of years. There
were a lot of the pieces of the announcements that we have discussed in terms of
CES. As we move forward, you're going to see us continue in terms of working with
these manufacturers on the development work ahead of the overall production. So
you'll see infotainment systems still be a majority of our overall revenue that we have
in terms of our automotive business, working in terms of the development work with
the OEMs then for the future overall platforms as we go forward. These platforms will
be enriched with the overall software that will likely be codeveloped between us and
the overall manufacturers. But the important part of them is they will be AI-enabled.
And they will likely be a signiﬁcant increase in terms of overall price that we're
seeing in terms of infotainment systems.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
And how should we think about the price of those systems when once we get to
production vehicles? And will you sell silicon? Will you sell software? Will you sell
compute systems? Like how are you going to approach that? And how should we
think about that relative to you're in production of vehicles today in places like Tesla,
is that opportunity bigger once you sort of get to large scale?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So it's very similar to what we have today with most of our businesses, whether that
be gaming, whether that be data center. It's a signiﬁcant amount of software that is
enabled with each piece of our hardware that we are putting in the market. We built
that together. We built that together, the software and hardware, jointly together that
provides that increased value in terms of what we receive. It's all put together. It
allows us the overall gross margins that we have because that key investment is in
terms of our overall OpEx. So when we think about price points, it's still super, super
early to determine, substantially increased from probably what we're seeing in terms
of the infotainment systems. The infotainment systems are a broad and wide market
and have probably reached their overall maximum that we're seeing in terms of
overall price. Those may move in terms of AI-enabled types of infotainment where
you have AI within the car in terms of voice recognition, facial recognition. But as
we've seen moving forward, overall doubling ASPs and then some as we go forward
is likely to happen in terms of the overall autonomous platforms.

not, I'll go into some of the ﬁnancial. We have a mic somewhere. Yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

A - Colette M. KressIf we look at gaming, I think the point was made earlier by Brian and more and more
that is done online and he said basically the 2 playing mechanisms would be the PC
where you have great representation. But also consoles. And I think your penetration
in the console market, maybe I'm wrong that's why I'm asking the question, has been
so far pretty much limited to the Switch. Do you have any prospects with the other
major console devices? And if not, why not?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So the question stems in terms of, yes, playing games from a mobile standpoint
has been associated with the overall GPUs and the GPUs within the PC. So there's
also a key market in terms of consoles on consoles for playing games. (Are we are)?
Yes, correctly in terms of the Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch has been a
tremendously successful console. It is the best-selling console in the U.S. industry
that we've seen. But I think the important part of that console decision that we made
was about a partnership that we had made with Nintendo, a partnership that we
could both overall beneﬁt from the overall console market. When we think about
being a part of a console or being part of a diﬀerent platform, it takes resources,
resources dedicated to Nintendo, dedicated to the overall success of that product.
We have to think about using that dedicated workforce and whether or not that
would beneﬁt us as a whole or whether or not there are other things that we could
overall use that workforce to do. We're very pleased that it was very successful
because we were able to work with Nintendo both that we can overall win from
there. In the future, there's nothing to say that we may not partake in terms of other
consoles. But we will still think about that in those parameters in terms of is that
beneﬁcial for us in terms of using speciﬁc reserve resources for those overall
businesses. Makes sense?
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
Why is it that economically PCs are so much better of a business? I mean, a high-end
gaming card costs multiples of what an entire console costs. We know what those
chips go for in a console, they're relatively low ASPs. Is it just because of the life cycle
of the console being lengthier that you're selling older GPUs by the end of that life
cycle? Or just why are there not the same rich economic opportunity that PCs are?
And can we see the evolutionary nature of these consoles where they're doing this
sort every 2-year upgrades, keep them closer to the cutting edge?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So what you have in terms of the console business is it's static over that overall
life. And so what happens is you're working towards the overall masses. There's
other diﬀerent components that are associated with that overall console that have to
get together to make the overall console. The PC market allows the ability for
whatever type of gamer you are, you can deﬁne the level of performance, the level
of high-end types of gaming that you want to do based on the GPU that you choose.
We've even seen now a shortening often of that console life cycle because the
overall PC market continues to inﬂuence with its constant upgrades, both inﬂuencing
better games in terms of what is overall being built -- the overall upgrade of that --
we continue to evolve the overall innovation in terms of gaming. That, therefore,
leads to higher price points because there's just so much innovation that it'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

We have time for one more question from the audience, if there is one. There in the
front.
Could you just talk a little bit about capital allocation, the dividend buybacks, how
you're looking at reinvesting in the business, if there's a formula or something of that
sort. And if you can rank order it?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
The capital returns, the overall focus in terms of investment. So when you think about
how we approach in terms of our overall investment portfolio or how we think about
our overall cash that we have, the #1 thing that we are going to do is investing in the
business. That investment in the business usually stems from overall OpEx. The
overall hiring is probably the most key thing that we overall invest in. We need to
make sure that we have the overall infrastructure available for the overall engineers
through the overall facilities that they may need or keep in mind many of them are
actually working on supercomputers more than they're working on simple overall
laptops. So that is key in terms of our #1 focus to address the market going forward.
Additionally, from time to time, we'll work in terms of our hiring in group.
Sometimes, we'll pick up small teams through overall acquisitions. But that has never
been really a large particular amount of our overall investment. I'm not saying that it
wouldn't be in the future. But we intend to ﬁnd most of it from overall organic
growth and an overall investment. That allows us to then still focus in terms of our
capital return program for investors. We do this both with a combination of
repurchasing our overall shares as well as our dividend that has been with us for
many, many years. So those are our overall uses of our cash, our uses and focus in
terms of our overall investments as we go forward.
{BIO 17644779 <GO>}
With that, I think we've just ran of -- we'll just go ahead and wrap it up there. Colette,
thank you very much for your time.
