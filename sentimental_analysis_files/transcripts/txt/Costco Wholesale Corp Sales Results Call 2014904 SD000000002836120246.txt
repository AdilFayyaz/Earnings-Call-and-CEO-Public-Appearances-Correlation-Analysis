Good morning. And thank you for calling Costco Wholesale Corporation. I'm Jeﬀ
Elliott, Assistant Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. And this morning I
will review with you our sales results for the 4-week retail month of August, which
started on Monday, August 4 and ended on Sunday, August 31.
For comparable results, this 4-week period is compared to the same 4-week period
last year, speciﬁcally Monday, August 5 through Sunday, September 1. August
included 28 selling days for both years.

ownership or use of real estate; amounts expected to be spent on expansion plans;
actions of vendors; rising costs associated with employees, including healthcare
costs; energy and certain commodities; geopolitical conditions; and other risks
identiﬁed from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports ﬁled
with the SEC. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update these
discussions due to subsequent events or circumstances.
Now, with regard to sales, as reported today, net sales for the month of August came

inﬂation in the mid-single-digit range, the majority of which came from the meat

headwind, primarily due to Canada or the Canadian dollar, to our reported August
sales of a little over minus 0.5% or minus 50 basis points, roughly. Total international
comps for the 4-week period came in at plus 8% in local currencies but resulted in a
reported comp of plus 6% when converted to US dollars. The average transaction
was up just over 2%, including the combined negative impact from foreign exchange
and gasoline price deﬂation. Comparable traﬃc frequency was up just over 4.5%.
Cannibalization for the month of August had a negative impact to total comp sales
of minus 0.5% or again minus 50 basis points, which is very consistent with where we
had been running the last couple months.

both this year and last year.
