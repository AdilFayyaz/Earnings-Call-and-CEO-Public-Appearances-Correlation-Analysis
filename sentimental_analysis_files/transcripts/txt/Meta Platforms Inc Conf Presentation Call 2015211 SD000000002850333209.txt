Good morning. Thanks for spending some time with us. My name is Brian Boland.
I'm Vice President of Advertising Technologies at Facebook and in that role I'm
responsible for the diﬀerent businesses that you will see here today, predominantly
the work that we're doing to extend our advertising capabilities oﬀ of Facebook. And
I thought before we jumped into questions it'd be useful to give a brief overview of
the diﬀerent pieces that we have, from Atlas to Audience Network and to LiveRail, to
give you a good sense of how these ﬁt together and what we're doing, kind of the
method behind the madness. So that we'll walk through in the next little bit.
If you dramatically oversimplify the ecosystem, this will help put in the context what
we're doing. We are fully focused on advertisers, we're very focused on publishers.
And we are focused on growing their business. If you hear one of the refrains from
us, we talk about real business results constantly and we believe that that focus for
advertisers of helping them grow their business, on one side. And on the other, are
new businesses around helping publishers grow their business is a core focus. So
those are the areas that we're looking at how we could extend technologies into an
advertiser ad server and into a publisher ad server. Then the one spot in the middle
where we can bring those together in ways that make it even easier for people to do
digital marketing networks and that's in that kind of exchange spaces in the middle.
When you think about the diﬀerent eﬀorts that we have based into those spaces,
Atlas for advertisers, LiveRail for publishers and the Audience Network, which really
extends advertisers campaigns easily oﬀ of Facebook and helps publishers very
easily monetize their inventory. That's the gross over-simpliﬁcation of the market and
the areas that we are particularly focused around.
So let's go a little bit deeper into the way that the world has changed that has made
these eﬀorts for us important for advertisers and publishers. Now a lot of this, like,
really calls for a next generation of tools for advertisers and for publishers and what
has brought that around is that there is a cross-device world now. We no longer haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 2 of 13a simple world, we have a desktop computer and a single browser, where all of the
technology from the last generation just works really well. We now have this multi-
device world. And now when we think about what unique things we bring, people-
based marketing is a core foundation for all of these solutions that we're bringing to
the market, of moving beyond devices, of moving beyond cookies to people,
because fundamentally what advertisers care about is reaching people and what
publishers care about is creating great experiences for the people who use their
services and monetizing those experiences. And in the core, that's really about
people. We'll talk about why people-based marketing is actually something we think
is pretty special.
So you know the stats; device fragmentation is happening. We know that 60% of
people are using two devices a day. And it's even worse when you start adding more
devices. We know that almost 25% of people are using three or more devices a day.
That trend is going to continue. You all know that coming pretty soon there's going
to be watches that are more and more connected. They are going to be more
devices in your home as TVs become more interconnected. So you will have a
growing number of devices that are connected and you will be spending a growing
amount of time with connected devices. This creates a challenge for marketers and
publishers who need to deliver their messages to people in a really compelling way
that actually grows their business.
This is a fundamental problem that has been plaguing the industry. And we're
starting to see those behaviors stir up for people. You may start browsing on one
device and you ﬁnish browsing on another device. You've experienced that, you
might be experiencing it right now on your laptop and your mobile device. You hop
from device to device. Whilst other [ph] people are shopping in stores and they have
their device with them while they are shopping. How many times have you been in a
store and you are doing a couple of things. You may be looking up a product or
products in the store or you just maybe on a service, consuming content, while you
are shopping, very common experiences that we see people doing.
Now, while these trends have happened, people still buy physical products in
physical stores. Now this stat of the 94% of sales still happen in physical stores from
the US census in 2014, this blows the mind of our engineers when we share that with
them, because they think everything shows a bit of droner [ph] if they get delivered
to their door. But the reality is that for most consumers they are still shopping in
physical stores.
So we have this math and challenge for marketers where there are these great
devices that are connected to people. But there are now more devices that creates
fragmentation. And there is this challenge where the business that they are trying to
grow the sales that matter to tell whether their marketing works, happens oﬀ of a
device. That's a very large challenge for our advertisers.
And we think about what's interesting in mobile, mobile has really grown rapidly.
And we know that there are a couple of key things that have been missing. One of
those is targeting and measurement. We have highlighted the measurementFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 3 of 13challenge a moment ago. If you are seeing an ad on your device and buying
something in a store, I can't measure that until now. And we think about the
technology, the existing technology has been cookie-based and was really designed
to run a desktop browser world. And it doesn't transfer well to mobile. And it doesn't
transfer well to apps. There are no cookies in apps, it does not exist. So those old
technologies just don't cross the device.
And ﬁnally, formats, if you think about your experience on mobile, you went from
having this giant screen on your desktop or your laptop or you could see
advertisements in diﬀerent places on that screen, you now have a much more narrow
screen. You have a narrow screen or things happen in lines. So format and the
evolution of the experience for people is a critical evolution for advertising that
fundamentally work well on the mobile device. So those have been the challenges
that we've seen on mobile and that we had to experience.
If we think about what really matters to solve these challenges, the ﬁrst one is
people-based marketing is a solution. They can help connect the experience across
devices. Moving the technology from cookie-based to more modern people-based
technology is the next one. Then ﬁnally, negative advertising, where the advertising
that we're showing is very tailored to the experiences inside those apps and inside
that mobile experience. That native component is critical to the evolution of
advertising being successful, because it's great for people, you actually like it and it
drives results for advertisers, which in turn drives yield and monetization for
publishers.
So how are we making that real in all these products? Atlas is the ﬁrst one we'll talk
about, which is our advertiser solution and it is an advertiser ad server. That means
that Atlas will deliver the advertising for marketers and will help them measure it.
And we are measuring on a real people basis and we can solve the cross-device
problem (inaudible). Now people-based is the crux of how we think about Atlas,
both from a targeting standpoint and a measurement standpoint. We're not looking
at cookies, we are looking at people, because we are able to use the log-in that we
have on Facebook in an automized way to understand the delivery of people and
the measurement that happens afterwards.
Now, if you look at the current world, you have an ad that you show and that ad
shows up across all these devices and across these screens. You can't connect them,
because they are individual devices. So in the current system, this shows up as the
compression. But we know that's not what's really happening behind the scenes.
Behind the scenes is a human game, right. You are behind that screen, whether it's
your tablet, whether it's your phone, whether it's your desktop, it is important to
understand that there is a person that it's not six individual people or six
impressions. But now we have three people. And because we can be people-based,
we can understand more about those people and we can understand that we
reached three men, we can tell you their age range that we reach those folks. We can
say how many times and where. We don't do that on an individual basis. But
understanding that we're reaching people, not devices, is important for marketers
who care about reach. So by building a system on people based, we have solved theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 4 of 13challenge of knowing what real reach looks like in a fragmented and cross-device
world.
Now reach is good. But reach doesn't really get to business growth. It's important to
understand how a business has had their sales be lifted by the advertisements that
are being shown. And if you look at what happens in clinical trials, for medical
clinical trials, you take patients and patients are real people and you can divide those
patients into two groups. You have a test group and you have a control or placebo
group, right. You divide people. Then you start to look at what happens with the
treatment, because in any situation there are going to be people who does get
better, right. What you want to know from the medicine is did it make more people
better than the norm that would be healed regardless. And that's the importance of
having a test and control group, because you can start to see the speciﬁc folks who
are healed by the treatment more than would have gotten better normally, right. And
that gives you conﬁdence that those medicines work.
Now, we can actually do the very same thing with Facebook's technology when it
comes to advertising and this the same great work that's happened in direct mail for
decades, where we can look at the population, we can divided it into two groups.
People whose see the ads and people who don't see the ads. And that enabled us to
look at a control group and a treatment group to really tail this back to a lift in their
real business results, not just, hey, we are going to take credit for anybody that might
have seen an ad. But an important part of this is a lift in their business from people
who saw these ads. That is critical to know where to invest your dollars, is that you
don't want to just invest dollars. So that someone sees the ad, you want to invest the
dollars so that it actually incrementally grows your business. In this kind of
methodology, when we look at the control group, people are still going to buy the
products in the control group. We look at the treatment group, more people will buy
those products if the advertising is successful and that gives businesses conﬁdence
that that channel, that publisher is accretive to their business and helping them grow
their business, tying it back to real business results. It helps make better decisions.
So here's an example of the campaign that was run on Facebook where we looked at
a last touch methodology. So just a last click got all the credit and then we looked at
incremental lift and the last click showed a terrible ROI for that campaign. But when
you actually looked at whether that campaign was in or out, whether that publisher
was in or out, we saw a huge change in the ROI, a 2.2x ROI of incremental --
incremental donations to that campaign.
If you are looking at the old technologies, in the last touch model, they're making a
bad business decision. If you are looking at a lift model, right, which tells the truth
about what grew their business or in this case grew their donations, they'll make a
diﬀerent set of decisions around their ROI, right. So they would be missing out on
incremental donations if they were using the older models. It's fundamentally not
good for those businesses.
And as I said earlier, not all of the sales are happening online. We know that so many
of the sales, 94%, are happening in the physical world. So we need to take the stepsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11
Meta Platforms Inc (FB US Equity)
Page 5 of 13to be able to measure against real world sales. And through partnerships, with
companies like Datalogics. Through the work that we've done to connect oﬄine
conversion measurement, we can now, in a privacy-safe way, understand the
approaches that are being made in aggregate and show lift for real world physical
purchases through things like loyalty cards, through things like the Datalogics'
database, which has incredible ﬁdelity and can tie that exposure that ad that you see
on Facebook, back to an action that happens in the store that we can tie back to that
test and control methodology and give advertisers high conﬁdence that their
business is growing in the online world, in the physical world, because of the ads
they're running. Then with that information, they can make more sound investments
and they can buy advertising that grows their business in a meaningful way,
conﬁdently. That's what we are doing with Atlas. And that's where the focus has been
on measurement, of making the shift in the world from last generation technology to
more modern technology that can help them connect real-world sales with high
conﬁdence across every device that people are on.
Now, the next piece is around the Audience Network. And this is kind of the easiest
way for advertisers and publishers to connect the work that they are doing with the
kinds of targeting we have in Facebook, with the easy way to reach supply on mobile
apps. And the Audience Network was designed to take that same kind of targeting
that we see on Facebook that advertisers have become used to, that same kind of a
native format and be able to extend that from Facebook onto another publisher. So
here's an ad that would show up on Facebook and that same kind of a format, the
same targeting easily ﬂowed into the Audience Network and can be rendered inside
somebody else's experience.
And the important thing that we're really excited about the Audience Network is the
evolution of native advertising. Now, these experiences that are really relevant to the
app and tailors that experience inside the app. And as we look at how publishers
have started to apply this, we can see that they can create these great experiences,
where just inside their normal format is an ad, that is a native ad. It ﬁts, it feels better.
As a person using their experience, you feel better about these ads, because they
feel less jarring, less outside of the norm of that experience and for a publisher, they
like these for the same reasons. Design-wise it ﬁts in, from a standpoint of people
using their site, it doesn't feel jarring, it feels like a natural part of the experience and
it performs really well.
So this is one of the things we're most excited about is this evolution of native
advertising becoming more common across the app space on the mobile devices.
We move from a world where you used to have all these pages, where you could put
ads, where it was easier to put ads, there was less of a tax on people who use your
service for the ad that you may put on the page. But now that it's a single column,
now that the consumption is so focused on your attention, it is really important from
a user experience standpoint that we, as an industry, get this right. And publishers
have said this is very important for their business to get this right and have their
experience be a compelling one for people. And by the way, the more compelling
the experience, the better the user experience, the better the ROI for the publisher.
They can monetize much better in this environment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Page 6 of 13Now, LiveRail, our latest piece of what we are doing in ad tech in our last acquisition.
LiveRail is around extending a lot of the capabilities that we've built on Facebook to
publishers on the Web and publishers in mobile. This is about bringing this concept
of people-based marketing, of bringing the idea around cross-device, of bringing
that same accountability of measurement beyond what we've done on Facebook
and onto every publisher in the world. To remind you where it ﬁts in, it is the
publisher-centric solution, designed to really focus on growing publishers'
businesses, help them create great user experiences and drive yield at the same
time.
Now, LiveRail has had a great history. They've been around since 2007. They have
built a very, very strong video business, where they have a great set of publishers,
you can see on the screen. And they've continued to grow with these publishers,
who have been very excited about the potential of what we can do with the
foundation that that team has built, coupled with the best parts of Facebook. And the
ﬁrst thing that people are excited about is the concept around people-based
marketing, of really starting to deliver to real people.
The challenges that the publishing industry faces are around accuracy of delivery.
We know when we look at the Nielsen data on desktops that the Internet average,
when you start to get to narrow audiences is 32% accurate in targeting. When you
get just gender, it's 59% accurate, which means 4 out of 10 times, you're showing the
wrong ad on desktop. And the Facebook data is better than 90% accurate. And we
look at mobile, it's even worse, because as we said earlier, the targeting and data
doesn't work there. So for publishers, this is a real challenge and as people shift
rapidly towards mobile, this creates an even bigger problem for publishers and this
is some of the problems that we aim to solve with LiveRail on Facebook.
We're looking, over the next few months, to extend our capabilities to mobile and
strengthen that inside of LiveRail, truly extend these feel-based [ph] capabilities and
start to bring some of those best-in-class components of Audience Network into
publishers via LiveRail.
Now, all these pieces work well together. If we think about the most important pieces
that underpin all this, it's the people-based aspect and I've said that 50 times in the
last 20 minutes. But that's our focus and it is really how we make that [ph]. The
foundation across all of these and how Atlas will be able to bring campaigns onto
LiveRail or in the Facebook, be able to measure across all of these touch points,
including the rest of the mobile ecosystem and the desktop. We're going to have
Facebook seamlessly connect into publishers via the Audience Network and then
into LiveRail. These pieces connect together and really focuses on real people, the
foundation and real results. Whether you're an advertiser or a publisher, we want to
grow your business by proving for advertisers that they grew their sales and for
publishers that they actually see better yields and that's kind of the foundation of
what we're doing.
So thank you and we can chat for couple of [ph] minutes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Brian BolandThat was fantastic, thank you very much. We all have tons of questions about what
you just went through. So hopefully that helps. How much of a game changer is
people-based marketing? I mean it was something that was maybe touched on in
the past. But it seems like that's the message that whether it's yourself (inaudible)
really going out with, how much of a game changer is it for 2015 for advertisers?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
So let me un-time down that a little bit. It is a game changer. But it's hard to change
the game in the course of a year. Changing the game takes a little bit of time.
People-based marketing is fundamentally a positive step forward for the industry,
because it does a couple of things. One, it has taken the challenge of mobile and
this fear of oh my goodness! I don't know how to connect desktop to mobile and my
world is just much more complicated. It's even worse on mobile, because it's not just
apps. But you also have a browser on your mobile device and believe it or not those
show up as two diﬀerent things in the old technology. So your own device looks like
two. I mean that's hard to work around. So it is a game changer to be able to tie
these components together and to help advertisers and publishers understand their
reach of what's going on and being able to tie back to real-world sales, which is a
key component of that people-based aspect. These are all great game changers. It's
going to take time.
It seems like there is a huge education process that has to occur. That was going to
be the next question, what are you doing to help educate the advertisers?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
Yes. If you think about the advertising industry, it's big, right? If you look at the
agencies, there are hundreds of thousands of people who work in agencies and the
largest brands of the world have thousands and thousands of people who work on
their campaigns. And you're dealing with functions from the CMO to the brand
manager to the data people who execute the campaigns, the agency sides, the
planning, there's like lots of people involved. And there's behavior change that we
need to help them work through of valuing and goaling [ph] their teams oﬀ of these
types of metrics. I mean imagine, as a CMO, you could goal your team on business
growth. So instead of saying, hey, you need to reach this campaign. But you could
say, we want to see X % lift in sales over this quarter. That will be real. That will take
time. And we're doing a lot of work. We've done some great partnerships with the
agencies, with Atlas as we launched it. We've engaged very heavily with the agency
community to work closely with them, because they are a great partner in helping
advice their customers on what works and there is education with their teams,
hundreds of thousands of people who need to understand these new ways to
measure campaigns, these new ways to plan campaigns, moving away from click-
through rates as being be all and all [ph] that people just hugged on the click-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Brian Bolandthrough rate to now looking at sales. That's a shift. Then part of it's a conversation, a
lot of data they work with the team and helping to make that process over time.
Do you face any skepticism, because one thing (inaudible) said in the past is that
marketing partners -- advertisers don't put a lot of stake in the ROI metrics that
Google gives them, because it's their platform, right. So I mean how do you
overcome those?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
One of the things that we have held a value from early on in our measurement work
and this measurement work is not new. This is the culmination of years of work that
people on our management team have done to really prove ﬁrst that Facebook
works. I mean there was a big conversation last couple of years -- three years ago,
does Facebook work? And this eﬀort, this work, this very work here is what's solved
that problem and proved beyond any shadow of doubt that Facebook worked.
So that was great work from our teams. Now, the way that we did that was not by
being completely self-referential. And not saying, hey, buy our stuﬀ, by the way we
work and you're going to just trust me on that, right. We totally get that. We have
deep partnerships with companies like Nielsen. So Nielsen and Nielsen OCR are
great products and they are independent in their industry standards that we support
and that we actually think are great for the world. We don't try to create our own
metric there as other companies have done. We believe in companies like
Datalogics, who is an independent company, who provides that independent that
third-party view that can say conﬁdently this works and we are independent and they
have not mistaken again.
Vendors like Datalogix say they can match an oﬄine sale to an online ad with about
70% accuracy. When you think about the level of accuracy that the industry might be
able to get to, do you have any views, can it be better than that?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
The industry can always improve and we can always get better. What we want to
make sure that people don't get lost is how big of a step change it is to be able to
match at that level. So you're dealing with a world where we are moving from having
to have surveys where people scan their grocery bags, like they unload their
groceries, then they are recording what they actually bought that day to much, much
higher ﬁdelity, much, much higher sample sizes and incredibly -- (inaudible) levels
much, much lower than that. Now we have ﬁdelities to go even deeper to
understand campaigns and creative dynamics that where never before possible. But
the industry will always improve, it's just -- it's important that we do this. And the
reason that we've been so slow and methodical about this, is that the privacy aspects
and putting people ﬁrst has been a design principle for us. So we want to make sureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantwe're very clear that we were doing things in a way that protected people's data that
we spent time with the industry regulators to make sure that we're doing things
really well for people.
I want to pause for a second and see, we don't have a ton of time left. But questions
from the audience. Up, there is one, sorry, way in the back, I can't see who it is.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 18384322 <GO>}
Hi. Excuse me. Steve Chung, CEO of Frankly, a mobile messaging company here.
Two questions for you. You mentioned native advertising on mobile. And one of the
things that it's diﬃcult to scale, I think, is the custom ad units that look really native,
because every app looks diﬀerent. Is that a scale challenge for you? And second
question is, how important is location awareness in all of the ad products that you
have and is that a focus for you?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
So the ﬁrst part, on the challenge of native advertising is that we've created a very
generalizable format that makes it easier for any publisher to be able to take in the
information required to show a native unit. It's simply a question of prioritization for
those ad publishers. How they want to put their design resources to take that
information and render it in a beautiful way inside their app. If you look at some of
the examples that we've seen people create, they get very creative and have them
feel like a seamless part of their app, that takes work. Much like everything else in
life, the really good things take hard work. That's the kind of thing on native, that it is
not as easy as just drawing a rectangle and things, ﬁll it with whatever you want. But
it does yield higher results for the publisher and a much better experience for the
consumer. So we're seeing publishers get much better about how they can start to
think about that as a part of their design process. Important for them not to think
about ad that they like ad on -- or just smack on the page somewhere. But really how
do you elegantly put it in there, takes extra work. But again, they are already putting
that work in the core design of their product. Why take a large % of your product in
pixel space and devalue it by not putting the time in. So we're seeing folks start to
learn how to do that in (inaudible). Our job is to make that as easy as possible and
help them start to work their way through it. That's what we've been doing and I
think we've done a good job on that.
The second piece was around location. So location -- I think location at some point
will be very interesting. Right now, we're very focused on these components of really
helping people understand measurements through and through and then bringing
target ability to mobile. Mobile targeting is very, very nascent today and something
we think we can help a lot around.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Brian BolandAnother question in the audience. Okay. So many people, I can't scan the room fast
enough. When your sales people -- I mean you guys have a lot of messages to get
out to advertisers and agencies this year. When the sales people are sitting down in
these meetings, what are their kind of top two or three areas of focus? How do you
guys get them focused on the key messages?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
You might be surprised, people-based is one of the messages. We have been on an
evolution with our business over the last few years of ﬁguring out who we are as
Facebook and in the last three years, we've really understood the value that we have
and that theme of people-based has been a core theme from the core people
products, all the way through now into ad tech. So we have a very strong dialog and
language on people-based, being one of the foundational things that we talk to
people about. The second thing is around real results and we actually -- from the
Facebook side told advertisers last year incorporating our pitches [ph], if you don't
know for sure that we're growing your business, don't spend and that's a jarring
message that people don't expect, because they are expecting just to try to pitch
themselves up. But really looking and anchoring towards their business and helping
them to focus on how would they feel conﬁdent, how they prove those real business
results is the second message that ﬂows from the core base of teams across ad tech.
And the last one is the shift to mobile. So as we have by necessity and by
opportunity, done more and more on mobile, that's been a core part of the
conversation and for a lot of marketers, this last year they saw their consumers
spending more and more and more of their time on mobile. In the last holiday
season they spent a ton [ph] of time on mobile. So for them it's a natural interest in
what we can do on mobile. And that's one of the big -- that's a fair big part [ph] of
what we talk there. So real people, real results and what we can do on mobile.
And what could you do or what are you doing to help prove out the measurement
side of it? So when you've got some early adopters that have fantastic result. But
when you hear -- I think Sheryl [ph] talked about it on the last call, like we could be
doing more. How do you help accelerate that process even more?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
Yes. It's back to that ﬁrst point around education and making it operational. So when
you explain this to CMO at the high level it sounds great.
But they get it. But --
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
Because they love it, like the -- hey, you can make my digital media accountable, that
sounds awesome. The steps to operationalize that it's being very targeted with
customers to help them look at the campaign, let's pick a campaign, let's measure it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

A - Brian BolandSo let's start with one campaign, let's understand the impacts of that campaign and
how we'd operationalize that diﬀerently next time and we extend beyond that
campaign to the next set of campaigns.
So it's piece-by-piece on an advertiser basis. And with the agencies that's been a big
part of helping us to scale, is that as we train the agencies and have them
understanding these new tools and what this can mean, it's helping them advise
their clients on ways to start to apply these in a more scalable manner. It will. But
fundamentally, this will take time.
Right. So that was going to be the follow-up question and then we have a question
in the audience right here. But ﬁve years from now, would you be surprised if this
isn't the way people are doing their advertising?

I'd be happy.
Can it happen that quickly? Is ﬁve years enough time, is three years enough time?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
It's super hard for me to triangulate on the amount of time. I mean it is amazing, ﬁve
years ago, two weeks ago the iPad came out the ﬁrst time. It's like that thing blew up
over ﬁve years. So like amazing things can happen in ﬁve years for this one. Man,
there's a lot of people who need to make changes that's heart to say.
I was wondering what can you share with us about the economics to Facebook
between advertisers who use Atlas, how you beneﬁt, how they beneﬁt and how
that's split or what the economics are to you? And secondly, in terms of the
publishers who use LiveRail, do you share data? Do they tell you who their users are,
do you tell them what their users are doing on Facebook, things like that?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
We can't really go into speciﬁcs on the economics or on the fact that that we believe
that people measuring more accurately is good for the industry at large and fair
measurement, true measurement is good for Facebook as it is for any other premium
publisher. So great measurement is great. On the data front, we have very clear
controls in place for how data can ﬂow. We don't share individual user data with
publishers, we don't pass that around. There are things that publishers can take
advantage of in the system, which is probably why we have the LiveRail system
installed on their site. So they can take advantage of these targeting capabilities,
without having to have information around people transferred to them, veryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-02-11

that way.

{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
Yes. The question really is on insight, what kind of insights we'll provide back. We're
very early on in the product life cycle for LiveRail. But helping advertisers -- right now,
publishers are most interested in eﬃcient delivery. Over time, I think they will be
more interested in insights and whatnot and that will be (inaudible) later date.
We've time for just one quick one right here.
How do you think about third-party ad buying tools and how they ﬁt into your
ecosystem?
{BIO 17384107 <GO>}
So we think they are a critical part of our ecosystem. If you look at our evolution of
the Facebook marketing partner program, we've had a long history of being an
ecosystem friendly and ecosystem company. We continue to plan to help a healthy
ecosystem grow. There are pieces that we need to do from a privacy standpoint and
from a delivery standpoint that are part of the technology foundation that we'll build.
We expect companies to be able to build great businesses on top of that.
All right, with that, I'm sorry, we're out of time. Thank you, Brian. Very helpful.
