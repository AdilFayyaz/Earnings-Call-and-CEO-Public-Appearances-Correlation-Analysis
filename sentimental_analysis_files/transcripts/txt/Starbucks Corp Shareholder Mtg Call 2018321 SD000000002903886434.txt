Well, good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you all to Starbucks' 26th Annual
Meeting of Shareholders. And let's all give a round of applause for the brilliant Pirulo
[ph] and his band who traveled here from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Pirulo . Thank you.
So much. Thank you. Pirulo , the joy that you and the band brought to this room this
morning is truly a gift. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Now Pirulo and hundreds of thousands of his fellow countrymen recently endured
Hurricane Maria, a Category 5 storm that devastated the island of Puerto Rico. When
the wind and the rain stopped, we witnessed the damage. And the world's heart
sank. Now our hearts have been challenged this past year by so many communities
that have suﬀered through natural disasters, whether it's the hurricanes that hit
Houston, Miami and the Caribbean; devastating earthquake in Mexico City; a
decimating wildﬁre season in California. Everywhere we turn, people facing
adversity. It's how we choose to respond as people who says a lot about who we are.
And this Starbucks community to which we all belong chooses to respond with
compassion and optimism.
Now optimism is not just a positive disposition when times are good. Optimism is
about banding together during times of adversity, believing in ourselves and
working together to do what needs to be done. So when disaster hits, Starbucks
partners mobilize. We mobilize with our customers. And we work together in our
communities to serve others at a time of need. We roll up our sleeves. We bail water.
We stitch lives back together. We volunteer our time. And we contribute to raise
money. Together, with Starbucks partners and customers, we contributed more than
$2 million to aid disaster relief in 2017. And we volunteered time.
And so I want to start our meeting today by ﬁrst recognizing the more than 330,000
Starbucks partners who proudly wear the green apron for your commitment to
community. Partners who are here with us today, please stand up. Please stand up.
Come on. Okay. Partners, partners, remain standing. Come on, stay standing. This is a
fun event.
Now for veterans, military personnel and their spouses, please stand. Welcome. Now
keep standing. Keep standing.
I want to welcome our licensed partners and joint venture partners who traveled
from around the world to be with us today. Please stand. Now remain standing.
Everybody, remain standing.
I want to acknowledge our remarkable Board of Directors who guide us on our
Starbucks journey. Please stand. All right. Stay standing now.
Now I want to recognize and welcome all shareholders and guests who have joined
us here today. Stand up. Come on, stand up. Now stay standing. Stay standing
because together as a community, all of us are trying to do something meaningful.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

Page 3 of 39And that's why you're here today. We're trying to create a diﬀerent kind of publicly
traded company, a company that sees the pursuit of proﬁt and the pursuit of doing
good in this world, not as opposing forces but rather as 2 strands of DNA that are
woven together. Both are essential for life. I welcome you all here today. Be seated.
We're going to have some fun.
Now today, I want to share, hopefully, an inspiring and a clear-eyed view of where we
are in this journey at Starbucks at this special moment as we look to the future. And I
want to share my perspective one year after assuming my responsibilities as CEO.
Now my most important and weighty responsibility is to keep Starbucks moving
forward to claim its vibrant future. And this requires sharp discernment. It requires
the discernment to have the wisdom to know which aspects of Starbucks must be
honored and preserved, while at the same time, the courage to boldly reimagine
and reinvent our future. Now in every part of today's program, you're going to --
we're going to show you a little bit of both, what is enduring and what is being
modernized.
Now with that as context, we're going to go into 3 topics, 3 deep areas. First, I want
to share how the hard work we've done in this past ﬁve years positions Starbucks for
growth over the next 10 years. Second, I want to share how we are modernizing this
respected and beloved global brand to reach more people, uplift more lives, elevate
their day in more places, in more occasions than ever before in our history. And
three, how we are adding diverse talents, diverse perspectives and creating a fully
representative culture, which we believe is the foundation for a truly modern
Starbucks.
Now let's start by taking a look at the past ﬁve years. Over the past ﬁve years, many
brick-and-mortar retailers have struggled as the industry has been impacted by a
signiﬁcant shift in consumer buying behavior. In fact, this last year alone, more brick-
and-mortar retail stores were closed in the United States than in any other period in
history. Starbucks is the rare exception.
Now let's just take a look at these numbers. In a period where more brick-and-mortar
retailers are closing than any other time in history, over the past ﬁve years, Starbucks
opened more than 10,000 net new stores from 18,000 to 28,000. And those stores
are performing at the highest levels ever. Now certainly, while many retailers have
been suﬀering from declines, Starbucks has been the exception. We've grown the
number of customers we serve each week from 66 million to nearly 100 million per
week today. And while many retailers have been ﬂat or shrinking top line revenue,
we have nearly doubled revenue. And we have more than doubled the market cap
of the company.
Now while these numbers defy the trends and are impressive in and of themselves,
there is an even more powerful story underneath. It's about the work that has
happened in this 5-year period that strengthens the foundation of Starbucks in a way
that allows us to grow. The past ﬁve years have been all about turning in this kind of
performance, this pursuit of proﬁt, while at the same time, building our brand
around social impact and investing for the future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 39Now when others in the industry have been cutting investment, we have doubled
down. We've doubled down investment in 3 powerful areas. And these 3 powerful
areas are critical to Starbucks' growth agenda going forward. And those 3 assets are:
Digital, we have been extending the third place to embrace digital; China, we've
established China as our next big growth market; and Starbucks Reserve, Starbucks
Reserve is now our innovation lab for new ideas and for the future.
Now at the highest level, Starbucks has always been and always will be a brand that
is close to people's hearts. We've been a ritual and a place you come to lift your
spirit, your day. And in many ways now, the closest thing many of us have with us at
all times is this, our mobile device. Probably many of you have them with you here
today. Now Starbucks has been earning the privilege to be in your life in many ways.
And over the last ﬁve years, we've been building much more expansive relationships
that extend to our customers' lives on their mobile device, extending their rituals of
the day to wherever they are, in the oﬃce, their car, their home. And I'll share with
you in a moment why this greatly opens up growth opportunities for the future.
Now Starbucks has also been and always will be a brand designed for all. We've
invented the concept of the third place and earned broad appeal. Now that said,
there are hundreds of millions of more customers that we can appeal to, that we can
reach out to, that we can earn their loyalty of. The rising middle-class -- the largest
rising middle-class on planet Earth is in China. And it represents a powerful growth
agenda for the company. In a moment, I'll share a little bit more about our approach.
And why we're so bullish on it.
Number three, Starbucks has always been and always will be a premium brand.
Something special. Quality. Worth it. Your everyday uplifted. To earn that premium
requires that we harvest some of the highest quality, most ethically sourced coﬀee in
the world. And that we boldly innovate at the top end of our oﬀerings. And that is
exactly what we're doing with Starbucks Reserve. But that's only half of the story. I'll
share the other half when we get there.
Now more on digital. In my 3 decades in the tech industry, I've seen many
technology-driven disruptions. I've had a front row seat to the rise of personal
computing, to the explosion of the World Wide Web, to the advent of cloud
computing. And all of those disruptions enabled perhaps the most impactful one of
them all, the mobile device.
I mean, think about it. The iPhone was introduced a decade ago. And the mobile
Internet began its transformative journey. And certainly on that journey, it has
changed not only consumer behavior. But human behavior. Now if you study many
of the scenarios that all of us engage in on this mobile device, there is a common
red thread. For example, on your mobile device, you can enjoy music from any artist
anytime at any place in the world using Spotify or Pandora. Convenience. On your
device, you can make an airline reservation, reserve your seat, check in, get a
boarding pass, clear your TSA. Convenience. On these mobile devices, you can buy
most anything you choose and have it shipped to you in hours, sometimes minutes.
Convenience. On this device, you can get an education, you can pay a parking ticket,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 39you can see your medical records, you can predict the weather, watch a classic
movie. You can even help your kids with their geometry homework. Convenience.
None of this was possible 10 years ago to the extent it is today. And in most of these
examples, the mobile devices ampliﬁed the consumer desire for convenience.
Now as you're aware, Starbucks has been investing in this, in mobile, in our app, in
the transaction systems, in the platforms, building out the capability to extend the
connection we have with our customers in the third place to a digitally connected
world. And those investments are showing up in our performance. Now in fact, more
than 30% of all U.S. customer transactions are paid for with a mobile app. We're now
working to expand our digitally connected customer relationships well beyond the
current state. We want to reach millions and millions of more customers digitally. As
an example, we have opened up Mobile Order & Pay to all customers. We've created
digital coupons and promotions for customers that we'll be utilizing for our Happy
Hours. We're utilizing our personalization engine to provide more relevant
personalized content. And the opportunity goes well beyond that. And now certainly,
the realm of -- in the realm of retail, oftentimes, convenience has been the enemy of
the physical store. Instant has been the enemy of brand loyalty. Fast has been the
opposing force of great experiences.
Now some in the industry believe that you must either focus on a retail experience
that is about community or a retail experience that is about convenience. You cannot
do both. We reject that thinking. We do not buy in to the false trade-oﬀ. In fact, we've
refused to succumb to the pressure of the tyranny of form. The work we are doing in
store design, store locations, operational routines in our stores and digitally on our
app are all focused on embracing the concept that we can better serve multiple
experiences our customers desire, experiences around community and experiences
around convenience. Now over the past ﬁve years, the third place has been
extended, extended digitally. And we are innovating in ways to better serve
experiences around both community and convenience. Roz Brewer, our Chief
Operating Oﬃcer, will take you through more of that innovation agenda here in a
minute.
China. Now everywhere people who believe in humanity, community, kindness and
optimism is a place where Starbucks can thrive. Now our brand seeks growth among
people who believe in these things. And China is one of those places. So let me set
some context. Economists expect China's GDP to exceed $15 trillion by 2021. And
that explosive growth of GDP is fueling a massive increase in the middle-class in
China, expected to reach nearly 600 million people. That's nearly double the entire
population of the United States. And Starbucks is a coveted brand at the center of
this rising middle-class. In fact, Starbucks has cracked the code on China in a way
that few other global brands have been able to do. And as a result, over the past ﬁve
years, we've grown the number of stores from 700 or 800 to more than 3,200 stores
today. And we've been introducing the Chinese consumer to premium coﬀee and
the third place experience.
We're opening a new store in China on average every 15 hours. And to ensure we
bring the full force of Starbucks, we have acquired 100% of our joint venture in EastFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 39China. As we ﬁnish that integration, we're going to accelerate the pace of growth in
China. We are much more than a coﬀee retailer. In fact, the secret to our success in
China is that we stand for something that Chinese consumer seeks. We're an
aspirational brand with empathy for the human experience. And we demonstrate our
humanity by taking care of our partners and their families, creating opportunity and
optimism for the future. Now our team in China has designed some of the world's
most innovative and beautiful stores to become a destination for our customers.
Belinda Wong, who is with us today, CEO of Starbucks China, will take you through
the amazing story and the amazing journey that's unfolding in China.
Now globally, with more than 28,000 stores around the world, our brand has
ubiquity. Our brand has always been about premium, about how we make you feel
as a customer. And certainly, our products and the experiences we create are never
ordinary. We strive to constantly reimagine the experience, push the brand to new
levels of premium. And one of the things that I learned in over 3 decades in the tech
industry is how new product innovation at the very top of your product line cannot
only create a halo eﬀect across the entire product line. But you can take elements of
that innovation, features and capabilities and design elements of that innovation at
the very top and weave it throughout your entire business. And in many ways, that is
exactly what we are doing.
Starbucks Reserve is an expression of the world's most sought after small-lot coﬀees.
And the Starbucks Roasteries are the ultimate in experiential retail around all things
coﬀee. These formats have become innovation labs for us, purposeful design,
premium products, new beverages, new forms of service and new ways to share our
coﬀee knowledge. And it's an opportunity to leverage innovation in new ways across
the entire ﬂeet of our core Starbucks stores.
Now it's my belief that these investments that we've made over the past ﬁve years
are setting the stage and the foundation for growth over this next 10. But let me fully
and deeply acknowledge at this present moment that I am both a realist and an
optimist. Now the retail market has been particularly brutal over the past two years.
Now we have navigated the market much better than most all other retailers. But our
growth slowed a bit last year. Even with that slowing growth, we continue to make
the multiyear investments that position us for the future. We made these investments
last year while still growing revenue by 7%, same-store sales by 3%. And we opened
over 2,200 new stores. We also stepped back and assessed the current market
condition and our strategy going forward. And we revised our long-term growth
guidance to reﬂect the opportunity ahead. Long term, we expect to deliver revenue
growth in the upper single digits, 3% to 5% same-store comparable and 12% or
greater EPS growth.
Now we are optimistic about the future. In fact, we are so optimistic about the future
that we have made a commitment to return a record $15 billion in cash to our
shareholders over the next three years in the form of buybacks and dividends. $15
billion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

Kevin R. JohnsonNow I opened up this discussion this morning with a statement about clearly
knowing which aspects of Starbucks must be honored and preserved and, at the
same time, have the courage to boldly reimagine and reinvent our future. Now
coﬀee is at the core of Starbucks. And the ritual of sharing a coﬀee tasting at
Starbucks is something to celebrate. These moments of human connection over
coﬀee get our day going. They get our meetings going. They get ideas ﬂowing. So
let's do the largest coﬀee tasting ever attempted at an annual shareholder meeting
right here today. What do you think?
Now we're going to do this with a very special coﬀee. The coﬀee today is having -- is
celebrating its 10-year anniversary, Pike Place Roast. All right? Now we're being
joined by 116 Starbucks partners. We're going to hand out coﬀee to each one of you.
And while they do that, pass your coﬀee down to the end of your row. Don't start
drinking it yet. We're going to wait until everyone has their coﬀee. But while you're
getting your coﬀee, I want you to take a moment, introduce yourself to the people
next to you, have a nice conversation and get ready for the largest coﬀee tasting at
an Annual Shareholder Meeting. We'll be right back in a moment.
Okay. How are we doing on coﬀee? All right. I want to invite 2 of our special
Starbucks partners to join me and lead this coﬀee-tasting. So Fabiola, Sergio, come
on out here. Please welcome Sergio, Fabiola. Welcome. All right. Okay. Does
everybody got your coﬀee? Well Sergio, why don't you begin, share a little bit about
your Starbucks journey and a little bit about this coﬀee?
Absolutely. Buenos dias. Good morning, everyone. So ever since my ﬁrst Starbucks
coﬀee tasting, I've come to learn that nothing pairs better with our coﬀee than a
good story. And when it comes to Pike Place Roast, I can't help but share my story of
where I came from and how I became a partner. I was born and raised in Mexico.
And I graduated as a graphic designer. But in 2006, I moved to the U.S. with my
family. And I found it very hard to ﬁnd my place and ﬁt in, in this new culture and
world. Until in 2009, I moved to Seattle where a store manager believed in me and
gave me the opportunity to train as a part-time barista in a little store in the Pike
Place Market.
You might have heard of it. It's known as the ﬁrst Starbucks. You can't miss it. It's the
one with a line out the door every day. So without ever making coﬀee before or
knowing much about it, for the ﬁrst time in my life, I felt like I was part of something
bigger than myself. So in a way, before I got to taste Pike Place Roast, I got to
experience the store and the history that this coﬀee represents. And it changed my
life forever. So this coﬀee that we're about to taste today is not just the one that tells
us where we came from. But it reminds us of where we've been, where we are and
where we're going. And no matter where it's brewed all around the world every day,
it makes us feel like we're all together in one store where we all speak coﬀee and
where we all can feel like we belong. So.

Unidentiﬁed ParticipantSergio, thank you for sharing your story. This is a special coﬀee for you. Thank you.
So Fabiola, a little bit about your story. And why don't you lead us in this tasting?
No, absolutely. I think of coﬀee so much as has been described as this ritual, this nod
to our heritage. Coﬀee is a call to presence. So in the moments that we have
together, let's just consider what it speaks to us. Maybe it's warmth in hands or
thoughts of running into a store, or it could be that perfect conversation across the
table. I know for me, when I consider Pike Place and in my story and my experiences,
I think of families across Latin America, families of farmers that very carefully and very
lovingly cultivate coﬀee for the stories our cups share. And so if you haven't already,
let's remove our lids. And let's really smell that coﬀee, thinking of those memories.
Kevin, what do you smell?

Kevin R. JohnsonNo. That's right, yes. No. Yes. No, Pike Place is such an approachable coﬀee. There's
like chocolate-y notes. There's this nuttiness that comes to life. It's meant to really be
loved by all palettes. And also again, that memory. Now for you to experience this
coﬀee, let's get it completely across our palettes. Hopefully, it's been cooled at this
point as you just got it. And we're going to aerate the coﬀee by slurping it. Now I am
Puerto Rican. And we do things with passion. We do so loudly. And so together, we
are going to slurp. All right? Let's do it. That wasn't very loud on my part. So thank
you. Good job. It's coﬀee across all of our senses. Sergio, what else does it evoke for
you?
Well when I was a store partner, I always was surprised how smooth and balanced
Pike Place Roast was. And when I became a part of the coﬀee team, I got to
experience ﬁrsthand everything that goes behind this cup. And I can tell you that it's
all by design of passion and partners that are obsessed about tasting, blending,
roasting, brewing until the proof is in the cup. And I am so proud to be part of that.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well what I love about this coﬀee is it reminds me of our heritage and where it all
began, the Pike Place store. And so Fabiola, Sergio, thank you so much for sharing
your stories and for sharing the ﬁrst ever coﬀee tasting at an annual shareholder
meeting. Thank you. Fabiola, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Now every time we share a coﬀee tasting, we also aﬃrm our commitment to making
coﬀee the ﬁrst 100% sustainable agricultural product. In fact, everyone in the coﬀee
ecosystem needs to take a proactive stance. And so we partnered with Conservation
International to create the sustainable coﬀee challenge, a global initiative with more
than 90 companies and governments to help all coﬀee purveyors adopt sustainable
practices. Now achieving sustainability means that we have to assure trust and
transparency in every bean, from the 380,000 coﬀee farms from which we purchase
our coﬀee to every cup that we serve you, our customers.
Now Starbucks is one of the only coﬀee companies and one of the few that can trace
our coﬀee to each of these farms, which is critical to ensuring a viable livelihood for
the farmers and their families. And now we've taken traceability and trust to the next
level. We're announcing a pilot program in Costa Rica, Colombia and Rwanda
collaborating with Conservation International. And over the next two years, we're
going to demonstrate how technology and innovative data platforms can give coﬀee
farmers even more ﬁnancial empowerment. Now we're going to leverage an open-
source approach to share whatever we learn with the rest of the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

Page 10 of 39Rosalind Gates BrewerNow you can see this in action at our farm. We own one coﬀee farm on the side of a
volcano in Costa Rica. The farm is called Hacienda Alsacia. And I was there last
month with our leadership team. It is one of the most beautiful places you can
imagine. In fact, words alone cannot describe the beauty. And there is no better way
to show you this farm than through the eyes of our partners. Let's take a look.
Ain't that beautiful? It's fantastic. What a beautiful, beautiful place and just a
wonderful way to share the story around sustainability of coﬀee. That was a year ago
that Howard invited me to join him the morning of the Annual Shareholder Meeting
at the Pike Place store, early in the morning. And as we stood together in the Pike
Place store a year ago, he presented me with the key. This is the key that Howard
carried in his pocket for years to the Pike Place store. Now this key is a symbol of our
heritage. And it is the key to our future. And I'm honored to share this responsibility
with a world-class leadership team. They are my partners. And they represent the
future of Starbucks. In fact, this leadership team gets up every day to work in service
of the more than 330,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron. We work in
service of our customers. And we work in service of our shareholders. And I'm
fortunate to have these leaders by my side. And I want to introduce a very talented
leader who joined this team just six months ago. She is someone with signiﬁcant
experience in retail. She is a great leader of people. She is my partner. And she is our
Chief Operating Oﬃcer. Please welcome, Roz Brewer. Roz?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
So nice. Thank you. Wow. Wow. So it was last year that I was sitting right here in the
audience being introduced as one of the newest members of the Board of Directors.
And today, I have the privilege. And I'm so proud to be standing here before you as
the Chief Operating Oﬃcer of this amazing company.
So just like Kevin, I had the vantage point of seeing the company up close and
personal as a director before embarking upon the incredible work of growing the
Americas, thinking about store development, thinking about the next-generation
supply chain. And most importantly, our product innovation. I get to do this at a time
when we are experiencing a seismic shift in retail. Our customer is demanding
convenience. They're demanding customization. They're demanding choice.
Technology. Technology has enabled the immediacy mindset. And shopping
patterns have shifted dramatically, with 96% of Americans shopping online. Mobile
payments, in just the last year in the fast food industry, grew 75% just between 2016
and 2017. That's just one year. Our customers, they continue to seek respite from the
busy day of multitasking, constantly in transition, creating the need for me-time and
human connection. But timing, timing is everything. Having just completed 10 years
with the world's largest retailer, Walmart, having honed design thinking and
processes that are key to their culture and creating digital retail at scale in solving
logistics and operations challenges and in this new world of retail, I personally feel
uniquely capable of being a service to the next growth of Starbucks. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 39So if I've learned nothing else, I've learned just what it takes to win this race and the
importance to be strong operationally while you innovate for proﬁtable growth.
Having operated more than 2,000 big-box stores. And at peak, more than $100
billion in sales, I'm excited to transfer those skills in this new role. But I've also
learned a lot since I've been here with Starbucks for the past 5 to six months. And let
me just say, it's been exciting. While the brand loyalty remains strong. And we
experience really enviable sales growth of approximately 7%, we need to innovate
cost eﬀectively. And we need to do that at scale to grow our digital relationships with
our customers and hone our coﬀee craft consistently.
So let me focus on our innovation agenda. And this innovation agenda will show
some of the most recent moves in coﬀee that we've made and the impact that it's
having on accelerating our growth. The delight in coﬀee is that it can be made in so
many diﬀerent ways. It can tempt the palette. It can match your mood. And it can
also make a ritual. This year, we innovated in Espresso. And for the ﬁrst time, a
customer can choose the heart of their beverage with Starbucks Blonde Espresso.
This will mean a lot to the brand loyalty and also a lot to our ability to serve our most
loyal connoisseur customers. So we're investing in how we deliver the perfect
Espresso beverages with the next generation of the Mastrena Espresso machine,
which gives us the ability to customize multiple types of espresso and have superior
steaming capability and enhanced speed and the consistency we need for our
customers.
But also during this time, I've been talking a lot to customers. In these past few
months, they've told us exactly what they want from us. And we're learning about the
afternoon. And these learnings are fueling the innovation in Cold Brew and beyond.
Afternoon occasions aren't just about breaks. They're also about transitions. They're
about consumers taking me-time. And cold isn't just for summertime anymore. Five
years ago, cold was about 37% of our beverage mix. And now it's over 50%. With
2017, total cold beverage sales in the U.S. company and operated stores reaching
nearly $5 billion. So we're building multibillion-dollar platforms within cold,
including cold coﬀee and Teavana, with the introduction of Teavana Infusions last
summer. And this summer, we'll expand Starbucks Refreshers, a platform that has
been 40% growth year-over-year with new unique ﬂavors and colors to reach even
more customers and provide better lunch-attach opportunities. Tea and refreshment
combined have contributed 1% weighted comp for each of the last four years. That's
considerable growth. In March 2015, we debuted Cold Brew. And it drove comps
and permanently and immediately up leveled cold coﬀee in our stores. We can now
say that we, we are the market leader in Cold Brew and have more innovation than
any, any other coﬀee retailer.
Two years ago, we debuted Nitro Cold Brew. And it's smooth, velvety -- partners
know. And they love it -- velvety texture and subtle sweetness built in an incredibly
loyal following with our customers. Our baristas, they create their own concoctions in
the stores, custom beverages and are now beginning to share them with their
customers through menu boards. It's exciting stuﬀ. But now we serve Nitro in 2,300
stores in 27 countries. And now here's the big news, we will expand that to nearly
4,000 stores by the end of this year. It's exciting stuﬀ. We aren't just rolling out more
stores. But we have the next generation of Nitro. And that will deliver breakthroughFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

these platforms include Cold Brew, Nitro, Teavana. And we've launched these shortly
after in critical geographies across the world like Japan and China. And we're
contributing signiﬁcantly to those comps.
So one of the most exciting opportunities is the chance for us to combine food with
coﬀee. This is not new for us. But what it has changed for us is it gives our customers
exactly what they're looking for. We've already grown the food business by 1.5 times
since 2013. And looking forward, we plan to double our food business by the year
2021.
Let's start with the morning, where we've established a strong foothold. And we've
answered our morning coﬀee customers' need for delicious, for hearty, for those
menu items to help them start their day. Breakfast sandwich sales have more than
doubled over the past four years and now account for more than 30% of total food
sales. Yet at breakfast, we've been searching for something more. The Sous Vide Egg
Bites address the very need for the customers who are looking for grab-and-go,
looking for wheat-free, wholesome and an excellent source of protein. It's one of my
favorite breakfast items. And we've seen more than 60% growth in this platform
since the national launch in January of '17 and with the recent launch in Canada. And
early results are on pace to outperform even the U.S.
Yet with all of that work, the biggest opportunity for food innovation is for lunch.
How are we going to do this? We're going to do this through leveraging our store
footprint and our traﬃc where we have signiﬁcant opportunity to drive attach at the
lunch day part. And we will oﬀer customers more of what they are expecting and
elevating our current Bistro Box line, which has grown at a rate of 20% in each of the
past two years. We will also continue to roll out Mercato regionally, with more than
1,000 stores by the end of the year. And approximately 50% of the traﬃc occurring
after 11 a.m., you can see how driving attach at lunch through new and existing
products is really a big business opportunity for us.
But that, that's just the start for us. Within the past 18 months, the growth of overall
peak in Mobile Order & Pay, as we all call it MOP, has transformed how we run our
stores. And I give all the credit to our partners. Thank you for all the work you do in
our stores each and every day.
This inﬂux of customers and innovation has truly raised the bar for our in-store
experience. So in the last 60 days, we took one more step towards ensuring we meet
our customers' need for speed and for convenience. And by assigning speciﬁc roles
by speciﬁc store and then we continue to grow MOP, drive-through and the cafÃ©
business all at the same time, we want to serve the customer in the many ways that
they want to interact with us. It's the customers' choice.
So now, from how customers want to react with us to in-store and how we engage
them on a personal, digital level, we now have more than 15 million -- that's 15
million active Starbucks Rewards members. This number has grown 11% year-on-year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 13 of 39Lucy Lee HelmWe know how powerful digital engagement is as a driver of customer satisfaction
and increased spend with Starbucks. And we plan to see double-digit growth in our
Rewards members this year. So here's a new opportunity. There remains 75 million
unique customers coming through our doors every month. We have plenty of
opportunity to form active relationships with millions of more customers by
providing access to MOP for all customers, improve marketing to millions of lapsed
Starbucks Rewards customers and WiFi e-mail sign-up. All of this work is underway.
Then once we have these, we turn on digital marketing and one-on-one
personalization. And that's been really successful in our Starbucks Rewards through
a very large group. And that extension is important to us. This allows us to bring
product innovation across coﬀee, refreshment and food to customers with focused
marketing and all of the work that we need to do to stay ever-present in front of our
customers. We take true pride in continuing to drive innovation across the company
as a whole.
But what's so wonderful about this company is that it just doesn't stop with products.
The innovation lens extends to our people, how we attract our people, how we
support our partners and, most importantly, how we retain them. We built our
company on innovating in our people. For 35 years, this has been the mainstay of
our company. And we've continued that tradition.
So at this time, I'd like to ask my partner, Chief Partner Oﬃcer, to the stage, Lucy
Helm. Lucy. Go, girl.
{BIO 17633691 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning. And thanks, Roz. I'm so proud to stand with you today as
Starbucks Chief Partner Oﬃcer. What a job I have. I have the incredible opportunity
to ensure that our global partners have an exceptional experience. And I'm so
committed to that. And it's important, not just because who we are as a company.
But because of the important role that human connection, our partner connection,
has in driving our business.
Today, I am so pleased to share that we, as a company, have achieved a major
milestone, 100% pay equity for women and men and people of all races performing
similar work in the United States. Thank you. Thank you, partners. And thank you,
shareholders. It's such an important moment. It's an emotional moment for me as an
almost 19-year partner and a senior women leader, I know that it reﬂects our long-
standing commitment to fairness in pay. The gender pay gap is real. And Starbucks is
committed to not only talking about it. But addressing it. For years, we've developed
the best practices to get this right, beginning with a focus on fairness in starting pay
for our partners and continuing with comprehensive audits to address and close any
unexplained pay gaps between men and women and between people of diﬀerent
races. And we are not stopping now. We have committed to achieving as a company
and maintaining 100% gender pay equity for all of our Starbucks partners in
company-owned markets around the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 14 of 39Rosalind Gates BrewerIn our quest to take this on, we are proud to partner with 3 national women's
organizations that are standing with us and join us in recognizing the importance of
this issue. First, the National Partnership for Women & Families, which promotes
fairness in the workplace, equality in health care and policies that help women and
men meet the dual demands of work and family. The American Association of
Women -- of University Women is standing with us, advancing equity for women and
girls through advocacy, philanthropy, research and development. And the Billie Jean
King Leadership Initiative, which addresses the critical issues required to achieve
inclusive leadership that will lead to signiﬁcant changes on how men and women
operate in the world today.
With our commitment to these principles and best practices we so established,
including equal footing for partners from the start of their career and throughout
their careers, transparency in how we talk about pay and accountability in
addressing and resolving pay gaps, we will, along with these awesome partners that
are standing with us in a coalition, set a new bar for multinational companies who
recognize the importance of equal pay for equal work.
But leading and innovating in partner pay is part of our heritage as a company. From
the beginning, Howard set out to create a diﬀerent kind of company, one that puts
employees or partners ﬁrst. In 1988, we were the ﬁrst retail company to oﬀer full
beneﬁts to part-time employees and their dependents, including domestic partners
when that just wasn't done. In 1991, we became the ﬁrst privately owned U.S.
company to oﬀer a stock option program that includes part-time employees. And
those employees then are called our partners because we're owners of this
company. And that program exists until today. And in 2014, we introduced our
Starbucks College Achievement Plan, giving eligible partners the chance to earn the
college degree of their choice, tuition-free at Arizona State University. And again, we
keep trying to innovate and understand our partners' experience. Early this year, we
announced new and signiﬁcant investments in our U.S. partner experience, which we
accelerated due to changes in tax laws. Partners in the U.S., including all those who
served you coﬀee today, will receive a pay increase next month. They will also
receive an additional stock grant, an industry-leading partner and family sick pay
beneﬁt and expanded parental leave to ensure that all store partners receive 6 full
weeks of paid time oﬀ to welcome their new child by birth or adoption.
It's great to get the applause for this. But this isn't me. This is all of you and what
you've wanted and our senior leadership standing for what's right for our partners.
And with these investments, I stand before you today extremely conﬁdent that we
are the best in the industry when it comes to taking care of our retail partners.
I love this company. And I'm so committed to it every day. Our mission and values
are the heart of who we are and our leadership. And our commitment to our
partners' experience, including equal pay for equal work, is stronger than it's ever
been. And we will continue to invest in our partners as they invest in our partners --
their customers. Thank you. So much. Thank you, Roz. Thank you, Roz. Thanks.

Page 15 of 39Kevin R. JohnsonThank you, Lucy. So this really, really conﬁrms why I came to Starbucks. We are
creating the future of Starbucks. We're driving value as we live our values. And
exactly one year ago, Starbucks committed to hire 100,000 Opportunity Youth, the 1-
in-8 Americans, ages 16 through 24 who aren't in school and who are not employed.
We're on a track to meet the goal by 2020 with over 50,000 hired to date. And we
want to do more. As Lucy talked about, we aim to retain our young partners with
access to competitive wage, access to health insurance, access to equity in the form
of stock, tuition-free college education through ASU and the Starbucks College
Achievement Plan and mentorship opportunities. And this is working. And our data
is showing in this, that our young partners, in order to be incredible additions to our
company, they're staying with our company. They're being promoted. They're
enrolling in our Starbucks achievement program at equal rates with all of our
partners. So once in the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, we ﬁnd that young
partners pursuing a degree retain at 1.5 times. And they are promoted 2.5 times the
rate of the U.S. barista population. Those numbers make a diﬀerence.
And we want to do more. Our work extends beyond Starbucks to ensure every
young adult has a chance to join the workforce, to pursue their ambitions and to
improve our shared futures. Now, now we're joining forces with LinkedIn; with
MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership; and nonproﬁts like Big Brothers Big
Sisters, the Schultz Family Foundation, YMC of the USA, YMCA of the USA [ph], City
Year and Year Up. And with these organizations, we will establish nationwide a
mentorship call to action with beneﬁts for career planning and career seekers. Our
goal is to leverage all Starbucks company-operated stores across our communities
and LinkedIn's member base of over 146 million professionals in the U.S. so all
interested youth can connect with trusted leaders to expand their skills and, most
importantly, to network.
Believing in the power of human potential regardless of background and creating
pathways to opportunity in our environment where partners can team and learn and
thrive is central to who we are, is central to Starbucks.
So I want to show you a video. And this video will show you how these hiring
initiatives are adding to the value of our company and the communities that we
serve every day. Thank you.

Well Roz and Lucy shared a little bit with you about what makes the Starbucks brand
so great. The fact that we focus on taking care of our people and, at the same time, a
social impact agenda. Our social impact agenda revolves around 3 key pillars.
Sustainability: sustainability of coﬀee, of our store design and of our cups. It's about
opportunity veterans, opportunity youth, refugees creating opportunity for our
partners and for the communities we serve. And it's about community. And the
Starbucks brand has earned recognition consistently for this. For the 16th year in a
row, we were named one of the World's Most Admired Brands by FORTUNE
magazine. And for the 12th consecutive year, Starbucks was named one of the

Belinda Wongyear, we were chosen as the 2018 Most Innovative Company for Social Good by Fast
Company.
Now this brand is built with those 100 million customers visiting our stores every day
and the reputation. It's our partners and our customers that create this. And so let's
take a closer look at a tour this last year at the role our customers have played,
engaging with our partners in creating and building this great and enduring brand.
Let's roll the video.
Now that video demonstrates how our brand comes to life in 28,000 stores every
day around the world. Now each one of our stores represents a community. And I
want to talk about something that is happening right here in our own local
community, Seattle.
Two years ago, in our community, we discovered right here in Seattle, one of the
more wealthier cities in the world, we had a crisis, a crisis of more than 600 families,
families with young children sleeping outdoors, sleeping in cars, sleeping in tents. To
have children in our own community, through no fault of their own, sleeping
outdoors was unacceptable. So we stepped up to lead an eﬀort to end this crisis and
ensure that no child sleeps outside. Now for the last 2 winters, we've mobilized
partners, customers in our stores. And in support of Mary's Place, the No Child
Sleeps Outside campaign, together with local business community, we've raised
more than $6 million to ensure that we are addressing this problem.
Now homelessness is a complex issue. But we believe this part of child
homelessness is solvable. And it's a continued work eﬀort that we have underway.
We've made so much progress in the last two years. And this year, we will also be
joining, with our generous friends at Pearl Jam, to be a part of a historic 2-concert
event in August, The Home Shows. Now The Home Shows will bring together
businesses, foundations, individuals and fans to unite our region around the critical
need in our Seattle community. Together. And with your help, these collective eﬀorts
can ensure that we are doing all that we can in support of our local community. Now
this is happening in every geography around the world, our partners engaging in
relevant things to leverage our scale for good.
Let's take a look at another example of taking care of our partners and doing good
in this world in China. Let's roll the video.

Page 17 of 39Starbucks' deeply rooted mission and values by investing in our partners. Along the
way, we have successfully created a unique culture of family. I wish you could have
seen the response of our partners and their families when we announced at our
Partner Family Forum last year the ﬁrst of its kind critical illness insurance for parents
of our partners. This is in addition to the coverage we are already providing to their
spouses and children. There were tears of joy and almost disbelief. To date, 93% of
eligible full-time partners and 14,000 parents are now in this plan.
But we have higher ambitions. We want to inspire more companies to do the same
for their people to create greater social impact. We have made intentional eﬀorts to
share our key learnings and best practices from their -- from the Parent Insurance
Program, Parent Care Program [ph] to nearly 100 corporations. And I'm so happy to
share with you that some of the companies that we met with will soon launch similar
programs for their people. And we will not stop here.
This strong family culture has built a phenomenal sense of pride, enthusiasm and
commitment among our 45,000 partners. This is the reason why China is the fastest-
growing and the most strategic international market today for Starbucks. We have
more than 3,200 stores across 139 cities and serving more than 6.4 million customers
every week. We're opening a new store every 15 hours. And despite this accelerated
growth, we have been able to achieve 33 consecutive quarters of incredible positive
comps. We are totally on track to reach our ambition of 5,000 stores in 200 cities by
2021. And we will do so by driving market-leading and locally relevant innovations
for our customers. And we're just getting started.
To understand our enormous opportunities in China, let's take a look at the
tremendous growth my country is experiencing. China is expected to overtake the
U.S. to become the world's largest economy in terms of GDP by 2030. Yet in
consumer spending, China has already surpassed the U.S. in 2016. And at the core of
this economic change and social transformation is China's middle class, the largest
middle class in the world. By 2022, 600 million people will reach middle-class status.
That's nearly 2 times the entire population of the U.S. Today, China's per capita
coﬀee consumption, it's only 0.4 cups per year compared to more than 300 cups
consumed here in the U.S. Lots of opportunities. The rising middle-class will, for sure,
drive the coﬀee consumption growth in the market and further propel the demand
for Starbucks. China's new middle class will reshape the global economy.
We're excited to bring a welcoming third place environment to our new customers
that is both inspiring and tailored to the evolving aspirations of the rising middle-
class lifestyles. Our passionate partners are engaging with them to create the perfect
Starbucks Experience. As our customers go through the Starbucks Coﬀee journey,
we want to build a deep and enduring friendship with them. One example is that
we've been laying the foundation of the China digital ﬂywheel that extends
Starbucks' third place. With social gifting, we're moving closer to our aspiration to
become one of the most gifted brands, which has enabled gestures of love sent
millions of times digitally. The My Starbucks Rewards program has been embraced
by our customers for its beneﬁts and personalization. We have a total of 6.2 millionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

Page 18 of 39active MSR members, almost half of the U.S. active members, with only 1/5 of the
store count.
Just two months ago, we unlocked another signiﬁcant growth opportunity by
acquiring our East China region, making China now a full company-operated market.
Yay. This region comprises of 2 provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, as well as the city of
Shanghai. It represents 11% of China's total population and generates 22% of the
entire country's GDP. Now to put this into perspective, the 150 million people living
in East China is equivalent to almost half the U.S. population. It's GDP at $2.5 trillion
is as large as the entire state of California or the entire country of India. Shanghai as
well as Hangzhou, Nanjing and Suzhou are ranked within the top 10 most aﬄuent
Chinese cities. In Shanghai alone, we have more than 600 stores, making it the
largest number of stores in any city in the world. However, there still is signiﬁcant
opportunities. The city of Shanghai alone has a population of 23 million people. This
is a population that is equal to the top 10 largest cities in the U.S. combined. I am so
excited by the incredible opportunities in East China. The synergies and eﬃciencies
as we integrate into a company-operated structure will allow us to scale and
accelerate for the future.
What makes me even more excited is how we can then use our scale for growth to
impact the communities we serve. One example of this that has made us all very,
very proud is our Yunnan coﬀee program. We want to bring the best of China's
coﬀee to the world stage because it is what we must do as a coﬀee company deeply
rooted in China. For the past ﬁve years, our Farmer Support Center in Yunnan has
directly worked with 17,000 farmers in sustainable farming practices. Today, almost
1,700 farms are now veriﬁed through our cafÃ© practices. Our farmers can receive
premium prices with higher-quality coﬀee. Behind me is a photo from the most
recent farmer assembly. This is a highly anticipated event, which we do every year.
We hosted 4,000 farmers and their families. Some traveled many hours from their
homes. We celebrated their hard work and dedication to improve the quality of
Yunnan coﬀee. This is a ﬁrm testimony that Starbucks has become the fabric of the
local community. We will continue to work hard hand-in-hand with the farmers to
change their lives -- to help change their lives and bring Chinese homegrown coﬀee
to the world.
You have my personal commitment that we will continue to give back to the local
communities in even more meaningful ways. My partners and I were so proud to
announce the additional social impact investment in China back in December, a $20
million commitment over the next ﬁve years to support disadvantaged women,
alleviate poverty and elevate our eﬀorts in Yunnan.
Our early success in China is really because of our people, partners like Mike, who
you just saw in the video. Our goal is to share our success with them. It is never just
about the number of stores we open or how rapidly we can scale our business. We
want to take care of each other because Starbucks in China is truly one extended
family. We invested in partner beneﬁts that are not only unique but also bring our
mission and values to life. We have Bean Stock, career coﬀee break and
comprehensive health insurance for all of our partners and their families. We rolledFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

Did you not think I'd be here? I must say, just sitting back there for the last 1.5 hours,
it's a very diﬀerent feeling than being on stage from the beginning. Kevin did such a
wonderful job in kind of framing everything. But seeing the growth and
development of the company and the new leaders, I just sat back with such
incredible pride. And I know watching your reaction, you felt the same way.
Let me begin by -- I know Kevin acknowledged the board. But 2 extraordinary
people who have served the board so well, Secretary Gates and Senator Bradley are
retiring from the board. And I'd like them both to stand and be recognized by the
entire audience and just thank you on behalf of all of us at Starbucks. Please,
gentlemen. And I just -- from a personal standpoint, having Senator Bradley and
Secretary Gates at our side and at my side all these years, it's hard to kind of put into
words the guidance, the support, the wisdom that we've all gained and I've gained
personally. And I just in a very, humble, humble way, thank you both so very much for
what you've done for me. Thank you.

December. And like any grand opening, especially when you spend as much money
as we did, you're going to get a lot of people to come for a lot of free stuﬀ. So what I
wanted to do is I wanted -- I asked Belinda and her team to go back to China last
week. And just for the beneﬁt of our shareholders, let's look back three months and
see what's now happening when we're actually charging for things.
So just take a look at what happened last Saturday at the Roastery. These are not
extras by the way. These are Chinese customers at 10:00 in the morning coming into
the Roastery. And as you can see, it's threaded deeply into the Roastery into Seattle.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

Page 20 of 39And what we've tried to do is really do everything we can to elevate the theater, the
romance, the premium experience. And for all of us who have been to China all
these years, for 9 consecutive years, we lost money in China. And there were so
many people who doubted whether or not in a tea-drinking society, we could break
through. And as Belinda showed you not only have we broken through. But China is
going to be the largest market in the world for Starbucks. We're just getting started.
And I would say unequivocally, there's no other Western consumer brand that even
comes close to what we have achieved not only in terms of our commercial
presence, the values of the company, the relationship, we have trust and conﬁdence
with the government and our standing in the country. And this was the crowning
achievement of the entire company over the last almost 50 years.
I now have to turn to a very tough moment for all of us at Starbucks. A few weeks
back, we lost one of our own. And that was Orin Smith. And for many of you who
have seen Orin on the Starbucks stage over the years, I just want to spend a few
minutes and talk about Orin, his unbelievable contribution and the value that he's
added to the company while he was here and perhaps, most importantly, the legacy
that lives on.
In 1990, Orin joined the company as the Chief Financial Oﬃcer of Starbucks. We had
less than 60 stores. He joined around the same time as Howard Behar. And for the
most part, the 3 of us made most of the important strategic decisions of the
company. But it was Orin who always had the measured approach, the guidance, the
maturity to put us in a position to not only dream big. But along with Howard, to
make sure that we execute well. He was a mentor to all of us. He was a teacher. He
was a big brother. And over the last eight months, as Orin was suﬀering with just a
tragic disease, many of us had the opportunity to spend time with him. And Orin's
passing, for everyone at Starbucks, is a huge, huge blow and a reminder to all of us
about the fragility of life. There's nothing I can say and there's no words I can
describe other than to say how much I love and respected Orin. And I promised him
when we were last together that we would do everything we could as a company
and I would personally ensure the fact that his legacy will live on at Starbucks Coﬀee
Company. I can also tell you unequivocally that there would be no Starbucks Coﬀee
Company today in the form that you have seen it without Orin Smith. Thank you.
I was sitting back there and watching this all unfold and, reminiscent of three years
ago when I stood before you and kind of challenged all of us to understand that, in
my view, the rules of engagement for a public company have changed dramatically.
And this was three years ago, about the role and responsibility of doing everything
we could not only to make a proﬁt and create shareholder value. But to serve our
people as well as we can and to give back to our community. I think in the three
years that have passed, I think what you saw today was really a direct manifestation
of us doing everything we can to demonstrate that fragile balance between proﬁt
and social conscience and social impact and, at the same time, creating shareholder
value.
So I think now the question for me is love and responsibility. What does it mean to
love something and the responsibility that goes with it? In 1988, when we beganFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 21 of 39thinking about Bean Stock and health insurance, to us, it was an easy decision. We
were trying to build a diﬀerent kind of company. And in a way, when we were, like
many companies, a company in the ﬁrestorm of the ﬁnancial crisis and the
cataclysmic issues that were going on, there's tremendous pressure on us to do
everything we could to reduce cost. And I've told this story before where an
institutional shareholder picked up the phone and called me and basically pressured
me to do everything we could to cut that health care beneﬁt. And at the time, that
was about a $230 million expense. And we needed that money. But the question in
front of us was what's the cost of cutting that beneﬁt with regard to fracturing the
trust and conﬁdence with regard to the culture, the values and guiding principles of
the company? And along the way, we have faced a number of challenges, trying to
do everything that you've just witnessed and balance the ﬁnancial pressures with
growth and innovation and new markets. There's a constant challenge of making
these kinds of decisions.
1.5 weeks ago, I had really the privilege of presenting myself at the American
Enterprise Institute in Georgia. And for those of you who don't know that
organization, it's basically a conservative think tank made up mostly of Republicans.
And I went there and presented to 400 Republicans, mostly Republicans and
members of Congress, half the Cabinet, very famous, iconic Senators right in front of
me in the audience. And I talked about the role and responsibility of the company,
the dignity of work and many of the things that you have known us to be. When I left
the stage, which -- and it went fairly well, actually. No, no, I don't say that with -- well.
No. When I left the stage, someone came up to me and respectfully asked me, what
was the reason why that we'd elected, not unlike most companies, we received a tax
beneﬁt given the tax cut in the corporate rate to 21%. And -- but I shared with that
audience the fact that we had decided, even though we were beneﬁting from
hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental beneﬁt as a result of the change in the
tax rate, we had decided that we had a moral obligation and a cultural obligation,
not unlike what we did with health care and Bean Stock and college achievement
and all the things that we've tried to do over the years, to share that beneﬁt with our
people. And we had a spirited discussion about what is the moral responsibility of a
company in terms of making money? And I think we've proven over the years. And
we're not perfect and we make mistakes. But the conscience of Starbucks, the
conscience for almost 50 years. And it's proven out more often than not in our
ﬁnancial performance that success is best when it's shared. And that is what I tried to
describe.
So could we have taken that money and given it all away to our shareholders and
maybe the stock would have gone up 1 point or 2? So let me address the stock price
just for a moment. I think it's important is the stock has been fairly ﬂat for the last 12
months or so. And for those shareholders who look at the stock every day and are
short-term minded and maybe disappointed that the stock has not gone up at levels
perhaps that you hoped, remember something, we've been a public company now
since 1992. The market cap at '92 was $250 million. The market cap today is over $80
billion. We are in this for the long term. We are building a great, enduring company.
We're trying to make long-term decisions. We're trying to value the dignity of work.
And we're trying to do everything we possibly can to demonstrate to the world not
that we're better than anyone else or that we're preaching to any other company. ButFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 22 of 39that there's a better way. And the better way is not a zero-sum game where you leave
your people behind. The better way is not -- doing everything you can for the almost
6 million Opportunity Youth in the country who are not in work and not in school.
The better way is to do everything we can to help veterans who are transitioning out
of the service and hiring them because they're not damaged goods. But they've got
real value to add to any organization in the country. And the better way is to
recognize with regard to immigration and speciﬁcally refugees that this is a country
of opportunity. And that's what Starbucks Coﬀee Company stands for.
So let me shift just quickly into the business a bit and what's going on in terms of the
seismic change that we're all witnessing in terms of consumer behavior in retail. Now
I wasn't clairvoyant 3, four years ago. But I did notice something. And you didn't
have to be a genius to ﬁgure it out that the e-commerce eﬀect of things was going to
have a dramatic eﬀect on people physically shopping for goods and services. And
that has resulted in a tremendous level of compression in terms of the amount of
retailers that are serving customers today because less customers are coming into
their stores. And that has resulted in, unfortunately, many, many stores, national,
regional and local, going out of business.
Now this is a photo, as you can see, of a mall that is very, very busy with people
shopping for goods and services. Unfortunately, that was then. This is now. And it's a
dramatic change. And what it means. And you saw this today in what we've tried to
present you, is that we've got to push for reinvention and innovation. And we have to
do everything we can to become the primary destination.
Now as a result of what we're witnessing, we're also seeing something else. And that
is there is a proliferation around the country right now of empty storefronts. We took
a walk in New York 2 weeks ago from 59th Street to 79th on Madison Avenue. And
we lost count at how many empty storefronts there were in Manhattan. It reminded
me of the cataclysmic ﬁnancial crisis in '08. But what's happening is very simple. The
rent structures for the last 5, 10 years have been rising at historic rates. And retailers
do not have the amount of customers they had during these last 5, 10 years and
could no longer economically survive. So they are closing stores. And as a result of
this, I can promise you, just like I predicted in 2014, that rents are coming down. And
landlords are going to have to get belligerent or else their stores are going to stay
empty. And we're already beginning to see a diﬀerent level of reception in terms of
what we believe the cost of occupancy should be. And this is going to bode
extremely well, speciﬁcally for us. We're adding almost 700 new Starbucks stores a
year. And so we are going to take full advantage of the economic reality of this
situation. And as we go forward 2, 3, 4, ﬁve years out, even though labor is going up
in terms of cost of labor, we believe rents are going down. And the economic model
of Starbucks is going to be enhanced as a result of this macro situation. And we are
just at the beginning of this trend.
Now in addition to this, the burden of proof is on Starbucks and always has been to
create innovation in our stores, to create an experiential environment. And that is
why over the last couple of years, we've been thinking about premiumization and
segmentation. And that started with the Seattle Roastery, which is at the top of thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 23 of 39pyramid. We believe that we can build 10, 20, maybe even 30 global iconic
Roasteries around the world over time.
Then as a result of establishing the Starbucks Reserve brand in the Roastery, we want
to build Reserve stores and take advantage of the unique opportunity we have with a
brilliant, really artisanal baker. And that's Rocco Princi who I believe is here. And
Rocco if you are here -- Rocco. So I don't use this word lightly. But this man is a
culinary genius. And somehow, the Italian language, no matter what he's saying to
me, it just sounds so good. It's amazing, actually. So Rocco has brought to us the
ability for us to deliver the highest-quality Italian baked goods and developed 3
diﬀerent day parts. And for those of you who have been in the Seattle Roastery,
you've seen that we've integrated Princi into the Capitol Hill Roastery. And as a result
of that, that store has really demonstrated such incremental traﬃc and sales as a
result of Princi. But we also believe -- in addition to the Reserve stores, we believe we
can build stand-alone Princi bakeries as well. And so that pyramid exists.
So just over the last couple of weeks, after opening the Seattle Roastery, we began
planning for the opening of the ﬁrst Seattle Reserve Store. And if you think about
what that store is and what it can be in the future, basically, it's taking every element
of the Reserve Roastery in Capitol Hill, breaking it down in either 1/2 or even 1/3,
taking the Roastery out, putting Princi in, in a full way, all of the theater and romance
of everything we're doing around coﬀee in terms of coﬀee brewing and the beautiful
visual design and then elevating mixology in ways that we can have an afternoon
and evening day part. And I think we're going to play a short video, which will
actually show the Reserve store that opened at the lobby entrance of our oﬃce in
SoDo just 1.5 weeks ago.
How many of you have seen it? So the design is very emblematic of the Roastery.
And of all the things we're doing, we're really bringing Princi to life in terms of the
quality, the integrity and the artisanal value of what Rocco has done. And why we're
so pleased is that SoDo really is not a destination. And so we're getting obviously
lots of people coming who are Starbucks partners from our own oﬃce. But about
40% of the customers that are coming literally are people who were driving because
this store has become a destination. So our plans now are to build Princi stand-alone
stores, Reserve stores and then, of course, the excitement we have about new
Roasteries.
So in terms of new Roasteries, we have a lot of exciting things coming. So New York
will open up at the end of 2018. And this is in the Meatpacking District. And that
store on the left is Apple. On the right, which you can't see, is the Chelsea Market.
And across the way is Google's headquarters. Our fear about this store is it's going
to be too small. But you can imagine the excitement that we all have, especially me
coming from New York, about ﬁnally getting a Roastery in Manhattan. This will open
at the end of the year.
Then we go to Tokyo in 2019 in Nakameguro. And for those of you who don't know
Japan that well, this store kind of sits in the perfect place of where the cherryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 24 of 39blossoms are. And this store will open in the spring exactly when the cherry
blossoms are blooming. We get a few things right.
Then we go to Chicago. And in Chicago, we were very, very fortunate to be able to
secure one of the most iconic pieces of real estate on North Michigan Avenue. And
this is the old Crate & Barrel site. And the interesting thing about this store, this is a
design nightmare because this is going to be a vertical Roastery. So 4 stories. And I
can tell you that people are going to be coming to this Roastery just to see and ride
the escalator. It is the sexiest thing you have ever seen and very expensive.
Okay. So those are the 3 Roasteries. But there is 1 Roastery and 1 market that has
been on our minds now for many, many years. And that is what we shared with you a
year ago. And that is the opening of Starbucks in Milan. So I can't ﬁnd the words or
express to you how excited I am about opening in Italy. You all know the story. We
went to Italy for the ﬁrst time in the early '80s. We discovered the Italian coﬀee bar,
the sense of community, the romance of espresso. But we've waited a long time. We
waited because we didn't feel we had the right level of respect. And we just had to
get things right in many countries before we came here. Then once we decided to
come to Italy, we said we can't just open up a store. We have to come with the
Roastery. And we've got to ﬁnd the right site. And we found, literally, the old post
oﬃce at Cordusio Square in walking distance of Duomo. And this store will open in
September of '18. And I'm telling you, it is going to be -- I have no words. Everything
about Shanghai and everything about Capitol Hill and everything we've done in
advance of this has led us to this place. And I think we have our Italian partner here.
And that is Matteo Percassi. Matteo, are you here? Can you stand? Thank you. I also
see Angelo Moratti there. Angelo, will you stand? Thank you.
So there's lots of concern and trepidation as whether or not the Italians are going to
embrace Starbucks. And there's also a lot of people in Italy who are thinking, they
really have lost their mind. They're going to open up a 2,000 square-foot coﬀee
store in a 30,000 square-foot building. Because they don't know what this Roastery
is all about. So a week ago, we had, in essence, a hiring fair in Milan. And in order to
do that, we decided that we would kind of build a pop-up Roastery, invite the media
in and hire close to 150 to 200 people because we have to train them in advance of
the opening. And we didn't know what would happen. And we ﬁlmed it. And when
you see this, you are going to realize, I think, the anticipation that the Milanese and
the Italians are going to have when we open the doors in September. And I can tell
you, the design elements of this Roastery are going to take advantage of everything
we've learned and put a -- kind of an Italian ﬂare inside. But take a look at what
happened when we had this mini-training opportunity and hiring fair this week.
This is my 36th year with Starbucks Coﬀee Company, my 26th opportunity to be at
the Annual Meeting. And I just want to just take one moment and recognize my wife,
Sheri, for all of her support throughout all of these years. Thank you.
So almost in every annual meeting we've ever had, dating back to the ﬁrst one
where we held it at the Kent roasting plant. And we had Kenny G who is -- why do
people laugh at that? He was -- anyway. So we've had a history of bringing world-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

had so many opportunities. We could have done so many diﬀerent things. And we
thought we'd do something quite diﬀerent and quite unique. But in keeping with the
excitement and the anticipation we have about Italy. So what I want to share with you
is an aria. And to do that, the, I think, most famous, world-renowned singers in Italy
are from La Scala. And we have brought them to Seattle.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well fantastic. Well the opening of today, we said we would share a bit about those
things that we would honor and preserve as we built this great and enduring brand
and those things that we would reinvent and reimagine as we go forward. Hopefully,
we've shared a little bit of both of those with you here today. And with a wonderful
closing performance, what can we say? What do you think? It's fantastic.
Now I've often said that having Starbucks in my life has been a gift. And I consider it
a great privilege to serve this company, to serve our partners, to serve the customers
and you, our shareholders. And I just want to close by taking this opportunity to
thank Howard. My journey started nine years ago. My Starbucks journey started nine

Broadridge Financial Solutions has been appointed the inspector of elections to
tabulate the votes. And Mr. Andrew Wilcox, representing Broadridge, is present at
the meeting today. We have received an aﬃdavit signed by Broadridge Financial
Solutions that notice of this meeting, along with related proxy and annual report
materials, was mailed or made available on January 26, 2018, to each Starbucks
shareholder of record as of the close of business on the record date, January 11,
2018. And based on that aﬃdavit, this meeting is duly called with timely and proper
notice.
In addition, based on information provided by Broadridge, a quorum of
shareholders is present to conduct our meeting today. Please note that a list of
shareholders as of the record date is available for inspection by shareholders at the
Investor Relations table located in the grand lobby behind this auditorium. The polls
for the matters to be voted on today are now open and will close immediately after I
present the matters to be voted on at this meeting.
If you are a shareholder of record as of January 11, 2018. And you have not previously
voted or you wish to change your vote at this time, you should go to the Investor
Relations table in the grand lobby.
So the ﬁrst order of business is the election of the directors as nominated by the
board that I just introduced. The board recommends a vote for each of the
nominees. The second item of business is the approval of an advisory resolution on
executive compensation. The board recommends a vote for this proposal. The third
item of business is the ratiﬁcation of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the
company's independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for this current ﬁscal year
ending September 30, 2018. Likewise, the board recommends a vote for this
proposal. The fourth item of business is the shareholder proposal submitted by
James McRitchie and Myra Young regarding proxy access amendments. I would now
like to recognize Shiloh Britt, a representative of Mr. McRitchie and Ms. Young, for a
period of 3 minutes. Ms. Britt, would you please come to the microphone?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 27 of 39Sophie Hager HumeThank you. Shareholder proposal regarding proxy access amendments.
Shareholders ask the board to amend its proxy access for director nominations
bylaw and associated documents to decrease the amount of stock the member of
nominated groups is required to hold for three years to satisfy ownership regarding
to form a nominated group as follows: No limitations shall be placed on the number
of stockholders that can aggregate shares to achieve the 3% required shares for an
eligible shareholder. The reason for this proposal is that even in the 20 largest public
pension funds who are able to combine shares, they would not meet the 3% criteria
a continuous three years. This proposal addresses proxy access potentially for only
the largest shareholders, the least unlikely shareholders to use it. Since no group of
shareholders at any U.S. company has yet to make use of the proxy access, it is
important to make sure the current limitations of 20 shareholders does not prevent
shareholders from using proxy access. We urge you to vote in favor of proposal for.
And I would like to end with a quick story. My name is Shiloh. And I was a barista for
ﬁve years. I absolutely loved the time that I was a barista, some of the best times of
my life where I learned more about the community and about myself than I would
have in any other time. Tonight, I have been hearing quite a bit about community
and just how much Starbucks honors the community. And I want to thank you for that
because while I was a partner, I truly felt as a community member. I felt valued and I
felt that what I said mattered. So I do want to thank you for that.
During that time, I got to know my customers. And I got to know what they truly
believed, what they wanted and what they thought of the company. And I can tell
you from personal -- I can tell you that they believe in this company, they want it to
do the right thing, they believe in the forests and the ocean and they want the
company to address plastic pollution.
When I was a barista for those ﬁve years, I served over 65,000 cups of coﬀee. That
seems like a lot. But it is just pennies compared to what baristas all around the world
do. And I'm here today to speak on their behalf. We are very grateful that Starbucks
has, as of yesterday, said it is going to up the ante and admit to -- or get us a
recyclable cup. However, the thing is, this has been said twice before. I want to know,
Mr. Johnson, will you keep your promise? Will you deliver on this recyclable cup that
we are still waiting for? Because the world is watching and we're all waiting. So
please, what you do with the world will follow. Will you give us this recyclable cup?
{BIO 18877968 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. Britt, for your time. We'll hold any more questions for the end.
Respectfully, for the reasons set forth in the company's proxy statement, the board
recommends a vote against this proposal.
The ﬁfth item of business is the shareholder proposal submitted by As You Sow on
behalf of the Michelle Swanson and Stan Roebuck [ph] revocable trust together with
other co-ﬁlers regarding a report on sustainable packaging. I would like to nowFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

Page 28 of 39Adrian Grenierrecognize Adrian Grenier, a representative of As You Sow, also for a period of 3
minutes. Mr. Grenier, would you please come to the microphone?
Hello, everyone. My name is Adrian Grenier. I'm a UN Environment Goodwill
Ambassador, a friend and an investor. And I'm here on behalf of concerned
investors, As You Sow, to present proposal #5, which requests the phase-out of
plastic straws and the renewed commitment by the company to fulﬁll on its failed
sustainability goals regarding plastic.
One person, 1 cup and 1 neighborhood at a time. This is Starbucks' commitment to
creating positive impact on the communities it serves. One new Starbucks store
opening every 15 hours in neighborhoods across China. This is Starbucks' current
growth trajectory in Asia. Yesterday, Starbucks announced a $10 million investment in
the closed loop fund to begin tackling the recyclability of its plastic-lined cup.
Impressive? Certainly. And I applaud this tiptoe in the right direction. But how can
Starbucks live up to its promise of creating positive impact on the communities it
serves when the company is knowingly expanding its footprint and its plastic waste
in a part of the world that often has little to no formal recycling systems and, of
course, the plastic that already bleeds into the environment?
While innovation on the paper cup is important, we must not get distracted from the
bigger tragedy of plastic packaging, which accounts for over 40% of marine litter.
Starbucks moonshot must shoot beyond the paper cup. As investors, it is our
ﬁduciary duty to understand our portfolio's impact on the climate and vice versa. The
global ocean is the world's seventh largest economy. A healthy ocean is fundamental
to mitigating climate change and its impact. A healthy ocean is also fundamental to
ensuring the future of our investment in the company.
So why did I, an actor, come all this way from New York to be here today? one year
ago, I visited Bali in support of my work with the UN Environment and its Clean Seas
Campaign. Even for me, someone intimately aware of the plastic pollution crisis, I
was shocked when I walked down the beach picking up handfuls of plastic.
Starbucks' iconic green straws were among the most prominent in my collection. I
now know that plastic consumed in China, Indonesia and the Philippines accounts
for 44% of all marine plastic pollution. So yesterday's announcement also makes no
mention of Starbucks' ubiquitous green straws, which are swept into waterways,
ending up in the bellies of sea life and eventually back on land in our tap water, our
children -- that our children drink and the ﬁsh on our plates.
I am here, not because I was asked to be, I am here because I have seen this
destruction ﬁrsthand. I am here because I care. And Starbucks, I want you to care
more. I am business-friendly and I understand the challenges associated with
innovation on a global scale. But solutions are already on the market. And our
competitors have begun to take action. McDonald's and Costa have made
announcements that have stolen our moral high ground. I do not want Starbucks toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

expectations of an awoken consumer base, we will lose our competitive edge.
Now, Starbucks, you need to act and fully realize your commitment to our global
community and to the planet who you name as your most important business
partner because it is good business. Today, I am simply asking that you act ocean-
friendly and vote yes on proposal 5. Starbucks taught the world how to drink coﬀee.
And I ﬁrmly believe that Starbucks can teach the world how to make the environment
its ultimate business partner. The siren is calling. I hope all of you will listen to her.

Thank you, Mr. Grenier. Respectfully, for the reasons set forth in the company's proxy
statement, the board votes -- the board recommends a vote against this proposal.
The last item of business is the shareholder proposal submitted by Trillium Asset
Management LLC on behalf of the Paul Lefort [ph] revocable trust regarding a
diversity report.
I would now like to recognize Brianna Murphy, a representative of Trillium Asset
Management, for a period of 3 minutes. Ms. Murphy, would you please come to the

{BIO 17733123 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board and my fellow
shareholders. My name is Brianna Murphy. I'm a shareholder advocate at Trillium
Asset Management. I'm here on behalf of the Paul Lefort [ph] revocable trust, a long-
term Starbucks shareholder, to hereby move proposal #7.
Our proposal asks Starbucks to disclose workforce diversity data identifying
employees according to race and gender in categories deﬁned on the EEO-1 chart,
what many consider to be the standard and comprehensive workplace diversity
disclosure. To begin, I think it's worth highlighting that we both agree on the
importance of advancing gender and racial diversity within the company. The
board's statement in the proxy notes that building a diverse, inclusive workforce is a
real business imperative. We are encouraged by Starbucks' commitment to pursue a
diverse workforce. However, investors do not have enough information to evaluate
the company's eﬀorts and progress.
Currently, Starbucks provide high-level diversity data for just 2 ranks within the ﬁrm,
the 50 top leaders and vice presidents. By summarizing this data in such a vague
manner, the company prevents investors from fully understanding and evaluating
the company's commitment and progress over time. We're concerned this may
prevent the company from capturing the business value of a diverse workforce.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 30 of 39Sophie Hager Hume
A - Kevin R. JohnsonResearch has shown that companies with greater ethnic diversity are 35% more likely
to outperform those without ethnic diversity. Starbucks currently reports that just 18%
of the 50 top leader roles are held by ethnically diverse employees. We believe the
proposal's request is not only reasonable but poses few, if any, costs to the company.
Starbucks is required to provide this information annually to the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. Therefore, the cost of disclosing should be minimal.
Lastly, disclosing workforce data could contribute to a culture of transparency and
accountability. By promoting a gender balance workforce, Starbucks can further
reduce the company's risk of sexual harassment incidences, a risk we need to
address at all companies now more than ever. In closing, we believe it is in the best
interest of shareholders and of the company to demonstrate that it is its commitment
to diversity in the most thorough way possible. I'd like to take this opportunity to not
only urge shareholder support for this proposal but strongly urge the board to
consider making this information public. Thank you for your time and consideration.
{BIO 18877968 <GO>}
Thank you, Ms. Murphy. Respectfully, for the reasons set forth in the company's proxy
statement, the board recommends a vote against this proposal.
So that concludes the matters to be voted on as outlined in the notice of annual
meeting. In accordance with our bylaws, I hereby declare the polls for voting at our
2018 annual meeting closed.
Ladies and gentlemen, I received the preliminary tabulation from Broadridge. And
based on that tabulation, I'm pleased to report: all of our director nominees were
elected; each of the management proposals was approved; the shareholder
proposal regarding proxy access amendments was not approved; the shareholder
proposal regarding a report on sustainable packaging was not approved; and the
shareholder proposal regarding a diversity report was not approved. The ﬁnal results
will be reported on a Form 8-K ﬁled with the SEC within 4 business days of this

And that concludes the formal business. And I now declare the formal meeting

Howard and Kevin, especially, for their vision on social impacts and all the work that
Starbucks has done. I'd also like to say a special thanks to John Kelly for his advocacy

personal ﬁnancial support of Mary's Place. So I just want to let you know what we've
done in the past year and how well your $6 million has contributed to the results.
We've provided over 175,000 bed nights. And by the way, for people that don't
know Mary's Place, Mary's Place is an organization that has emergency family
shelters in Seattle and in the region. So we've provided over 175,000 bed nights.
We've served over 300,000 meals, which includes your program of FoodShare. And
we've begun to regionalize our family -- emergency family centers. We have 3 in
Seattle. But in the past year, we've also opened in Shoreline, Kenmore and White
Center. And that means that our families, our guests and their children are closer to
the communities that they come from. And the children are closer to the schools that
they continue to attend. So thank you for all the work you've done on social impacts.

I'm Justin Danhof for the National Center for Public Policy Research. Howard, I think I
know how you felt speaking at AEI. I kind of feel the same way when I come here
every year, just in reverse. In repeatedly bashing President Trump's tax cuts, however,
Mr. Schultz, it appears that you might be placing your personal politics ahead of the
company's best interests. You've gone so far as to call the tax cuts fool's gold.
Allowing hard working-class Americans, including many Starbucks partners, to keep
more of their hard-earned money, that's not fool's gold. Hundreds of corporations
have oﬀered bonuses, increased wages and increased investments in the United
States, importantly, in response to President Trump's tax reform. Despite Mr. Schultz's
protestations, of course, Starbucks increased wages and oﬀered Starbucks bonuses
to many of its employees. As Lucy pointed out earlier in her presentation, that was in
response to the tax cuts. Even after the company made that announcement, Schultz
made the outrageous claim that the tax reform law somehow designed to rob from
the future of young people. This comes again as many Starbucks partners are seeingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

of favorable provisions in that reform. That's not robbery, it's a double victory for
Starbucks partners. Relying on poor economic analysis, Schultz appeared to suggest
that tax cuts might increase the national debt by as much as $1 trillion. President
Obama's economic policies increased the national debt by an unprecedented $9
trillion. What did you say about that? Using your own logic, President Obama robbed
from future generations much more than any other President in history.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
What's your question?
Well here's the question. The comment, ﬁrst, is that it's shocking to hear Mr. Schultz
object to a law that's helping so many Starbucks partners and their families. If he
cares more about criticizing the President, he has the right to enter the political
arena. But this law is helping Starbucks partners. So my question is for Kevin. Do you
agree with your predecessor that the recent tax cuts that have beneﬁted so many
Starbucks partners are fool's gold designed to rob future generations?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
I'm sure Kevin can have his answer to that question. But can I just clarify a few things?
First of all, thank you for coming, thank you for the question. And I think you
mischaracterized what I said about AEI. I said I was privileged to go to AEI. And I was
-- the opportunity I was given was an honor to speak to a mostly Republican
audience. There was nothing disrespectful about that. With regard to the tax cut itself
and the reduction in the tax rate, what I've said publicly was that I was for
comprehensive tax reform, which would have included a corporate tax cut. But I did
not believe that cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% was the right thing to
do. And let me explain why. I think this is really important as it relates to how you've
characterized my position. The reason I said it's robbing from young people and
future generations is that we are sitting today. And this is factual, with almost a $21
trillion debt on the balance sheet of America. Is that true?
Yes.
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Okay. Secondarily, we are approaching $400 billion a year in interest expense. Is that
true?
Absolutely.

Q - Jonathan RosenberryOkay. Both parties, President Obama, President Bush and now, President Trump,
both members of Congress, are complicit in their reckless approach to the amount
of debt. And if this was a business, we'd be approaching insolvency. The debt is
robbing from the existing generation of young people and future generations. The
corporate tax rate of 21%, in my view, was an enormous missed opportunity to do
comprehensive tax reform. And that was my position. That is what I stated publicly.
And I think both parties. And this is important, both parties, including the current
administration, are responsible for the years in which we have not gotten the truth
and the honesty with regard to the piling on of almost $21 trillion of debt. China
owns over $1 trillion of that and building an infrastructure on our money. That's why I
think it was a reckless thing to do without doing comprehensive tax reform. Thank
you.
Thank you.

Thank you for your question. First of all, I think each of us as citizens of this country
obviously will have our own perspective and our own point of view on policy and
diﬀerent things related to politics. I separate that though for my responsibility at
Starbucks. My responsibility at Starbucks is to always do the right thing for our
partners, our customers and our shareholders. And that's exactly what I did in this
case, certainly looking at the impact of the tax legislation that was passed. And what
was the right thing to do? The right thing to do was to accelerate some of the
investments that were already in our strategic plan. And one of those was the
investments that we're making in our partners. And I think that was absolutely the
right thing to do for our partners and for our company. And I'll separate that from
any personal point of view I might have as a citizen. My job, as the President and
Chief Executive of this company, is to do the right thing for Starbucks partners,
customers and shareholders.

I'm Jonathan Rosenberry. Thank you for this opportunity to speak. Starbucks
brightened our mornings when it became one of the ﬁrst national coﬀee chains to
pour out nondairy milks. But millions of consumers are seeking hearty plant-based
foods to enjoy with their coﬀee. And that's where Starbucks menu still doesn't live up
to the buzz. A recent report by international restaurant consultants, Baum +
Whiteman, named plant-based dining the 2018 trend of the year. And last summer,
vegan options ranked highly in QSR magazine's list of 100 ideas for improving
restaurant brand. Although you've recently debuted a vegan cupcake and a protein-
packed lentil bowl in a few cities, for most of your customers across the country,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

I'm Bruce Herbert of Newground Social Investment, an investor voice here in Seattle.
And I'm an original stockholder of the company who has stood at many times on this
occasion to celebrate both our company and our people. And in contrast, today, I
must stand to call the company toward a higher standard of good governance and
conduct. And the issue is this. Today, Starbucks curbed shareholder First
Amendment rights by not allowing the proponent of the sustainable packaging
proposal to present their proposal in the way in which they wished, in essence,
controlling the impression that shareholders and the press might get on that topic.
One must ask if the board was aware that this was taking place on their watch. The
rules which govern the manner in which these proceedings are conducted are set by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. And under SEC rules as well as
established meeting protocols such as Robert's Rules, presenters are allowed to
speak their minds in -- and are encouraged to ask questions of the board. So I've
attended a number of annual meetings around the country where pairs of presenters
have shared in presenting a proposal. Often, young people have been especially
encouraged to participate in this important civic process. In this light, it was
disappointing to see how the company tamped down on shareholder rights today.
As I have celebrated before, Starbucks is a very good company and used to making
courageous choices and persevering against all odds. But there is not really room for
that in terms of tamping down shareholder rights. Therefore, I ask, will the board
pledge to support its engaged stockholders and not micromanage future meetings
using the -- under the SEC mandated portion of this proceeding?

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantWell ﬁrst of all, thank you very much for your feedback. And I'll just comment that we
are committed to providing access to the annual meeting to as many shareholders
as possible and while, at the same time, remaining in compliance with all SEC rules
and regulations. Now certainly, to accommodate that here at McCaw Hall, certainly,
there's a big line of shareholders that want to have access to this. And so we
reserved a seat for any shareholder proposals and then ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis
for other shareholders that want to show up. So we take your feedback and
recognize that we try and make this a meeting that's inclusive and accessible to all
shareholders. So thank you so much. Thank you. Over here.
Mr. Johnson, you do not know me, although my picture is probably on some
dartboard in Starbucks. I am a proud former barista and current volunteer for
Stand.earth. Thank you for listening to me earlier. And I do just want to say that
despite asking you guys to create a better cup, I absolutely love what you guys are
doing. I go to Starbucks every other day with my mom with our reusable cups. But I
do have to ask you, sir, you have made a promise -- sorry, your company has made a
promise in 2008 and 2012 to deliver on a recyclable cup. Will you keep that promise
this time?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well ﬁrst of all, I appreciate your dedication to Starbucks and your comments around
sustainability. I think we share a common goal. And in fact, I'll just remind our
shareholders and our audience that our current cup is a recyclable cup.
Unfortunately, for that cup to be recyclable, it requires cities and municipalities to
invest in the equipment to recycle them. We are searching for a better solution. We
have a common goal with you. And what we decided was because Starbucks is far
less than 1% of the total cups, everyone in the industry is looking for this solution.
And so this is why we made the commitment of $10 million in partnership with
Closed Loop Ventures to create an opportunity for innovators to come up with not
only a recyclable cup but ideally a compostable cup. And so we remain committed.
We do have a recyclable cup today. We know there is more to do. And we are
making the investment in partnership with this third party as an aspiration to create
an open-source solution that not just Starbucks can beneﬁt but all merchants and all
consumers that use paper cups to consume their beverages. So thank you so much
for sharing your perspective.
Thank you. We will be keeping an eye. And our giant Cup Monster, Grounds, will
take a break from rolling the streets of Seattle. But I do invite you to reach out to
Stand.earth. We would love to speak with you about this exciting future. So thank
you.

Welcome, Jerry.
And of course, I go to Starbucks a lot. And whenever I walk in the door, I always get a
real cup. I don't -- I do not take a cardboard cup. I always use a real cup.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Ceramic, yes.
And that's just the way I am. But a number of years ago, a comment was made. And
we would like to see cups that are for sale at Starbucks be made in the United States.
And I realize your commitment to the business in China. Of course, I understand that.
And if I was in China, I expect the cup to be made in China that I would buy. But here
in the United States, it would be really nice if we could support companies that make
cups here in the United States. And I remember that Mr. Schultz a number of years
ago said that there was a company that they were going to, I don't know, investigate
or buy more cups from. But I haven't really seen the results of that. So I would still
like to see cups made in the United States sold at Starbucks.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Howard?
{BIO 1432255 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you very much. I think what you're referring to is we began an investment
and a partnership with a company in East Liverpool, Pennsylvania, right on the
border between Pennsylvania and Ohio. 20 years ago, this was the center of pottery
manufacturing in America. And all those companies, for the most part, are now gone.
We invested in that company and tried to help them. Unfortunately, they could not
sustain themself just on our business. And for now, they're no longer making that
product. We would love to ﬁnd domestic manufacturers of those products. And I've
been seeking them for quite some time now. The issue is the scale of Starbucks and
the amount of product that we need. But we are constantly looking for those kind of
vendors. Thank you.

{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Congratulations.
Thank you. First and foremost, I want to thank Kevin, Roz and Howard for just being a
part of this company. It literally saved my life. I was at my wit's end before I got hired
on by my ﬁrst manager. What I do want to address today is the topic of a non-
retaliation workforce. I have been with the company for almost two years. And I've
worked underneath 5 managers. Only 2 of those 5 managers have been held
accountable for that non-retaliation workforce. In the 6-week span between January
and February, I watched 6 of the partners of the current store that I work at leave
because of the issues that I brought up to my manager and her cutting them out of
their hours and refusing to speak to them. To me, that is exactly what -- the opposite
of a non-retaliation workforce. For a partner to address a problem that they are
seeing and then get their hours cut because they wanted to bring it up, that's
ridiculous. I'm a ﬁrm believer that people do not leave jobs, they leave managers.
And Starbucks does so many things for their employees that I see mostly from
higher up. The thing is, is that you can be a great shift supervisor and you can be a
great barista. But your manager is what makes your store. And I'm seeing now with a
lot of the youth, they are afraid to approach their manager with any issues because
of that retaliation. I moved to Idaho last year. When I told my manager I didn't want
to open anymore, she threatened to ﬁre me. I told her that she could not do that
because this is a non-retaliation workforce. She did not speak to me for 3 weeks.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Okay.
So I just want to know what we can do about that.
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Roz?
{BIO 15034309 <GO>}
Yes. So let me -- ﬁrst of all, thank you for everything. You're totally dedicated to us.
And I'm grateful for you being a partner in our stores. And what you've described to
this room is totally unacceptable. And we do not support retaliation in this company.
I'd like to learn more about your store. I'm going to ask, I see my leader for the U.S.,
Rossann Williams. I'm going to ask her to get your store number so that we can make
sure that we look into the situation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21

Now thank you, Mr. Kevin.
Thank you, Mr. Kevin Johnson, for meeting us yesterday at the Starbucks
headquarters. We were wondering, can you use reusable mugs next year at this
meeting?
{BIO 3773960 <GO>}
Well ﬁrst of all, I want to thank you and your parents and adults for hosting or for
visiting Starbucks yesterday and sharing your story with me. I think these young
ladies began a journey studying sustainability and things that they felt were
important. And they came to us with ideas and things they'd like to see. And
certainly, as we talked yesterday, we share a common goal, which is to -- we've got a
recyclable cup. But that's not good enough. We have to move forward with a
recyclable cup and even a compostable cup. And your ideas of let's encourage more
of the reusable cups. And so we sell the reusable cups in our stores. And we're
going to do more around that.
For this particular meeting, I don't know if this is a reusable cup meeting. But your
point about reusable cups is so noted. And it was a pleasure to spend time with you
yesterday. And thank you so much for your creativity and your commitment to
sustainability. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-21
