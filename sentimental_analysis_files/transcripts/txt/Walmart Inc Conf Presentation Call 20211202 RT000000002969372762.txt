Good morning. Good day, everyone. Hope you're doing well. I'm Simeon Gutman,
Morgan Stanley's Hardline Broadline and Food Retail Analyst and it is a distinct
pleasure to welcome Walmart to this ﬁreside chat for our global consumer and retail
conference, represented by EVP and CFO, Brett Biggs.
I'm going to read a quick disclosure and then go and get going with Q&A. First for
important disclosures, please see the Morgan Stanley research disclosure website at
www.morganstanley.com/research disclosures. If you have any questions, please
reach out to Morgan Stanley's sales rep. We do have a Q&A for the audience. I see
the queue, if you'd like to ask, I could manage both as we get into it.
In lieu of a formal intro, Brett, thanks for being here. I'm going to bug you ﬁrst about
the announcement, I do want to say, I hope we'll see you at the shareholders
meeting and I'm expecting them to invite in the next quarter to give you another
hug.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I've thought about that.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yeah. I'm sure they're going to do that to you. But it's obviously been a pleasure
working with you and as they said in Jerry McGuire, you've been the ambassador of
[ph] Quant, not just shareholder value Brett, but community and I think respect and
even some love. So, appreciate the partnership over the last (Multiple Speakers)

Questions And Answers
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
(Question And Answer)
Fair enough. So, can I ask, what are you -- what you're going to be doing 12 to 24
months from now?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I maybe for the ﬁrst time in my life, I don't know entirely what I'm going to be
doing. I'm involved in a lot of non-proﬁt work. I really enjoy that. And I'm looking
forward to doing that, spending more time doing that.
I have two daughters I have a 23-year-old and a 15-year-old. So, looking forward to
spending more time with them, my wife as well. Just probably will get me and
Simeon play a little more golf in, well that would be part of the plan, but I'm excited.
It's the company is in fantastic shape. It's such it's been, what a blessing to my life the
last 22 years and starting year seven in this role. And I just can't -- I can't think of a
time where I've been more optimistic about the company, and I feel like we're just in
a great place for a transition like this to occur.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
So, thanks for that. You've been at this helm during one of the most transformational
moments or times for Walmart. Through multi-channel, understanding what the
economics would look like, doing both balancing investment with growth. And then,
we always used to talk about the expense ratio and how you could potentially
engineer it lower. So, open-ended of what's left and what do you think the big
strategic initiatives maybe for the next Walmart CFO?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I think the strategy is as solid as I've ever seen it, inside the company. And I
think now we need to go execute against that. But when you have a competitive
environment and macro environment that's constantly changing, you're going to
continue to adapt that strategy. You and I were talking earlier, there's -- you get a
question of why, why now. And there's -- in companies like this is, there's you never
ﬁnish anything. There's just diﬀerent evolutions of what's going on inside the
company, because it's changing so frequently and improving itself. So, I think the
new CFO will continue to have certainly things to do, but I think whoever comes in is
coming in at a time when I've never seen the growth opportunities this company like
I see them right now. When I came in 2000, we were $260 billion in revenue and
we're way over $500 billion now. And I remember thinking about the rollout
Supercenters at a time and what that could look like, but now I look at it and I justFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-02
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14Q - Simeon Ari Gutman
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Simeon Ari Gutman
A - Brett Biggssee so many diﬀerent arms of potential growth that I think it's astounding what this
company could do.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
So, part of this, I guess the strategic/ﬁnancial plan is balancing the investment with
growth. Do you think that there could be a tilt in how that's positioned in the future
meaning, either invest quicker or grow quicker or do both faster? And then, I have a
follow-up related to more about '21 and how to think about going forward.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I think, we said last year that we're going to increase our CapEx sum and you're
seeing us do that, we're investing in fulﬁllment centers and automation and other
things that are going to, I think make this company give it the ability to grow even
quicker than it is obviously last two years have been high growth, because of COVID.
But can grow quicker than we did pre-COVID, because of the investment we're
making, that sometimes you're going to have a lack of some of that investment. You
can't put up a fulﬁllment center overnight that increases your capacity to do 3P and
other things like that. So, there's always a lag, but we're putting the CapEx in, to
make those growth rates possible. We have the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to go do that. And
you've seen we do share repurchases here over $7 billion of our share repurchase,
already for the year. So, we really can do all of this. And speed is a really important
element inside the company right now. We want to continue to move with speed,
because that's our customers are moving quickly, our competitors are moving
quickly and we want to stay in front of that.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
So, in the second quarter, I call it the quote that was heard around the world, Doug's
quote, that we can do both, where he reiterated the idea of investing as well as
driving proﬁt growth. And part of it is the recognition that you've built this ﬁnancial
plan. You've stuck to a strategic plan, which not many companies can say they've
done. I think that's what's helped you've been able to hit it. And then in the last call, I
thought there was a little bit of vagueness regarding that. And maybe just to help
clarify, we always thought, hey, we've built this plan that even if we don't grow sales
at the same rate, we could still engineer the P&L. And I want to say, you manage it
that ﬁnally on an annual basis to be able to grow EBIT dollars at a call it, mid-single-
ish rate of growth. And the way that it was characterized on the third quarter was
more of, hey, this might be a medium to long term. It may not be linear. So, can you
just parse that we can do both to how should we think about it in terms of a timing
perspective?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Well, I don't think anything is linear. It rarely is and actually I would argue over the
last two years, the algorithm we put out there, we've exceeded it by a long, long way.
So, I think we've already done what we said we would do from a sale topline and
bottom-line perspective. You know, there's been challenge for us in the last two
years, no doubt about it. And the 4% sales growth, the ability to grow operating
income faster than that, I feel great about that. Is it going to happen every year? No.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-02

Page 4 of 14Q - Simeon Ari Gutman

A - Brett Biggs
Q - Simeon Ari GutmanThere maybe years we invest diﬀerently than we do other years, but if you look back
over a period of time and say did they do, what they said they would do, I feel great
about our ability to do that.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And maybe a nuance follow-up to that, is I would have viewed or maybe the market
would have viewed 2021 or your ﬁscal '22 as a stepped-up investment here and you
mentioned the CapEx. And therefore, as you lap that there could be an easing of
that, and therefore that gives you a little bit more wherewithal, albeit you had a great
-- you've been having a great sales year this year.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Well we said 2.5% to 3% CapEx as a percent of sales for a period of time. So, I think
we laid that out fairly, fairly clearly last February.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Fair enough. So, moving on from that topic to the state of the consumer. And I want
to ask something that I think is pretty topical, that's probably been sitting on the
stock, maybe more than we appreciated, which is the lapping of stimulus. We will lap
a gargantuan amount in the ﬁrst half. But at the same time that customer is being
more employed, a lower income consumer employed and getting better paid. So,
how do you -- and I'm not a ﬁrst-half question, but I'd say, overall state of consumer
and the puts and takes around that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I think the state of consumer is still strong. You pointed out, jobs are readily
available, wages are up and that's really across the board. With where labor
participation rates are, you would think that the labor market would stay pretty good
for folks that want to work. So, that should stay strong through next year. We're just in
this period of time where there's such an imbalance of supply and demand in certain
categories, that we haven't seen before, because you've got the stimulus, you've got
a strong consumer, that is fueling demand. And you've got supply in some cases
constrained by impacts of COVID. Those things should work themselves out over
time, if you just think through. It may take a little longer than all of us thought when
we started this into this 18 months ago. But it will work. I feel conﬁdent, it will work its
way out over time. But if you look at Q3, we had over 15% two-year stack of Walmart
U.S., which is a massive business to begin with.
Sam's Club pulling fuel into back over 30% to your stacks. So, the size of this
business compared to what it was two years ago, is quite diﬀerent. I mean, we've
grown to a Fortune 50 company over two years. So, as we go into this next period of
time, which I think would continue to be incredible growth, and we are going into it
already with growth over the last two years that would have exceeded, I think any
investors expectations.

Q - Simeon Ari Gutman
A - Brett BiggsYou've been I guess appropriately like sobering ﬂash conservative around how we
should think about that. I've asked this a lot of CEOs of companies that sell durables,
exclusively durables, where there's this debate about reversion or some digestion.
How do you think about that for your business? I know, we're lapping stimulus, but
as far as this water level being higher and that, that retailers can grow from that.
Does that have merit or how do you think about it?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think what? I feel good about us continuing to grow. I can't speak for the entire
retail industry, but the consumer - consumer's good, there's still a lot of money out
there. I mean, I feel good about our ability to grow. I mean, have there been
tailwinds last two years? Of course. And it's why I keep coming back to and it's not to
be evasive about the questions, why I keep coming back to. I always think about this
business on a longer -- mid-term, long-term basis. I certainly care about next year
and our investors who I know care about next year, but any one quarter or one year
is while it's important, and our focus is on, when investors look back ﬁve years from
now and say these guys did the right thing. And I love where I'm at now. That's what I
want.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Got it. Okay.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
And feel good that will put them in that place.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yeah. So, transitioning from sales to margin, speciﬁcally gross margin. Last quarter,
the U.S. gross was down a shade 12. I thought it was a relative victory, right, when we
saw it. Maybe the market felt diﬀerently. We had a discussion -- I think that one of the
primary culprits were supply chain costs, not necessarily price investments, but Doug
did make a comment on the call. Our costs are rising quicker than our retail and we
kind of like that balance, something like that to that eﬀect. And so, taking into
account the headwinds, tailwinds, supply chain, inﬂation pricing, how should
investors think about that? I don't think you're managing to a margin. It's probably
an outcome but how do we think about the puts and takes? Are we in a gross margin
down environment for the foreseeable future?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
There are a lot of pieces to gross margin and Simeon, I feel like I've been saying this
ever since I was CFO, it's tough to look at quarter-to-quarter. Because there's so
many pieces, there are supply chain costs, there's a new businesses that we're in,
there's input costs, there's the cost versus retail, trade oﬀ, there's competitive. It's
really tough to look at quarter-to-quarter. I'm with you, I was a bit surprised by the
questions related to the U.S. margin, because it's been up signiﬁcantly at times and it
was -- I'd say relatively ﬂat in Q3. Again, as I -- as you look at the next few quarters or
certainly there'd be some choppiness in the next few quarters, I think in anybody'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-02

Q - Simeon Ari Gutman
A - Brett Biggsbusiness as we work our way through these imbalances that we've had as an
economy. But do I think the gross margin of Walmart can go up over time? I do.
And I, the reason I say that is, because of the new businesses that we're building.
Our ability to grow our general merchandise business, and continue to make the mix
better, which is really why the supercenter started as you needed a mix out of that
box and it's no diﬀerent today. You still need that mix. I think our ability to grow our
GM business as good as it's ever been with the capacity we're building for
marketplace and an e-commerce. So, I feel good about all of that. And, but I feel
good about the ability to do that and keep our price gaps in a really great shape,
that allows us to take market share.
If I'm an investor, again, let's talk about how investors feel two years, three years, ﬁve
years from now. I think they're going to be glad that we continue to take market
share which we are, but we can do it in a way that's really responsible from a
shareholder perspective. So, going back to your comment about we can do both. I
feel conﬁdent that we can do that. This is a time though where you can show
diﬀerentiation with competitors, on pricing, do in a smart way, do in a strategic way,
but you can -- you can show diﬀerentiation, get that market share, get customers into
your ecosystem in your ﬂywheel, that long-term is a great decision.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
You mentioned that, I think you said we feel good about where we are with pricing
or maintaining price gaps. Can you talk about the backdrop? I know you don't share
so much on it, but we are hearing, especially in the grocery space, pricing initiatives
or improvements trickling in a little bit more frequently. So, where do you stand? I
know you eventually
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
What do you mean by that, Simeon?
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
The price gaps. Price gaps for its competitors, where you feel you are? Because it --
at the margin you've always said we feel good about where we are. Now I'm starting
to hear other retailers lean in for the ﬁrst time especially in grocery, curious what
you're hearing, seeing and anything diﬀerent?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
You're telling I'm trying to shrink that price gap?
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Exactly.

Q - Simeon Ari Gutman
A - Brett BiggsGot it. Yeah. Our price gaps were higher than they were or wider than they were
before we came into COVID. So, I feel like we have a lot of ﬂexibility in what we need
to do. And even just, I mean, takeaway, we've always done well, which is provide
value for the customer. The things that we can do now versus ﬁve years ago and
where there's delivery pickup, e-commerce, the initiatives that we're putting forth in
ﬁnancial services, and healthcare, there's so many things that we can do as a
business that competitors really can't do. That it just adds on to, I think the gap that
we already had with price. You had these things on top of it. And I think it makes the
total gap wider.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Competitively.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Regarding inﬂation, Brett, is there any update as far as is it beginning to level oﬀ? Or
do you expect the run rate to accelerate further?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think anyone who says they know for sure where that's going is, is probably not a
prudent call. We're seeing categories where it is leveling out some work, we're
seeing some work continues to move upward. I think you've got to look at input
costs. I think there's labor costs, that are probably a little stickier than maybe some of
the input costs will be longer term as the, again the imbalance is just clear, they are
way out of the system. I think some of those costs, whether that's transportation costs
or input costs will probably come down at some point. Labor costs are probably a
little stickier would be my guess at this point for a longer period of time.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Okay. So, a shifting away from margin. I want to ask a little bit about e-commerce.
The ﬁrst is, do you think Walmart at some point in the future will discuss the channel
proﬁts or is that a thing of the past?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think it's really diﬃcult to discuss in that way anymore. Because and I think it's going
to get more diﬃcult. I started saying that about three or four years ago, and I think
you and other analysts, Simeon, didn't quite believe me on that one. But as we get
this ﬂywheel more integrated, we did more things going inside of our ecosystem. It's
going to be much more diﬃcult to discuss channel proﬁtability in a way that makes
sense. To me, it's about growing top line and doing it in a way from a total
proﬁtability standpoint that makes sense for the company and for shareholders.
Certainly, I and Doug and others talk a lot about and have a pretty good view into, if
we grow this channel this happens, because we don't do that, then you don't know
how to manage the costs. And, but to describe that in a way that one doesn't hurtFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-02

A - Brett Biggscompetitively, and in a way that it makes sense and how you would monitor it, it is
pretty challenging.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
What could I infer from that then if you have alternative proﬁt pools, with that go
against or be included in the P&L of an e-commerce business or no, you'd still look
at e-commerce with non-alternative revenue drivers?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Well, to begin with e-commerce isn't a segment. It's part of our U.S. segment, it's
part of international segment, it's part of our Sam's segment. So, we don't out e-
commerce separately from a reporting standpoint, that which makes it even, I think
even more challenging to discuss. But your question really hits at the point. If my
Connect business is growing, it's going to be for a lot of diﬀerent reasons. If our
marketplace business grows, it's going to be because, our site has gotten better,
we've done more and more fulﬁllment services, which has made it easier for sellers.
Our stores are better, which gets us more customers than they shop more online, it's
really integrated. Which is what we want. That's exactly the business model that I
think diﬀerentiates us over time.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yeah. So, the angle which I'm sure you've already sense of why it's important is, at
some point you did discuss that the e-commerce as a channel was losing money and
certain companies trade a profoundly diﬀerent in higher multiples when they cross
that threshold from losing money to making money. And part of the narrative has
been investing in the marketplace in the long tail of goods. And so, through the
extent that the market can track Walmart's progress, I think it could be additive to
your and that, that would be the angle if it's positive about it that way.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
No. And yeah, and I understand that and, for us it's always going to be a balance of
how do we show investors enough data points that you see, that you can connect
the dots like we do internally. But doing in a way that doesn't disadvantage us
competitively, that's the balance. In February, we really started talking about this new
business model, the omni-channel model and the new business initiatives, and we
know over time, we're going to need to talk about some of those things. So,
investors can see the beneﬁt of that. But I think even if we didn't split, if we didn't
talk about any of that, you're going to see it in the top line and the bottom line.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Okay. Fair enough. Just a reminder, there nothing is in the queue. So, but if people
have questions, feel free. So, we have about 15 minutes.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}

A - Brett Biggs{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
All right. Give me a hard time on our last one. It's all good. But this is a good
transition to alternative proﬁt and I have a laundry list. Some of which you may not
include as alternative, but I think it would be helpful and this could occupy our last 15
minutes. So, ﬁrst Walmart Connect, second Fintech, third Health, fourth, GoLocal. I
mean you keep us busy. I have the marketplace and Walmart Plus, so that was ﬁve
and six. So, I think the bigger question Brett is, how should we think about how
you're prioritizing those? I'm not sure you'd classify them all as alternative, but how
do you think about?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
They're all businesses that were growing more rapidly. And that for the most part all
have higher margin characteristics and you would see in pure retail. So, I think I think
you can connect them that way. They're all -- the good thing is that, I think you've got
the list right. And so, it's not a 100 things, it's four, ﬁve, six, that we want to focus. So, I
feel like that's a good number for us to be able to really put resources against. And
you now going into some like this, there's going to be some of this that goes
incredibly well, better than we would have thought. There will be some things that
won't work out quite like we want. And as we go through these, we'll learn things
that will lead to other businesses, that we want to go into. I think, GoLocal is a great
example of that. And logistics is always been a core competence -- core competency
for us. And the ability now to potentially turn that into a business, makes total sense.
There'll be other things like that, that happen over the next two, three, four, ﬁve years
that will be on the listed on, on that aren't on the list today. And there'll be some that
maybe come oﬀ the list over time. But I really doubt something comes oﬀ the list.
As I look at these and our ability to scale in all of these areas, we have the people in
place, we have the capital that's going to be committed to these businesses. I'm on
the JB, Fintech board as with Ribbit, who's a phenomenal partner with great people
leading that business. Each one of these has big upside. There are meaningful
interest, and investors up there needs to be meaningful, we can't do things that
don't move the needle. All of these move the needle. That's why I'm excited about
them.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
You got the ﬂywheel of doing both, even before some of these were hatched. So,
U.S. EBIT today, I thinks sits around $22 billion and I'm just throwing it in the U.S. for a
second. Why shouldn't that ﬂywheel spend quicker, meaning unless you have so
much to reinvest back from these initiatives but between Connect and we have an
estimate of what we think it can somewhat we have a sense of Fintech and Walmart
Plus. I mean, there's some tangible EBIT dollar pies here. Why couldn't $21 billion be
$30 billion in four years from now?

A - Brett Biggs{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
I mean, I'm basically saying why can't you signiﬁcantly accelerate the EBIT growth of
the U.S. enterprise?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, there's -- if you look at some of these there's opportunities to do that.
There's some that will invest back into, as that happens. We want to keep taking
market share, which mid to long-term is deﬁnitely the right thing to do. So, it gets
back to this balance of how much do you, you drop the bottom line? How much do
you keep investing back in the business? And I think over time, Simeon, that's those
are decisions that will make that investors -- will certainly understand how investors
look at that as we go through that process. But there are some, some of these
businesses that can certainly scale more quickly than some others. Some could scale
pretty quickly.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
To zoom in on a couple, Connect. It seems like the progress is happening at a
quicker pace. Do you -- Okay and if you agree does the goal of what I think you said,
maybe reaching it as a top 10 advertiser, does that happen quicker or is that is -- can
you be a top ﬁve?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I think both of those things are possible. Again, we'll balance out, and it goes back
again to -- it's really diﬃcult to look at these things on their own. As you get a look at
Connect and say that was my only business, could I just plow into its skeleton
quickly? Yes. But at the same time, I can't look at it as now, because I got to look and
make sure that my customer experience is good. My advertising experience is good,
that I'm getting the tools that I need for them, to not just for this year, but for three
years from now to make that work. But I keep my site uncluttered, to make sure the
customers continue to trust me that I'm giving them the best product
recommendation for them, not necessarily what a supplier wants. All of those things
have to go at the same time, to make the brand work.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
That's helpful. We do have a question from the webcast, related to e-commerce. Can
you give us a sense of how 3P is doing? Any sense, can you share what percentage
of e-commerce, or what percentage of the business it is, and what is holding the
business back at this point? And then there's a follow-up, which I'll ask after this.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. 3P is one of those businesses, that I do think it is accelerating. It can continue
to accelerate. We added I think, 20 million items in the third quarter on marketplace.

A - Brett Biggsgreat from a customer perspective, because they just more and more they know and
then come to Walmart, get what they need, whether it's 1P or 3P, that's the most
important part of marketplace. So, it is accelerating. As we get the tools in a better
place, which is work that's being accelerated, then it accelerate even further. We
don't really have a goal of what the penetration of 3P should be higher than it is
today. And we want it to be whatever natural place that goes with our customers, we
want it to be probably as high as it can be, as far as a penetration of e-commerce.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And maybe related and to this follow-up is, I guess you wouldn't have a pure market
share goal though within 3P or in GM?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
No. Because it's so category based. You'd have to look at each category separately,
but more market share. We've been very successful in growing market share, as you
know food consumables over time and we have just as aggressive goals for general
merchandised categories.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Can you share how much market share you gained or shifted in grocery and maybe
in general merchandise?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. It's not something that we've shared, but it's increased.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Fair enough. On this topic of marketplace, we thought that part of what's holding
back Walmart Plus from being even a more like-for-like competitor with the other big
subscription model out there, was having that the marketplace fully ready with a
long tail of goods and you're investing towards that. Is that a fair observation?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. Again, it is fact, this price sounds like I'm answering all your questions with the
same answer, but it's kind of where we are. It's the ﬂywheel, it's the ecosystem, each
part feeds the other one. And Walmart Plus is a really important part of several
pieces of our strategy. It's not the only important piece, but is an important piece of
strategy on delivery and market share and delivery. It impacts what business we have
in e-commerce, 3P. Just that it all impacts the other pieces of the business.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Yeah. We have another question from the audience. I'll read it and I think I can
paraphrase, Brett.

{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
So, with logistics being so important to Walmart, how do you think about the
relationship with your suppliers? And then, incorporating this in with the historical
buyer role in the company, is there a point in time where you're being eﬃcient with
the supply chain and bringing products to Walmart, it matter as much as the buyer
decision, meaning does eﬃcient transportation of the product from the supplier to
Walmart enter into a buyer's decision, thinking that people will favor you even more,
because you can bring a product to market quicker?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
It should. I mean, if you're a supplier and we can get the product more eﬃciently the
store to where it gets sold. Yeah, I deﬁnitely should enter into the equation and a
buyer -- part of a buyer's decision is how quickly can I get it? Are you going to keep
me in stock? That's really important. And particularly today, are you going to keep
me in stock. But with the growth rates that we're -- that we have today and where I
think will go on the future, I would think that would be very attractive to suppliers.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
May I have it back to the alternative revenue for a second? See if I can put them
(inaudible) Even Fintech could be a bigger proﬁt pool than Connect?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I don't know how to put those into context. And I -- we need them both to be bigger.
I don't -- FinTech is, it's a very broad deﬁnition. And so, there's a lot of things that can
go into that space, which is why I like it. I enjoy being on the board. There's a lot of
white space still there. So, it's hard to measure that, but we want both of them, be as
big as they can be.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
And to clarify Brett, I think what you mean by that FinTech is that, yes, there are direct
revenue attributes in terms of selling someone ﬁnancial service and have them
reducing interchange. But enhancing the share from that customer being more
engaged on your platform that's not to be able to measure.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. And it's -- but that space and when you start bringing in really talented people
and you start putting them against big challenges, there's a lot of times things come
out of that space. It's not directly related to what you're doing speciﬁcally in ﬁnancial
services even. So, I just the team we've got assembled there and the partner we have
there, there's a lot of opportunity there.

Q - Simeon Ari GutmanOkay. One quick one on GoLocal and then I'll mention Flipkart, because I think it'd
be a shameful not to have to mention Flipkart. On GoLocal you jump started it by
partnering with a major retailer who we're speaking. I guess, was that a surprise and
are there more of these and you're becoming in a way, you have a third-party
marketplace, a fulﬁllment network to fulﬁll the third-party marketplace without
creating a long tail yet. The long tail exists. Now, you're actually connecting the dots.
So, is there another way to look at GoLocal? And then, could that be as competitive
as Connect or even a FinTech is for proﬁt dollars over time?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. GoLocal is really interesting and it's really again is taking a core competency
and turning it into a business. Delivery as a service, or whatever you want to call it.
So, I think that deﬁnitely you had it on your list and I think it's fair that you have that
on your list of potential growing accelerating businesses for us.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Fair enough. So, moving to Flipkart, Brett, I think you'll know everything I'll ask about
it. So, maybe I'll let you just answer, what I'm going to ask timing, and when is the
right time is the business performing the way that you expect it to be?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yeah. I said the business is performing almost exactly like we thought it would.
Growth is good. It's certainly one more path to proﬁtability. We expect that or we
wouldn't have gotten into the business. We're going to continue to invest and take
opportunities to grow that business, not just in retail, but other areas from payers is
part of that. An IPO is still very much in the cards for that business and everything
else, it's timing. It's is the business, exactly where you want it at the market ride, all
those things have to ﬁgure in to where, what you do with an IPO. But an IPO and
letting our associates have a piece of the business, having to be in a local business in
India, all those things are important to us, longer term, and I don't -- nothing about
that has changed.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Okay. Last question, I'll make it two parts, speed dating.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
That's a damn bender trick to do that.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
I learned from the best. The two parts just so we can get international in Sam's and
on international portfolio rationalization, is it in the later innings? Is it still middle
Innings? And then on Sam's, the club channel seems to be steamrolling broadly, I
could even be taking share from core Walmart, I'm not sure I would say that, but
could that be a case and what do you think about that interplay going forward?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-02

So, I'll start with Sam's. Sam's is just killing it. Again, (inaudible) tobacco 31%, 32% to
your stacks. It's -- that's a big business to be a third bigger over two years. They have
great momentum. I love what they're doing. Memberships are phenomena. The Club
Channel is doing well, but Sam's is really, really doing well. And if I'm a Walmart
shareholder, I want Sam's and Walmart to both do well. So, it's like picking your
favorite child. I like Walmart and Sam's. On international, you may made a lot of
moves in the last couple of years on the portfolio. I think the markets were in today
makes sense. Particularly the big markets Mexico, Canada, India, China are all great.
Chile's had a great year. South Africa has been a little more challenge, because of
what's going on with COVID there. But I think all of our markets, they all make sense
right now.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Okay. Well, we're out of time, Brett. Appreciate you taking this time. I hope to be part
of all the toasting and roasting over the next year. But to those who joined us, thanks
