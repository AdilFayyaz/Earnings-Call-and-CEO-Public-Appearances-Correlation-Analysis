(Question And Answer)
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
I usually like to start the ﬁreside chats with more of a longer-term strategic question,
but we're sort of less than two weeks removed from your quarterly earnings. And I
think there's still some unanswered questions that investors have on the October
quarter that might be helpful to go through initially before going into some longer-
term questions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-30

Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette KressThe ﬁrst is really on the gaming side where you're currently in the midst of an
extremely strong sort of product cycle with the RTX 30 Series, up almost 40%
sequentially, up almost 40% year-over-year. Couple of things I'd like to ask. You
talked about sort of there being supply constraints. And you mentioned it wasn't just
your own silicon. I'd be curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the extent of
those supply constraints? And importantly, when you think supply will catch up with
demand?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. So in Q3, a very busy Q3 for us, really exciting for
us as we continued our overall Ampere architecture. We took that opportunity to
take our Ampere architecture to GeForce and produced our GeForce 30 Series cards
for the market. Well, they came out and we would characterize the launch and what
we were seeing as overwhelming demand. That demand for GeForce for gamers is
very strong for both laptops, for desktops, but the channel remains lean. We do have
supply constraint and our supply constraints do expand past what we are seeing in
terms of wafers of silicon, but yes, some constraints on substrates and components.
We continue to work during the quarter on our supply and we believe though that
demand will probably exceed supply in Q4 for overall gaming. We do expect it
probably to take a couple months for it to catch up to demand, but at this time, it's
really diﬃcult for us to quantify. So we stay focused on trying to get our cards to the
market for this very important holiday season, and each day things continue to
improve, but towards the end of the quarter, we'll be able to provide some more
information.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Colette, you guided the January quarter for gaming up sequentially, now that
includes an extra week. So despite some of these supply constraints, you are
expecting a strong January. I know you only guide one quarter out, but as we look
forward into the April quarter, I'm just kind of curious, you've got the headwind of
losing that week from January to April, but you also have supply coming online. And
I think more importantly, you continue to introduce the RTX 30 Series down the stat,
you'll have more notebook, you'll just have more general product availability. April
tends to be a seasonally down quarter to begin with for gaming. How should we be
thinking about that this year?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So I think you highlighted a lot of the diﬀerent factors that we take into
consideration each year, and the overall seasonality that is sometimes there for
gaming. Our gaming business is broken down into three major components, which
is that desktop, which is the notebooks and the overall consoles, each of them
having diﬀerent characteristics as it goes through seasonality. We've also discussed
that we have often seen in our strongest overall demand focus around the holidays.
But keep in mind, the holidays in terms of what we're referring to, are holidays that
start as early as October and move into the new year through to the overall Chinese
New Year, so it's an important piece.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 11Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette Kress
Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette KressBut I think there's very important statement that you made there, that is correct. We
are ramping RTX 30 Series and we're just starting. So we're in the brand-new era of
an amazing overall architecture and a performance leap that is larger than any other
performance leap that we have done. And the overall reviews and reception of our
launch has been quite strong. So we're going to watch in terms of how we see
between Q4 and Q1 transition. It has normally been sequentially down. That extra
week in Q4 should have, could have enhanced that overall decline. But we're just
going to have to see where demand is once we get the supply more intact.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Colette, I almost hate to ask the next question, but I'm getting asked with more
frequency than I would have thought. With Bitcoin almost back to kind of peak levels
in calendar year '18, I'm getting asked the question of whether or not we should be
at all concerned that some of the strength -- excuse me, in the gaming business was
Bitcoin crypto-related. And any comments you can make on that especially in lieu of
some of the channel issues you had back in calendar year '18?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Our focus in terms of really understanding our channel over the last couple of
years post-crypto has continued to be a focus of ours and enhancements to really
understanding both levels in the channel and in terms of real-time or is close to real-
time information that we can get in terms of how the overall channel is doing. On
your crypto question, we have for some interest from the channel, but nobody is
aware of any real demand at this time for crypto.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
That's helpful. The other near-term question from the October quarter was just on
the data center business. I think you did an excellent job kind of explaining on the
call and afterwards the inﬂuence of Mellanox in October and then going into
January. And I think one of the concerns that I've heard post the conference call is,
how should we think about the core growth rate of the core data center business. I
mean, clearly you're going through some product ramps there as well, the A100 is
ramping up, the B100 is ramping down, but you've seen growth rates on a year-over-
year basis decelerate from an unsustainably high 200% plus to now a very
respectable 40%. But if you kind of model conservatively sequentially from here,
you're very quickly getting down to sort of maybe that 20% year-over-year growth.
How do we think about kind of normalized year-over-year growth in data center and
what impact might the macro be having on the data center business today?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So for the rest of the group, let me try and summarize a little bit more in terms of
what we experienced in Q3 and how we overall guided Q4. Our overall Q3 results in
data center yet again another record level, not only a record level in terms of NVIDIA
compute, but an overall record level in terms of Mellanox. We had expected our
overall sequential increase to stem primarily from our NVIDIA core compute, but we
also saw strong growth in terms of Mellanox between Q2 and Q3, largely due to a
China OEM and purchases that we didn't feel would repeat in overall Q4.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette KressSo the record levels of Mellanox you couldn't be more pleased with our
performance in the ﬁrst couple of weeks, ﬁrst couple of quarters here at NVIDIA.
They have done tremendous. And we've been even excited in terms of all of our
integration eﬀorts in terms of working on future products together.
So our compute business, as we think about NVIDIA compute, continues to ramp
with overall A100. So A100 started out several quarters ago in terms of launching to
our hyper-scales around the world and many of our hyperscales that is speed-of-
light quickness in terms of creating overall cloud instances with the overall A100,
more and more adoption worldwide across all of those clouds as they create these
cloud instances.
Q3 was the quarter for us to also create the opportunity to now expand to our server
OEMs, our server OEMs that are building for the overall enterprises, building for
industries and serving overall edge computing. That also came with the release of
DGXs, DGX SuperPODs that also support such an important part of these industries.
We are pleased with both the adoption and the overall scale that we are getting with
overall A100. It's been several years since we launched overall V100.
Our breadth and depth of our customer base has expanded signiﬁcantly, not only in
terms of both our understanding of accelerated computing and AI, but our focus in
terms of providing software capabilities for them to connect these platforms to their
applications. We're able to serve so many more industries than what we had just a
couple of years ago and we will continue to build on that investment to do so.
So as we move from Q3 to Q4, we still expect a sequential increase in NVIDIA
compute. As we ramp the A100, Mellanox will be down, but they had such an
amazing strong quarter in Q3. So as we move forward, we're still in these early days
of A100, but most importantly, we're in the early days of AI and accelerated
computing.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Well, Colette, to your guys' credit, you've kind of leaned forward on the product
cycles that are driving your data center business, but it's got to -- if you look at the
macro this year and the fact that enterprise went to work from home mode, that had
to had some sort of impact on the business, especially in the second-half. Now you
look at server demand in the enterprise and it's down over 40% year-over-year. Is
there sort of a rebound that we should expect in core enterprise as we get into next
year and the vaccine gets more widely distributed?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, it's a really good question that says COVID and the pandemic had pluses and
minuses and there are companies that have beneﬁtted, there're companies that had
really struggled. But I think it's important to understand some of those pieces and
how that inﬂuenced such as the data center and such as the enterprise.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette KressSo if you look in terms of our ProViz business, there's an example that says, the
overall ProViz business was purchasing from our overall OEMs.At the initial onset of
the pandemic, a real struggle to both get overall components and building through
some of the challenges of the overall supply ecosystem to build that. But
additionally, how do you support from the work from home?
What we saw in Q3, which is really interesting with ProViz as we started to see that
sequential increase and then returning back super strong results in terms of our
workstations and our mobile workstations, as the OEMs and enterprise found a way
to both procure and build for this very important market as they are working from
home. And so, we do believe that's coming back up.
Now when you think about in the data center and you think about the enterprises,
we're not general purpose overall enterprise purchasing. We are focused on
accelerated in AI, and we are in those initial years as they build out those workloads
to do. But it has been an important area for many companies that have to rethink
about where their investments are, they continue to invest in that overall AI.
The cloud has been a very important part of them as they have been working from
home to use the overall cloud to continue their work and expanding to accelerated
and AI and you see that in our results. But I do believe the overall business is
continuing to work through some of the challenges with the pandemic and ﬁnd ways
to reach the overall enterprises and we hope that this will get better in the quarters
to come.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Colette, that's a great summary of some of the near-term issues. Maybe I can step
back now and ask a longer-term, more open-ended question. I mean, NVIDIA has
always had an extremely rich history of parallel compute. You initially leveraged that
into the gaming market. There were a lot of hard work. You brought that to HPC and
then broader data center. But you've just been a silicon company. There has been a
strong software element to your oﬀering now with the acquisition of Mellanox and
the proposed acquisition of Arm, you're broadening out even further. Maybe you
can spend a few minutes and just step back and reset kind of what you think the
value proposition NVIDIA oﬀers to the investment community? What's the kind of the
overarching strategy here?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. I think you've watched so much of our transformation over the last decade or
even decade and longer. And that transformation has really been about moving
away from just a chip company focused on gaming. We have moved to become an
overall computing company, a computing company that is not focused on the history
of computing, but the future of computing and the future of accelerated computing,
which will be with us for many decades going forward.
In order to scale to that accelerated computing and the use of overall AI, it required
a full stack approach to how we approach this overall market, meaning, we just are
still thinking about the silicon, thinking about the best performance that you can getFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 11Q - John Pitzerfor the overall hardware, but we are also focused on systems and software, because
that full stack really diﬀerentiates us and is what is going to be necessary to achieve
this transformation to accelerated computing as we go forward.
The overall work of just focusing on just our hardware performance, but not
addressing the need for stitching together the software and, in many cases, easing
the adoption by providing an end-to-end system that all they have to do is plug in
for these overall markets. We've been able, with our full entire staﬀ, to rapidly
expand the ecosystem faster than we've ever done in the past. We have 2.3 million
developers. We have more than 1,800 GPU-accelerated applications at this time and
we have received more than 6 million CUDA downloads alone in 2020.
So a feat of a lot of work over a full generation, but we still have a lot of new things to
address for these markets. Our platforms touch broad markets. Our platforms are
not built speciﬁcally for one overall application, but build often for markets that are
in their early days or things that we think will be strong and growing markets into the
future. We've created a platform for RTX. Our RTX platform is like no other ray
tracing platform that is out there. It is multi-year in its making and it also includes AI.
So to think about our overall real-time ray tracing but also putting AI into the hands
of ray tracing going forward is something that no others have done, but we take that
platform approach also to our workstations, to our data center and to automotive,
which are with our HGX platforms, with our EGX edge platforms as well as our AGX
platforms or autonomous platforms. Each and every single one of these platforms
begins with a uniﬁed architecture and addressing the overall end market with the
most important piece, which is that software.
We have written so much software speciﬁc for these industries. You've seen
diﬀerences in software that help people bring AI. We can talk about Clara, we can
talk about Jarvis, Mervin, the many other things that we do for the metropolis for
overall drive for cars. We have at this point as equal amount of software as we
hardware engineering focusing on these markets. So when you step back and look
at what our future entails, now with Mellanox, it is focused on end-to-end computing,
computing that doesn't start with when the overall data reaches the overall GPU, but
starts when you want to compute the data. So we're thinking about everything from
the interconnects to the DPU, to the overall GPU performance as well, all of those will
matter long-term when we think about accelerated computing.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Well, Collette, maybe just spend a little more time talking about the application
framework. You talked about Clara, DRIVE, Jarvis, Isaac, Merlin, Metropolis; I mean all
these software stacks that you're building. Historically, I've always viewed NVIDIA as
the chip company that's been able to capture the most value in the ecosystem that
goes after. You look at your core gaming growth, it's been 30% annual growth, your
compound annual growth over the last ﬁve years. What's amazing about that is half
has been ASPs which is to me a value capture. Can you talk a little bit about that
application framework and maybe as you discuss, it brings speciﬁcally into the
conversation the announcement you made with Mercedes-Benz earlier this year?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-30

Page 7 of 11A - Colette Kress
Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, so when you think about our value and why people continue to come back to
NVIDIA from a value is A, that overall development community. The developers want
to work where other developers aren't working, meaning they can now leverage the
work that developers have built as well as the work in terms of NVIDIA has done in
terms of expanding that ecosystem. Our work comes to linking together the overall
connectivity all the way down to the hardware, to the system software, to the overall
frameworks right up to get to the overall application and now our customers and
ecosystem knows that okay.
So building upon that has really now been to continue to stay with NVIDIA and know
that NVIDIA will continue to innovate. That is why people buy our overall systems
and their overall price points are really about the innovation and the software that is
incorporated. We have never been a situation of a manufacturing cost plus because
there is so much software in the ecosystem and so much overall software that comes
with each and every single one of our platforms that we do.
So that takes us to the important part where you talk about our overall Daimler
Mercedes, overall investment that we are making. Daimler has come out and has
endorsed our full end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles. In the future, their
entire ﬂeet of AV will be harmonized on the NVIDIA drive platform from the
hardware that we will provide them, but also we will maintain a share of the software
that they realize, a way that you can kind of think about this is when you are
purchasing an AV card and if you want that overall AV package, that AV package
comes in the high thousands of dollars that will be split between Daimler and overall
NVIDIA. Really a transformation in the way that the OEM manufacturers think about
how they are going to build a strategy of AV and partnership with NVIDIA here. We
couldn't be more excited about this agreement, the investment that Daimler has
made in us and it will really be the pass for the industry as a whole in terms of how
they think about building out AV.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Colette, as you start to run numbers on the Mercedes deal, it's actually not diﬃcult
over a kind of 10-year useful life of a car to make an argument that your recurring
software revenue could be as large as the initial system sale? Are we thinking about
that the right way, one? And two, as you embark on this strategy, we think ﬁve, six,
seven years out, how much of the revenue in your business do you think is going to
be recurring in nature?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, it's a really good way to analyze that. We're not talking about the cost of the
overall hardware and the chip. We are really talking about keeping the overall
software capabilities up to speed and there is going to be new updates all the way
through the ownership of that car. So you're correct, that's a long-term overall
revenue stream that easily with overall Daimler will reach in terms of in the billions

Q - John PitzerSo we're really pleased with such a great opportunity to really build out our
automotive business. You'd say how much will this be as a percentage of our
automotive business going forward? It may be the most material part of our
automotive business along with thinking about other ways that we will also serve that
market with our hardware platforms as well, but in the future, this has been our
strategy. It's a long-term strategy but this is a really good case of how the strategy is
coming to (inaudible).
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
And to be clear Colette, autos is the ﬁrst tangible example of revenue sharing
through software, but we can assume that your application framework will provide
other opportunities in other industries and as you guys talk about I believe now $60
billion AI TAM with the addition of Mellanox, this seems to me to be above and
beyond that channel, am I thinking about it the right way?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
This TAM for overall automotive, we have been talking about it and an expansion.
You asked in terms of does this overall software, can it extend to our other
platforms? Absolutely could. Do we have anything speciﬁc now or do we have things
that we may be working on, absolutely, but there is a great opportunity for those that
don't want to take care about software themselves is something that NVIDIA helps
them with and has a software license with them. So we're pleased of where this
broadens people's thinking in the enterprise and otherwise industries on how they
can leverage our software in an ease of deployment available accelerated
computing.
This has expanded our overall TAM, overall as we think about the expansion of what
we did with bringing in overall Mellanox into our overall business. It allowed us to
not just focus on accelerated computing surrounding our GPU, but a focus of also
thinking about the interconnects and the importance of those full systems. So we're
pleased in terms of the expansion that are DC TAM. If we look out to 2024, it's
probably close to $100 billion now with a inclusion of overall Mellanox that can still
be broken down to some of the key components where our hyper sales will still be
an important part, also key customers for our Mellanox business and will probably
be about $45 billion of that overall $100 billion TAM.
Then if we move into our enterprises, our enterprises is probably the next key
component of that TAM and it has expanded to be probably about $30 billion with
the introduction of Mellanox in there. And then additionally, our Edge AI position of
about $15 billion and high performance computing is also a key component for both
Mellanox as well as us and is about $10 billion.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
But I think you guys done a good job over the last several years debunking the myth
that you're very strong in machine learning and training, but not that strong in
inference. Can you talk a little bit about the positioning an inference? And as you
think about augmenting your silicon with software, how important does that become
as an incremental mode for competition?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11A - Colette Kress
Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette Kress{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, so we did. We were very open in terms of indicating that we were going to
move to take a good look at overall inferencing and how we could even accelerate
the work that we're doing on inferencing. Inferencing was a CPU market, inferencing
at that stage was probably a simplistic overall inferencing market that focused on low
end binary types of inferencing that needed to be done. But, what we have seen
over the last couple of years has really endorsed why use of a GPU for inferencing is
very key.
One, the overall complexity of inferencing, the overall approach of overall training to
deal with natural language processing and the focus on conversational AI and
recommenders has really expanded this inferencing market and that overall
complexity is a multi-stage inferencing problem. So over this period of time, we have
seen more and more focus to the programmability of the GPU, the performance of
the GPU to solve some of these very diﬃcult overall inferencing examples that we
are talking about. What we've seen in just this last quarter of Q3, our key for speciﬁc
inferencing product continues to reach record levels within the quarter.
We came out with the A100, and remember the A100 is a unique overall architecture
that allows you to do -- not have to decide whether or not it was going to be used for
training or used for inferencing. You could do both or you could do all of one or all
of the other. This overall ﬂexibility aided both the cloud providers as well as for
internal use as they began the training and also see that continues to move to overall
inferencing. We are now seeing that the amount of inferencing on GPUs in the cloud
has exceeded the overall compute capacity of CPUs, and that is just over a short
amount of period of time. We're pleased with the adoption. We're pleased in terms
of people seeing how important this area will be for accelerated computing going
forward.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
Colette, I feel like I could talk to you for another hour-and-a-half and still not hit all
the issues. We're coming up to the end of our time here, but I thought I'd end with
just one question around the ﬁnancials. You're one of the few companies that I cover
that doesn't have a target gross and op margin out there. I'm wondering, if you can
talk a little bit about some of the near-term and longer-term inﬂuences on gross
margin and op margin. Speciﬁcally, gross margin, how do we think about product
launches and the maturation of sort of costs and margins over time. How do we think
about software becoming a bigger part of the mix and what that should mean for
gross margin? And then on op margins, how do we think about kind of your desire
to want to accelerate some of these opportunities with more R&D, with more SG&A
versus being able to put up very healthy operating margins?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So let's focus on gross margin ﬁrst. So our gross margins really simply the
number one thing we want you to think about is our gross margins are most
inﬂuenced by mix and most inﬂuenced by more software. What I mean is the
absence of the software cost helps our gross margins, because the software cost isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-11-30
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 11Q - John Pitzer
A - Colette Kressdown in R&D. And so, people are purchasing our platforms for their full capabilities
in aiding them with their overall applications and we beneﬁt from a gross margin.
But there are many of our platforms that are not fully software-rich that we still say. So
that's why we have a mix and that mix becomes one of the largest drivers of our
gross margins.
The faster growing business with higher gross margins inﬂuences an uptick of our
overall gross margin in total. For this last quarter, we saw a surge moving and strong
growth in gaming, that strong growth in gaming moving from Q3 to Q4. We have
very strong margins, but they'll be relatively ﬂat over that period of time. There have
been times when our data center gross margins and the growth and the rapid
growth in our data center has improved our overall company gross margins.
When we focus on our -- both our launches and our overall initial onset of our
products per architecture, yes, our gross margins can improve over time. They start
oﬀ quite healthy and we even get better, because that's the type of company that we
are, that we're going to focus on making them great over there. So you'll see that
usually over a couple of quarters before they get into their long-term preferred
overall gross margin.
But now let's focus on operating margin, that's correct. We don't have an overall
long-term goal on operating margin, but we think about both our shareholders
carefully, and we think about our investments carefully. We make our investments in
some of the most largest growing markets that we have in front of us and sit down
carefully to ﬁgure out how to make those investments and many of the things that
you see us producing today began 5 to 10 years ago, and so it's a long haul for us to
make those decisions on investments and in thinking through how large those
overall markets will be.
What you can count on us is giving you a framework as we begin a new year on
about how much we're going to spend, because you know what, it's what we can
control. What we can't control is the market of overall demand. But we can come
through and tell you, we're going to spend this much and we believe this will be the
right amount of investment for these large things going forward. And historically, this
has proven to be working for us. So, I think we're going to continue this path on
investing, investing right and producing that shareholder value and that overall
leverage that we have done with the expansion of the operating margins.
{BIO 1541792 <GO>}
That's great. We've come up to the end of the ﬁreside chat, but Colette, I want to
thank you for participating again and wish you, your immediate family and your
extended family a safe and healthy rest of 2020. It's been a very trying year and
