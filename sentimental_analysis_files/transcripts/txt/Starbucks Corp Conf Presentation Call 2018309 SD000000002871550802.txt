Good morning, everyone. It's John Ivankoe from JPMorgan, restaurant analyst here.
It's certainly a pleasure to be headlining this event. And starting oﬀ Friday morning
for us, the Starbucks Corporation.
With the company today is their EVP and CFO, Scott Maw. Also, joining them are
their VP of Investor Relations, Tom Shaw; and Director of Investor Relations, Durga
Doraisamy.
So welcome all. Thank you. So much for coming.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And we'd really like to talk about a number of diﬀerent, I think, very topical initiatives
for the company. And I think what's very interesting is continued growth of My
Starbucks Rewards members and continued conversion of non-MSR members into
active MSR members. And just the overall opportunity that you have and why you're
excited about converting some of the 75 million customers that you have to the 15
million active My Starbucks Reward customers that you have.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. Great question. First of all. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for having us,
John. What I would say, is what we've driven over the past several years is signiﬁcant
growth. And over the last couple of years, almost all of our same-store sales growth
from those customers that we have digital relationships with. And those are in our
Starbucks Rewards program. And last quarter, those grew, I think, at 11%, a little over 1
million that we added. They're growing their spending rate somewhere betweenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09

Page 2 of 15mid; to high single digit. So you're getting both a revenue per customer growth and
a number of customer growth. And I think that continues to be a big part of our
growth as we look over the next year or 2 and beyond just because if you think
about where we are in personalization, most of that growth is coming from
personalization. But we've really only been capturing spend data and learning about
spend data for a couple of years now. So we're pretty early on in the optimization of
that process.
And we -- so we set a target out there sort of be in that mid-single-digit, hopefully,
every quarter on spend growth and at least double-digit on number of member
growth. And we've got a number of things that we're doing to bring customers in.
And we feel really good about that as really a long-term growth driver. What's a little
bit new and we've been talking about recently. And people have been asking about
recently, is we've got 75 million people coming through our doors each month, 15
million in the rewards program. What about that other 60 million? We know you'll
convert 1 million or 2 million every year into Starbucks Rewards. But what can you do
beyond that?
So we've talked about -- and the big reason people don't join the rewards program
is twofold. Number one, they don't know about the beneﬁts of the program. We've
done a lot of customer work on this. So they don't understand that when they
engage with Starbucks and they bring their spend through the program, they
basically get a 7% to 8% discount rate. That's one of the best loyalty programs out
there. I'm obviously a numbers guy. So I know what credit cards do and what airlines
do, hotels. And that 7% to 8% rate is really a big incentive. We can oﬀer that because
of the nature of preloading a card, because of the nature of our product and the
margin that we have, because of the frequency of customers, because of the
incrementality we've been driving with one-to-one personalization.
And so we've got to ﬁnd a way to continue to get people to know about the
program more. We're doing more things in store. We're doing more things as we
can with digital marketing. But the real opportunity -- and then, the second reason is
they don't want to preload a card. So one of the reasons that program is so, as you
know. So beneﬁcial for customers, is they preload a card, which has all sorts of
beneﬁts. Psychological beneﬁts, that they know they have money loaded and banks
and companies have been talking for years about when you put your money with
someone and people know they prepaid it, you use that more often. And we see
that. There's the beneﬁt we get from ﬂow, load or interchange and all that stuﬀ. So
that's the core program. But we know those 2 facts are hurdles for customers.
And so what we're starting to do is, for the ﬁrst time, capture digital relationships so
that we can use digital marketing assets, including personalization at the end of the
day, to get non-Starbucks Rewards members or we like to say customers outside of
the rewards program just so it's a positive. So what are those things? So I mentioned
3 things recently. 2 of them are either running or planned. And one of them we're
debating and could come.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09

Page 3 of 15Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Scott Harlan MawThe ﬁrst one is opening up Mobile Order & Pay to everyone. So it's long been a bit
of a frustration for customers that don't want to join a rewards program or unaware
that they can't order ahead. Starting, we think, by the end of March now, we'll be
fully rolled out where everyone that downloads the app will be able to use Mobile
Order & Pay. So we sort of opened up that channel. And it is a channel like drive-
through or POS to all customers. There's no friction of having to be in the rewards
program. So as we do that, obviously, we have the ability to capture their email
address, to capture mobile phone information. And begin to market to them directly.
The second thing that we've done is we are doubling down on, you mentioned this,
converting lapsed members. So we have 15 million, 90-day active members, pretty
narrow active window. I think it's the right thing. But we have millions of what we call
lapsed active or inactive members that are 91-plus days. And we've been marketing
to those folks. And they've been a source of growth in the Starbucks Reward
program, sort of reigniting them that Matt Ryan and the team have a number of
things. And we're going to reach a little bit more on the oﬀers that we give to them
because we've got the math to show that it pays oﬀ to get them to come from
inactive and back into active. So those are the ﬁrst 2 things.
Then, the one that we're talking about, I'll call it, we're researching, although it's a
little more than researching, is we call Wi-Fi sign up in our store. So you come into
our stores, you give us your email, then every time you come in, you're automatically
connected to Wi-Fi. You don't have to accept and connect. It's convenient for
customers and it allows us to have a chance, again, to email market. You add all
those things up. And we said on the most recent call, we think we can have several
million of these non-SR digital relationships. It's not going to be a revenue driver this
year. As we get into and through next year, we'll be able to start understanding what
their spend patterns are. And then, start marketing to them directly. And they should,
as we get through '19 and beyond, start to contribute to comps. And as you know, to
date, that group really is not, is 0, right, in the revenue stream from personalization
with that group today.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And so do you view the Chase opportunity separately from this?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. When I think about Chase, it's really in that core program. It's a way to capture
more Starbucks Rewards program and drive increased activity. And what we've done
with Chase, there are sort of 3 pieces to the agreement. There's obviously an
interchange agreement, which is beneﬁcial as with every credit card that's done with
any retailer. And by the way, the debit card is unique just because debit card rewards
are so unusual. So that piece by itself will drive increased proﬁtability. Chase buys
stars from us. We think we have a chance to market to those customers. We think the
fact that people earn stars when they spend, that will drive more customers into our
stores. So there's some comp impact.
The interchange piece in the ﬁrst few years is actually bigger than the comp piece,
just given the size of our interchange spend. Then, the third piece is really aroundFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09

Page 4 of 15Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Scott Harlan Mawbuilding out the infrastructure to do partnerships. So you'll remember Spotify, Lyft,
The New York Times. Those were wonderful partnerships. It's sort of small. But even
doing those it was highly manual tracking those partnerships. So this is now fully
automated. It took us a little longer than we thought. When I say a little longer, we're
almost 1.5 years past our original date, to be honest. But the big reason of that is,
we've built that out. We now have the ability for customers to earn stars outside of
our stores at diﬀerent rates, burn at diﬀerent rates, all the way from how we market
integrated marketing capabilities all the way back through to something as basic as
the accounting system. So as we look at other partnerships. And there will be more,
we now have the engine to run those on.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
So obviously, driving comps is actually increasing the ability of your stores to serve
more customers. 2 diﬀerent things. One, do you have continued ability to drive the
morning business through a Mobile Order & Pay improvement? I mean, I know that
was an initiative over the past year. I mean, is there a Part 2 to that, perhaps, that you
can talk about? Then, secondly, maybe a little bit separately from throughput if you
want to look at this holistically or not, is the afternoon business. And as you get data
on a weekly basis, if you're understanding the afternoon weakness better in terms of
what the causes are. And by deﬁnition, what some of the solutions may be.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. I'll take those in order. If you look broadly at throughput. And we'll start with that
peak. But I want to talk a little bit about what we've done throughout all dayparts
recently. So you'll remember, a year ago, we struggled with throughput at peak,
particularly in very high-volume MOP stores. And so what we did is, we created
speciﬁc roles and trained those roles that, at peak, all they did was support MOP. So
before, maybe there were 7 or 8 partners working at peak, 3 or 4 of them might be
doing some portion of MOP, fulﬁlling the orders, consolidating orders, doing
handoﬀs.
What we did in 1,500 stores is we -- you trained either 1 or 2 roles if, in some stores,
we trained run role just to do the consolidation. And then, partners would share the
calling and handoﬀ. But in the really high-volume stores, we train someone just to
consolidate orders from the cold case and the oven and the Espresso machine
together and get the ticket ready for it to go and one partner to call. And because
we could make that -- and it's not 4 hours a day, right? It's a couple of hours a day in
some stores. In some stores, it's 1 hour a day.
Whenever that peak is, it allowed us to connect to customers. It was the same person
in the store every morning a lot of times. So you get to know your customer. And it
signiﬁcantly improved the customer beneﬁt. Fewer lost items because the orders
were consolidated by the same person and in order. And so that -- within about
three months, in those 1,500 busiest stores, we saw comps turn. And over the last 3
quarters, they've actually been improving comps faster than the average. And so --
so that's what we've done.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09

Page 5 of 15Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Scott Harlan MawTo your question, is there more that we can do? So about 3 weeks ago, we rolled out
a national update to how we -- how our partners work. We call it Deployment 2.0,
which is a terribly boring name. But that's what we call it. And really, it's based upon
what's happening in the store, how many people are deployed doing what. It's been
about ﬁve years since we've done that. And the way we were doing it before, it was
absolutely weighted for how many transactions you have, of course. The more
transaction you have, the more complex the transactions you have, the more labor
you earn. But what it wasn't really weighted for speciﬁcally was the product mix of
those transactions, deeply product mix store-by-store. And even with those
transactions, it was sort of a lot more on average by store type as opposed to store-
speciﬁc.
So what we have now is each and every store for each and every daypart has not
only how many people they should have staﬀed, which is what we did before. But
where they should be. And so I'll just rattle oﬀ a couple of stats here. If you go back
ﬁve years ago, cold beverages as a % of total beverage revenue in our Starbucks
stores was in the mid-30%s, I think it's 36%, 37%. You roll forward ﬁve years, cold
beverages are now over 50% of beverage sales. And in many stores, they've
doubled, right? You've gone from 30 to 60 or something like that. Warmed breakfast
sandwiches have doubled in many stores, yet the play is based upon an average
number of transactions and the deployment is based upon average from ﬁve years
ago.
So now in stores, they have a high mix of cold. We'll have 2 partners standing back
to back, one at the Espresso machine and one at the cold beverage station working
on those concurrently. Previously, you might have someone at the Espresso machine
turning around and trying to keep the cold beverages. And throughput suﬀers from
that. So that impacts and inﬂuences everything. It's 3 weeks in. The partner response
has been really strong. I'm copied on a lot of that. And so we think we're on to
something. We think we're oﬀ to a good start. And even if the partners are just
happy and nothing else happens, it's going to be a good thing. But I think that is
also part of what will help in the afternoon. So if I could pivot to that.
So in the afternoon. And just to give you guys a little bit of math, we're comping
positively in the morning daypart last quarter. Lunch was ﬂattish and the afternoon...
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And this is traﬃc?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
This is traﬃc. Yes. Yes. And total comp, just because given where the comp that we
reported was a 2%. Lunch was ﬂattish. And the afternoon was quite negative. When
you think about that afternoon and evening daypart, it's a pretty small daypart. And
so you can think about the size of negative comps that we're seeing there. And what
we're seeing in the afternoon, some of that was holiday. But what we're seeing in the
afternoon is an opportunity to make sure our partners are focused on the customer
ﬁrst. It's not that they've taken their eye completely oﬀ the customer. But there are so
many things going on in that afternoon daypart. Again, sort of driven by us aroundFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09

A - Scott Harlan Mawjust cleaning and training and restocking. We just want to make sure that what --
while we're doing that, we're keeping an eye on the customer. And I think with this
new deployment, that helps free that up.
Then, in the afternoon, there's a big opportunity, we think, around product. So as we
move particularly through and into the warmer months, Nitro will be a big part of
that. Cold Brew broadly. But Nitro. We've got lots of things planned around iced teas
that have done well for us. So we think that afternoon daypart, we have the right
products. The challenge, as you know, has been Frappuccino has been declining
faster than those new products have been growing. It's not that those new products
haven't been working. It's just the net of that given the Frappuccino decline has
been slightly negative.
Then, digital becomes a big opportunity for us, both lighting up that new 1 million
member that we have coming in. But also, if you watch your oﬀers carefully a lot of
the sprints that we're doing. And the star dashes and the gamiﬁcation are pointed at
the afternoon. So come in, in the afternoon and bring a friend and do this or come
in, in the afternoon over the next two days and get 100 stars. So all of those things
are pointed at the afternoon. We think we can start to turn that pretty negative
daypart, not -- probably not positive this year. But even if we can get it to be slightly
negative, that'll help comps a ton.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And so let's discuss Frappuccino. I mean, have you talked about what percentage of
your sales it is, for example, in the summer months? Excuse me if I don't remember.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. I think we've talked about, for the full year, it's somewhere in the mid-teens of
our sales mix. And so it's a meaningful category for us.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Right. So -- and presumably, more than that in the summer. So stopping Frappuccino
Happy Hour, I mean, is it your belief, I mean, you no longer have to discount to
someone that was going to buy the Frappuccino anyway, that the discount wasn't
actually driving increased traﬃc. It was just allowing people to spend less that would
buy it. So why isn't this a risk for the business? And I guess, like how much of a -- how
much anxiety is there in the kind of pulling of promotion that you obviously used to
put a decent amount of faith in?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Right. So what's happened with Frappuccino -- you got it exactly right. What's
happened with Frappuccino over the last two years Happy Hour is the halo that we
get after the promotion has gone away. So what used to happen is, we do
Frappuccino Happy Hour. We'd sell a ton of Frappuccino, we'd comp well in that
time period. But what would happen is, people would continue to come in and buy
Frappuccinos and other beverages in the afternoon at a higher rate throughout our
Third Quarter. And so that was really where we paid it back. We didn't actually pay itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Scott Harlan Mawback during the promo. It was wonderful. And -- but it was all of the impact we have
because we were top of mind with people after. That softness is what we've seen in
the last two years. And so ﬁnancially, bottom line standpoint, it really hasn't been
worth it over the last two years and wouldn't be worth it this year.
So but your question is on top line, right? So what we're trying to do this year is sort
of reinvent Happy Hour. And there'll be more details to come. But basically, the gist
of it is using our digital assets to light up Frappuccino Happy Hour for those people
that we think it's truly incremental. Basically count on the fact that the halo's probably
not going to come and try to get real incrementality while we're running Happy
Hour. And we've got another -- a number of other products and promotions during
that time frame. We think we can close some of the gap.
Then, the other thing, I'd just remind you, while Frappuccino Happy Hour early in the
quarter was positive, the back half of the Third Quarter last year was pretty tough.
And so when you think about the comparisons for the full quarter, we get -- we feel
comfortable that we can do at least a 3% as we get through the back half of the year.
So it's all those things. The fact that, yes, we have a little bit bigger comparison. It's
not a big P&L driver. But we've got a number of things around cold beverages,
probably some speciﬁc Frappuccino Happy Hour oﬀers to oﬀset that during Happy
Hour. Then, we think good momentum as we move through the rest of the quarter to
comp strongly. And the thought is get to a 3% for the year.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
So -- let me take that then. Do at least a 3% comp in the back half of the year,
December was 1%. I mean, I think you've commented that January was 1%. A couple
of diﬀerent things here. I mean, let's isolate January between what you think the
impact of the Starbucks Card gift was. Let's isolate the lobby and like the experience
and when that might be lapped. I mean, if it's possible to isolate maybe some
throughput initiatives, I mean, the deployment 2.0 that hadn't been put in yet.
So in other words, why is January an anomaly? Then, secondly, we'll come back and
just understand holiday. I mean, is holiday something that it's always going to be the
low quarter and that's just something that we need to accept and expect? Or does
holiday '18 -- I'm sorry, to be pressing us in now to ﬁscal '19, is there a reason to
believe that we can then take a December quarter back to trend?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes, let's break that down a little because I think it's a fair question that's on people's
mind. So if you think about the -- our First Quarter, the holiday quarter, ﬁrst 6 weeks
or so, half the quarter, we had strong momentum and really a continuation of the 3%
comps or so we've done for a while. So that was in place when we went into holiday.
Pretty much right when we went into holiday, we saw the impact that you're talking
about. And for the back half for the quarter, you can just do the math. It was about a 1
comp. What we said is January is similar just without completely backing myself into
a corner. But obviously, you're in the ballpark. So January was soft as well and looked
quite a bit like that back half of the holiday period. And it was actually some of the
same drivers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 15Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Scott Harlan Maw
Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Scott Harlan Maw
Q - John William IvankoeSo what we saw in January, 2 things in particular, was the continuation of the softness
in lobby. And again, I think that was ongoing from holiday as we typically get a little
bit of carryforward into January as we move through some of our ﬁnal merch. Then,
the second thing is, we didn't get the gift card tailwind. And so gift cards weren't
negative year-over-year. But they were ﬂat. And we typically get a nice tailwind in
comps as we get into January. And that tailwind actually was a little bit of a
headwind. Small amount. But it was meaningful. So as we get through January, those
2 things almost, by deﬁnition, should abate. There's still some gift cards coming in.
So it's not 0. But it's not a huge number. And the things that you -- we talked about,
which is this change in deployment, some of the product things we are doing like
Blonde Espresso, which is oﬀ to a great start. And all the things we're doing in
digital, we think that's enough to move us back up to get up towards that 3% run
rate as we move through the rest of the year. And that's what gives us conﬁdence to
get to 3% for the year.
I think if January -- sorry, John, maybe just -- I think if the drivers in January were so
diﬀerent than what we saw in the holiday or not related to holiday, I think it would be
harder to sort of understand what's going to happen. So it's a little bit of what's not
there as we move forward. But it's also the things that we have momentum around.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
So can we talk about holiday...
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
2018, sorry.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yes. First quarter '19...
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think, ﬁrst of all, our lobby will be entirely diﬀerent. And so even if we won't have
the same negative comp impact, I'm not sure if it will be positive or not, just because
you still have a year-over-year decrease in the number of SKUs. But I promise you, it
will be more proﬁtable. Fewer mark-outs, fewer BOGOs, fewer write-oﬀs. So all the
things that have hurt us in the lobby before. So from a top line standpoint, my guess
is there's opportunity, maybe, to go a little bit better there in lobby. But from a
bottom line standpoint, it'll absolutely be better. As we get into holiday beverages,
what I think we've learned over the last year or 2 is we're going to really have to go
deep around digital at holidays. So not only in our own channels, email and in app.
But also in our social media channels and really try to make sure that we're doing
everything we can to reach our customers digitally. And that is what's driving our
comps. So I feel like that kind of oﬀsets some of these headwinds that we've seen.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Okay. So annoying question, Unicorn Frappuccino was how big of a driver in the last
year? I mean have you begun to kind of talk about that and prepare us? And is thereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09

A - Scott Harlan Mawan encore for it?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. So it was -- I mean, it was a pretty big driver in the month of April. And we've got
a number of things teed up, which I can't quite announce yet. I think watch what
Kevin talks about in the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. And then obviously, in the
earnings, we'll give you an update.
Look, we think we can oﬀset that comp, over the course of not only the month of
April. But over the course of the quarter. We'll see how we do. It's a relatively big
number. But I don't think we're terribly nervous about it, particularly if you take a
little bit longer-term view. It was a wonderful product. And we've got some other
things planned that, I think, will be pretty cool as well.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
I never even laid eyes on one.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I hadn't either. I mean, I was in a meeting with John Culver. I hadn't laid eyes on one.
I said that. And all of sudden, he Mobile Ordered and Paid one. And someone
brought in from our store. And I'm like, oh, that's what it is. It's actually pretty good.
It's just a lot.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Yes. Well it was already gone by the time -- and I go every day. So I don't even know
what happens. Okay. So...
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
We got a number of things planned, I think, that will oﬀset some of that.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
So Deployment 2.0. I mean, we've been focusing on the throughput side. What
about the cost side? So let's take cost. And then, just kind of push into that part of
the equation. Obviously, U.S. margins were not what you wanted them to be in ﬁscal
'17. They weren't what you wanted them to be in the First Quarter of '18. So when can
we begin to at least stabilize that? And what does it take to grow America's margins
again?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. So if you go to the time before the tax investments came in. So go back to
guidance, basically. And where we guided. What we said is the ﬁrst half is going to
be challenged. In the back half, we should start to see improved margin, then margin
expansion. And so if you adjust for the tax impact, we're still in that ballpark for the
U.S. I think as we get through the Third Quarter, into the Fourth Quarter, we can see a
little bit of margin expansion. It's not going to be anything like you saw in 2014 andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 15Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Scott Harlan Maw2015. But a little bit margin expansion, which given the investments, I think, is just
ﬁne.
And so what's driving that I think is your question. We have our normal work around,
it's not easy. But it has been something we've had for a while around cost of goods
sold. And that's looking good. And I think a couple of hundred million is our target
this year. And we're on track to get the vast majority of that. This year, we launched 2
new initiatives. And Roz has really been leading in driving these things. And her
background has been wonderful to partner with.
So labor savings and waste savings. In both of those, we're sort of three months in. In
the First Quarter, running on track. And there are signiﬁcant savings there. And you
know about this. But the big opportunity there is taking a look at our stores and de-
averaging them. And looking at those stores that on the surface of it, we can analyze
this from Seattle. On the surface of it, it looks like they have too little waste and -- or
too little labor. And what we want to do is we want to add in product. And we want
to add in labor to drive sales.
On the ﬂip, we call that the green tail. On the red tail of distribution, it's too much,
right? So we want to manage that cost. And so we're oﬀ to a really good start there.
There's Lean principles that we're deploying. There's lots of analytics that we're
getting into store-by-store, working with district managers, working with store
managers. But the opportunity is signiﬁcant. And that builds obviously, is back-end
loaded, right, as we get that pipeline built. And we feel like if we can execute on all
that, we can get back to margin growth, excluding those tax investments.
And if you're thinking, what about including the tax investments? We'll lap the
majority of that as we get into the Third Quarter of next year. So most of the wage
increases that we announced will go in place in April.

Okay. So a lot of companies have been here in the last -- yesterday, I suppose, that
have talked about putting technology in to reduce labor hours, eﬃciency,
eﬀectiveness and really being driven not as a nice to have, as a need to have,
especially in high-wage markets such as your home state and a number of other
markets that you do business in. So to what extent can technology -- can you enter
the tipping point where technology and how consumers use the brand or potentially
new things to (inaudible) what have you, to begin -- that you'll to start to reduce the
number of eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness in terms of store-level labor expenses?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes, I think that one of the things that we've done around, for example, supply chain.
And this impacts the store because our managers are obviously ordering and
stocking inventory. So we're continuing to look for automation opportunities, both in
our manufacturing and distribution centers, robotics and some of our distribution
centers to improve the eﬃciency and accuracy of orders. So that we can get
managers less and less involved in their own store orders. So automated ordering is
something that we're looking at. So literally, you still have a chance to look at yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09

A - Scott Harlan Maworder. But you're not ﬁlling out an order every day. It just comes. And it's highly
accurate because of the automation of the supply chain. So we're well into that.
Within stores, we're looking all the time, although with lean techniques, we're
getting far smarter about what is time and motion around Espresso machines and
how do we get our Espresso machines positioned right in the stores? How many do
we need? We're starting to work upstream. Matter of fact, we got a new Espresso
machine in test right now in a couple of our stores. We're working upstream with our
manufacturer to make those more not only quicker in the way that they deliver
Espresso. But also enable -- Bluetooth; and Wi-Fi-enabled so that we constantly are
looking at the eﬃciency of those machines, what the grind looks like and taking all
that work oﬀ our partners. So they're not adjusting the grind 3 or 4 times a day, it's
happening automatically. So all of that is helping within the stores.
Then, when I talk about this deployment work, again, it's really using the analytics to
ﬁgure out where to use people without having more folks. And so as you know, if
people have more transactions, they earn labor. But most of the Deployment 2.0,
probably 95% plus of the stores, it's simply redeployment with better analytics. So all
of that should help the store experience. And the goal -- the way I think about it,
John, the goal is all of those non value-added activities that don't touch the
customer touch the product. We want to simplify those greatly. We won't be
automating how we make Espresso beverages. I know you're not saying that. We
won't be automating how we make breakfast sandwiches. We've looked at
automating things, like, could we automate some of the brewing that we do? But
anything that really is about that Starbucks experience, it will always be handcrafted.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Which may free you up to do more things on the premium side. I mean, if you have
things like drip, for example, that's automated would be ﬁne, especially if there's
more of a handcrafted element in terms of Reserve bars within Starbucks stores. And
that's something that a couple of years ago, I thought there was going to be a
relatively big conversion opportunity within the traditional Starbucks U.S. store base
in terms of putting in Reserve bars what have you. But it doesn't sound like that that's
a big opportunity at least in the short term. So do you have an ability to put
customer-facing attributes within the Starbucks store of, hey this drives like
additional traﬃc or drives additional ticket in term -- from a capital perspective?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes -- the answer is yes. And I think your intuition on the number of new Starbucks
Reserve bars, let's call them, versus converted, if we get to 20% of the stores that
have Starbucks Reserve bars, there'll be a meaningful number of those that are
conversion. If I was betting, I would say it would be the majority just as we go
through renovations and look for those opportunities and even some of the ones
that we're testing in the U.S., they're conversion. So I think your intuition is right.
And when we talk about store returns. And I talked about this a fair bit yesterday,
most of our new stores are drive-throughs. But not all of them. And so we've got
80% drive-throughs, 20% more in urban markets. Those 20% stores, they skew theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09

Page 12 of 15Q - John William Ivankoe
A - Scott Harlan Mawway you're talking about. Not all those new stores are Reserve bars. But many of
them are Reserve forward. They're more about third place experiential retail, things
that we've been doing for decades. And those stores still have really good returns.
But they're not as high as a drive-through. But for us, that's absolutely critical. We
cannot back away from the premium experience and write the expression of the
brand. So we'll continue to invest in those stores, get a great return, maybe a little bit
lower than what you see in drive-throughs, while we drive convenience and
transactions through the drive-through stores.
And the last thing I'll say is if, you really want to see this, at a little bit more at scale
because we only have a couple of dozen Reserve bars in the U.S., you can go to
China, where they have a lot more. Whether they're Reserve bars or what tag we put
on them, Reserve Forward stores, Pour Over, Slow Bars, Clover, all the things -- ways
to enjoy coﬀee at the premium end.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
Thank you. Is Mercato the food solution? I mean, as it currently stands, I mean, the
packaging is it's -- austere might sound like a negative word. But minimal, it's fairly
high priced. Obviously, it's much harder to manage inventory coming in, coming out
of the store every single day. I mean, is this the permanent solution that you see
that's right for the country? Or is that just going to still going to be done on a
market-speciﬁc basis?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes, I think we're still sorting that out. So we're in 2 markets. We'll roll 6 more markets
before the end of the year. And what I've said about Mercato is when we roll it out,
there's probably 30 or 40 SKUs. I should know the exact number. Let's just say
there's 30 SKUs. There's a couple of dozens SKUs, right, okay, that come out under
the Mercato banner. And some of those SKUs do really, really well. And some of
those SKUs do good. And what we were trying to learn is do all of those SKUs go
into every store across the U.S.? It probably not, right, just from a supply chain
eﬃciency standpoint. Do some of those SKUs go to every store in the U.S.? Perhaps.
A few champion SKUs. So all of those SKUs go into all the stores along the coast?
Maybe. That's what we have to ﬁgure out. We ﬁgured out cost of goods sold. We
ﬁgured out the delivery costs. But we're still working on what's the demand
equation, what's the value equation and what's the waste solution. I believe that
there will be some number of fresh -- fresher SKUs in our stores that come through
Mercato. The question is just scale. And I think that's the nature of your question.
But I just want to go beyond food. Food growth over the next few years is not
predicated on Mercato. A little -- I've gotten that question a little bit from folks. I think
that's upside for us in the afternoon. It's upside for us around fresh. But if you look at
today, Sous Vide Egg Bites, our new innovation, they're driving a ton of growth.
We've got the up level than we did on Bistro Boxes with everything being protein
forward. We've got the upleveling we've done on some breakfast sandwiches. And
those are driving 2 points of comp. So food comp and innovation is quite healthy.
But if I had 1 point of beverage comp, we'd be having a diﬀerent discussion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-03-09

So cannibalization, obviously, in the U.S., especially given your rate of store growth
and relatively -- depending on the quarter, relatively ﬂattish same-store traﬃc, I
mean, how are you measuring it? And have you seen -- I don't think that you're
seeing it on a national basis. I don't know if you're seeing it on a local basis. I mean,
have you seen cannibalization on a local basis, where you have materially taken
capital out of one market. And said listen, this is a higher return to where you were --
your cannibalization real time data, for example, is robust?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes, I'll use the word sales transfer. If you look at sales transfer, we track it -- there's
sensitivity around the other word. So we track it store-by-store. And you're absolutely
right, John. So we see sales transfer when we open a store. We plan for it, actually.
So I did a couple of slides yesterday. And I used the store in Fort Collins, Colorado,
where we had a really proﬁtable store in a shopping center in Fort Collins that was
doing, I think, $1.5 million, if I remember correctly, about 700 AUVs. We opened a
drive-through, big, beautiful drive-through, a couple of hundred -- I'm sorry, a couple
of miles away. And it did $2.5 million or something like that of sales. And it's doing
1,000 transactions. And what happened in that existing store within the ﬁrst year.
And again we planned for it, lost 100 AUVs, right? Then, what happens is it comes
back into the comp base in comps. And so the math around the new stores is there's
going to be cannibalization.
And what we do is we add all of that cannibalization that we can track in impacted
stores, that negative number on a weighted basis. And we take all the positive lift we
get from comps in years 2 through 5 after we open a store, it's in the comp base. We
take the positive and the negative on a weighted basis. We put them together. And
it's basically 0. Sometimes it's a little bit positive. Sometimes it's a little bit negative.
But it is basically 0% impact on comps. And what you're left with is. And the other
picture I showed is, you're left with the incremental cash ﬂow that's come into that
new store. And it's a hugely -- like some huge percentage. I can't give the actual
percentage. But it's the vast majority is incremental comps. And so when you do the
IRR on that, given our AUVs and given our relatively lower cost investment. And
given the margin on our product, it's big incremental beneﬁt from a cash ﬂow
standpoint.
And the last thing I'd just say is, I'd just remind everyone the licensed stores that we
opened, they're about half of the 750 stores we opened in the U.S., they have very
diﬀerent characteristics than the company-owned stores. They tend to be in captive
locations. It's not that there's 0 cannibalization. By the way, we track those too. And
we model cannibalization on licensed stores as well. But it's just a diﬀerent type of
impact. I said the word I said we'd never use. We model sales transfer and license
stores as well, it's just a diﬀerent type of impact.

{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Right. So you want to talk about -- that is the place where Lean is helping us the most
today. So we are doing time and motion studies. We are doing things where we go
in and look at the highest throughput drive-through stores because in the drive-
through, we have so much telemetry about what's ordering and how everything
closes out, right? Because unlike at the POS where we don't yet have the DOM
rolled out everywhere, we're not closing out every order. In the drive-through, we
close out every order. So we know exactly how long each and every product takes to
make. So we ﬁnd the best drive-throughs, again, using distribution. We ﬁnd the best
drive-throughs. We do time and motion studies. And we're starting to train that into
all of our drive-throughs.
{BIO 1556651 <GO>}
And Mobile Order & Pay is better integrated in the drive-throughs. I mean, that's -- I
mean, in terms of when the customer comes into the queue, that the product is
being made at the right time. I mean, that's always a challenge. Are you...
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
We're getting better at that. And one of the things that we've been talking about is
we've gone to channel production in some of our busiest Mobile Order & Pay store.
And all -- what channel production is, it's important is, we dedicate an Espresso
machine and a POS to Mobile Order & Pay. And we dedicate an Espresso machine
and a POS to in-store traﬃc. And that allows us to move the in-store experience
faster. So people perceive that things are going faster rather than, in some stores
today, it's just in the order it comes in. And we didn't get a chance to talk about
China.
