Good morning. And thank you for calling Costco Wholesale Corporation. I am Jeﬀ
Elliott, Assistant Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. And this morning I
will review with you our sales results for the four-week retail month of April which
started on Monday, April 7 and ended on Sunday, May 4. For comparable sales
results in this four-week period is compared to the same four-week period last year,
speciﬁcally Monday, April 8 through Sunday, May 5. April included 27 selling days
this year versus 28 selling days last year, reﬂecting the timing of the Easter holiday.
Before I begin, let me start by saying that the following discussions will include
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements
that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company
expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties and may cause actual events, results or performance
to diﬀer materially from those indicated by such statements.
These risks and uncertainties include. But are not limited to, domestic and
international economic conditions, including exchange rates; the eﬀects of
competition and regulation; uncertainties in ﬁnancial markets; consumer and small
business spending patterns and debt levels; breaches of security or privacy of
member or business information; conditions aﬀecting the acquisition, development,
ownership or use of real estate; amounts expected to be spent on expansion plans;
action of vendors; rising costs associated with employees, including health
healthcare costs; energy and certain commodities; geopolitical conditions and other
risks identiﬁed from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports
ﬁled with the SEC.
The Company does not undertake any application to update these discussions due
to subsequent events and circumstances.
Now with regard to sales. As reported in today's press release, net sales for the
month of April came in at $8.56 billion for four weeks ended April 4, up 7%
compared to the $7.98 billion reported for the same period last year. This year's four-
week period included 27 selling days compared to 28 days last year, reﬂecting theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-08

Page 2 of 4timing of the Easter holiday, which is observed in many of the countries where we
operate.
This calendar shift negatively impacted this year's total and comparable sales by an
estimated minus 1.5% to minus 2%. Thus, the negative of the lost selling day was
more meaningful than the positive shift of the preholiday sales.
For the 35 weeks ended May 4th, the Company reported net sales of $73.21 billion,
an increase of 6% from the $69.0 billion reported in the similar period last year.
Comparable sales results for the four-week and 35-week periods were as follows: US
four weeks plus 5%, US 35 weeks plus 4%; international four weeks plus 2%,
international 35 weeks plus 1%; total Company four weeks plus 5%, total Company
35 weeks plus 3%.
Comparable sales for the four-week and 35-week periods excluding the impacts
from gasoline price movement and foreign exchange were as follows: US four weeks
plus 5%, US 35 weeks plus 5%; international four weeks plus 7%, international ﬁve
weeks plus 7%; and total Company for both four weeks and 35 weeks, plus 5%.
Please note that the four weeks of April gasoline pricing was inﬂationary, thus
beneﬁting the comps, while foreign exchange was weakening, a detriment to comps.
For the 35-week periods, both gasoline and foreign exchange had negative impact
to sales.
In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights for the
month of April were as follows: On a regional and country basis, US regions with the
strongest results were the Southeast, California and the Midwest. On an international
basis and local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Canada, Taiwan, Korea and
Mexico.
As discussed last month, Japan had a nationwide sales tax increase eﬀective April 1.
This tax increase positively impacted the comp sales results reported for the ﬁve-
week month of March, due to strong consumer demand prior to the tax increase.
For April, we experienced an inverse aﬀect in Japan subsequent to the tax increase,
which negatively impacted comps sales for the month.
Moving to our merchandising highlights. The following comparable sales results by
category excluded the negative impact of foreign exchange. Food and sundries
comps sales for the month were in the mid-single-digit range. Within food and
sundries, the performance with the strongest results were candy, cooler. And deli.
Comp sales highlights for hardlines were ﬂat year-over-year. Better performing
departments were automotive, tires and hardware. These results were largely oﬀset
by oﬃce and electronics. Consumer electronic comp sales were slightly negative for
the month.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-08

Page 3 of 4Softlines experienced comp sales results in the high-single-digit range. Better
performing departments within softlines include apparel, domestics, housewares
and jewelry.
Fresh foods experienced positive comp sales results in the low-double-digit range
for the month. Meat, produce. And deli all experienced strong results. Fresh foods
continues to see inﬂation in the mid-single-digit range, the majority of which is
coming from the protein category.
Within ancillary businesses, gasoline, hearing aid and optical produced the best
comp sales results. Gasoline comp sales were up low double-digit year-over-year.
The average sale price per gallon was up 4%, higher this year at $3.71 a gallon
compared to $3.57 a gallon last year. Overall gasoline price inﬂation had a positive
impact on April sales of right around 0.5%.
Weakening foreign currencies over the year relative to the US dollar resulted in a
detriment to our earlier reported April sales of approximately minus 1.25%. Total
international comps for the four-week period came in at plus 7% in local currency.
But resulted in a reported comp of plus 2% when converted to US dollars.
The average transaction was up plus 1% year-over-year, which includes the net
impact from -- the net negative impact of about 0.75 point from the combined
impact of foreign exchange and gasoline pricing combined. Comparable traﬃc
frequency was up a little over 3.5%, which includes a detriment of one fewer selling
day during the month which is estimated to be minus 1.5% to minus 2%.
(Cannibalization) for the month of April had a negative impact to total Company
comparable sales of a little over 0.5%.
At this point, I would like to take a moment to report some of the key metrics on a 9-
week basis generally normalized for the calendar -- or normalize the calendar for the
Easter holiday shift between months. For the nine-week period which includes the
results from March and April, the reported comp sales for the US were plus 6%,
international plus 3%. And total Company plus 5%.
Excluding the impacts of deﬂationary gasoline prices and foreign exchange, comp
sales for US were plus 6%, international plus 8%, total Company plus 6%. For this
nine weeks, foreign exchange had a headwind of about 1.5% negative, while
gasoline price deﬂation was very slightly negative to the tune of just a few basis
points.
Traﬃc for the nine weeks was up 4.5%, while the average ticket was up just right at
0.5% for the nine-week period.
Looking ahead, the four-week May reporting period will include 27 selling days for
both this year and last year, reﬂecting the observance of the Memorial Day holiday in
the US and the Victoria Day holiday in Canada.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-08
