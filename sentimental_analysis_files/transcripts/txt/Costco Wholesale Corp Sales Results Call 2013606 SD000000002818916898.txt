will review with you our sales results for the four-week retail month of May, which
started on Monday, May 6 and ended on Sunday, June 2. For comparable sales
results, this four-week period is compared to the same four-week period last year,
speciﬁcally Monday, May 7 through Sunday, June 3.

recognition of the Memorial Day holiday.
