So before we begin, Microsoft may make some forward-looking statements during
this presentation. And you should refer to their SEC ﬁlings for risk factors relating to
their business. And that's true whether you're here in person or listening on the web.
Excellent. So Satya, thank you for coming. Welcome to the TMT conference.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you. So much, Keith. Thanks for inviting me.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So I was having dinner with a portfolio manager last week. And we were talking
about Microsoft. And we noted that in your tenure, when you joined Microsoft -- or
when you took over the CEO role, Microsoft had a ($304 billion) market cap. Today,
that stands over $725 billion. And what he said to me, it's hard to believe that one
person, that one man's kind of changed the course of the company that -- a
company that we were all thinking of as a legacy, tired technology company is now a
mobile cloud innovator, right? Someone who's nimble in terms of their innovation.
Can you share with us a little bit about how that happened? Because I know it wasn't
just you. I mean, I read your book. You talk a lot about the senior leadership team.
But you aligned everybody in the right direction. You pointed the ship and got it
moving in a much more forward direction than Microsoft had been aimed.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, a couple of things, Keith. I mean, the way I think about my life at
Microsoft is not from the day I became CEO. I've been at Microsoft for 25 years. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Page 2 of 13Q - Keith Weiss
A - Satya Nadellaclearly, the responsibility that I have and the accountability that I have is
unquestionably more today as CEO than it was before. And so therefore, even trying
to take credit for what has happened in the last four years without realizing that the
franchises and the bets that Bill and Steve played -- you all know -- is just wrong.
Businesses don't get built that way. Things don't -- things that last long take long to
build. Even every startup that's successful has had 10 years, 15 years before they even
can IPO. So that's the time frames with which I think about. But to your core, one of
the things that I've come to realize is that it's -- when everything is going great, when
businesses are growing and the core is growing at 20% and more and all of you are
celebrating that growth, that's when you really need to watch out because the
question is, "What happens after?" Because there's no such thing as a perpetual
motion machine. That original concept, idea hit is eventually going to run out of gas.
That means you need to have built capability that allows you to get to a new concept
long before it's conventional wisdom. In fact, long before many of you will give us
permission to even invest. So that means you got to have a management team that
knows how to bet on the future long before, in some sense, it's conventional
wisdom. And what enables organizations to do that? I believe it's culture. What
enables organizations is not just the insight. It's the ability to have that everyday
courage to make bets, to learn from mistakes, knowing you're going to make a fair
share of it. So it's that art form. If it was just a science, then every company you would
talk to would be long-term successful. But it's not. And it's only because I think
there's excessive celebration of short-term wins and there is lack of understanding of
what is, I think, the real sustainable building of businesses.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. In your book, you talk a lot about the 3 Cs, right, the concepts, capabilities and
culture as being the key to success. Can you dig into that a little bit for us on sort of
how you apply that? How do you apply that in terms of -- with your senior leadership
team to make sure people are focused in that way? And how should we think about
those 3 Cs enabling the next $100 billion coming from Microsoft?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, it's similar to what, I mean, I just talked about. But here is how I would
say it. Somebody said to me, "You got to be careful about talking about culture with
investors because the only culture they love is in their yogurt." And so it's sort of
such -- you can't plug that into a spreadsheet and have it change something. But it is
probably the most important thing because that's what enables you to build
capability. I'll give you an example, take silicon. At this point, it's clear as day,
whether you are doing things on the edge or doing things on the cloud, you need to
have silicon capability. If I look at the sophistication with which the margin structure
of whether the cloud business or anything else is going to change is going to be
around how smart are you with silicon. Of course, we got started on some of that
journey, quite frankly, with our work on Xbox many moons ago. But we don't have
like an Xbox silicon team and a cloud silicon team and a diﬀerent silicon team. We
have one capability of people who are able to tape out new silicon which can help
us in our innovation. That culture that cultivates great silicon engineers to come, join,
work with the silicon industry, too. So it's not just about us building our own. But to
shape that ecosystem so that we can be on the frontier of innovation, that, to me, is
the most important long-term indicator. That doesn't mean you -- you have to catchFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

A - Satya Nadellanew trends. You're not going to have a perfect batting average. In our case, if you
look at our 43 years of history, we've had our fair share of big wins. But we've also
had some fair share of our losses. But it's the ability to have capability and a culture
that allows you to keep going back every day and making judgment calls and having
a high percentage of winning.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. So let's dig into some of those sort of technology trends and future
opportunities that Microsoft's been working on. The ﬁrst one I want to talk about was
artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning. You mentioned before that AI is the
ultimate breakthrough in technology. Why? Why do you think of it as kind of that
ultimate breakthrough, or certainly one of the biggest new ideas that Microsoft is
facing today?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, in fact, picking up even from your last question and then going to this AI
piece, the -- you asked even, what is next for Microsoft? I feel one of the key things
that we have done is position ourselves in the core mission of the company and the
core business model of the company so that it is really in tune with the times. In 2018,
if you have a mission and a business model that is not about creating surplus around
you in every community, every country that you operate in, you are not going to have
a long-term business. So now having said that, we have plenty of opportunities. And
we'll sort of explore those. AI is going to be one of the trends that is going to be the
next big shift in technology. It's going to be AI at the edge, AI in the cloud, AI as part
of SaaS applications, AI as part of, in fact, even infrastructure. And to me, leading in
it, not just to sort of have AI capability that we can exercise. But the ability to
democratize it so that every business can truly beneﬁt from it, that, to me, is at least
our identity around AI.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And I think -- when we talk about AI and machine learning, there's -- in my
perspective, there's 2 sort of big sides of the equation. One is the capabilities and
technology, having that. But the other is being able to apply it to real business
problems. And I think we've talked too often just on one side of the equation. But I
want to start there. So in terms of Microsoft and your capabilities, like how are you
guiding Microsoft to ensure that you're in the running, that you're the vendor that
your customers are looking towards when they think about machine learning, when
they think about cognitive services, that they should be coming to your platform
versus -- and there's other big competitors out there?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes. Twofold. One is, of course, you have to have technology. I mean, if you take even
the recent machine reading comprehension test that Stanford did, we were #1 and
Alibaba was another #1. So if you look at speech, we hold the WR -- WER record still.
Computer vision, some of the ﬁrst original ImageNet records were held by us. So in
some sense, you got to have, whether it's speech, whether it's reasoning, whether it's
machine reading or vision, you got to have the capability. And that's something thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 13Q - Keith Weiss
A - Satya Nadellawe have. And we are applying that in our own applications, if you look at Oﬃce 365
and what Cortana is capable of doing. Even this morning, Cortana woke up and sort
of talked about a couple of commitments I had made in e-mail about following up.
That's actual machine reading and comprehension at work. The long term, though,
here is what I feel. Like let's say, there are 2 or 3 other companies that have AI
capability-wise. The question that every customer, whether it's a ﬁnancial services
company, whether it's a retailer, whether it is a manufacturer, is going to ask is, "Who
do I trust?" Especially in a world where there's going to be transfer learning. One of
the largest transfers of wealth can happen if you pick your supply chain wrong. If you
do not have fundamental trust with the partners you have, suppliers you have and
entrusting them with data, which they are going to then help you reason on top of to
create AI has to be one of those very trusted partnerships. And I think that's where
having this purity of business model, which we have, which is fundamentally
consumption-based or subscription-based, not having all these funky cross-subsidies
and marketplace structures and multiple businesses that one side you compete and
on the other side you partner. I just think most people are going to see through it.
Like recently, I talked to a bank CEO. One of the ﬁrst questions he asked me, which is
pretty stunning to me is, what's the state of your RL?" And I said, wow, this is a bank
CEO asking about reinforcement learning. And that means there is real awakening to
where AI and the trajectory of AI is going. So therefore, I fully expect them to be
asking the hard questions of which technology partners can they really trust in the
long-term interest -- whose long-term interests are aligned with their long-term
interest.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. Even in the research department of Morgan Stanley, we've talked to a lot of
vendors as vendors about machine learning capabilities and artiﬁcial intelligence.
And over the past few years, I feel like a lot of the conversations are vendors coming
to us and saying, "We have these capabilities. What should we do with them?" Right,
versus coming to us with real solutions. How are your customers talking to you guys
about machine learning, artiﬁcial intelligence? How do you bridge that gap between
a set of new, innovative, really interesting capabilities, being able to automate parts
of the work that no one's ever done before with real business problems of getting it
to solve a real domain problem that your customers have?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, I mean -- I think, even there, I would say in the last couple of years, I've seen
marked diﬀerence in terms of, it's not just technology for technology's sake. And
that's why even technology and its evolution is very path dependent. If you take --
you asked in the previous question, "What's diﬀerentiated about, say, our speech
service or vision service?" One of the most diﬀerentiated aspects of it is the ability to
customize it. It's not just a generic API that you call. For example, there are certain
fast food restaurants using our speech service, which is being trained for the
ambient noise of drive-thrus. That's a customized application. So that the order entry
into the point of sale is that much more accurate. There is computer vision
customization that is happening so that in a manufacturing line when somebody
wants to really get highly accurate around detecting defects, they can customize it.
So that ability to have a tool chain that makes it possible for businesses to then take
their business process and add machine learning and AI and make it that much moreFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Page 5 of 13Q - Keith Weiss

Q - Keith Weissproductive and that much more eﬃcient is what, I think, the real innovation is. It's not
just having the technology. But to be able to really deliver the deployed solution.
And there are 2 approaches to deployed solution. One is to have a very highly
consultative sale. There's a place for that. There are lots of partners of ours who are
going to do a good job of it. But our job, as traditionally Microsoft has always done,
is to bring world-class tools. To me, when I think about what's happening with Visual
Studio tools for AI and the ability for developers who are not AI experts. But yet are
able to roll in AI into their solutions, that's a place -- just like what happened in
client/server and databases, that's how I think about what the world of AI is also
going to be.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. The investor question that I get most often on machine learning/AI is, is it
having an impact yet? Is it actually driving new business? Is it accelerating workloads
out there in terms of what people are doing? From your perspective, do you think
we're there yet of where these capabilities are now actually driving workload
growth?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
For sure, it is. But it's early days. But let's take what -- most people describe it as IoT.
It's fascinating to see the workload path, if you will, of these IoT projects, which is,
let's take anything that's on the edge, take even a manufacturing context. You're
collecting lots of data. You take that data and you rendezvous it both in the edge as
well as in the cloud. Then once you have a lot of data, you reason over that data so
that you can do some predictions. Because ultimately, AI translates into 2 things,
whether it's some predictive power or analytical power. In this case, let's say you can
predict failure. Then right after that, you need to translate that prediction into some
action. So then we see growth in something like ﬁeld service because you then have
to get someone who is going to go ﬁx the thing before it's broken. And so that
ability to take something which is growth in our edge, to growth in data, to growth in
AI tools that are being used for preventive maintenance, to growth in ﬁeld service,
that's happening at scale today. But is it just AI? Is it just data? Is it just business
applications? And that's one of the reasons why I like to think about the broader
platform eﬀect as opposed to just the narrow application.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Shifting gears a little bit. I want to talk about quantum. So the Morgan Stanley
research -- tech research team, we put out a report on quantum computing last
summer. And I would say the consensus feedback from all our clients was, you guys
are crazy. What are you talking about quantum for? Quantum's 5, 10 years out. This is
science ﬁction that you're writing here. Later, it was, I think, two months later, you
were on stage at your developer conference, the Build Developer Conference. And
you're talking about quantum computing as a real capability that Microsoft's
investing a lot in, that Microsoft's going to be bringing capabilities to the ﬁeld, not in
the 5-, 10-year time frame. But something much sooner. Can you help us frame this
topic for our audience? Can you help them -- can you help me get them to read my
report on quantum computing? Are we there yet? Where are we in terms of sort of
getting that technology production-ready?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Yes. When I think about all of the opportunities that we have in front of us, if I look at
how people are using our compute in Azure and how compute by itself seems to be
insatiable in terms of the need for more of it, or our own feature development in
applications, such as Oﬃce 365 or Dynamics or Xbox. When I look at all of these, it's
clear that we need more compute. We are reaching the limits of current
architectures, whether it's the Moore's Law or it's the von Neumann machine itself
and its architectural limitations. And so that's where quantum comes in. We have
taken the approach where instead of trying to go and solve some narrow problem of
quantum to achieve, let's even say quantum supremacy, the real challenge of a
quantum computer is always going to be, "Are you going to have enough qubits that
can be stabilized in ways that you can do general-purpose compute?" So that means
the error correction challenge cannot be so enormous because in the quantum
world you're not just going to be able to have that many qubits to do all of the error
corrections. So that's the uniqueness of at least our approach. So we've got a
fundamental mathematical theory called topological theory. We have a Fields medal
winner in it who sort of has done groundbreaking work. We have a couple of world-
class physicists who are trying to instantiate that topological matter in a physical way.
And so that's these Majorana particles that we are trying to basically discover that
exhibit topological matter. Then guess what? We're going to need a complete new
computer science stack because this is not what you program previously. And that's
interesting because I've not -- when we sort of put the simulator up on Azure is when
I started seeing that it's not just our belief that the world needs more compute. There
are many, many people who are very, very excited about it, from oil and gas to many
other ﬁelds who are saying, "Wow. We need to come up with new solutions for some
of the big, long-standing computational problems." And you see it in some of the
early adoption of the Azure simulator.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. I think one of the -- I mean, there's a -- 2 big diﬀerentiators that we saw in the
Microsoft approach. One was, just fundamentally, the physics that you guys are
looking to approach it are diﬀerent from most of the other competitors out there.
Although in this forum, I don't want to get too much into topological qubits. The
other, which is also really interesting, is the fact that you guys have the entire stack,
where you're developing across the entire stack. It's not just the hardware. But it's
the software on top of it. Can you talk us through sort of that 3-layer approach of the
hardware, the interface and sort of the software algorithms on top that actually are
going to enable this to get real work done sooner?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Well I mean, it's -- look, I think the ﬁrst phase of this is for us to build all of these 3
layers. And as I said, I think the key is for us to have fundamental breakthroughs in
physics that allow us to stabilize these qubits at scale and then to be able to then
build the containers in which you can have a general-purpose computer, which
requires breakthroughs even in cryo computing to be able to achieve that. But the
place where I think we are going to shine is -- beyond what is going to be
groundbreaking work on the physics side, is going to be the software stack. In some
sense, this goes back to the very ﬁrst question. Most companies, in spite of whateverFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

A - Satya Nadellanew technologies and capabilities, have something innate in them. If you look at
Microsoft, what we started with was the basic interpreter, whatever, 43 years ago.
And it's back to basics in some sense. So we're going to start again with the tool
chain for quantum. What's the point of having a quantum computer that only 2
people somewhere can program? You got to be able to have quantum computers
that everybody can program against. And that's at least how I think we are going to
diﬀerentiate.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. What's interesting is, this time, instead of an open underlying hardware or a
preexisting hardware infrastructure, you guys also have to develop the hardware
infrastructure that you're creating that interpreter and that software language on top
of.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
That's right. And as a big capital spender today on the cloud side, it's actually pretty
logical for us to be on the forefront of not just quantum. There's many, many, many
pit stops between now to quantum. And in fact, if you look at even our road map
behind in terms of the investments to quantum, they're going to need many
dividends of that investment long before quantum.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Yes. I want to shift gears a little bit to something that you brought up earlier, the idea
of trust. I get asked the question a lot of, why does Microsoft -- when Microsoft is
competing against Amazon Web Services or Microsoft's competing against Google
Cloud compute, why do they win? Is it their technology? Is it the breadth of services?
I think there's another aspect within it. Part of it's trust and part of it's understanding
your customer's business problem -- business problems and bringing real solutions
to them. Can you talk to us about how as a technology industry broadly, you think
about trust, maintaining that trust with your end customers, how do you keep on the
right side? Because there's a lot of diﬀerent -- and you talk about that in your book a
lot. There's a lot of diﬀerent forces that are pushing in the wrong direction that sort
of make it diﬃcult for you guys to maintain that trust with your customers.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, I do believe, as we sit here in 2018, this probably is the issue of our times and is
not going to go away anytime soon. Because if you sort of -- and the reason for it is
very straightforward because there's not a walk of life, there is not a sector of our
economy anywhere in the world that's not impacted fundamentally by digital
technology. And so if you start with that premise, then one of the questions every
head of state I meet or a local community leader I meet ask is, "Hi. what does all this
mean for us? Whatever you talk about in terms of technology, what -- how do I think
about it creating surplus in my own region?" And that's where I feel Microsoft's
fundamental grounding in our mission of empowering every person and every
organization on the planet to achieve more is super important to me. It's not just a
set of words. It guides the choices we make about the businesses we're in, the
business models. And as I said, the surplus it creates. So I can sort of go to New YorkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Q - Keith Weissor Istanbul or anywhere and say, "Here is Microsoft's contribution to your small
business productivity, your public sector eﬃciency, your multinational
competitiveness, your educational and health outcomes." Of course, we have an IP-
based business. And we need a return. But it's a factor of production to your own
creation of wealth and surplus. That, I believe, is going to be what's going to be
important in the long term. Because if all you do is collect rent and not create
surplus, there's no way people are just going to allow that. I mean, that -- I start there.
And it's not about companies being branded as one. It's the core -- or countries
being branded, it's about every company being evaluated by their business model
and their ability to deliver, I think, long-term surplus that's more evenly spread.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Okay. The other big part of the equation on trust is security and the ability to ensure
to your customers that their data is going to be secure in your cloud, in your
environment. When investors think about Microsoft, should we think about Microsoft
as a company that secures data, secures users, is inherent in the platform? Or is
Microsoft actually a security company? Are you bringing new capabilities that are
new SKUs, if you will, new products to the marketplace for providing security more
broadly?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I mean, security as a category, if you sort of look at it across what's happening with
our oﬀerings in Windows, our oﬀerings in Oﬃce 365 or on Azure, it's probably the
fastest growing just because cybersecurity is such a massive need across all
segments, across all markets. But we don't think of security just as a stand-alone. You
even ask, is it securing users, is it securing data? It's everything. It's securing of your
data. It's securing of the user. It's ensuring not just security as technology that
protects one time. But it's the operational security posture. If you ask me, even with
Spectre and Meltdown, one of the things that was just a marked diﬀerence was not
only our ability to take that issue, which was a processor design issue, come up with
a ﬁx and a mitigation, get it deployed, say, in our cloud very rapidly so no customer
had to even spend any money. So the operational security posture that allows us to
see threats and mitigate the threats is as important as the technology itself. So we
are investing very, very heavily. It's also -- security is always going to be an
intelligence game. It's not just the technology game. That's why security and
operational security go together. We are also going to have a very open ecosystem.
So it's not just about us and our technology. But how can we make sure that the
overall investment in security is leading to better customer outcomes because I think
one of the many -- one of the things that can slow technology down is to have
security challenges that slow adoption. And so therefore, there's even responsibility
beyond sort of the monetization that we all have.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. When I talk to customers and they talk to me about their progression on Oﬃce
365 from E1 to E3 to E5, one of the probably -- the top responses that I get back of
what's drawing people up that stack is security, is the discrete security functionalities
that you expand with that. So there is a monetization angle. There is a monetization
of this security technology that you're deploying into the stack.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Oh, for sure. I mean, as I said, whether it is the -- that migration up from the E1 to E5,
whether it's with Windows or Oﬃce 365 or what we now describe as Microsoft 365,
clearly, security is one of the value propositions. But to your broader point, one of
the things that I think has been perhaps a revelation is this move of Oﬃce from, "Oh,
I used to run Exchange to now Oﬃce 365," it's not a one-for-one move. I mean, if I
look at the overall market opportunity for what is considered the Oﬃce franchise. But
more broadly, I think of it as the Windows and Oﬃce franchise in today's world.
Think about it, in our heydays of client/server, we didn't sell servers to small
businesses in India. We did not have that opportunity to penetrate with Exchange or
Lync or any of our servers. But whereas now, you can. You can sell subscriptions to
small businesses everywhere. You can also have value propositions, whether it is
compliance, whether it is security, whether it's voice. Some of the -- a rich capability
that is now just, again, possible for us to have across all of these levels. Again,
something we never had previously. Also, ﬁrst line. One of the most interesting
things in the last year I've seen is companies really deploying technology with their
ﬁeld service people, with their retail specialists. So that's another. It's not just e-mail
for the knowledge worker or collaboration for the knowledge worker. But it's even
the ﬁrst-line worker. In fact, HoloLens, some of the highest volumes of HoloLens as
it's being deployed is to the ﬁrst line. So when I think about that, the growth
opportunity for what is Oﬃce 365 is a lot bigger than anything that we achieved,
even with our high penetration in the client/server world.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. I want to shift gears and talk about some of the recent business performance.
And the ﬁrst topic that I want to talk to you -- great segue, thank you -- was Microsoft
Cloud. It's been probably the biggest outperformance of -- in terms of investor
expectations over the past two years, in particular what you guys have been able to
do in Azure. I think last quarter you saw an acceleration in growth at $1 billion-plus
scale for that business. What's driving that strong kind of return on investment that
you guys made? And what's diﬀerentiating Microsoft, particularly on the Azure level,
versus some really big competitors out there that had a head start in terms -- at least
in terms of being out in the marketplace with their Infrastructure as a Service and
Platform as a Service capabilities?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, we -- we are very pleased with the progress we are making on Azure.
And I think it starts with having a fundamental diﬀerentiated point of view on where
is computing going. So we describe this as the intelligent cloud and the intelligent
edge because distributed computing, I never believed even multiple years ago that
it's somehow going to become one centralized service. But it's going to remain
distributed. If you look at -- we talked about AI previously, you need not only
inference capability at the edge. But for the new workloads, we need even training
capability in the edge because the amount of data that's going to get generated that
needs to be reasoned over in real-time to take action will require compute to be
where storage is. So when I think about what we are building, when we describe our
hybrid computing architecture or this intelligent cloud intelligence, I feel we're, in
fact, leading that change today. And now beyond that, I think what you see is theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

A - Satya Nadellasecular market demand for this type of computing. As every industry and every
country is being digitized, the one thing that they need more is that core
infrastructure. And we participate at the core infrastructure, both on the edge and in
the cloud. We participate in the data layer. We participate in a lot of the higher-level
PaaS services, whether they be AI or others. And so therefore, we feel we both not
only have a diﬀerentiated point of view, we have execution that is diﬀerentiated in
the marketplace today. And in the long term, we will -- again, just like I talked about
Oﬃce 365, we had a good business in our server business. But this business is
orders of magnitude bigger than what used to be a successful server business.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Right. I'm going to ask one more question then open it up to the audience to make
sure we could take some of their questions. But turning to Oﬃce 365, I want to ask
you about where you think we are in terms of sort of the progression of that market
opportunity. And there's -- in my view, there's 2 dimensions -- there's kind of 3
dimensions. There is the penetration into the traditional oﬃce space, of getting
people to convert over. There's the expansion of the capability of sort of what you're
selling to those guys. But there's a third one that you guys kind of brought into the
equation more recently that I don't think a lot of investors are thinking about is
Microsoft 365, of it's not just Oﬃce, it's going into the Windows space as well and
sort of pushing out in that direction. So from your perspective, kind of like what
inning are we in? Where are we in terms of sort of building out that Oﬃce 365,
Microsoft 365 base?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes. It's the real question to be asked because we are not trying to just build these as
a single SaaS service or even a single operating system. It is about being able to
build a rich information model that enables users and groups of users and
organizations to be productive, to be able to collaborate, to help, in fact, impact the
cultural outcomes of organizations at scale. So when I think about Microsoft 365, it's
that ability to have a rich information model about people, their relationships with
other people, their schedules, their projects, how are they collaborating. If you think
about it, I mean, I would encourage you to use Outlook even on your iOS devices
and go and look up a person's contact. You look up the person's contact, not only
are you going to see, ﬁrst of all, all the contact information. You are also going to be
able to see their LinkedIn connection. But not just that. There's this beautiful thing
called organization. People you work with. You look at that and you say, "Oh, yes, that
must be just an org chart view." It's not an org chart view. It's a dynamic view of the
colleagues you are, in fact, working on projects. So that creates one of the dreams in
all organizations (sort of has) been, how do I create a boundaryless organization?
How do I create collaboration? What instigates collaboration? So that's the way we
think about it. So we're not building an operating system for a device. We're not
building a single app. We are thinking of the users and groups of users and building
an operating system for them. Windows is part of it. Windows -- Oﬃce is part of it. So
is Android. So is iOS devices. We don't care. We want to be able to really help users
with their productivity and collaboration and organizations with what they want. So
that's the expansive nature. And by the way, security is going to be part of that. So
not only is it about productivity. But it's about trust and security as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

Right. So it's not about the user interface. This is really about the information
underneath it that's tying it all together?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
And the user interface is a very important element. After all, I gave the experience
example with Outlook. But experiences are being powered by this rich information
model and the experiences then reinforce the information model to allow us to
create more rich experiences. So that feedback cycle is what's most important.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. So I want to take the opportunity to take some questions from the
audience. Up front.
Can you talk about how you think about use of cash with respect to shareholder
returns versus M&A? You've got $100 billion to repatriate. It's been 1.5 years since the
LinkedIn acquisition. So just how you're thinking about those priorities?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
I mean, look, I mean, whether it -- we're always going to have a balanced approach
to our capital allocation. When I look at what we have done, even in the last multiple
years, whether it is the dividends, the buybacks, the M&A we have done. So for
example, take the LinkedIn. I mean, the fact that we are ahead of the plans we stated
at the acquisition is super important to us because it's one thing to do M&A. It's a
completely diﬀerent thing to do M&A and then follow through on the plans you
stated because that's the true measure of our ability to realize the beneﬁts of
spending shareholder money. So I feel good about the way we have had a balanced
approach to it. But fundamentally, when I look at the opportunities ahead, I think
about -- across our 3 segments, there are 4 big, big opportunities. We talked a lot
about Azure and the Azure Edge opportunity. It's massive. And we are in the very
early innings of what the world needs in terms of core infrastructure. The opportunity
in business applications, which we didn't even talk much yet about. We are a small
player in a big market that's growing. And we think of that as another huge place. In
fact, one of the big breakthroughs for us, beyond the growth of our Dynamics 365,
which even last quarter grew 70%, has been Power BI. We went from nowhere to
being now the leader in BI in the cloud. We grew 3 -- by 3x last year. I think we're
going to end the year with $0.5 billion billings annualized run rate, which is
tremendous. I mean. So that took investment multiple years. But here we are with
some real numbers. Then say -- that was in business applications, now let's go to
Oﬃce 365. That I think is very clear, Microsoft 365, in terms of, whether it's small
business growth, whether it's ﬁrst-line growth, the richness of applications, the
security and gaming. Gaming is another place where fundamentally we are going
and trying to build out a gaming service which says, the console is going to be
important to us, continue to be the place where the most heaviest gamers are. PC as
a gaming device is, in fact, increasing in popularity. And our ability to build Xbox LiveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-26

A - Satya Nadellaas a network with subscription services, that's another huge opportunity. So to your
core question, I think that we can do the best for our shareholders by looking at
these expansive opportunities and investing wisely on them. Then having a balance
with all the other dimensions, whether it's dividends or buybacks or M&A as it ﬁts
with our core strategies.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. Let's try to sneak in one last one.
So my question really is around gaming. If you can just spend a little bit more time
talking about the gaming opportunity. I know you just touched on it a little bit, the
role Microsoft plans to play, not quarter to quarter, longer term, your outlook for e-
gaming, Xbox, the technology, what are the core competencies longer term?
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Yes, I mean, to us, we're very happy about the core gaming asset that we have. And
that asset got built with the loved brand of Xbox as well as PC gaming. One of the
things that most people had not recognized is that we are the owners of both of
those. And so therefore now that we even have Xbox and Xbox Live, in particular,
across these 2 has really helped us grow engagement on Xbox Live. And we'll
continue to do so. We now have play-anywhere game subscriptions, which I think is
the beginning of what is going to be a transition. Much like what I described with
Microsoft 365, is a transition in gaming, where the console is going to be super
important, the PC is going to be super important. But ultimately, it's about people
and their ability to game anywhere. And that's where we are going. Whether it is with
our subscription oﬀerings with Game Pass, whether it's with Mixer, which again is
growing very rapidly in terms of just streaming. And so are esports franchises around
our ﬁrst-party games. So I think we have many, many levers there. But fundamentally,
it comes from that heritage of having been in the gaming business for multiple
decades at this point and built up that capability in a world where now we have the
ability to take that and have it service a much broader marketplace than ever before.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. Unfortunately, that takes us to the end of our allotted time. But thank you
very much for joining us, Satya.
{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Thank you. So much. Thank you, very, very much.
