Presentation
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
All right, I think we are ready to get started. Good morning, everybody, for day two
of our global tech conference. We are thrilled to have Peter Klein who is the CFO of
Microsoft with us this morning. The format, Peter and I are going to go through a
series of questions, then we are going to open it up to all of you to see if you have
any questions you want to throw at him and we will start from there.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Good morning.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Thank you for coming.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Thanks for having me. It is great to be here.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
All right, tablets. And there is a shoutout because I see a handful of people with
Surfaces out there.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}

Peter KleinPeter, thank you for that. The trend does seem though to be moving to smaller size
form factors, right? There has been a lot of interest in things like the Mini, the 7-inch
Fire, the Nexus 7. Can you talk to us about what Microsoft needs to do, if anything, to
kind of capitalize on the 7-inch trend?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes, yes, that is great. We are really set up for that. The notion of ﬂexibility and
scalability of the operating system is actually intrinsic to our vision and our strategy.
We talk a lot about devices and services and when we say devices and services, we
mean a set of experiences that are complete, that are compelling and they are
consistent across a whole range of form factors and devices, including size of form
factor.
And you can see that in some of the things that we have done with Windows Phone
8 and Windows 8. Clearly, now we share the same kernel and so you have the same
core code base driving form factors from 4 inches all the way up to 27 inch all-in-one
and everything in between. If you think about our developer platform, we have done
a lot of the hard work so that now applications can scale up or down depending on
the size of the form factor.
So core to our vision of delivering a set of services across form factors is the
scalability of the operating system. And so I think we are really well set up to deliver
the most sort of versatile set of experiences across form factors whether that is 4
inch, 5 inch, 7 inch, 8 inch, 10 inch, 13 inch. And along with our partners in the
ecosystem, we will work through that based on underlying demand.
And so one of the strengths of our ecosystem has always been versatility and
ﬂexibility and having a variety of form factors at a variety of price points. And so we
have sort of been set up for these kinds of dynamics because, as you and I have
talked about in the past, the trend towards new kinds of form factors and devices
and experiences is beginning and continuing and what the ultimate sort of form
factors will be is uncertain. But we are well set up to respond to demand as we see it.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And with the new Windows PCs that we have seen out in the market and there is a
lot more I know coming after I met with Tammy a few weeks ago. And you look at the
tablet form factors that are coming to market, how do you guys think about how this
will change the course of the consumer PC landscape? So there is consumer PCs
and then overall compute, kind of what do you see all these things doing to the
diﬀerent growth rates?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. Well we are certainly encouraged. As we have talked about, it is early in the
launch of Windows 8 and this was a fundamental reimagining of experiences for
both work and play and so that impacts the consumer experience a lot. We are veryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

Peter Kleinencouraged by the work that is going on as we speak. We have talked about we
have almost doubled the number of certiﬁed systems and there is a lot of great work
going on across the ecosystem. Hopefully people will get to see those as they come
to market. We have kind of shown them throughout the ecosystem. Acer, HP, Dell,
Lenovo, they are all bringing great 10 inch, 13 inch touch laptops to market.
I think you will see going forward more price points. You will start to see maybe
some lower priced, $599, tablets, ultrabooks, touch ultrabooks coming to market on
Clover Trail and other architectures. Because I think over time we are very
encouraged by what the ecosystem is delivering. Now we have been very clear that
the thing we need to do is to continue to bring compelling devices, touch
experiences, touch ﬁrst experiences at all the right price points and I think if we do
that well, that will have a positive impact on what we see in the consumer PC market.
But that remains to be seen.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
The vertical integration is -- I mean you have been doing hardware with Xbox for a
while. But when we think of Microsoft kind of three to ﬁve years down the road
based on the comments you just made and the diﬀerent form factors, is Microsoft
going to become more vertically integrated over time?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Well it is hard to speculate going forward. There are certainly things we are doing
now obviously with Surface that gives us an opportunity to do some things in the
tablet market that we think beneﬁts the whole ecosystem and we have learned a lot
from what we have done with Surface and we can bring back that learning to the rest
of the ecosystem. So I think it is fair to say that we will always look at what makes the
most sense from a vertical integration perspective, as well as an ecosystem
perspective.
Obviously with Xbox it made a ton of sense and that has been very successful. I think
with Surface obviously that gives some great learning and some great examples of
what you can do with Windows 8 that is obviously very focused on the ecosystem as
well.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So it is it a question of if the ecosystem performs for Microsoft, then maybe the
notion of vertical integration isn't going to be as important going forward or do you
kind of feel like you're always going to have to have skin in the game whether it is on
the tablet side or on the phone side?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes, I think it will always be a balance because there is always things we can do like
with Surface that I think are good for the ecosystem, good for customers and beneﬁtFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

Peter Kleinthe whole ecosystem. But there will always be a strong ecosystem play as well.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
There is a school of thought that would say consumers don't want to multi-home,
meaning they want to have their tablets and smartphones be part of the same
operating platform because of the beneﬁts they might get of sharing the content
across multiple devices if they are not say Web-based apps. I was wondering what
your -- how Microsoft feels about that.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. Well I agree with that. Actually I would even take it a step further. It is broader
than just tablets and smartphones. I think it is all devices from phones, to tablets, to
PCs and in the living room as well. And it is probably broader than just contents or
operating system platform. It is just about the experiences and so when we think
about those complete set of experiences that people want, that is what we are sort
of trying to deliver again with sort of a similar developer platform. We are getting
closer and closer every day for the developer platform that people can develop
once and run it anywhere from sort of any form factor for everything that we deliver.
If you think about some of the services that we deliver, whether it is Xbox Live or
SkyDrive for storing content, SmartGlass where you can take your entertainment and
your games from the TV to your phone if you happen to be leaving. I agree that the
ecosystem play where you have a set of consistent experiences, not just content. But
the overall experience whether you are at work or at play across all the devices. So
that is core to sort of our vision.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So if you think about that and you think about -- you obviously have dominant share
in PCs today, you have great share in the living room with Xbox, phones and tablets.
And I know that the lines are blurring between all these types of devices. People
would say you are really coming from behind in those two areas. What is Microsoft --
what should we watch for, kind of what is Microsoft hoping for to make -- to try and
see that dynamic change because the view is that people don't want to multi-home,
then you need to kind of -- we need to see some share increases in some of these
other areas to kind of come up to where you are in other device factors.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
No. I think that is right and we are obviously very focused on that. For part of the
ecosystem, we come from a point of strength when you think about where we are in
the living room and where we are on sort of PCs and laptop and we want to sort of
take advantage of that. But to your point, what people should look for and obviously
that what we are focused on is delivering the same set of compelling experiences
across all form factors and we are pleased with the progress we have made in
phones with Windows Phone 8. We are starting to see some traction there this last
holiday season. So we are very focused on that. And obviously with Windows 8 earlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

Peter Kleinon, we are very focused on delivering both touch and touch laptops and tablet
experiences that are really compelling and that is a key area to look for our success.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
We get asked a lot what alternatives does Microsoft have if you don't start to see the
share change in things like phones and things like tablets. Can you walk us through
kind of the diﬀerent alternative or how you think about what your alternatives might
be or how we should think about it as investors?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. It is hard to say because I am not sure what alternatives. I mean we are obviously
-- it is very early in sort of this new generation and so we have got a bold project now
with sort of how we thought about the ecosystem, how we thought about Windows 8
and how we think about sort of that operating system driving these changes. And so
for us, we are very focused on continuing the success we have with PCs, taking that
to tablets and phones with Windows Phone 8 and with Windows 8 and continuing
on the places where we are having great success like Xbox and delivering and
continuing to deliver great entertainment experiences.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
What we get asked a lot is in terms of alternatives are what could Microsoft do to
make it cheaper. Does that mean getting more vertically integrated so that you can
be more aggressive on price points and then kind of making money on the lifetime
value of the customer, then we might think about it that way going forward or is it
cutting the price to the OEMs, which I am not sure is material enough to make a big
diﬀerence in terms of what the end price would be. But I think people are trying to
think of -- again, if you look at consumer compute share, the share has kind of
leveled oﬀ here. But for it to go back up and just beneﬁt from the (inaudible) eﬀect
you are talking about. What could you do -- like what is the plan B?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. That is a great question. I would say it is less plan B than how you execute on the
current plan. I am a big believer in price diﬀerentiation and customer segmentation
and I think you are right. I think there are diﬀerent price points for diﬀerent use cases
and for diﬀerent sets of customers. And so what we aim to do as we continue to
evolve this generation of Windows is to make sure we have the right set of
experiences at the right price points for sort of all customer segments.
So I think about it -- it is probably more nuance than just do you lower prices or raise
prices. It is more about do you have the right set of experiences at the right price
point for a given scenario or a customer segment. I think that -- it is less a plan B and
it is more just how do you tweak your plan, how do you bring new things to market
to make sure you have the right oﬀerings at the right price point.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

The other area that gets a lot of focus is the end of life of XP and we have until April
of next year I guess for that to happen. How do you think about -- you guys have
mentioned a little over 50% of people have --
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
60%.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
60% now are on Windows 7. How do you think about the tail that is left between now
and call it 12 months from now?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes, I would expect a lot of that tail to continue to migrate to Windows 7 between
now and when the end of life of XP is. And it is an interesting question how that is
going to impact the business PC market. How many of those are upgrades on
current hardware, how much of those will happen on new hardware. It is hard to
predict. I think it will be a mix. What we are seeing to date is a lot of these upgrades
happening on existing hardware, which is good for our enterprise business.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Is it diﬀerent than what you have seen in the past?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
It is probably a little bit more, probably a little bit more. Enterprises are starting to
get very interested in Windows 8. Typically when we launch a new operating system,
particularly one that has the degree of change that Windows 8 does, consumers sort
of adopt ﬁrst and then enterprise will take a look at it. And there are some interesting
things we are seeing starting with new enterprise applications that people are
building.
So it will be interesting to see how it plays out. As we have talked about, our volume
licensing or our EA business on Windows has been very strong the last few quarters.
I think a lot of that is this sort of upgrade cycle to Windows 7 on the existing
hardware and I think over time you'll start to see people buying new hardware as
they upgrade as well.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
How would you think about the PC replacement rate right now? What you are saying
would imply that it is actually lengthening even further than what we have seen orFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

Page 7 of 16Peter Klein
Heather Bellini
Peter Klein
Heather Bellini
Peter Kleinam I mistaking your comment?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes, I would say it is not sort of intrinsically lengthening. At a point in time, we might
see people taking advantage of upgrading to Windows 7 on existing hardware and
then over time upgrade that to new hardware. So I don't want to sort of imply a new
trend. It's I think more of a point in time scenario.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Now you have also come out and said we are going to get more frequent Windows
updates and it sounds like maybe it is going to be every 12 months or so. So you
really should start to see your ELA business in Windows, your deferred portion I
would imagine start to be a bigger driver of that business going forward and maybe
make it more untethered from PC shipments as we have all known it to be in the
past.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. That could be. I mean I can't sort of predict exactly what will happen. I think that
is a very viable expectation.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. Feedback from enterprise customers thus far, what they like about Windows 8?
Again, I think, like you said, the adoption is going to be on the consumer side ﬁrst.
But any initial thoughts, even the ones that maybe have gotten their hands on Pro as
kind of (inaudible).
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. It's early. There's a very high degree of interest. People are very interested in
having an experience that is very compelling for their users. But is very comforting to
them from a security and manageability perspective. So I think we are having lots of
great conversations about it. We have got some great early examples of use cases of
how enterprises are adopting Windows 8. And I think early on, what we are seeing is
both for certain types of their workforce, a lot of the mobile workforce, ﬁeld
workforce and telecom companies like British Telecom is using it for their ﬁeld
workforce, Emirates Airlines is using it for their crew to deliver applications for the in-
ﬂight experience.
So you are starting to see people experiment with it on both usage scenarios for
their types of workers, as well as new applications. Then there is people who are just
getting performance beneﬁts from it. We have said a lot, one of the things I noticed
right away when I started using Windows 8, it is simply -- even without all the new
innovations -- it is just a better Windows 7, it is very (inaudible), it is very fast, it is veryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

is very early and I think that will play out over time.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Is there anything they have said thus far about developing or there is a lot of apps
that get developed internally and when you think about app development for touch,
how have the developers talked about that experience thus far?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. So both ISEs and corporate developers are pretty excited about building new
classes of apps that are touch-based natively and also take -- beneﬁt from the cloud
as well because that is sort of the new paradigm. So I think you see a lot of
excitement from corporate developers to build new LOB apps. I think it will be a
while before a lot of the existing legacy are sort of replatformed for touch. But all the
new development people are really thinking about touch.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Has this helped when you have been -- again, knowing that it is still early days. But
with Windows Phone 8, have you noticed that having things like Pro for example or
with Windows 8 as a SKU being out that you have now been able to drag Windows
Phone 8 into the conversations with corporate customers, especially if they are trying
to decide what to do with BlackBerry (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes, I can say personally anecdotally I don't have sort of a broad swath of data across
the Company. But certainly the conversations I have had with customers that is an
increasing part of the dialogue absolutely.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And is there -- what do you think Microsoft's strengths are to kind of try and convert
some of those customers over to you versus say iPhone or an Android device?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes, I think it is two things. I think it is both front end and back end. I think sort of the
set of applications and experiences you get from productivity and collaboration and
communication all the way to the sort of well-understood manageability and security
I think is a very compelling story for enterprises and that tends to be -- those two
things tend to be the drivers of the conversation that we have.

Heather Bellini
Peter KleinI think another thing that people have been wondering about lately, without naming
any names speciﬁcally. But the strategy you have to help support the PC ecosystem
broadly based. Can you walk us through kind of some of the things that make you
decide how you might support a partner in need?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes, I think we have a long history of participating and in supporting the ecosystem
and that takes diﬀerent forms. Oftentimes, it takes the form of co-marketing,
sometimes in helping with development in the ecosystem and so I think in sort of a
very dynamic industry, I think our ability to support the ecosystem, particularly the
ecosystem that is innovating on our devices and platforms, is a good thing and
something we will continue to do.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
How do you do that without upsetting the other people?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
It has always been a balance. This has been going on for a long time. We are broadly
supportive of the Windows ecosystem and that broad base and it is open to sort of
the whole ecosystem. So I think everybody understands that.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And RT, or I should say just Surface RT, what lessons have you learned? It has been
on the market now for a few months. Kind of if you would name -- like kind of list for
us kind of the top two or three things you learned both -- things you could work on
and things that you were very happy with from the launch and the initial feedback.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
I think with Surface RT, there is a couple things that we really learned and part of it
stems from our approach. As you know, we had a very controlled launch and part of
the reason for that is so we could really observe and sort of understand the
experience launching a new product, new operating system, new architecture, our
own device. So that was limited to our stores and our online and some limited
geographies.
And one of the things that we learned from that is that people really need to touch
and see and play with it to really understand. There is a lot we did to build
awareness. But observing people coming into the stores and seeing it and playing
with is super important and so what we have done is to broaden the reach of what
we are doing on distribution, get it out there in more geographies, in third-party
retail so people can actually come in, touch it and play with it and really get the full
experience so that they really understand that. And so we are going to take that andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantnow broaden that and of course, with the recent introduction of Pro, we will start with
a little bit more expanded distribution and continue to expand capacity.
I think the other thing that we have learned because RT was a new type of operating
system and a new architecture is seeing how people use it and taking that learning
to actually continuing to update and make updates to the operating system, which
was part of the design principle to begin with because those beneﬁts beneﬁt the
whole ecosystem. So the learning from Surface helped -- when we see software and
hardware integrated very closely, it helps us really understand some of the core
experiences. We can build that back into the operating system over time and then
that beneﬁts the whole ecosystem as well.
So we learned a lot about distribution, we learned a lot about the need for people to
experience it. We learned a lot about how to continually make the operating system
better.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Should we expect your retail strategy -- I mean you have a good number, not a huge
number of retail stores, of Microsoft retail stores. How do we think about your retail
footprint going forward and how important is this?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
It is important because it is a great place for people to, particularly as we reimagine
some of our experiences, it is a great place for people to get a very good exposure
to those devices, those experiences to the whole ecosystem. And I think you should
expect us to continue to roll those out similar to how we have in the past. We did a
little bit more this year because of the new Windows 8 and the new devices that we
have out and so we will continue on a path much like that. It is measured, it is
executed well. But we will continue to expand the exposure people get to our
devices and services.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Okay. I am going to pause for a second and see if there is any -- there is a question
right here and then I was going to switch gears a little bit. There is two questions,
three.
Questions And Answers
Heather, Peter. Good morning. AJ (inaudible), Cornerstone Capital Management. I
have to admit, while listening to the presentation and listening to the story over time,
I still am not very clear as to what the hardware strategy is. The core I remember of
Microsoft and seeing some of the applications of Microsoft live years and years ago,
even on lap phones and 3G phones early on, was there was a lot of great softwareFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

Page 11 of 16A - Peter Klein
Q - Heather Bellini

Q - Heather Belliniproperties, there was a lot of opportunity to expand those software properties and to
grow the base outside of Windows. But now this hardware strategy seems to
disintermediate the current vendors and I am not really sure what the strategy is with
hardware at Microsoft. So a bit more detail, please.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Sure. And and when you say hardware, I assume you are talking more on the tablet
and PC side more than the gaming side. I think of it as more additive than anything
else. As technology evolves and as innovation happens, the ability to work closely
between the boundaries of software and hardware allows us to innovate in ways that
we couldn't before and as I said before, that innovation beneﬁts the whole
ecosystem and so our ability to deliver some unique experiences in hardware I think
is very interesting. It shows what the full power in certain scenarios of what a
Windows 8 can do. But it also beneﬁts the whole ecosystem.
And so I understand that that is a balancing act and in fact, the ecosystem has always
been about balance. But there is amazing work going on across the whole
ecosystem that I think is beneﬁting from a lot of the things that we are all doing to
think about how we bring Windows 8 to market and what kinds of experiences that
you will see. And I think over time -- remember, it is very early in Windows 8. I think
over time, you will start to be very impressed by what is emerging broadly from the
ecosystem across form factors and sizes.
So as the market has evolved, it has gotten more diverse. The set of experiences
have changed and I think the whole ecosystem is evolving with that and I think we
play a part in that and the hardware strategy allows us to build a nice little business.
But most importantly, it beneﬁts the whole ecosystem.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
While we are bringing the mic, I know there is a question over here, I am just going
to ask one while we are waiting for the mic to get over there. A lot of questions
about Oﬃce on iOS. What do you have to do to get it there, what are the reasons
why you wouldn't bring it there ultimately when you think about how that would
maximize proﬁt for that division?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Well I am sure you can imagine sort of the trade-oﬀs, we think about it a lot. I mean
we have a history of cross-platform delivery broadly in productivity whether it is
Oﬃce on the Mac or whether it is certain experiences that apply that customers
really want cross-platform whether that is e-mail, communications, notetaking. So we
deliver all those products cross-platform, Exchange, ActiveSync, SharePoint,
OneNote. And a whole bunch of things. And importantly, with the Web applications,
you can access oﬃce documents, do some light editing on any device and on any
browser. So I think there is a lot of things that we are doing to sort of meet that need
and then we will continue to think about other things going forward.

I think the mic is over here.
Thanks. Hosted virtual desktops, not a huge market today. But quite a lot of
momentum, doubled I think last year. If that momentum were to continue, would that
surprise you and would it in any way change your strategy with regard to
participating in the virtual desktop market and do you see that potentially, were it to
grow in the long term, a bridge over the OS moat?
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And wait, Peter, before you answer, if we can move the mics, there are several
questions over here. So trying to make sure we get in as many questions as possible.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
No. I appreciate that.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Go ahead.
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
I will stretch and dance a little bit. The way I think about virtualization and virtual
desktop, I feel great about our sort of long-term strategy and how we think about
sort of virtualization end-to-end from applications to devices to infrastructure. So I
am not sure -- we will obviously watch and see how things evolve and we will always
evolve our strategy. But we have a long-term strategy and I think it is fairly unique
and compelling when it comes to how we think about virtualization all up and how
data as well as applications are delivered, whether that is virtual or real. But we will
continue to watch that. It has proven to be -- it is sort of a controlled market. It has
probably been that way for the last few years. But we will continue to watch that as I
am sure you will.
Peter, a question for you, a little bit circling back on the enterprise maybe tablet

for another 40%. A lot of those folks are probably going to be entertaining otherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

showing a lot of waning interest in being in the business at all.
With Android not having a big, let's say, foothold in enterprise yet, trying to counter
the iPad. But with Dell and HP kind of on the sidelines, why not be very aggressive,
take the Surface Pro, multiple devices, LTE connectivity, other things that you can go
in and lead that way and kind of prevent Google or Android from being an
alternative there and kind of getting a good win share there?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
That's a great question. I agree with you. I think it is a great opportunity for new form
factors in the enterprise. I think we have a great story there. And I think it is going to
be both. I mean I think Surface Pro is a very interesting product for that and we are
starting to have lots of great conversations with enterprises. But I think the
ecosystem broadly is going to bring great tablet and touch experiences to
enterprises. I don't want to sort of comment on sort of speciﬁc vendors. But I do
think across the board. And inclusive of HP and Dell and Acer and Lenovo and Asus,
the whole ecosystem sees that opportunity and I think are going to bring some
compelling devices to address that opportunity that you noted, which I tend to agree
with completely. And Surface Pro will be a big part of that.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
I think there is one right here.
Hi. Peter. I had a couple questions about Bing. First of all, take us back to the
beginning of that thought process. What was the goal in mind when you created the
search engine? And the second question is what are sort of the metrics of success or
failure for that product? Are you looking for it to sort of drive a ton of revenue on its
own or are you looking for it to bring a lot of business to your hardware?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Both. So the thought process behind Bing was a couple things. One, we see a
massive business opportunity and there is a lot of natural things about the
technology sort of underlying that that were very natural for us. At the same time, it is
a very strategic asset because it does a couple of things. It is an engine, sort of a
machine learning engine that makes all of our services better and it is a corpus of
data, it is a corpus of Web data. Both of those assets are very rare things and both of
those accrue to all of our other properties. And so we're looking for both.
Bing, we think there is a real good business opportunity there. We have been
focused a lot on increasing our share and increasing our monetization, managing
our costs and improving our ﬁnancial performance, which we have been able to do
much better the last year or so. And so we feel good about that, lots more to do. At
the same time, you can see Bing crossing -- I talked before about our devices andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

Bing more and more an intrinsic part of what the experience that you get on all of
our devices and how that plays in it.
Then the last thing is it gives us scale in the cloud, which we have been able to
leverage and deliver commercial cloud services. And so you take all that together --
and the last thing would be big data. That machine learning engine allows -- works
into some of our commercial services on big data. So it is a very strategic asset, it is a
very big business opportunity and so it delivers both of those things for us.

I was going to switch gears to entertainment and devices for a second. There is a lot
of excitement around smart TVs, about streaming content in general and I am just
wondering what else can you do with Xbox to help make this the living room, which
we have been waiting for to get revolutionized for a long time, what can Xbox do
even more than it is doing today to help -- to hit that goal?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. It's a great point. I agree with you. I see that opportunity and I think some of the
things we have been doing in Xbox have been sort of unique and leading along that
way. For a while now, we have thought of Xbox as a much more broader platform
than just gaming. Xbox Live is a unique and powerful asset, over 45 million users
now and we have got -- the Xbox install base is now over 75 million. But more
importantly, we have brought a lot of entertainment content to that platform and the
engagement in entertainment content is actually growing faster even than gaming
on the server.
So I think what you will see us doing as recently as this week making some
announcements some increased entertainment. We think of the Xbox Live platform
as an entertainment platform and really thinking about the TV and that channel into
the TV is a very broad entertainment platform, which again then accrues to the other
devices that we have because you can take that seamlessly from your TV to your
smartphone or to your tablet.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
So people who aren't gamers, who don't think of Xbox as a way to just get that TV
content, they think of Xbox as a gaming console, how do you change that, the tenor
of those conversations with consumers? So for people that might not ever play
again, what opportunity do they have to leverage Xbox without ever necessarily
wanting to play a shoot them up game?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. And that has absolutely been sort of the path we have been walking down the
last couple of years. Obviously we have a core set of -- sort of a gaming community,
which is always super valuable and it is great. We continue to serve that very well.
And it has taken some time and frankly we started early. So we feel like we have a
leading position of thinking about Xbox as a platform more broadly than gamingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

A - Peter Kleinand that honestly just takes time. You have to build the right set of content, you have
to make people aware of that content and we will continue down that path. But it is a
long journey, which is why we started early to sort of broaden how people think
about the platform.

What about assets like Skype, when you think about transforming the living room?
How do you think of some of these other assets that you have bringing those into
the fold?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Oh, it's core (inaudible).
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
And even things like Bing, I mean (multiple speakers).
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Absolutely. If you think about all the apps we have, it is core to that and sort of
bringing those set of experiences to the living room, I think Skype is a great
example. I have always thought Skype will be very compelling there. But whether it is
Skype or Bing or other things, bringing those sets of experiences to the living room
and then having them cross other parts of your life I think is very compelling. It is
core to our strategy.
{BIO 2268229 <GO>}
Any other questions? I have got one last one if -- there is one right here.
Peter, could I just ask on -- back to your point I think about price -- just having the
right products kind of at the right price points? Do you think there are fundamental
things that have to change with the supply chain in order to get there, i.e., you go
back to the holiday season of last year and there just wasn't enough touch panel
supply for Windows 8 or the hinge makers, for example, for some of these hybrid
detachable devices just didn't have enough capacity and the supply chain wasn't in
place or do you think it is an issue more with the actual operating system and with
the OEMs in terms of getting the OEMs to buy in more to something like Windows
RT where it is a lower cost platform, lower cost processor and therefore you have the
ability to really kind of hit those lower end price points. How do you think about
those two things?
{BIO 5820282 <GO>}
Yes. It is a great question. I think it is a little bit of both. I mean I think it is always
going to be some function of the supply chain and how the supply chain evolves for
a new way of thinking. I think some of it goes not just to the operating system. But to
the chip architectures and the innovation that is happening on the silicon side. So IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-02-13

think you will see all those things.
