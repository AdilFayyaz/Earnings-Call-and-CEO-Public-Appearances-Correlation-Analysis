Q - AnalystQuestions And Answers
(Question And Answer)
There is a lot to talk about from a macro and micro perspective. Maybe let's talk
about sort of top priorities for 2023 for Alphabet and just sort of to really tackle it
right away, top priorities and how does AI ﬁt into the company's top priorities?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So the top priorities are ﬁrst to invest for long-term growth, and then also to make
sure we durably re-engineer our cost structure. In terms of investing for long-term
growth, the priorities are the same that we've talked about at this conference for
quite some time, it's really behind Search, Ads, YouTube, cloud and Pixel. And to
your question, AI really underlies all of that and the investments we're making in AI,
research and delivery. In terms of durably re-engineering our cost structure, we do
have a number of work streams that are in ﬂight to go right at that. And the main
point is, we are looking to slow the rate of expense growth such that revenues --
revenue growth exceeds expense growth.
And then more speciﬁcally to your question on AI, it is obviously an extremely
exciting time for AI. And as Sundar indicated, we're on the verge of launching a
number of LLM-based products and services. You can think of it as a portfolio and
I'm not going to get ahead of those sitting here today. But we do very much look
forward to continuing to unveil what we're doing there. And I think the main point, as
I think about it, is all that we're doing with LLMs in these launches builds on many
years of research and product work that we've done. We have amazing engineers, in
particular, in AI with both Google Research and DeepMind. And you can see it in the
product rollouts that we've had.
So, reminiscing back to when I ﬁrst joined Google back in 2015, Google ﬁrst
launched RankBrain, and it was the ﬁrst opportunity where we're really using AI to
improve context around queries. And then you think of BERT and MUM and what
we've done with LLM to continue to advance what is Search. And going through
what we're doing, the same is true with Ads. We've used AI to really help advertisers
achieve and maximize their objectives around ROI. We've used it in cloud. And so,
we're building on a decade of extraordinary work, and as I said, look forward to
sharing more in the next weeks and months.
Okay. I want to go into the AI discussion a little more, but maybe just to sort of right
set on from a macro perspective, can you just sort of give us the -- any updates or
the status there what you're seeing from macro ad demand? Any verticals or
categories that are potentially stronger or weaker than others and sort of the state of
the advertiser discussions in '23?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-08

So after what was clearly an extraordinary acceleration in digital activity kind of going
into COVID, coming out of COVID, what we saw and what we've talked about is that
the macro environment got more challenging. And on the fourth quarter, we -- as
well as prior in the year, we talked about some of the pullbacks that we had seen as
a result of the more challenging macro environment. In Search, there was some
pullback, we described it as kind of broader pullback aﬀecting YouTube and
network. And basically, as we've talked about for many years, what you see with
Google Search is what you see in the broader economy.
To your question about what is the conversation with advertisers, it's as it's always
been. What about ROI? What can we do with ROI? And that, again, is where you start
with Search as this extraordinary cost-eﬃcient way to achieve their objectives
measurable, and that's such an important part therefore of the dialogue. But then to
your prior question layering on AI and things like Performance Max where we can
help them really optimize across the portfolio and solutions to maximize ROI. So,
continuing to have a lot of those conversations.
Okay. Let's talk about Search a little bit and sort of the AI use cases and the way
Search could change. The investors right now have sort of taken the stance of
bucketing certain companies in the winners or losers group within the AI discussion.
Other companies are pushing out AI tools within Search throughout the overall
ecosystem. To your point, we're still sort of waiting to learn about Bard and more
tools to come with the APIs. Maybe just remind us -- give us some more examples of
how you're already using AI in Search? And then what are some new use cases in
Search that you can sort of think about through next applications of AI to come?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yeah. I love it. So, we have, as I said, been using AI in Search for many, many years.
And our view is that we don't launch products just because there is a new capability
or technology available. We have billions of people around the globe who trust us,
rely on us to deliver accurate, timely information. And so, user testing is a large part
of what we've always talked about and continue to do, and remain very excited
about when we do launch the application utility Takeout. To your question, I think,
probably one of the most exciting new applications that really leverages large
language models is everything we're doing with multimodal search.
And to give you a sense of what that is, say you want it tonight, anyone here wants to
plan a great dinner somewhere in San Francisco, and you've got your favorite Italian
dish that you want, lasagna, you can take a screenshot, photo, combine it with text
with Google Search around Near Me, and you'll get a full listing of where can you go
for that great lasagna dish that you've seen that you want here in San Francisco. And
so, it's this combination of visual search and all elements of it leveraging MUM that is
so exciting, multimodal search. We're the only search engine -- Google Search is the
only search engine now oﬀering multimodal search, and it builds oﬀ of Google Lens,
which now has 12 billion queries per month and growing, and we're really excitedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)

Q - Analyst
A - Ruth M. Poratabout what the capability of Google Lens, and it's just one of the examples of how
we're continuing to advance what is search and look forward to continuing to do so.
I feel like the Search discussion around AI is sort of what is part of the zeitgeist of
society [ph] right now, given some other companies' products. But Google Services
has a lot of other potential ways to use AI. So maybe just -- I know there's no
announcement today unless you're interested in that. But talk to us about sort of how
you think about other uses of AI across all the Google Services suite of tools and
products.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yeah. Good try, but I'll stick with the second part of your question. So, you're
absolutely right. It is across the full set of Google Services. So, for example, within
YouTube, we've been using AI for quite some time for a host of diﬀerent things. One
is as it relates to, again, advertisers and how do you maximize ROI, it goes back to
PMax, Performance Max. It also goes to the recommendations engine for users. It
also goes to the very important work that we're doing around trust and safety and
content moderation, our ability to actually identify quickly content that violates our
policies and take it down. And we're continuing to look at opportunities to apply AI
in ways that help creators generate content in their storytelling.
In Pixel family, we're similarly using AI on a host of diﬀerent applications. One of my
favorite is in the camera and the ability to use, for example, something called Magic
Eraser which hopefully many of you have seen and used, the ability to take a photo.
And if you don't actually want some of the clutter in the background, it will help you
with AI, identify it, take it out and put in a better background and amazing with
respect overall to what we're doing in Ads. So, yeah, a lot of applications.
The advertising point. This is another common discussion on AI, the incrementality of
revenue. You said at the fourth quarter earnings call that using advances in AI to
drive new and better experiences for users in Search as well as deliver better
measurement, higher ROI and tools for more compelling, creative content
advertisers as one of your big opportunities. Are there any statistics or ways you can
help us quantify early signings of the -- early signs of the incremental revenue you
can generate from all these AI tools?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well, it starts with you sort of -- probably because you're quoting us back from the
earnings call, it starts with a lot of the functionality that we bring. And so, the ability
with respect to advertising, there are two parts to it. One, what are we doing for
advertisers? And whether it's through Smart Bidding or through Performance Max,
we're helping advertisers really maximize what is the opportunity. The second part is
what we're doing with users, and when you -- for users and support of users, when
you think about what users turn to Google for, they're coming because they either
want to learn something or they're trying to do a task or they're trying to transactFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 11Q - Analyst
A - Ruth M. Porat
Q - Analystsomething commercially. And so, what we're using -- again, AI has been invaluable
as we understand the context so that we can be as responsive, which then translates
into activity.
So, to give you an example, say, you want to go buy something or we each want to
go buy something. You may care more about price, I may care about availability. I
may want availability near me. And one of you may want something about the
ranking and reviews. And so, what we're able to do with AI is better enhance what is
context for query, better deliver. We're able to help advertisers again, with
placement with creative, all of which translates into additional revenue, and we're
continuing to leverage what we're doing with AI again to address both sides.
You mentioned as we were talking in the green room, some of the work that we had
done around Google Shopping. It's a great example. What we've done through
Google Shopping and the whole mission you've heard a lot of us talk -- a lot of you
have heard us talk about it, is open up to the broadest array of merchants because
that's good for merchants, it's good for users, it's good for the overall ecosystem.
And that's the type of work that we are looking at and again, it comes back to some
of this context on queries that's useful.
And how do you think about Google Cloud and GCP sort of ﬁtting into this AI
opportunity as well? Is there going to be an incremental competitive advantage?
Like, how does AI drive workloads to GCP?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well, at the core of your question, we ﬁrmly believe that AI is transformative for each
one of us in our businesses. Our ability to connect more closely to customers, our
ability to extract operating eﬃciency in our businesses, our ability to address some
of the risk management requirements that we need. And so, our Google Cloud team
somewhere is very excited about the way they are able to work with customers
across each one of those, and then really leveraging our infrastructure, which again
goes back to your AI question to better deliver.
So our AI infrastructure enables customers really to leverage TPUs, GPUs to really run
what they need. We bring data analytics that's critical to their ability, again, on each
of those dimensions. It's our cybersecurity capabilities. And so, yes, it is incremental
to everything that we've already spoken about. And at its core, they too are
leveraging the AI capabilities across Google. That's GCP. And then similarly, within
Workspace, we've used AI in our collaborative Docs and tools in Gmail for quite
some time and look forward to again, continuing to add to that with some of the LLM
work that we've been doing.
Okay. Looking forward to those announcements. All those announcements, those AI
tools, they do come with a cost. We've been doing a lot of work trying to ﬁgure out
the cost. I think Wall Street generally has -- we have some estimates to say that theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-08

Page 6 of 11A - Ruth M. Porat
Q - Analyst

Q - Analyst
A - Ruth M. Poratincremental cost of the AI models can be 2x to 3x more expensive than paid search.
In some cases, even higher than that when you're going through a lot of aggressive
training of these large models. First, love your reaction to that. And then secondly, if
that is the case and it is more expensive than paid search to run these models, how
should we think about the long-term margin proﬁle of Alphabet, the OpEx structure?
Just walk us through that a little bit.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So you're absolutely right. LLMs -- running search on with ALMs or LLMs generally
are more compute intensive and thus expensive. But the important point is this is not
new for Google, and we've been asked this question for many, many years. The cost
to compute has continued to increase, one, because of the scale of the Internet and
growth in the Internet. And two, as I've already said, we've been using AI for a
decade now. We introduced LLM four years ago. So, this is not new for us. And what
we've been doing and hopefully is self-evident from results is we have a number of
teams that are very focused on every element of eﬃciency around compute and
driving down eﬃciency as much as possible. So, to be more speciﬁc, within the
infrastructure area, you've heard us talk about TPUs and the beneﬁt that you can
have with TPUs.
We have a team that's focused on software optimization, so you can move workloads
as eﬃciently as possible. We're looking at overall model eﬃciency where there are
beneﬁts there as well. And then the other is the obvious point that LLMs don't need
to be used for every query. So just optimizing actually how you think about
applications. And so, yes, the premise is right. Yes, we are focused on it. We've got a
host of teams that are focused on cost eﬃciency around compute because it's an
important part as we think about sort of long-term performance, and they have been
for years.
Exactly. We watched all the other AI tools. It's not new.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
It's not new, it's been a decade here. So yeah, it's been a lot of work.
Great. What about CapEx? You talked about total 2023 CapEx being ﬂat on a
reported basis. We think the real estate CapEx is probably going to be down quite a
bit. So, we're sort of backing into infrastructure CapEx, up 20% plus for the year. Just
sort of talk us through the drivers of CapEx this year? And how should we think
about the CapEx and the capital intensity and the spend needed to sort of push
more AI to more consumers across more products?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So CapEx for 2023 will generally be in line with 2022. And you're right, that is
because real estate CapEx is down meaningfully. And CapEx around our technicalFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 11Q - Analyst

Q - Analyst
A - Ruth M. Poratinfrastructure is up meaningfully. That's for both data centers and for servers and it's
primarily in support of cloud and everything that we're doing in AI, and as I said in
general, that comes to ballpark in line with last year.
Okay. On the fourth quarter call, you talked about your eﬃciency and expenses and
sort of discipline. And you said, we're focused on delivering sustainable ﬁnancial
value, and that obviously means that expense growth cannot be growing ahead of
revenue growth. That is more than I remember you saying previously around these
topics. So maybe walk us through what are sort of the few areas where you're
focused on to drive this more durable expense discipline? Where have you made
the most progress? And when should we expect to see the impact in the P&L?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well, it's an important truism, so it seemed valuable to just reiterate. What I tried to
underscore on the call is that we are focused on durably re-engineering our cost
base and we do have a number of workstreams that are in ﬂight. They include
everything from looking at how we can apply AI internally to our processes, as well
as all of the eﬃciencies in technical infrastructure that you just asked about, that's
one bucket.
The second big bucket is around vendors and everything we're doing around
procurement, and how can we be more eﬃcient in each element there. And then the
third major bucket is, we call it, where and how we work. And so, each one of those
are workstreams that have been launched. The reason I wanted to stress durably is to
do change of substance takes time. So, the workstreams are in place. We expect
they'll contribute more in '24 and then beyond. And our view is that these are critical
elements that we're continuing to work on to deliver durable results as we look at
what's the overall investment requirements.
Okay. Very helpful. Let's talk about hardware. Sundar has spoken about how
hardware is one of the key long-term priorities for Alphabet. Why does hardware
matter? And I guess the second one is just -- you talked a little bit about Pixel, but
how can your own hardware ecosystem potentially to further AI advancement?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So when we -- when Sundar talks about hardware, in particular, focused on the Pixel
family, phone, tablet and wearable. And the view is that we're able to really highlight
the opportunities, the future of compute by bringing together the best of AI and
hardware and software. And an example of that, I already gave the example around
Magic Eraser, but you also have things around Translate.
So, our view is that we're able to highlight what this is for the Android ecosystem,
which is a beneﬁt to the Android ecosystem in addition to the platform investments
that we're making. And so, it's in that context that we view it as important. As we tried
to be clear on the call, we're investing meaningfully against the opportunity, andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-08
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 11Q - Analyst

A - Ruth M. Porat
Q - Analystthat's why we said that there's a real focus on how we can drive incremental
eﬃciency, whether that's through work with our supply chain or some of the location
opportunities for the teams, but that's the overall, both opportunity and expense
implication.
Okay. Let's shift to YouTube and sort of strategic priorities. Maybe just to level set for
everyone, what are sort of the one or two key areas of investment and prioritization
on YouTube when it comes to the user oﬀering, the advertiser oﬀering, the overall
ecosystem?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well, I'm just saying as you're asking, next year, we can do this as a YouTube Shorts.
So overall, YouTube is an extraordinary asset. It's just billions of engaged people
globally. And whenever we talk about billions of engaged people globally, we start
with the creators. So, the creator ecosystem for YouTube is really special, and it's
really because of the opportunity as we've grown with them to express themselves
on so many diﬀerent platforms and to monetize across the platform. So, whether it's
long-form video, short, podcast, livestream, music, you name it. You've got the
breadth of opportunity on YouTube, and that creator ecosystem, it creates this
virtuous circle with users and advertisers.
In terms of the opportunities, there are a number of them. One is Shorts. We're super
excited about the momentum in Shorts, up to 50 billion views at the end of last year,
that's relative to 30 billion back in the spring daily and just continued ongoing really
extraordinary strength. And we're continuing to work to build that out. The other is
Connected TV. Living room continues to be the fastest-growing screen and we're
excited at another place where AI is relevant both for user experience, but also for
advertisers. On the subscription side, it's an incredible opportunity. We're now at 80
million subscribers for YouTube Music Premium, more than 5 million for YouTube TV.
And really pleased with how the team has grown that. And then longer term, we're
looking at making YouTube more shoppable. So, we're excited about YouTube.
AI goes across all those.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
It does, and have for a while.
Yes. YouTube Shorts, 50 billion views. Can you give us an update on sort of the
monetization of Shorts and where you are? And maybe just sort of a philosophical
question. If you think about the potential ad revenue per hour on Shorts versus other
forms of longer form video content on YouTube, do you see those eventually
reaching parity? Or do you think there's going to be a diﬀerence in what an hour of
Shorts monetizes that versus other forms of content on YouTube?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-08

Page 9 of 11A - Ruth M. Porat
Q - Analyst

Q - Analyst
A - Ruth M. Porat{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So a lot of questions in there. So, YouTube Shorts, we have been investing to really
continue to build out what we're oﬀering with YouTube Shorts. And it's, again,
another area where AI can be helpful to creators as they're continuing to develop
content. We look forward to rolling out more there.
In terms of your core question on monetization, we talked about the monetization
plan some time ago. We launched it last month and the feedback has been very
positive. And this goes to my prior point, which is creators on the YouTube platform
have the beneﬁt of billions of users globally and then these multiple formats that
they can -- they really can draw from and we think that's a real asset, but
monetization is early days. The feedback is positive. You're absolutely right, there is a
gap to the traditional long form and we're working to close that gap. But it's still very,
very early days.
Okay. YouTube, the other -- one of the other recent announcements was the Sunday
ticket, and so reaching a deal to distribute the NFL Sunday ticket. What excites you
most about adding the Sunday Ticket to YouTube? And how should we think about
the ROI math done around that investment?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So the ROI math is that we expect to generate an attractive ROI over the life of the
deal. And we're focused on a couple of things. One is the opportunity to continue to
extend subscribers -- grow subscribers on YouTube TV. The second is the
opportunity to oﬀer a standalone premium channel subscription for the NFL Sunday
Ticket, so distinct from YouTube TV subscription. The -- and so -- and the third, which
I think is really interesting is the opportunity with our top YouTube creators to oﬀer
them exclusive NFL content and see what they can do. And so again, we see a
number of diﬀerent paths.
Okay. Excited to see those. One more on AI. On generative AI speciﬁcally because
that does seem like another potential unlock for YouTube. I know there's this sort of
this discussion of how quickly will these tools develop and scale and be rolled out.
Just as you sort of when you talk to the YouTube teams and the engineers, how far
away are we from having scaled creator and advertiser generative AI tools that can
be rolled out and used by the hundreds of millions or billions of people on
YouTube?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well, I want to start, and again, I keep going back to this, but we are building on
years of using AI sort of to your question within YouTube as well. And I've already
mentioned things like the recommendations engine or what we're doing with
advertisers on PMax that's also beneﬁting YouTube. I think where you're going is
what about generative AI for storytelling or other areas. And we do look forward to,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-08

Page 10 of 11Q - Analyst
A - Ruth M. Porat
Q - Analyst
A - Ruth M. Poratas I said, launching our various applications here of LLMs and the concept of
storytelling is a valuable part of it.
Okay. One more on cloud. The cloud segment, you had about mid-to-high 30s
growth for the total segment in 2022, I think 37% growth. Just talk to us about sort of
the key areas of strategic diﬀerentiation for cloud to drive outsized growth versus the
other competitors in the public cloud space.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So we keep coming back to the same couple of key drivers. One is our infrastructure,
our AI infrastructure, TPUs and GPUs that lets them run AI models. That's valuable.
Our data analytics, our extraordinary -- our cybersecurity has consistently been
leading edge and being able to add Mandiant into the family as the ability to have
early incident response capabilities. And so, that whole suite is super valuable and
then as well our industry solutions. And when I'm with cloud customers, a couple --
to your question, a couple of things that are called out, and you'll be hearing more
of is Vertex AI, which really is a lightweight, simple way for our enterprise customers
really to run AI models. And they don't need an AI scientist internally and so super
valuable.
And one that we've been doing for quite some time, but given a lot of the discussion
around conversational AI is all of the work with our contact center AI, which provides
extraordinary operating leverage for our enterprise customers. CSAT scores are up,
costs are down, and it's really leveraging our contact center AI. Verizon has talked
about this a bunch as have many others. And so, there are a number of examples
where, again, we're leveraging AI on behalf of customers and it's both within our
infrastructure and our capabilities.
Okay. I want to close on capital allocation. In 2021, you bought back $50 billion of
equity; 2022, almost $60 billion of share repurchases. Just remind us again sort of
philosophically, how do you come up with these numbers? Like, how do you sort of
think about what is the right amount of capital to be returning to shareholders? And
what about the debate between buybacks versus the dividend as you compete for
capital?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well, our framework for capital return is -- our capital allocation is unchanged. It
starts with what do we need in the business to support the organic growth of the
business, and it then goes to acquisitions or strategic investments. And then we're
very pleased to have this third lever, which is return of capital. At this point, we
continue to believe that the share repurchase program is the most eﬀective return of
capital to shareholders and are pleased to have done $60 billion last year, and that's
both the As and the Cs, and it was great to be able to have both of those in the
program. To your question, we look at the form and size with the Board on a prettyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-08
