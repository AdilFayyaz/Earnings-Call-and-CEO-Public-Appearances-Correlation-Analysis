computers that learn from data to write software. AI is software that writes software.
AI writes software diﬀerently, and the software written by AI is processed diﬀerently.
Nvidia recognized this mean and pivoted the full force of our company to reinvent
computing from the ground up. Our invention of accelerated computing, and our
full stack reimagining of data center scale computing, has enabled a million times
advance in AI over the past decade.
AI is now transforming every industry and the stunning advances in AI have opened
the door to take on some of the world's grandest challenges, such as drug discovery,
and climate science. Last year, we announced our Cambridge-1 and Earth-2
initiatives.
Cambridge-1 is our AI computing center that hosts research collaborations with the
healthcare and life sciences community to apply AI breakthroughs, to drug
discovery. Earth-2 is our digital twin of our planet's climate system. It's built on
advances in Nvidias AI, computers, inventions and AI physics algorithms and it's the
result of collaborations with leading climate scientists.
Earth-2 will emulate the complex multi physics of Earth's atmosphere, land and sea
to predict climate change decades from now, at speeds and record resolutions,
millions to billions times faster than possible today.
We hope to create a system that can help scientists industry and policymakers
predict the regional impact of climate change and simulate the eﬀects of mitigation
and adaptation strategies. Let me now turn to our business and our work to reinvent
computing.
We had an excellent year, a record year. Full-year revenue was 26.9 1 billion of 61%
from 16.68 billion a year ago. Gross margins increased 120 basis points year-on-year
to 66.8%. Operating income increased 87% year-on-year to $12.7 billion and earnings
per share increased 78% year-on-year to $4.44. We returned $399 million dollars
during the year to shareholders through quarterly cash dividends.
Our top priority remains the expansion of Nvidia accelerated computing, creating
software systems, chips that serve more computing environments, markets and
applications within each market. Our company has built like a computing stack in
four layers: hardware, system software, platform software, and applications. Each
layer is open to computer makers, service providers and developers to integrate
with their systems.
We now serve over 3 million developers. Our products are available from every
major computer maker and in every cloud. More than two -- more than 25,000
companies have adopted our platform across $100 trillion worth of industries. Over
the last year, we expanded our platform in new dimensions and directions as we
added new chips, systems, and software that open new market opportunities.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

a new generation of self-driving cars, trucks, Robo taxis, delivery robots, warehouse
movers, farming robots and more. We created ORAN -- we created ORAN for a near
future where everything that moves will have autonomous capabilities.
Our new Grace CPU architecture oﬀers ultra-fast data processing for AI and machine
learning. New software opens new markets. Nvidias SDKs provide complex
algorithms and engineering an optimized CUDA libraries. Nvidia SDKs are at the
center of accelerated computing.
Nvidia RTX for graphics, Nvidia HPC for scientiﬁc computing, Nvidia AI for data
science and AI, Nvidia drive and Isaac for autonomous vehicles and robots, and
Nvidia Omniverse our physically accurate simulation platform for developing and
operating ﬂeets of autonomous systems like cars and trucks, and places like
warehouses and factories.
Omniverse is a platform for robotics systems, the next wave of AI. This year, we
began oﬀering enterprise software licenses and support models for Nvidia AI, Nvidia
Drive, and Nvidia Omniverse. New Software new systems and new chips create new
growth opportunities.
Since 1993, we've repeated we've repeatedly reinvented computer graphics; the
GPU, programmable shading, material simulation, and in 2018, RTX real-time ray
tracing and AI image synthesis. Nvidia RTX uses ray tracing and artiﬁcial intelligence
to approximate the physics of light and materials to generate photorealistic virtual
worlds.
Like a time machine RTX made real-time photorealistic 3d graphics possible 10 years
earlier than predicted. More than 250 games and apps have incorporated RTX from
Fortnite to Adobe Photoshop. RTX gives creators a virtual showroom, architecture
walkthroughs products, product conﬁgurators and digital arts our powerful new tool.
Over 200 million gamers and creators use NVIDIA GeForce GPUs. In the coming
years, nearly everyone can be a creator. Hundreds of millions of creators will build
virtual worlds on platforms like Fortnite, Roblox and Nvidia Omniverse.
We're all-hands-on-deck to advance the NVIDIA AI platform, solve new problems
and make AI more accessible from PC, Cloud and Enterprise data centers to the
industrial edge and robotic systems. Companies from nearly every industry are
processing and reﬁning their raw data to make AI software. Today a manufacturer is a
company that makes things. In the future all companies will be manufacturers. They
will be manufacturers of intelligence, and data centers will be their AI factories.
At GTC 2022, we announced the largest rollout of hardware in our history, the Nvidia
H100 GPU is the new engine of the world's AI infrastructure. The Grace CPU
Superchip, our entry into CPU, comes packed with one terabytes per second
memory bandwidth, and twice the energy eﬃciency of high performance CPUs.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

Grace and Hopper honor Grace Brewster Murray Hopper, a United States Navy Rear
Admiral and pioneer of computer programming. She conceived a device
independent programming languages, and found the world's ﬁrst computer bug, a
moth [ph] in the mark two computer at Harvard.
On the networking side, Nvidia Spectrum 4 will be the world's ﬁrst 800 gigabits per
second networking switch. Nvidia GPU, CPU and networking systems form the
foundation of our computing platform and the industry's AI factories. We are
building the world's AI infrastructure from end to end.
Bringing Omniverse to market was a huge endeavor, setting the stage for the next
wave of AI and opening a new chapter for Nvidia. Omniverse is a 3d simulation
engine to build and connect virtual worlds. Designers from various departments will
work together in Omniverse throughout the entire product lifecycle.
Companies will design, train and simulate AI powered robotic systems in Omniverse
deploy the AI software into the ﬂeet, and mimic the ﬂeet with a digital twin. Just as AI
has revolutionized how software is written and deployed, AI will revolutionize how
machines are built and operated.
A whole new level of eﬃciency and automation is coming to the world's largest
industries. Amazon is using Nvidia Omniverse digital twins to optimize the design
and ﬂow of its warehouses and train more intelligent robotic systems. PepsiCo uses -

metropolitan environments.
The Omniverse ecosystem has expanded quickly in its ﬁrst year. We have over 80
software tools connected to Omniverse across design, rendering, robotics and
digital twins, and industrial automation system.
Omniverse has been downloaded over 150,000 times by individual creators. We
imagine a day when Omniverse connects tens of millions of designers, creators,
roboticist and AI researchers. Nearly 30 years of Nvidia graphics physics simulation
AI and computing expertise made Omniverse possible.

Questions And Answers
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thanks, Jensen. We'll now move to Q&A. Let's start with a question we received from
shareholders on how we see our growth potential this year and next year. Then a
related one on how our strategy might change if the economy slows down.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

We grew our revenue by a factor of four in just the last ﬁve years. As we look out
through the rest of this year, and into next year, we continue to see strong growth
potential for our company. We're kicking oﬀ some of the biggest new product cycles
in our history. Let me quickly outline the four big ones.
First, in the data center, which is now our biggest business, we have just launched
our newest GPU, Hopper. Hopper is another giant leap in AI computing, and is the
new engine world's AI infrastructure and we expect it to do very well across the
board from Cloud and hyperscale to enterprise customers of all sizes. Along with our
new quantum and NV linked networking platforms, this will be a giant data center
refresh.
Second, early next year, we're launching our ﬁrst ever data center CPU, Grace. This
will open up a big new opportunity for Nvidia that we've never participated in. Third,
gaming has become the world's number one form of entertainment, and is
continuing to expand. In just the last two years 100 million more gamers are playing
on PCs.
And forth in auto, we are ramping up our new ORAN robotics processor, a ﬁrst of its
kind processor built for autonomous vehicles and robotic systems. More than 35
automakers, Robo taxi, trucks, and autonomous delivery vehicles have chosen ORAN
for their AV platforms. We expect auto to become our next multibillion dollar
business.
So all in we're ramping major new processors, each of them unsurpassed in their
markets, and serving some of the highest growth markets, AI data center gaming
and autonomous vehicles.
Now, you also asked about our strategy and potential economic slowdown. The
product cycles, I just outlined position as well for continued growth. Still, we're
disciplined in our investment pace to balance long-term growth and continued
ﬁnancial performance. We've hired great talent this year and we're going to slow
down hiring for the rest of the year, to be sure that we can support our current
employees through this macro backdrop and inﬂation.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. The next question is, can you talk a little bit about our strategy in the
automotive space and our competitive diﬀerentiation?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We have a very unique strategy in auto. Building an autonomous ﬂeet requires two
computer systems; an AI Data Center to develop the AV software and an AV
computer in the car to run the software. It also requires four major software stacks;
the data collection and processing, model training, mapping and simulation, and the
self-driving car application.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

AV computer. Nvidia AI is our data processing and AI training software platform.
Nvidia Omniverse is the simulation software platform. Nvidia Deep Map is our
mapping platform. And Nvidia Drive AV is our car self-driving application.
We're building a fully drivable ﬂeet of autonomous vehicles. Yet our platform is open
and customers can engage us however they wish. They can adopt parts of our
platform or take it in its entirety.
The Nvidia drive computer and software will power all new Mercedes Benz models
starting in 2024 and all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles starting in 2025. All in
our AV platform has been chosen by over 35 automakers, truck makers, Robo taxi
companies, adding up to an $11 billion design win pipeline over the next six years.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Could you also talk about our strategy in healthcare and the technologies we have to
address the opportunities?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Our technologies make a huge contribution to healthcare. We're working on
bringing the power of AI to a number of ﬁelds, from medical devices to robotic
surgery, genomics and drug discovery.
Nvidia Clara is our platform for bringing AI and accelerated computing to the
healthcare and life sciences industries. Nvidia Clara has two major pillars. Clara
Holoscan is a computing platform that features our AI and image processing
expertise for medical imaging and diagnostic instruments. And Clara Discovery
combines the power of AI and scientiﬁc computing for researchers to apply digital
biology approaches to accelerate drug discovery. Nvidia can make a meaningful
contribution to healthcare.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. The next set of questions we received relate to our gaming business.
Speciﬁcally, what percent of our gaming revenue is coming from crypto mining? And
what are we doing to address this market while ensuring GPU supply to gamers?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Let me ﬁrst provide some context. The cryptocurrency market is not a strategic focus
for our company. That said, just like any other high performance computing
application, crypto mining can be done on GPUs. Over the past few quarters when
mining activity surged, we worked hard to prioritize our limited GPU supply for
gamers rather than miners.
We did that in two ways. First, we create a crypto mining processors or CMP for
professional miners. Last year, that contributed 2% of our total revenue, though we
don't expect the meaningful contribution going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

A - Jensen HuangSecond, we implemented light hash rate technology to our GeForce GPUs to reduce
their mining hash rate and help steer GeForce applied to gamers. It is diﬃcult to
quantify the contribution of crypto mining to gaming revenue as we don't have
perfect visibility into the end use of our GPUs.
Looking ahead, we see reduced demand for crypto mining as cryptocurrency prices
have decreased, which should further help with improving the availability of GeForce
GPUs to gamers.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. Next set is a question on what actions if any, were taken to reduce our
dependence on manufacturing abroad?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Nvidia relies on the services of third-party companies called foundries to
manufacture our chips. Our chips are among the most advanced in the world and
require the most advanced manufacturing processes.
Today there are two global foundries that provide these processes, TSMC in Taiwan,
and Samsung in Korea. We have a long and great partnership with both foundries,
which has allowed us to deliver tremendous growth despite the semiconductor
shortages throughout the industry.
We continue to advance our multiple supplier resiliency. We are sourcing multiple
suppliers, multiple solutions on multiple continents to support our future product
development and manufacturing.
As advanced fabs become available in the United States, we expect to manufacture
some of our products domestically. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel are in the process of
building advanced fabs in the US. We look forward to supporting our growth with
domestic manufacturing by our partners.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. A number of questions came in regarding the supply constraints that
have been impacting both Nvidia and the broader industry, and in particular, in
areas such as gaming and automotive. Can you talk a little bit about what we're
doing to mitigate these issues, both in the short term and the longer term?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yes. You can think about the supply constraints in two categories; those that aﬀect
our chips and products, and those that aﬀect our OEM and ODM products and
systems, which contain our products.
Both supply categories are needed for producing products for end-customer
demand. Both have been a factor over the past few quarters, but only have the
ability to -- we only have the ability to address the ﬁrst one. So let me talk about that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 13A - Simona Jankowski
A - Jensen Huang
A - Simona Jankowski
A - Jensen HuangDemand has been exceeding supply across most of our businesses, particularly in
gaming and networking. Our constraints have been in many areas, from wafers to
components, and overall logistics. To help address these, we have procured long
lead time supply components. And for some, we have even prepaid for supply and
capacity to support our growth this year and beyond.
We expect to see a step-up in supply in the second half of this year and that should
help support the ramp of multiple product cycles we spoke about a few minutes
ago. So overall, we expect much better availability of our gaming products for the
holidays, though there will still be some pockets of supply constrained in our
broader portfolio.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Next we received a question on how the Russia Ukraine war may have impacted our
revenue and our supply?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
First, let me say our hearts go out to all those impacted by the war in Ukraine. We
paused selling into Russia in Q1. Historically, Russia represented about 2% of our
revenue, with most of that in gaming.
Looking forward in Q2 -- looking forward to Q2, as we detailed our earnings report
last week, we have assumed a negative impact to our revenue of approximately
$500 million relating to Russia and the China COVID lockdowns. About half of that
impact relates to Russia. From a supply standpoint, we do anticipate supply issues to
remain as our partners are challenged with delivery and logistics issues.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. Moving to the topic of capital allocation, we received several questions
here, including whether we will increase our dividends, continue to buy back our
stock and also consider putting the stock again. Could you speak to that?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Our company generates a lot of cash and capital allocation is a top priority. First and
foremost, we are investing for growth -- we are investing for growth as our as we
have tremendous opportunity ahead of us. The vast majority of our investment is
organic.
We consider M&A opportunities, if it is a good strategic and cultural ﬁt. Our
acquisition of Mellanox is an excellent example of this. In addition, we have resumed
our stock buyback program. In Q1, we repurchased 8 million shares of our stock for
$2 billion.
Our board recently increased and extended our share repurchase program so that
we are authorized to repurchase up to $15 billion through December 2023. We are
committed to maintaining our dividend.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02

A - Jensen HuangWith respect to the question on splitting our stock. We have split our stock ﬁve times
since inception, most recently last year. We've reviewed this periodically. We
consider a stock split if it is in the best interest of our shareholders.
{BIO 7131672 <GO>}
Thank you. I think we have time for one last question, which is on our sustainability
eﬀorts. Could you talk a bit about what we're doing to improve and address climate
change?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We contribute eﬀorts to reverse climate change through the technology we invent,
the science we enable and our operations. Our technology is driving advances for
modeling our climate, reducing carbon emission, and designing mitigation and
adaptation strategies in the changing world.
Climate scientists use NVIDIA GPUs to model climate scenarios and predict weather
patterns. With recent advances in AI, modeling of weather forecasting can now be
done four to ﬁve magnitudes faster than by using traditional methods. Last year, we
announced plans to build Earth-2, AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the
impacts of climate change.
Earth-2 will be a climate digital twin of the Earth, enabling scientists to do ultra-high
resolution climate modeling and put tools into the hands of cities and nations to
simulate the impact of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Nvidia scientists along
with Stanford, Caltech and Purdue recently developed a novel AI technique to
predict the pressure buildup caused by capturing CO2 by injecting into deep rock to
mitigate climate change.
The process can capture CO2, but also fractured geological formations and leak
carbon into aquifers. This AI model helps scientists ﬁnd an optimal site and injection
rate. To achieve net zero emission, the world needs to reduce or capture billions of
tons of carbon dioxide in the coming decades. Accelerating this process will
undoubtedly help us reach carbon neutrality at a much higher rate.
Nvidias top contribution is with deep computer science. Nvidia GPUs are typically 20
times more energy eﬃcient for AI and HPC workloads and CPUs. If we switched all
CPU only running servers, running AI and HPC worldwide to GPU accelerated
systems, the world could save nearly 12 trillion watt hours of energy a year,
equivalent to the electricity required of nearly 1.7 million US homes.
We aim to make every generation of GPUs faster and more energy eﬃcient than its
predecessor. Our ampere GPU architecture is up to 20 times faster for AI, and up to
seven and a half times more energy eﬃcient than its previous generation. Our
newest GPU, the Hopper-based H100, we take yet another giant leap forward.
And operationally, we have a goal of sourcing 100% renewable electricity for oﬃces
and data centers by the end of ﬁscal year 2025. And Voyager and Endeavour ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-02
