Thanks a lot. We will keep things moving along this morning with the leading
specialty coﬀee retailer in the world, Starbucks. Very pleased to have Troy Alstead,
the CFO, looming behind me here. And JoAnn DeGrande, who runs the Investor
Relations function at the dais, or table, or whatever we want to call that.
The Company has had a very signiﬁcant run since some challenges that they
addressed very quickly and swiftly in the downturn and recession. And I think
probably puts Starbucks, which as many of you know has been a remarkable growth
story, on more solid footing than at any time I think I can remember in terms of just
core fundamentals in terms of the top-line proﬁtability and growth. And with that, I
will stop and let Troy tell you the real story.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone. It is great to be here. The store behind
me is a store that is opened about a year and a half ago in -- south of Seattle. It is in
the industrial area near the Port of Seattle. It is made from four reclaimed shipping
containers. It is LEED certiﬁed, as are all of our -- the goal for all of our new stores to
be built going forward. This is a highly proﬁtable drive-through store with also a
walk-up window. And many people use it as a bike-up window, as well.
It is in a great location. It has won many national and international design awards for
the innovation of this design. And it is an example of our ability to continue to
innovate against the store concept, the store design, while we also innovate against
beverage opportunities, food and everything else we do in our business. So a very
good reﬂection of the growth opportunities we have to come. Incidentally, if we ever
had to relocate this store, that would be quite easy to do.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18

Page 2 of 12Starbucks has always been a growth company. Since the early days as a privately-
held company and then over the last two decades as a publicly-traded company, we
have been deﬁned as a growth company, largely during that period of time by
growth in new stores. And particularly for much of that history, growth in new stores
within the US.
Since the diﬃculties of 2008 and 2009, we have really diversiﬁed and matured our
growth strategies, crafted a whole new set of strategies and plans and initiatives
around driving growth multidimensionally throughout the business. And I will spend
a little bit of time this morning taking you through a few of those, what we believe to
be the most signiﬁcant opportunities we have.
We are targeting to deliver 10% or greater revenue growth on a sustainable annual
basis. In 2012, we delivered revenue growth of 12 -- of 14% -- excuse me. In this
current ﬁscal year, ﬁscal 2013, we anticipate by the end of the year driving revenue
growth between 10% and 13%. And I think by the time we get toward the end of the
year here, we will be right somewhere in the middle of that range.
We are also targeting leveraging that 10% revenue growth into more rapid earnings
growth as we expand margins over this period of time, targeting 15% to 20%
sustainable growth in earnings. And over the past three years, we've delivered
compound growth rate and earnings of 19%. So toward the top end of that
sustainable range that we are driving for. And in this current ﬁscal year, our current-
year target ranges between 18% and 22% earnings growth, with a signiﬁcant number
of investments we are making back into the business this year to drive growth in
future years. Then beneﬁted a bit by commodities favorable this year, after a few
years of some diﬃculties in commodities, that is helping boost us toward the top
end of that range and perhaps tipping a little bit beyond that 15% to 20% range that
we have targeted.
Now, the opportunities that we face are multiple. And they include the traditional
store growth that we've historically executed very well. But also a range of those.
And I intend to take you through a few of those highlights today, starting with food.
Food ranges around the world within a Starbucks store from a low end of about 10%
of the sales mix in some markets around the world to a high end nearing 30% in
other markets around the world. In the US, food is about 19% of the sales mix within
a store. Approximately 1/3 of our transactions in US stores have a food item on them.
Two thirds of those transactions do not have food on them. And that really
represents the opportunity as we see yet.
Of those two thirds of the people, 50 million to 60 million customers coming into
our stores every week, many of those two thirds of the people want food. We've
already acquired that customer. They've come in the store. They are interested in
food. They are ready to give us money. And yet the barriers historically to us
capturing more of that two thirds have really been twofold, as we understand our
customer.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 12One has been our food often historically has not met their expectations. It has not
been up to the quality they expect when they come into the Starbucks. The second
barrier has been it hasn't always matched the occasion. So the daypart. In our early
days, our food was primarily oriented toward that morning daypart. We didn't have
lunch oﬀerings. We didn't have something that was appropriate in the afternoon if a
customer was coming in.
Over the last several years, we've really signiﬁcantly addressed and continue to
address both of those barriers by elevating the quality of our food, by improving the
execution in the store and also by increasingly innovating -- just as we do with
beverages, innovating against the dayparts, going after that midday daypart.
Innovating with food into the afternoon and evening, where we know in those
dayparts, food is a more meaningful driver of that customer's decision to come in
the store than it is in the morning, where it is primarily a beverage-focused
transaction.
The result of that has been not that many years ago food being in the low teens as a
% of sales in the US, with a much lower attach rate. We have slowly. But surely, been
addressing the barriers to that customer purchase and moving that sales mix and
that attach rate higher. And that is all before the La Boulange acquisition.
What has encouraged us going forward is the early results of our new food program,
starting with bakery with the La Boulange execution ﬁrst in the Bay Area, more
broadly in Northern California, very recently in the Seattle market, as we just
launched there a week ago; and then we will continue launching this new bakery
program city-by-city across the US over the balance of this year and for about the
next 18 months before we are fully penetrated.
The conﬁdence we've had from what we've done with food in years past and the
early -- very early results we are seeing in our new markets with La Boulange gives us
conﬁdence in our ability to continue driving that attach rate higher and driving the
sales mix in food higher.
What is important about food is it has two opportunities here. One is to attach more
food to those existing transactions, those customers who are already in the store. But
we also know that food can be a driver of traﬃc. It can create an opportunity for
somebody to come in in the afternoon at midday when perhaps otherwise they
would have made a diﬀerent choice. And better food also sells more beverage. So
we see a tremendous opportunity here with food as a consistent driver of growth
over time.
Now, as excited as we are about food, the core -- the largest part of our sales mix,
the core of our business and where we have signiﬁcantly continued to innovate is
within the beverage category. Just in the Second Quarter alone, we had three points
of incremental comp coming from new beverage innovations, three particular
products, shown here actually. The Refreshers platform, which was an entirely new
platform -- not just a product, a platform of products that we launched for the ﬁrstFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 12time last summer. It is going after an entirely diﬀerent consumer need state, that
refreshment category that we had not historically really addressed in our portfolio of
product oﬀerings. It really targets an entirely new daypart. It helps stretch people
into that underleveraged time of the day when we have signiﬁcant opportunity. And
by itself, added about a point of incremental comp in that Second Quarter that we
just reported.
I also list up here two other beverage innovations that are right in the heart of what
we do, Hazelnut Macchiato and Vanilla Spice Latte. I call out that in particular
because together, they give us about two points of incremental comp in that Second
Quarter. But particularly to make the point that those espresso beverages are right
down the middle of where the largest part of our sales mix is within the store, in that
espresso category. And it is even in that large, very mature, very established category
within a Starbucks store, we continue to innovate and clearly continue to have
opportunity to drive incremental volumes through the stores, very proﬁtably, with
beverage innovation.
I mentioned the store upfront. And I will comment on stores here again. Now, our
store opportunity going forward is both as we remodel stores. This is a Times Square
store that we remodeled about a year, year and a half ago. It is the number one
volume store in the US for us at about $6 million AUV. And it is representative of our
ability to take existing stores and either remodel and in some cases expand where
that opportunity exists, create a signiﬁcant brand platform and drive signiﬁcant
volumes through those stores.
Now, not every location in the country or in the world is a Times Square kind of traﬃc
location. Our second-highest volume store is the Pike Place store in Seattle -- 1200
square feet, a limited oﬀering. There is no food oﬀered in the store. It is really the
original of the concept only with beverages in the store. And yet this is a $5.5 million
AUV that continues to comp very strongly. Proﬁtability, four-wall cash proﬁt in the
store is in the upper 30s. It is a very good representation of our ability through a
relatively small footprint to continue to grow and innovate and drive continued traﬃc
over time.
The third highest-volume store in the US is traveling all the way down to Houston,
where we have this drive-through store. It is a beautiful store. It is an extremely high-
volume store. And it is reﬂective of our opportunity as we go forward about adding
drive-throughs increasingly into the mix. About 40% of our US portfolio today is in
drive-through stores. Going forward, our growth in new stores in the US will be
about 60% drive-throughs or greater, as we continue to recognize an ongoing
opportunity to get better at how we operationalize through the drive-through and
then also how that opens up new real estate opportunities for us.
By the way, we are increasingly looking at drive-throughs in selected markets around
the world where we are highly underpenetrated. But recognize we have a signiﬁcant
opportunity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 12Now if any of you have ever traveled between LA and Bakersﬁeld, California, you will
know there is not a whole lot there. But right in the middle of that stretch there is a
Starbucks drive-through store. That is in the top ﬁve volume stores in the US for us as
well. And again, represents and underscores the opportunity for us with drive-
throughs. But also increasingly, as we have sharpened our abilities around our
supply chain into our stores, as we've deepened our capabilities around operating
proﬁtably, as we've increasingly managed our ability to select sites and execute
those sites, it has opened up for us increasing opportunities for real estate. And it
represents an example of why we continue to believe that even in the US, where we
have obviously our longest-standing marketplace, the most stores anywhere in the
world, that we continue to add hundreds of new stores per year here within the US,
both by adding depth within the existing trade areas and in many cases reaching
into new market opportunities that we couldn't have reached historically.
In the last several years in particular, really since the challenges of 2008 and 2009,
we have signiﬁcantly deepened our capabilities around real estate site selection,
around understanding trade areas, around store design, around innovating around
the concept. We've become much better operators of stores within the stores, about
managing waste and managing and deploying labor. We've become much more
selective about how to size a store for a particular trade area. We understand
cannibalization than we ever have before. And that has opened up all kinds of
innovative depth of opportunities for us, including a ski-up store that you see here in
one of the ski areas, including a store that will open up here in a few months. It is a
train car that is actually in the Swiss train system, an entire Starbucks store that will
travel with that train. And we are very excited about that opportunity. And is
reﬂective of our opportunities in the US and around the world.
Now, tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world, second only to water.
It is an ancient beverage and yet at the same time it is a beverage platform and
category that has many new, innovative, exciting things happening with it in the US
and around the world, as there is a bit of a revitalization in consumers' interest
around tea, recognizing its health and wellness beneﬁts and the aspects of tea. And
with all that said, tea for Starbucks has remained in the single-digits share of sales
within a Starbucks store.
Now, tea has been in the name of Starbucks when we opened the concept,
Starbucks Coﬀee, Tea & Spices, way back in 1971. We have equities in this space. We
have customer permission in this space. And yet it has never had the focus and
attention in our stores and outside of our stores that we can now bring to it.
We are very excited about tea as an opportunity in our stores. And the Teavana
acquisition that we completed just recently brings with it three propositions, three
growth opportunities. One is to continue rolling the Teavana store out, by bringing
together the deep capabilities that Teavana team has in tea sourcing and blending
and R&D that they are very deep and strong in, as well as their merchandising
capabilities within the existing Teavana stores. And combining that with what
Starbucks does well, store operations, store design, labor deployment, site selection.
And importantly, beverage execution and innovation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 12A new generation of Teavana stores will begin opening up this fall, will look and feel
much like Teavana of old. But will bring with it new elements of beverage execution
and innovation in the store that we believe will add a new layer of growth and open
up signiﬁcant growth opportunities for the Teavana standalone concept in the years
ahead. We are very excited to begin rolling that across the US, again, starting in New
York beginning this fall. And ultimately, there is tremendous opportunities we know
around the world for a contemporary teahouse concept that we believe we can
execute quite eﬀectively.
The second strategy and leg of growth for tea for us is to now deepen our tea
presence within the Starbucks stores, or really use tea as a driver of another
customer occasion, another customer visit. It is a very complementary consumption
time to coﬀee. Coﬀee to the American consumer tends to be busy and rapid and
skewed toward the morning. Tea is a little more relaxing and Zen-like and skews to
the afternoon and evening and weekends, very complementary to that existing asset
we have. With Teavana's capabilities around tea and our ability to bring beverage
innovation in a focused way to tea, just as we have to coﬀee and now to food, we
believe we have an increasing opportunity to use tea as another layer of growth
within the Starbucks store over time.
Then the third opportunity with Teavana, in particular, is to use that as a leverage
point into CPG channels over time. Once we establish the brand more meaningfully,
create awareness through the Teavana stores and through the Starbucks stores, we
have an opportunity to then extend that, both in dry tea and ultimately perhaps
ready-to-drink tea and other tea innovations in a packaged format into the CPG
channels over time.
Another opportunity and geographically was China Asia-Paciﬁc for us. Our CAP
region is the fastest-growing region of the world for Starbucks. And it is also the
highest margin and highest return on capital region of the world for us. It continues
to be a signiﬁcant opportunity.
And in China, which gets a great deal of airtime and is a huge opportunity and will
very soon become our second-largest market anywhere in the world. But also in
India, a market we just opened a few months ago and are seeing tremendous early
results from. Vietnam, also a new market we opened. Indonesia, a place we've been
in for many years now. But has signiﬁcant long-term opportunity, both in store
development and then outside of the store. Products like ready-to-drink beverages,
for example, we have a signiﬁcant opportunity in many of these Asian markets to
deepen our presence and expand the Starbucks reach into the consumer through
our brands and products and channel opportunities.
Speaking of channel opportunities, channel development is a part of the business
that consumers have told us too over the years -- with the deep history of Starbucks,
as you know, being in the Starbucks' store, we have come to recognize more
strategically over time that there is a signiﬁcant opportunity to go after customer
occasions of our brands and products and the oﬀerings we have outside of that
Starbucks store. That is largely focused today in the US, with all of our productsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Q - Andy Barish
A - Troy Alsteadaround packaged coﬀee, singleserve, ready to drink, VIA, many opportunities within
that core of the coﬀee and tea space and some adjacencies right around that that we
are proﬁtably developing and growing within the US and increasing outside of the
US. It leads us to believe that in the next ﬁve years, channel development will be
among the fastest-growing parts of our business anywhere that we have, as we
continue to extend, again, our reach to the consumer outside of the traditional
Starbucks store.
All of that growth really empowered by what we do digitally. We've had signiﬁcant
success in reaching our customers digitally, signiﬁcant beneﬁts both in terms of cost.
But also the halo that comes from providing these opportunities around payment
methods and loyalty to the customer. The Starbucks card in all its entirety. And that
means the physical card. But also mobile forms of card -- store value card payments
represents now greater than 30%, almost 1/3 of transactions in our US system.
The loyalty program in the US just introduced a couple years ago represents now
25% and rapidly growing of our US transactions. Mobile payment, not launched all
that long ago, represents greater than 10% now of our US transactions. A signiﬁcant
opportunity to, again, continue to drive eﬃciencies, speed of service, a lower cost
transaction within our store, a very sticky transaction by virtue of the fact that people
have preloaded their money that we hold for them in anticipation of that coming
transaction. And increasingly, an ability for us to harvest that information and really
determine the most eﬀective ways over time to understand our customer, to target
products toward them and, in the appropriate ways, reach them with our messages.
All of that again represents a snapshot of where we today see our most signiﬁcant
growth opportunities. There is many more beyond that. But perhaps I will pause at
this point and hand it back to you, Andy, for any questions or any questions that you
may have.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1512077 <GO>}
Sure. I'll kick things oﬀ. I was actually shocked to see the China food number at the
bottom on the list. I thought -- if my recollection serves me correctly -- when you
originally opened in that market, it was mostly an afternoon tea time food business.
So can you kind of give us an update? It seems as if maybe the coﬀee culture is
starting to take hold in China and it has obviously become much more of a beverage
business.
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Well it has always been skewed toward a beverage business. But when we've
opened up in China, the dayparts were, yes, skewed more toward midday and into
the afternoon, with a very low, almost nonexistent morning occasion.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 12Q - Andy Barish
A - Troy Alstead
Q - Andy BarishWhat has happened over time is, yes, the beverage business has grown, the
awareness of Starbucks' products and that learning and that experience around how
to ask for a Starbucks beverage and how to enjoy those beverages and how to use
the Starbucks concept, all of that has grown over time. And yes, that has more
pronounced driven the beverage business in our stores, which is very critical to our
concept. It has also driven the morning a bit faster, where we really see that morning
experience developing increasingly in China. We actually see the opportunity both
to drive AUVs in China through food, through dayparts, through the frequency of
that visit. But also increasingly through our beverage innovation and the attachment
of food to it over time.
{BIO 1512077 <GO>}
And can you give us just a quick update on China unit economics, sort of trendwise?
Are you seeing any -- as the Tier 1 cities get a little bit more crowded and
competitive, are you seeing any changes in that, good or bad?
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
We are still small and fairly early in our experiences in China. We've actually been in
China since the late '90s. But we reached something of a tipping point, I would say,
three or four years ago, where all these classes of stores really signiﬁcantly elevated
in terms of comp growth and volumes through those stores. I think that was about
reaching an awareness in that marketplace.
In our early days of extending then from the Tier 1 cities into Tier 2 and Tier 3, in
those early days of development, we saw very similar economics and sometimes
stronger economics in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities than we even saw in the more mature
Tier 1 cities, as we were selecting, as you would expect us to do in the early days of
any market entry, some of the best real estate in the market.
Now as we progress over the next many years, we do expect that we will likely have
very, very strong ongoing economics within China, probably somewhat moderated
from where they've been in these early days, where we are largely cherry picking the
right kinds of real estate. But with that said, we fully expect. And we see today, that
the unit economics in China likely will always be the strongest at a unit economic
level for us anywhere in the world.
The volumes remain lower than, say, in the benchmark US business. But four-wall
proﬁtability and four-wall return on capital is very strong in China. And we would
anticipate that pattern to continue even as we penetrate within Tier 1 cities. And
again, outside of the Tier 1.
{BIO 1512077 <GO>}
Thanks. Maybe your perspective as; you didn't spend a lot of time; but on K-Cup
growth. First of all, maybe a quick snapshot of the new Green Mountain deal that you
signed recently.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 12A - Troy AlsteadThen secondly, from a big picture, strategic perspective, is there a -- I guess a tipping
point, to use the term you just used? At some point with the growth in singleserve,
do you worry about consumption in the retail coﬀeehouse business? Or how have
you looked at those occasions over, say, a ﬁve-year period?
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Let me speak to the last part ﬁrst. The answer to that is a profound no. Customers
don't make a trade largely between their at-home consumption and consumption on
the go, in a coﬀeehouse, whether it is a Starbucks coﬀee house or somebody else's.
Perhaps around the edges some do, by the way. But fundamentally, that is not a
trade customers make.
What we see as a signiﬁcant opportunity -- and I think, in fact, that point is evidenced
by the fact that over the last several years, as there has been increasing attention to
at-home consumption, on our part and on other people's parts, in making
consumption more convenient and easier at home through, for example, most
signiﬁcantly the Keurig platform, there has been nothing but signiﬁcant growth
within the Starbucks stores. There really is no meaningful transaction there.
What we do have every aspiration to do is elevate our share of at-home
consumption. While Starbucks has a nice share of coﬀeehouse consumption in the
US and something we'll continue to deepen, we believe, over time and have
opportunity to grow even further, we've always been underrepresented in at-home
coﬀee consumption. And when historically we've asked customers why that is; if you
are a loyal Starbucks customer, why don't we get more of their share of consumption
when they are at home; historically, it is because we weren't in the form factor that
they were looking for at home. And that has led us over the last several years to
really aggressively innovate into this space, providing more at-home opportunities in
packaged coﬀee, Starbucks high-quality ﬂavored coﬀees, increasingly things like VIA.
And then a couple years ago on the K-Cup platform.
Most consumption at home in the US is in the low pressure brewed category. So our
Green Mountain with Keurig have done a fantastic job placing their machine into
people's homes. The beauty of that platform is it is a very healthy economics for
everybody in the business in singleserve who can make a proposition of it. But
importantly, as coﬀee becomes easier for people to consume, people consume
more. So we are actually seeing higher consumption of coﬀee, largely, we believe,
driven by singleserve executions.
Our strategy, both in the Keurig platform. And really respectfully with all forms of
singleserve in the US and around the world over time, is to be the coﬀee on other
platforms. We recognize that Starbucks is not an equipment company. We don't
have aspirations to become a deep equipment company. We have a fantastic
partnership with Green Mountain, who, again, has done an outstanding job placing
their machines in millions of people's homes over time.
And that relationship and partnership and what we believe to be the opportunity
going forward led us to, together with Green Mountain, lengthen and expand ourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18

going. They are an extremely innovative company, always things on the table for
innovation around that singleserve beverage experience at home that we want to be
a part of together with them. And that is what led us to, together with them, extend
that relationship.
{BIO 1512077 <GO>}
Questions from the audience? Yes.
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible)
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
Yes, some of both. You're right; the historical Teavana concept, which has great unit
economics and is something we are very happy with, was largely a mall-based
merchant, a mercantile, a retail execution of hard goods and dry goods. Going
forward, we will very much respect that, because there is fantastic economics. And
that's a great experience for the consumer in that execution.
But what we are working together with the Teavana team on is bringing more of a
beverage execution into it. Again, because our Starbucks capabilities are so strong in
how to operationalize beverages and how to innovate around beverages, we'll add
that as a layer into the store.
Now, the dry goods and hard goods I expect will always remain a predominant part
of that Teavana sales execution and the experience of that store. But we know we
can add both a layer of sales and proﬁtability into the store by making it a
contemporary consumption tea beverage, teahouse kind of place. But also by
having a more pronounced beverage execution in-store, we think that will accrue to
more sales of the hard goods in the stores as well. So the new, somewhat evolved
concept is what you will begin seeing roll out this fall.
Yes?

Page 11 of 12Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Troy AlsteadThank you. So the question was is there any backlash -- if I represent it correctly -- or
concerns we have about regulations around caﬀeine or the FDA's interest in that
space, or some of the things I think others have gotten in trouble with a little bit
around high caﬀeine content.
And the answer is no. We watch it extremely closely and always have. But if you step
back and really watch Starbucks, we have never signiﬁcantly targeted high-energy
kinds of beverages. We've never made a point that we are going after the youth
market with caﬀeine beverages. We've been very cautious representing what our
concept represents.
Coﬀee and caﬀeine is one of the most steady beverages for centuries. In fact, it has
been around a long time. We are quite conﬁdent that in the right use among our
customers and the way we are targeting that it that it is a very complementary,
healthy beverage and not something we are concerned about with any regulations
around. And again, I think it is largely about how we positioned our brand and our
products historically and how we intend to position it going forward.
(inaudible; microphone inaccessible)
{BIO 5724238 <GO>}
The question was -- for those who couldn't hear it -- I mentioned a lot of
opportunities. What is the biggest challenge we face. And how will we overcome it?
I think no question the challenge we face and talk about together among the
leadership team and with our Board frequently is around execution of all those
things. We have signiﬁcant opportunities. We have a very, very healthy and robust
business today in the US. We have a growing and increasingly proﬁtable business
outside of the US. There are signiﬁcant opportunities as I've gone through outside of
the Starbucks store.
Our opportunity and our challenge is to execute eﬀectively and stay on top of those
as we go forward. It is an area where we focus heavily. I'm quite conﬁdent in our
ability to do it. We have a deeper, stronger management team than we ever have
had in our history. We are far better today at allocating the depth of talents and
resources against each of these initiatives.
I started at Starbucks when we were privately held more than 20 years ago. Back
then, everybody did everything, because that was what; not unlike most startups
around the world, that is what you do in those days.
Starbucks is a dramatically diﬀerent company today. We have depth of talent and
specialists who are targeted and bring experience against each of these initiatives.
Then we watch them and report on them and measure them closely.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-06-18
