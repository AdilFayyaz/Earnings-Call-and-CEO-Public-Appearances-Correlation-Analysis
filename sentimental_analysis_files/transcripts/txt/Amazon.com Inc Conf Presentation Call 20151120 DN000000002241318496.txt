Good morning. Thank you all for joining the webinar to discuss the outlook for
Analytics Software Market. This is part of a series of webinars that we are doing for
2016 outlook. My name Mandeep Singh, I am the Software and Services analyst for
Bloomberg Intelligence. I am joined here today by Dan Vesset, Program VP for
Business Analytics and Big Data for IDC.
Couple of housekeeping notes; today's presentation will be recorded and available
for download. At the bottom of the slide window you will notice that you can adjust
volume and maximize your screen, so you are free to ask questions using the Q&A
panel to the right of the PowerPoint slides. We will address questions at the
conclusion of the presentation. And a copy of the slides and transcript will be
available upon request.
A little bit about Bloomberg intelligence. This is the Proprietary Research Group. At
Bloomberg we provide unique analysis and context on industries, companies,
government and credit factors that impact businesses, all integrated within the
Bloomberg Professional service. We have a broad coverage spanning hundred plus
industries and 800 companies globally. Our research is data driven and our analysts
have an average experience of 17 plus years, both on the buy-side and sell-side. We
do not give any buy or sell recommendations.
For software speciﬁcally, you can type in BI space ASFT [ph] on the terminal and you
will be able to load the software dashboard, which has three sections; analysis, data
library and monitor. Analysis covers short-term and long-term hits and has key
indicators and earnings interpretation along with industry primers. Data library has
all the data.
So, without further ado, I will pass it on to Dan Vesset to go over the formal
presentation. Dan?

All right. Thanks, Mandeep. Thank you all for joining us. I'll have a few slides to
present today, but I'm hoping that we can spend most of the time responding toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 2 of 15your speciﬁc questions, so we can type those in, I think we'll be taking just the
written questions and Mandeep will help facilitate that, and we'll get to that.
So, as was mentioned, I run IDC's business analytics and information management
market research practice, and in this case we're partnering with Bloomberg to bring
you some of the latest research, speciﬁcally around the Business Intelligence and
Analytics market. We have a team of analysts, who cover the diﬀerent aspects of this
market. And as you can see on the slide now, this is our taxonomy or our map of the
diﬀerent discrete market segments in the space. In full-year 2014 this was about a
$40 billion market and we expect the year to close -- 2015 to close with 42 billion in
software revenue, global software revenue, that includes license, maintenance and
subscription revenues, cloud-based subscription. This does not include professional
services or hardware. If we add those in, we would, at least, triple that number.
So for context, we look at market in these three broad segments. At the bottom is the
analytic information management platforms. These are the databases both relational
data warehouses as well as the newer forms of non-relational non-schematic tools.
NoSQL databases, Hadoop, do you have sources where data lands as it comes in
from diﬀerent sources. In that bucket is also data integration tools, data quality, data
extraction, transformation, loading tools. Think of tools like Informatica for example.
And then on the left-hand side, there's a box for continuous real-time analytics. So
there is a -- there are streaming technologies for few used cases where that's
necessary. And then on top of that platform are two broader buckets there on the
left-hand side, performance management and analytic applications. So, these are
apps that the vendors, the IT vendors, the software vendors have pre-built for a
speciﬁc business function or an industry. So, it could be in the -- for the ﬁnance
department. So, not the ﬁnancial service industry, but the ﬁnance department could
be budgeting, planning, consolidation tools like applications like that could be
marketing analysis, sales analysis. So, for that function, et cetera along the lines of all
the major business functions.
And in some cases it is very industry speciﬁc, so could be fraud prevention,
speciﬁcally for consumer banking for example or credit card companies or it could
be supply chain optimization for manufacturing or predictive or preventative
maintenance in assets, some of the asset-intensive industries.
And the focus today will be on that upper right-hand side, so business intelligence
and analytic tools and that's where we see the query tools, reporting tools, all apps
stands here for online analytical processing, multidimensional analysis, visual
discovery. Also in this segment of the market are advanced and predictive analytics
tools, the statistics and data mining software. There is a small segment speciﬁcally
targeting spatial -- highly-specialized spatial information analytics GIS systems and
then Content Analytics, which are real, unstructured text and rich media analysis and
there has been. And so for the broader market, as I mentioned here, the $42 billion
market, the vendor shares that we have right now are on the full year 2014. And we
obviously expect some change in the share percentages, but it gives you a sense of,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 3 of 15even if we don't have the full year 2015, it gives you a sense of ranking at least, which
is for that overall market. So, this is not just the BI segment, it's the overall market.
Oracle is number one, because primarily they are the biggest data warehousing
vendor and the biggest, now the information management platform vendor followed
by SAP, which primarily is there because of the BusinessObjects portfolio of BI and
Analytics (inaudible), but also both have various analytic applications and databases.
IBM follows us too. Microsoft, SAS, Teradata, Salesforce. Salesforce there is primarily
because of their some of the sales and marketing kind of embedded BI tools and
now they recently came up with the new standalone BI and Analytics oﬀering Wave,
which I'll talk about a little bit later.
So, this is that overall market. Now we're going to drill in a little bit more into this $11
billion segment based on 2015 expected numbers in query and reporting and
analysis. So, if we look at just that segment, you see some additional vendors
popping up in the top 10. Qlik, Tableau, TIBCO's Spotﬁre division, then some of the
kind of the older midsize vendors MicroStrategy, Information Builders are there as
well.
Obviously the thing that jumps out immediately is the faster growth rate of the --
what have been become known as the visual discovery vendor. So, Tableau, Qlik and
Spotﬁre historically came in with a very diﬀerent user interface from the legacy
products from SAP's BusinessObjects, Oracle BI tool that they acquired from
Hyperion, and IBM Cognos and then some of those mid-sized vendors and that
growth, I think, diﬀerentiation is continuing.
We'll probably, well, we'll almost certainly continue for the foreseeable future, but it's
-- the competitive landscape is starting to change. And it's starting to change,
because all the big vendors now have comparable products in their portfolios for --
speciﬁcally for Visual Discovery. So, if we -- I'm going to come back to this slide, but
just if you look at the segmentation of query and reporting and Visual Discovery,
those are distinct segments and in many -- in most cases for most vendors there are
discrete products for each of those used cases and they address diﬀerent audience.
So, one could be more of a business analysts or who might be doing in that data
exploration, another production reporting would be for embedded reports, so it
could be compliance reporting, it could be relatively ﬁxed well-known ﬁnancial
reports that are not necessarily changing period to period. They need to be pixel
perfect. Some of the -- even ﬁnancial statements that go out to consumers are often
based on this -- with type of reporting -- embedded reporting software.
And then query and all up [ph] is -- we use that to classify those legacy
multidimensional analysis and query tools. And so if you look at these by market, the
share of the market is still about 50% of those legacy query and all-up tools. But
Visual Discovery is growing, on aggregate this is a ﬁve-year historical CAGR through
2014. So, historically have been growing at around 19%. So, that includes Tableau
and Qlik and Spotﬁre, but also the visual tools from -- visual discovery tools from
other vendors as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 4 of 15And advanced analytics is just slightly over 9%, about 10% historical growth rate
represents 20% of that BI market. And reporting, although it doesn't get the press
and the Mindshare is also certainly a decent sized segment and there's still a need
for that and will be a continued need for that market. But clearly those specialized
tools are showing higher growth rate than the legacy BI suites like the Cognos
business objects and Oracle's products.
And I think it's important to note that it's -- there's been a substantial change in the
latest versions of those tools. But the Mindshare and kind of the perception of
audiences and users are still that those are bulky, not very visual appealing, not very
intuitive tools and so that will continue. I think it's very diﬃcult to change Mindshare
in the short term.
So, the key vendors are focusing now a little bit on this visual discovery market. So,
the key vendors right now, the one -- besides the ones I mentioned are also
Microsoft with their Power BI toolset. Amazon just announced AWS QuickSight is a
new product and also Salesforce with their Wave analytics or analytics cloud oﬀering.
And then you can see for some vendors their multiple products, which I think is not
very conducive to their go-to-market. But they have to address the market this way,
because the customers and audiences were buying are at diﬀerent stages of
maturity and it could be, in fact, very diﬀerent audiences were buying. So, there is a
increasing tendency to buy directly by the lines of business, not the Central IT that
usually bought those enterprise BI tools.
Last year some colleagues at IDC did a study that showed that 60 -- just over 60% of
new IT budgets are coming from line of business rather than IT. And so I think by end
of 2015 that would have -- I think moved even higher. So, some of the most impactful
I think trends that I expect to see going forward. I think what that is starting to
happen is small Tableau continues to grow rapidly. They are seeing a lot more
competition there.
Sales and marketing costs are going up. Net new license revenues is starting to slow
down. I think part of it is that they have reached a certain size getting close to the
annual 500 million and just as it will be just harder to sustain the growth at that
point. Unless they invest very signiﬁcantly in net new sales, as I mentioned, early
competition is starting to increase. I think the -- and part of it is also pricing pressure.
Power BI from Microsoft is coming in at $10 per user, for the standard division $10 per
user. QuickSight is similarly priced.
There is a little bit of -- for QuickSight there is a little bit of higher price for some
additional features, but it's a fraction of what Tableau and Qlik and some of these
other enterprise tools are -- costs.
Oracle just released a new Cloud BI, Oracle BI 12c, which is has a visual discovery
tools as well and that's also priced much more like the Microsoft and AmazonFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 5 of 15product, rather than the standalone products. And these vendors obviously can do
this because they're not reliant on this revenue for survival. For them it's one of many
products and probably in some ways, even a loss leader to get customers on to their
cloud platforms and other applications and tools for -- so I think Microsoft and
Amazon's entry into the market is signiﬁcant. Both have their own kind of ecosystems
of developers and that's signiﬁcant because the developers are likely to use one of
their preferred platform to develop applications, BI applications and analytic
applications based on that platform.
So, if somebody already has most of their data or much of their data in AWS, it make
sense that Tableau will also try out, at least try out QuickSight and if it satisﬁes their
speciﬁc functional requirements, they will like -- much more likely to go with
QuickSight. And same for Microsoft. If it's a Microsoft shop and certainly in a SMB
market, there is a large percentage of those. It makes sense to also start using them
Power BI.
I think Salesforce will be also very signiﬁcant -- it didn't quite get the same reaction,
when that product came out as Amazon's product came. But I think it will, in the
short term, have even a bigger impact on the business user side, because Salesforce
really owns a lot of those sales management and sales analyst relationships. And it's -
- it seems like no-brainer to add on another product that and have some incremental
cost and start getting additional analytic functionality if you are already a Salesforce
customer.
And since their announcement of Wave Analytics, which is of a horizontal, more
generic BI tool. They also announced Sales Analytics is more of one of those analytic
applications that I mentioned in that upper left-hand side of the market map, and
then marketing our customer service analytics and marketing analytics are coming as
well. And those are then, are more pre-packaged, even faster to deploy. They
incorporate certain commonly used visualizations and key performance indicators,
metrics, some workﬂows, which in many cases will be attractive to sales managers as
they are using Salesforce and then now the additional analytic functionality from
Salesforce.
IBM just announced last month, Cognos and the latest version of Cognos Analytics,
which is a big revamp of their existing portfolio. So, it's again coming into the kind of
the modern age and with visuals -- with the functionality on visualization. I think one
thing that is starting to happen now is almost all, if not all, vendors have -- are
moving towards in memory, memory based deployment and memory-based
systems. We think that within the next three years all of them will -- all the new
versions of these products will be memory based and what obviously that part of it is
the function of the lower cost of memory, so this is not feasible. And what it provides
them is that instantaneous access and response rate from more -- from tools that
have more advanced or more process in terms of visual (inaudible) of the data. So,
the primary beneﬁt there is speed, speed of processing.
Many of the tools are now where in the fast primarily connected to the relational data
warehouse. Now they're starting to connect with various forms of -- various types ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 6 of 15connections to some of the big data sources like Hadoop or Spark. So, Hadoop and
so MapReduce versus Spark and some of the NoSQL databases as well just slightly
in a lesser extent. So, in many ways, some other vendors have announced Big Data,
"Big Data" versions of the products. Really in most cases those just mean that they're
adding Hadoop and some of the non-relational databases as store systems. Some of
them -- marketing play, but certainly an emerging and important sort of sources that
all of them need to be able to access.
In terms of geographic coverage, so for the specialized vendors, the pure plays, Qlik,
came out of -- and both Spotﬁre came out of Europe, both out of Sweden. So, Qlik
has a much higher percentage of sales coming from Europe, which I think is partly
contributing to slower growth rate. Although they are now quite well established in
North America as well, but they were here -- they certainly came here later than --
later and have a smaller presence than Tableau.
Tableau was in a reverse position or that they claim customers in over a 100
countries. It's really primarily dominated in North America, their CEO recently moved
to Europe to live there for a while. And I think with the expectation that he would be
more involved in growing the business in Western Europe, at least. For large vendors
obviously the opportunity lies across their -- they distributed and brought global
reach. Certainly for Oracle, Microsoft and IBM and SAP. So, that's little bit on the
geographic reach. With AWS -- some of the other diﬀerences between these
vendors; so Tableau and Qlik became what they are today because they bypassed IT,
in many cases bypassed IT and went directly at the line of business user. And
eventually some of these deployments grew to certain size, IT was forced to embrace
them and start supporting them.
Qlik now has two products, they started out with QlikView, which was the ﬂagship
product for long time and it started out in that fashion that I just mentioned. But then
as features and functionality were added, it became more and more like -- more
complex to set up and manage and IT increasingly took over the purchasing and
deployments of QlikView and so the response to that was Qlik Sense, which was
going back to the roots of trying to reach the record line of business end-user and
compete more eﬀectively with Tableau or some of the other tools on this list.
Tableau, kind of, is going the other way. They're still, I think, in a place where they're
not always fully embraced with IT. I mean, at the end of day, it has to be a balance of
being playing nice with both. The part of the challenge for some of the larger
companies is that as more and more of these discrete siloed BI deployment pop up,
there is a real risk, there is a governance risk, there's a data silo risk through the
analytics and usually the tool should -- usually solves the individual needs of a group
or even an individual person.
But if it does not -- if it's not based on certain level of enterprise standardization, it
does introduce -- potentially introduces discrepancies and how the data is viewed,
even the metrics could be diﬀerent, not to say anything about the data itself and
that's a risk that all these vendors have to deal within.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15

Page 7 of 15Mandeep Singh
Dan VessetWe see a lot more eﬀorts from Tableau to try to embrace IT and ensure that the
software has those enterprise capabilities around security and governance and data
model management. The one big unknown right now, I think the biggest unknown
here is Amazon and QuickSight. On the surface of it, it makes a lot of sense for the
companies that already have data in Amazon. And this doesn't have to be just
Amazon data sources, could be the hosted, any hosted data base. There is a lot of
Oracle and SQL Server for example hosted on Amazon.
The question is how well that product can actually support end users rather than just
the developers. Part of it is Amazon hands oﬀ approach to their go-to-market
strategy, so if somebody starts using QuickSite as an individual business user as a
business user Group and they run into trouble, Amazon is really not set up to have
those kind of one on one personalized support, that they provide to develop that is
they are from the other vendors and also that they over the years have started to
provide to some of the developers on the systems admin side and storage admin
side.
And even there, it's still highly reliant on the user to ﬁgure out their own back
through [ph] whatever channels they might enter or use the community kind of
online communities and sources like that. So that's a big question mark. Is this
primarily a product for developers to incorporate into other applications, and there
is obviously nothing wrong with that, there is sizable market for that, but it will be
diﬀerent from on what Tableau and Qlik have done to date.
And also with their QuickSite they are quite open that somebody cannot just
subscribe to the server side engine, calculation engine and use some of these other
visualization tools on top of that. So I think, that is a scenario that I can see
developing as well as some body may already have that low, but if they have their
data on Amazon, they may want to start using QuickSite and use that platform and
use Tableau on top of that for example.
Let's see, so maybe I'll stop here actually we're at the bottom of the hour, but and
maybe open it up now for some follow on questions.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great. Sure. Thank you, Dan. Thanks for the nice overview. I had speciﬁc questions
around like this full data visualization concept and how you said it's driven by the line
of business. Is it rendering the old data warehousing techniques obsolete or
company is just moving away from investing in data warehousing and kind of going
with more what the line of business wants in terms of whether using smaller vendors
like Tableau and Qlik, and just kind of maintaining the data warehouses because
obviously they had it for a while?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
Yeah, so I think it's really those layers that I showed in the map, I'll go back to that
slide, those -- so this one here, so those still matters, so there is still -- there continuesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 8 of 15Mandeep Singh
Dan Vessetto be a need for the warehouse, the warehouse itself is changing, it's no longer just
relational, so there is a big change in the architecture to extend the warehouse, the
relational data warehouse with some of these non-relational technologies, because
that's really the most eﬀective way to integrate data from many diﬀerent sources, it
could be internal and (inaudible) applications could be bringing in some of the
social media data, some of the IRT data into Hadoop clusters for example.
And then on top of that, you have then visualization layer that access its data from
that information management player. Now it's also true that you can bypass the
warehouse, you can go directly with the visualization tools to the source systems and
it is also a trend that exists and some vendors for example SAP and Oracle are very
keen to develop that trend because they owe many of those enterprise applications.
They want to see companies use more of that embedded BI that is maybe sitting
directly in the ﬁnancial systems, in the supply chain systems areas of enterprise
systems, I had a chance to ask question of Mark Hurd at Oracle earlier this year and
the question I posed was somewhat along the lines that the database and
applications business clearly dominate what they do and BI and Analytics is tertiary
for Oracle when we compare that kind of border message or high level messages to
other large vendors and he didn't deny that, that's the case, his response was that we
want to expose all the analytics in BI through the applications.
So I expect them to continue whether it's their HR applications or sales or marketing
or their CRP modules, to have more analytics and those will be most likely not --
many of those will not depend on the data warehouse. So to some extent the data
warehouse was not going away, but its role is somewhat diminished, many of them
were not growing as fast because some of the data sets are moving to other types of
technologies often open source technologies and so overall that aﬀects obviously
growth in the date warehouse segment in the market.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great. I mean I want to go over this whole concept of vertical versus horizontal kind
of layer of visualization and analytics. So if I have my data in an SAP or an Oracle
system and I use their analytics product, it makes a lot of sense because it's in the
enterprise application that's given to me by SAP or Oracle and I can visualize it
easily, but what if I have multiple systems and that could be ERP, CRM system from
diﬀerent vendors and I want to build an analytics layer on top of it where I am able to
ingest data from diﬀerent systems easily and aggregate it using that analytics layer.
So would a solution like Tableau or Qlik be more conducive to that or you may still
want to go with like a large analytics vendor for that kind of solution?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
So you can do some of that with Qlik and Tableau, but I think again it really will
depend on whether you want to setup a more managed and structured data
warehouse. And a part of the challenge is that, your Qlik or Tableau server is not
going to hold as much data, as a data warehouse. So if you're doing any kind of
longitudinal station, you want multiple quarters or years or kind of longer termFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 9 of 15Mandeep Singh
Dan Vessetanalysis and have data really from across the full enterprise, you're most likely
building -- still building the warehouse.
I think again that layer such -- that layer of this technology stack still has its place. But
now, you can -- I mean, I think part of the issue is that, now if you build out -- if your
data warehouse, let's say, from Oracle, let's say, it's (inaudible) data, you have the
option to also to use Oracle BI tool, so if your -- that layer is Amazon, you could be
using the right shift, for example, from Amazon as your preferred data warehouse.
Now you have a BI tool from Amazon that's also available. That was in the case just a
couple of years ago, you would naturally gravitate to these independent BI vendors.
So that's I think a big shift in the market. Was Salesforce is an example where most
likely the core data that you're analyzing is just a Salesforce data. So it's ﬁrst and
foremost the marketing and the customer service data. And in that case, you may
begin a self-contained in that domain and there is less need for a data warehouse,
have your Salesforce way of analytics, directly accessing data in those cloud CRM
applications and providing the necessary analytics in BI functionality.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Got it. So you mentioned about Amazon's QuickSight, can you talk speciﬁcally about
which segment of the $11 billion market is Amazon's QuickSight aimed at?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
Yeah. Some of it is still a little bit unclear. I think most of it will be targeting this visual
discovery, but I think there is also a little bit bleeding into this query and multi-
dimensional analysis space that would replace some of the existing deployments of
enterprise BI suites, because -- and there are some gray areas, obviously, between
those segments, because it's not always clear. Most of these still have a visual
interface, just that some are more conducive to this ad hoc visual, ad hoc discovery
where the schema and the routes that an analyst might take through the data are not
pre-determined, which was the case with all absolutions.
So with all that -- I mean, that's a big diﬀerence again with the -- in memory systems
and applicable to this particular question also is that, with many of the OLAP cubes
that existed before, somebody had to pre-build those cubes and the cube basically
determined how an analyst, how our user was able to navigate through the data.
And if they had a question that wasn't part of that pre-determined path, they would
have to go back to IT and that's where the frustration going to begin, because that
would require almost completely new development cycle, they would have to deﬁne
their requirements, the IT would have to go way, add a new dataset, new data
dimension, rebuild the cubes, redevelop it, test it and then deploy it out, by that time
host of end-users are already onto other questions.
So that was the part of the frustration that Qlik and Tableau were able to address and
nearly bypass that whole process. So with QuickSight, I think a lot of it will be a visualFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 10 of 15Mandeep Singh
Dan Vessetdiscovery, but it will be also -- you could develop a dash -- interactive dashboards
with that technology and some of the, kind of -- maybe a little bit light -- more light-
weight in a sense that it doesn't -- not necessarily have to be ad hoc discovery, it
could be some pre-built views of the data that's our management types are
interested in looking at on a regular -- daily basis for example, a weekly basis. So I
think it's a substantial part of that 11 billion that potentially they could egress. I don't
see them really going directly at the production reporting site for now.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
And I would just add they also launched a machine learning services before they
launch QuickSight, so do you think that makes the machine learning and AI just kind
of bring that relevance into the analytics landscape and how they plan to leverage
those techniques for analytics. Is that their play or?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
Yeah. So the machine learning in that case would fall into this advanced analytics
category. And if you look at these vendor, Microsoft has now machine learning, IBM
has on their -- has a machine learning services, Amazon has it now, and there are two
players there. One is the application of machine running internally to automate more
of the BI functionality, so recommendations, for example, for what the most
appropriate visualization is -- given a dataset, so the user ingest or imports the
dataset, the system can recommend the types of analysis that would make more
sense of the type of visualization, that would make more sense. So there is an
eﬃciency gain there, you need less analysts. They need to spend less time in
manually manipulating and setting up their views that they want to present to the
rest of the organization. So that's the kind of an internal use of machine learning and
somewhat of techniques for artiﬁcial intelligence.
And then externally those machine learning services are now also available to the
developers and data sites for developing applications, so they don't necessarily have
to build these -- all these algorithms themselves, they can call on that service and run
their data through that machine learning engine that Amazon or Microsoft or IBM are
providing.
And we expect that also to grow quite rapidly. I think also if -- so I'll give my -- IBM as
an example, with Watson Analytics, a part of it is IBM is kind of muddying their
waters around -- on Watson, so there is -- the largest cloud for them is the Watson
the cognitive platform for that, they talk about a lot and then now they are starting to
brand some of their other products also with Watson, even if they don't have all that
cognitive functionality.
So Watson Analytics is, if you look at it on the surface it's very much like these visual
and discovery and analytics products. It has -- but it's able to now call on some of the
APIs of that Watson cognitive platform and more will be coming. I think as that
happens and if it really does happen right and I think it does -- it will happen.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15

Mandeep SinghSo you'll start to see machine learning and other techniques being applied to this BI
and visualization market and that can really disrupt the market, because -- think
about what it is, it's -- the BI market is there, it exists and has existed primarily for the
business analysts to manipulate the data and ﬁnd interesting things that they can
report to management who then will take -- make decisions based on that
information, sort of their basic level could be anything from Excel and Excel pivot
tables and then all the packaged software that, in many cases, does pretty much the
same thing, but is maybe more visually appealing or has been in the past and more -
- have better capability to pulling data from diﬀerent sources and be more -- talking
of high performance, et cetera. But a lot of that is still very manual. It's a manual
process of getting the data and it's a manual process of ﬁnding what's interesting,
what is the root cause of a certain -- something turning red on your dashboard, why
is this KPI oﬀ from what it should be, let's investigate and let's ﬁgure out what it is.
In many cases, if you're applying now machine learning and other cognitive
functions through that dataset, it can tell you automatically what it is, what's diﬀerent,
what's unusual. And if that's where we're going with this market, there will be a lot
less need for -- I think over the next ﬁve years, we'll start to see a lot of disruption in
this market as there is going to be less need for the traditional tools targeting
manual processes of business analysts.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great, thanks. I'll take a pause here and remind our listeners to send their questions
if they have any, we can take it out in real-time and so we have one question from a
listener. He is asking to what level, if any, are we seeing the new age analytic
solutions like Qlik, Tableau replace implementations/used-cases of legacy solutions
like Cognos and Business Objects?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
Yeah. So we don't have a speciﬁc number, but anecdotally it's still a relatively small
percentage. Lot of it -- and it's usually happens when there is a quite old version of
strategies, these other products, and so there is not an incremental -- so there is a
decision point, do we go with -- do we jump two or three versions even in
sometimes for with SAP products or IBM or Oracle or do we go with the new vendor.
And oftentimes it also is triggered by a change in the SORE [ph] system, so there --
it's maybe a change in the ERP or CRM application or there may be kind of rapid
growing reliance and other non-relational technologies, so maybe that really heavy,
start reliance on social media data for example in a market scenario. So there is a
whole new dataset which is large dataset, fast scrolling and there is a new decision
point to assess the existing need. So that's where we see a replacement, but those
are relatively few cases. So in most cases it's an add-on to any given named
company, named accounts, and in most large companies will have multiple BI
products and will continue to have multiple BI products.

Dan VessetSo I would just piggyback on that, do you think like with IBM coming up with Watson
Analytics, Microsoft launching part of BI, is it cannibalizing their old analytics
solutions in any way or it's all incremental?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
I think it is cannibalizing, some of it. I think big part of it is, they are allowing the
customer, wherein the past they had to buy a suite of products which had multiple
modules within them, and so it was a relatively large initial outlay of cash. They're
now allowing a much smaller incremental purchase. So you can buy just the Cognos
Analytics or just that Watson Analytics piece of everything that IBM has to oﬀer.
When in the past, you would have been almost forced to buy a broader Cognos
suite.
So I don't know if it's cannibalization, but it certainly does. The price points become
smaller than any given point in time with a hope that it gets -- the volume of
transactions increases. Some vendors are very good at that. Microsoft is very good at
volume. And then somebody like Salesforce, but IBM and SAP and Oracle are not
that great at that. So I think for them it's a big shift and we could see that from their
very slow growth or in fact negative growth in the BI revenue.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
So let's move on to the cloud. Do you think is there an advantage for a cloud-based
analytics product over on-premise ones and I mean -- I know Tableau and Qlik are
very popular, but most of their consumption is still using their desktop or the server
products. So do you think it makes sense for people to kind of move towards a
cloud-based analytics product?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
So the broad answer to that is that everybody is moving to the cloud, you're right
that most of those deployments today are on-premises. We're estimating around
maybe 7% or so, 5% to 7% of the BI market is in the cloud today. That is very small
compared to, for example, what happens with Sales -- PS Automation applications
where the majority of deployments, they are now in the cloud. And part of it, is that
there was a lack of supply. So as you said, most of these deployments have still been
on-premises.
And now in the second half of 2015, all the major vendors came out with new cloud
versions of their tools. So we are estimating that the cloud, public cloud part of this
$11 billion market will be growing at 4.5 times faster over the next ﬁve years. 4.5 times
faster than the on-premises part. So there is no question that we're moving towards
the cloud and because of that it becomes really becomes a requirement. So they
have to have -- any vendor today has to have cloud-based product. Does it give you
a speciﬁc? So functionally, I don't think there is a major advantage at any given point
in time, but I think what the cloud gives you is the ability to reiterate faster through,
with new features and functionality and obviously provide quicker and cheaper
updates.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15

Dan VessetSo there's a lot of advantages to the vendor in moving to the Cloud. A part of the
issue is in the short term, it hits -- there's a revenue recognition issue as that kind of
the change happens and that can take three years to even out, so that's from a
revenue assessment and forecasting perspective that's an inhibitor to growth in the
short term. So there is more adoption but because the revenue recognition is spread
out, it's a negative. For those and those who were primarily in it's who have that issue
of switching from one premises to about.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great, and how would you contrast like the diﬀerent approaches of the large
vendors, so Microsoft and Amazon they are oﬀering their analytic service ﬂash
utilization [ph] tools on top of their Cloud infrastructure services, whereas IBM is --
yes, they're oﬀering Watson analytics, but they've also gone out and purchased
Weather Channel data. Is that tied into analytics in some way, and then what do you
think is the rationale for doing that?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
Yeah. So I think that's an important point is that what we're calling it -- calling it value
added content. So the ability to not just to analytics but contents along with it and
(inaudible) a company's one example of that in there -- Amazon, I mean Microsoft's
partnership with Twitter is another example of that.
Oracle acquired a couple of companies, Bluekai was one and Datalogix and they
were both in the consumer data business. So they're collecting behavioral data,
purchasing data, demographic data kind of packaging up [ph] and again in Oracle's
case, they are continuing to sell those as a discrete oﬀering but also embedding
value, not embedding, but they are co-selling that with CRM application.
So as you buy their marketing automation, marketing analytics you also have an
option now to subscribe to the data feeds about individuals, sometimes and usually
anonymized individuals, but used for analytics. So I do think that all the large
vendors are in a position or to do that and already some half, so Amazon also makes
available certain data sets to their marketplace, same with Microsoft.
I think we're going to see much more of that of prepackaged data sets, sometimes
just raw data, but oftentimes some type of value-added being put on the data, so
maybe scores, benchmarks that go along with the analytic service and that, it really
becomes feasible only in the cloud, because of the delivery mechanism for social-
bank [ph], so another example would be, well this also opens up its competition
from outside of the traditional player, so for example Intuit that provides certain
ﬁnancial solutions for the SMBs, they have our data service, where they -- because
they process all these transaction for SMBs, so they know what people are
purchasing, how much they spend at Staples last month in this region for this
business, they can create -- they create certain data sets and benchmarks out of that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15

Dan VessetAnd sometimes they are monetizing those directly and sometimes they're just there
to create more stickiness with the customers. And we can see these types of -- there
is more interest in that, credit card companies are in this business, large retailers are
becoming -- and this everybody is trying to ﬁgure out what -- how else to monetize
the data that they're sitting on, how to package that and in many cases within,
obviously within the compliance regulations and privacy regulations that exists and
make money of that.
So that's clearly the major part of the play from IBM in this case, another is the fact
that weather is a key element in pretty much any decision whether it's retail or
insurance or physical asset management or logistics, weather plays a huge part and
the weather company had all these relationships and business in those domains. So I
think there is an opportunity for IBM to continue that and I expect them to acquire
more content sources like them.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
So could this increase pressure on the pure play guys like Tableau and Qlik which are
primarily selling tools and don't have the VeriBit on to acquire content companies?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
I think overall, yes. I think in the short term, they are still more nimble and can
execute, I think faster and more eﬀectively than the big vendors. I think it's just this --
it's a symptom of the large vendors just moving slower, Qlik actually bought one of
those data providers, they bought a company called DataMarket, those are relatively
small European vendor but that -- so that exists, so they could go that way as well.
I think to me the next important thing is, will they -- will those pure play vendors get
more into advanced and predictive analytics? Not that they will compete with a
company like SaaS or IBM SPSS but incorporating some of that more advanced
analytics into their existing tool sets and to provide more recommendations for users
to automate the process of data, acquisition and preparation and also visualization. I
would expect them to do that, that will be an important kind of next step.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great. And one last question. So is this space getting too crowded? I mean
companies in this space continued to get new funding, Altrix had another funding
round and yeah we are keep hearing about analytics and visualization more and
more. So do you think there is scope for consolidation or yeah what's your odds so
far?
{BIO 4307286 <GO>}
Yeah. There are some that have gotten enormous funding like Gilmore, which frankly
I'm not -- I don't quite understand, I don't see anything quite unique there. There is
company like Burst and GoodData and others. Altrix is a bit diﬀerent and that theyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-11-15

Dan Vessettarget a slightly diﬀerent base. They partner with Qlik and Tableau where they're
more focused on their -- more data preparation and advanced analytics.
It's besides those that are more visible. There are dozens of other vendors in the
space, I think there is always this long tail or there is a lot of movement along those
vendors. This is the ﬁrst time I've been at IDC for 15 years. This is the ﬁrst time in
probably 20 years that there is a major change in the top 10 vendors with -- other
than M&A activity with Qlik just moving up -- I mean not quite -- Tableau moving up
the ranks now, kind of surprising some of the mid-size, other mid-sized vendors.
Will Tableau ever become top ﬁve? It's hard to say, it's doubtful. I think there would
have to be some acquisitions. I think there are always a bunch of some tiny smaller
vendors, but for those that matter I think it's very hard for any of those other names
you mentioned or that I mentioned to crack into top 10 for the next -- for the
foreseeable future. So I think there will -- and it's also, I'm not clear on what the
reasoning for acquisitions will be other than to buy somebody like Tableau or Qlik
assuming the right valuation, because a lot of the functionality is very well known
and so there's -- the big vendors are not buying unique IP when they're doing that.
{BIO 15014535 <GO>}
Great. Clearly, this is not an easy space to understand and hope you all ﬁnd the
discussion useful. Thank you so much Dan for your time. I really enjoyed the
discussion and look forward to future webinars. Thank you, all.
