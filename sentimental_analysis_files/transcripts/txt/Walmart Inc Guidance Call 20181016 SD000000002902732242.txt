Presentation
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
I would also like to welcome all of you that are listening live on our webcast. After
spending about 20 years coming to Walmart's Investor Meetings as a guest and an
equity research analyst, I am really excited to be part of the team this year.
Together with our executive team and our Event Solutions group, the Investor
Relations team is proud to present our program today. We appreciate your interest
in Walmart. And I know the team looks forward to sharing its strategies with you and
answering your questions.
Today's meeting is available on our website, stock.walmart.com. The presentations
will also be posted to our website as they are completed. Today's presentations
include forward-looking statements, which are subject to future events and
uncertainties, which could cause actual results to diﬀer materially from these
statements. Please reference our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP
reconciliations on our website, stock.walmart.com.
Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release we issued this morning. I
won't spend time on highlights. But did want to take a minute to discuss today's
agenda. Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO, will kick things oﬀ in just a
minute, then you'll hear from our CFO, Brett Biggs; and CEO of Walmart
International, Judith McKenna. At that point, we'll take a brief break. And when we
return, you'll hear from our newly appointed Chief Customer Oﬃcer of Walmart U.S.,
Janey Whiteside. She will be followed by CEO of U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore; and
CEO of Walmart U.S., Greg Foran. Greg will be joined by Chief Merchandising
Oﬃcer, Steve Bratspies; and Executive Vice President of Realty and Central
Operations, Mark Ibbotson. We will wrap up formal representations with CEO of
Sam's Club, John Furner. At that point, we'll take another break and will return for
our Q&A session. At the end of our Q&A session, our formal meeting will come to a
conclusion. And we invite you to join us for lunch, where you'll have an opportunity
to spend time with our executive team. With that, let's get our meeting started.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome. We really do appreciate you making the trip to
Arkansas and investing your time with us. We look forward to answering all of your
questions and hopefully, you'll leave here with a really clear idea of where we're
headed.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

Page 3 of 70We'll include some new presenters this year to give you a better sense for our depth.
This is not a company led by one person or a small group of people. And I want to
thank our broader, diverse leadership team for their great work and their sense of
urgency. These continue to be exciting times that are full of opportunity. To seize the
moment, we're changing. We're adapting. We continue to transform the company,
how we think and how we work with one goal. And that is to earn the business of our
existing customers as well as new customers today and tomorrow.
There are a few things you should take away from this meeting: First, you know us as
a strong execution company. We're also an innovation company. Current and
emerging technologies make it possible to serve customers better than ever before.
And we're doing that.
Second, we're moving faster and we have momentum.
Third, we have unique assets that will enable us to win in an omnichannel world. And
we believe that is the winning model.
Fourth, we can invest thoughtfully, plant seeds for the future while delivering good
ﬁnancial results in the near term.
Let's start with execution. We have momentum. And customers are responding to
the investments we've made over the last few years. The team is executing well. And
our plan to win in-store and online plays to our strengths. In the U.S., comp sales
have been positive for 16 consecutive quarters. We had a strong ﬁrst half. And our
comp last quarter was the strongest growth in more than 10 years.
In our stores, more customers are coming through our doors as traﬃc has improved
for 15 consecutive quarters and inventory keeps coming down. Many of our back
rooms are empty enough that we built 128 of our 200 U.S. training academies in
those back rooms where inventory used to be. We've invested in our people through
training and development, higher wages, increased beneﬁts and more are staying
with us as retention has improved in a highly competitive job market. In fact, we've
reduced our U.S. store associate turnover by over 1,000 basis points year-over-year.
When it comes to e-commerce, we're also delivering an improved customer
experience. Our sales in the ﬁrst half of the year grew by 36%. We've also
relaunched Walmart.com and Jet.com, grown the assortment and added over 2,000
brands this year. Delivery accuracy is improving. And other e-commerce
fundamentals are headed in the right direction.
Sam's Club here in the U.S. has reported a positive comp growth for 10 consecutive
quarters. Sam's also had a strong ﬁrst half, with our Second Quarter being our
highest comp in six years. We're focused on club model fundamentals and members
are beneﬁting. A thriving club business continuously reinvests in price, keeping gross
margins low to drive membership sign-ups and renewals. We're seeing membership
grow and renewals improve.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 70Outside the U.S., we've been executing well in the ﬁrst half. And at the same time,
we've been taking action to reshape the portfolio. We've had positive comp sales in
our 4 largest markets for 5 consecutive quarters, with Walmex leading the way last
quarter with over a 5% comp.
We're excited about the announced acquisition of Cornershop to further drive
grocery delivery in Mexico and Chile.
In India, Flipkart positions us well in a very large and growing market. The Flipkart
ecosystem will not only enable us to win in India. But it will also teach us more about
the future of retail. Judith will tell you a lot more about that in a few minutes.
In China, Sam's Club continues to be a standout. And we're learning to deliver an
easy and fast experience with partners through our supercenters. Our business in
the U.K. has improved. And the proposed combination with Sainsbury's will be good
for U.K. customers. We also ﬁnalized the majority sale of the business in Brazil in
August.
Around the world, we're serving customers better; delivering ﬁnancial results;
creating value for shareholders; and at the same time, creating value locally in
communities. Most recently, we're proud of how we responded to Hurricanes
Florence and Michael here in the U.S. Together with our customers, we donated and
pledged over $12 million to help those impacted by the hurricanes, with over $6
million of that coming from the company and the Walmart Foundation.
So as previous investments and strong execution deliver results today, we're also
working on tomorrow. We've done a lot recently. Take a look at the time line behind
me. These are some of the bigger milestones of the past three years. Let's scroll
through them quickly. But we want you to understand the breadth and depth of the
change underway. I want to challenge your thinking about Walmart.
Did you know we ﬁle thousands of patents a year in categories ranging from last
mile delivery to biometrics to augmented reality? Did you know we're working with
suppliers to remove a gigaton, that's 1 billion tons, of emissions from our supply
chain? Did you know we're pioneering the use of blockchain for food safety at scale
and that we'll be increasingly able to trace products directly to the farm in seconds?
Did you know that we've developed a mobile video game to teach associates about
store processes? Did you know we're using machine learning across the enterprise
from our supply chain, to real estate, to merchandising, to legal and more? You may
be surprised to learn that we've got tech hubs in 12 cities around the world and that
we performed nearly 3 million free health screens for U.S. customers over the last
four years and given over 10 million immunizations. Did you know that Sam's Club
has a team of behavioral scientists that work to gamify the in-club digital experience
for new members in a way that drives member retention. And we did it in three
months? We're solving problems diﬀerently and more quickly.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 5 of 70Looking back, we had a proven model. And we naturally focused on execution. As
the numbers grew, we worked on optimization and unintentionally became risk-
averse. After all, a small mistake multiplied by a lot of transactions or stores is a big
number.
But today, we're getting to reimagine retail in our business. To do that, we take risks,
try quite a few things and learn from our failures. That type of behavior's in our D&A.
And we're waking up that part of our original culture. Sam Walton himself said,
"We're always driven to buck the system to innovate, to take things beyond where
they've been."
There's a cultural change underway at Walmart. And we're enjoying it. That brings
back memories of not only things that worked. But things that didn't work for us like
Helen's Arts and Crafts and a stand-alone pharmacy that we call dot-drug. We
opened Bud's warehouse outlets, where we tried a diﬀerent approach with clearance
merchandise. And we tried these huge stores called hypermarkets that turned into a
concept you might be familiar with called supercenters. Sometimes we plant seeds
and they grow quickly. Sometimes they take a while. Sometimes we start something,
a 1.0 version, that doesn't work. But by version 3.0 or 4.0, it does. Expect us to test a
lot and fail sometimes. But along that journey, you should expect some successes
and occasionally, some big wins.
U.S. grocery pickup is a recent example. In 2014, we took you to our stand-alone
location here in Bentonville when we were just getting started. We've scaled grocery
pickup from nothing four years ago to over 2,000 locations today. And by the end of
the year, we'll serve 70% of the U.S. population. And we haven't sacriﬁced quality. As
we've scaled this business, we've consistently delivered one of the highest Net
Promoter Scores we've ever had. Our customers love it. Having fresh food within 10
miles of 90% of the U.S. population is a structural competitive advantage that we are
leveraging.
Customers also love our pickup towers, which we're growing from 0 two years ago
to 700 by the end of this ﬁscal year. Now that we've learned to do pickup well, it
unlocks our ability to provide delivery. By year-end, 800 of our U.S. stores will oﬀer
delivery, covering 40% of the population. By the end of this month, 50% of our
Sam's Clubs in the U.S. will oﬀer delivery through Instacart.
In China, we have a minority investment in JD Daoija, which is a last-mile grocery
delivery company. One-hour delivery from our stores through JD Daoija grew from
16 stores two years ago to almost 200 Walmart stores in 30 cities today. You can now
see last mile delivery capabilities being built in our key markets.
Of course, some of the things we've tried didn't work or haven't worked yet. We
tried grocery delivery with Uber and Lyft. But switched to others as we all learned it's
diﬀerent to move a grocery basket than it is to move people or a restaurant order.
We don't have the right model to scale associate delivery yet. But it makes sense. So
we're working on the next iteration.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 70We're planting more seeds for the future as we speak. We're piloting our own open
delivery platform in the U.S. called Spark. Sam's is piloting a club that uses
technology to push the member experience to the edge of what's possible today.
We're piloting Jetblack, voice and text-based commerce in New York. And there's a
waitlist to join. We're testing autonomous shelf scanning technology to improve in-
stock and modular accuracy and an autonomous ﬂoor cleaner.
We're also testing a fast unloader, a new technology for store receiving that helps
make it easier to unload trucks arriving from our distribution centers. And we're
learning how to automate picking groceries for online orders by testing AlphaBot,
which brings products to an associate more eﬃciently to pack the customer order.
And there's a lot more we're working on that we can't talk about just yet. So stay
tuned.
Beyond the customer experience, we're also innovating to drive out costs and work
more eﬃciently. We've rolled out a risk and casualty mobile claims app in our stores
that eliminates paperwork and provides more timely information on customer or
associate accident claims. Over time, we estimate that this will help us save $17
million through more eﬃcient and eﬀective claims management.
We're also implementing intelligent automation across the business with over 500
software automation bots using machine learning to complete manual and repetitive
tasks in areas like accounts payable, payroll, beneﬁts, logistics and transportation.
They allow our people to focus on more engaging work and also help reduce
expenses. This is saving us an estimated $30 million a year.
As the nature of work continues to change, we're innovating to empower associates
to better serve customers, thrive in their jobs and grow in their careers. This year
alone, we're on track to train 500,000 associates through our academies. By the end
of the year, we'll have deployed 17,000 VR headsets for training. These investments
are showing a return and helping fund future investments. For example, we know
that managers who go through academies have better retention rates than those
who do not.
We'll innovate in ways the customer can see. And we'll innovate to change from
within. We have a holistic strategy. And you've heard most of it from us. And you're
going to hear more throughout the morning as you hear from the team. But I want to
spend the time I have left on a few areas that I and we are particularly focused on to
drive change.
First, we're committed to making every day easier for busy families. No doubt, price
leadership has been a cornerstone of our business. That won't change. It's central to
our purpose as a company. We've also given them a broad assortment in terms of
our store oﬀer. But there's a lot more possible as it relates to choice or assortment
breadth in today's world. And that's fantastic. So it's important that we keep adding
items and new brands to our portfolio.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 70Over time, we'll use data much more eﬀectively to serve up the best choice for each
individual customer rather than a laundry list of choices. In addition to price and
assortment, we're going to save customers more time. We're making it easier. We're
making it faster. And our friendly associates are making it more fun to shop in our
stores. Whether it's in-store or online, we'll serve our customers with great
merchandise and engage them in a way that makes shopping more enjoyable.
Second, we're sharpening our focus on culture and becoming more digital. Our
culture is unique. And it's always been an advantage for us. But to be successful in
the future, it has to be shaped. Our 4 values are timeless: service to the customer,
respect for the individual, strive for excellence and act with integrity. But
behaviorally, we need more innovation. We need a greater sense of urgency and
higher expectations. We must become more diverse and more inclusive to achieve
our business potential. Diverse associates and diversity of thought drive creativity
and innovation.
As it relates to becoming more digital, we're on the journey. The potential to gather
data and put it to use more eﬀectively is exciting. We're learning how to work
diﬀerently. We're learning how to put product management, engineering and
business leadership together to work in a more agile fashion.
We're improving many of our processes. And we're empowering our associates with
better tools and technology. Unsolicited, on store visits, associates are saying, "Thank
you for the improved processes." That's music to our ears. These processes are more
intuitive. And we think associate experiences should be consumer-grade. So we're
making progress in stores. But it's more than just that. Take our recent by the room
launch in the home section on Walmart.com. One product manager, one designer
and 2 engineers developed that from idea to launch in just 2 short sprints. That's 4
weeks in total. That's fast.
Third, to deliver strong eﬃcient growth, we have to drive productivity, managing
expenses aggressively and be decisive when it comes to our capital and our time.
We have to operate with discipline. We developed cost-savings initiatives and a
process to drive them that will give us additional ﬂexibility as a company. You can
see our disciplined focus in our portfolio decisions. There's a pattern back to our
decisions to exit Vips restaurants and Suburbia apparel stores in Mexico, our
ﬁnancial services business in Chile, banks in Canada and Mexico, format in-store
closures and the decisions announced this year related to Brazil and the U.K.
We are actively repositioning the business and will keep making deliberate decisions
about where to play. We are prioritizing the U.S. Walmex, Canada, India and China.
We are prioritizing comp store sales and e-commerce growth over new store growth.
We're investing in technology, especially cloud, data and analytics and in the supply
chain of the future, including last mile delivery.
We see the big picture as it relates to an emerging retail business model that
operates as an ecosystem. We see lots of natural adjacencies to our core business. ItFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 8 of 70starts with the customer and what they want and need. We can serve them better by
leveraging data and relationships to create a unique network of assets, capabilities
and services that provide solutions for them in an integrated and seamless way.
Buying and selling merchandise is important. And it's a competency that takes time
to develop at scale. We are thankful it's a core competency.
Building on that, from an omnichannel position with ideas like a third-party
marketplace or an advertising business, for example, makes sense. As you saw from
our recent announcement, we're expanding our entertainment ecosystem to bring
new interactive content to our customers. We're in the pharmacy and optical
business. But we can do more to help our customers when it comes to their health.
We see a lot of opportunities.
And ﬁnally, we're building trust, which will become even more of a competitive
advantage. We'll do that by improving the experience of shopping with us and by
continuing to strengthen our compliance and ethics programs and acting with
integrity. We'll also do it by strengthening the fabric of the communities where we
operate and by making a diﬀerence in the world by using our scale for good.
Our customers want to feel good about shopping with us. And many of them value
the role that we play in communities. When they feel good about us as a company,
that increases trust. So we're telling our story better and we're giving them proof
points. We've eliminated 77% of the waste from our system. As a result of new solar
and wind projects, we'll more than double our renewable energy in the U.S. by the
end of 2020. That means in two years, 35% of our energy globally will be supplied
by renewables. And our merchants are innovating with suppliers to make our
products and our packaging more sustainable. We're on track this year to reach our
goal of providing 4 billion meals globally between 2014 and 2019 to those that need
them, 4 billion.
We're also proud of the opportunities we're providing to our associates. In addition
to better tools and training, we increased the starting wage for our U.S. associates
several times these past few years. Looking back, we're convinced that this was a
good business decision, as were the increases we've given them since then. We're
performing better as a business and retaining more associates. We'll keep investing
in our people, their wages, beneﬁts and training by market as we have been this
year. We've also expanded maternity and parental leave for salaried and hourly
associates and announced that we'll help U.S. associates earn a college degree at
accredited universities for $1 a day. We've also hired over 200,000 veterans over the
last ﬁve years here in the U.S. In a world that's increasingly digital, it will still be our
people that make a diﬀerence at Walmart and help us win the future.
So in summary, here's what we hope you'll take away today: First, we've proven we
can execute. And you can see the innovation. We're not just reacting to a changing
environment, we're shaping the future; second, we're moving faster and we have
momentum; third, we have unique assets that enable us to serve customers better
than others in important ways; and last, we're operating with discipline and investing
thoughtfully while balancing the short term with the long term.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

(presentation)
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Good morning. I'll also welcome you to Bentonville. And for those of you on the
webcast, we really appreciate your interest in our company every year for this event.
So as you can see from the video that we showed earlier. And that video has been a
really slow, eventful -- uneventful year here in Bentonville. So a lot going on inside
the company. It's a really, really exciting time at Walmart. I'm looking forward to
explaining why I feel so good about Walmart's position and why I think you should,
too.
I'm starting my 19th year at the company. And I see as much opportunity today -- or I
see as much opportunity in the future as I did when I ﬁrst came to Walmart. We're
leveraging our scale, our unique assets and ﬁnancial strength in ways that others
can't to enhance and build structural competitive advantages. It's a great company.
And it's an incredible culture that I feel certain will win with both customers and
shareholders in the years to come.
So you've seen a few headlines from our release this morning. But I'll add some
color over the next several minutes. There's a few things that I want you to take away
from this morning. We continue to transform the company to win. Recent
investments are paying oﬀ. Our long-term ﬁnancial priorities remain consistent.
We're making progress on costs, fueling our ability to win. We're delivering against
our guidance. And we have good momentum as we head into ﬁscal year 2020.
Doug just described how we're planning to win in the future. And I'm going to
expand on that with a ﬁnancial view of the company and how we believe investors
should view us. We're a diverse omni-company that looks quite diﬀerent than we
used to because of actions we've taken over the past several years, which you see
here. But we still have the same DNA that has made us successful over the last 56
years.
When you take those actions and you put it on top of our existing business, you can
see the full view of what we built. We have an ecosystem leveraging competitive
advantages through omnichannel capabilities, stores, services, e-commerce sites,
supply chain and a team of 2.2 million associates. It's an ecosystem that allows us to
serve customers in a really unique way. No one has the asset base that we have.
Then when you combine the ecosystem with our ﬁnancial strength, there really isn't a
company like Walmart. We're the ﬁrst company with $0.5 trillion in annual revenue; a
rock-solid balance sheet with a AA credit rating; a diversiﬁed asset base, physical,
digital, in the most important geographies; nearly 265 million customer transactions
a week; and strong stable cash ﬂow and in fact, over $28 billion of operating cash
ﬂow last year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 70This ﬁnancial strength gives us the ability to deliver near-term results while we're
positioning the business for the longer term. Now three years ago at this meeting,
we discussed investments that we needed to make to win long term. It was a
challenging decision to reduce earnings in the short term. But those investments are
paying oﬀ. U.S. store investments have led to improved customer experience leading
to strong sales and traﬃc. In grocery pickup, three years ago, we had fewer than 50
stores oﬀering this service. But today, we have around 2,000 stores with great
customer satisfaction. The investments we've made in Walmart.com, in web site
redesign, category specialists, have led to key new brands on our site. And we've
been able to oﬀer free 2-day shipping on e-commerce orders because of the
fulﬁllment investments that we made in prior years.
We've also invested in technology and in process improvements that have helped
increase productivity, manage inventory, reduce costs and serve customers in new
and exciting ways. But during this period, we've continued to deliver strong comp
sales, improvement in expense leverage, strong dividends and consistent share
repurchase.
So one of the primary questions I get from investors is, "When will you be done
investing?" A business that doesn't invest doesn't -- won't last. We all know that.
We're going to continue to invest in our business thoughtfully and strategically.
We're focused on ensuring the good returns from these investments over time. And
we've tracked well against what we said we'd do.
The payoﬀ from past investments is helping fund new investments. And that model is
working for us. The great thing about the ﬁnancial strength that we have and our --
the breadth of our business is that we can pull many diﬀerent levers to ensure we
ﬁnd an optimal balance of investing long term with consistently strong ﬁnancial
results. There are a lot of diﬀerent ways for us to ﬁnd that balance. Many companies
have to choose between defending their core business and investing in new
businesses. We can do both and still deliver solid ﬁnancial results.
Now a key reason why we can continue to thoughtfully invest in our future is that the
core business is really strong. We're pleased with our ﬁrst half performance. We've
had some tailwinds this year, strong economies around the world. But I still feel
good about our performance and in particular, the 3-plus % comp in Walmart U.S. in
the ﬁrst half. Our scale is just so hard to put into context sometimes. The percentages
kind of lose meaning. But that level of comp over a full year at Walmart U.S. would
result in growth of nearly $10 billion, which is quite amazing.
Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales have increased a strong 36% for the ﬁrst half of the
year. And we expect to be around 40% for the full year. The core Walmart
International continues to operate very well. And Walmex is leading the way. Sam's
Club had a good ﬁrst half with traﬃc-driven comp sales and improvement in
membership trends. We're achieving expense leverage across many parts of the
company. And this leverage gives us the additional ﬂexibility to invest in price, in
omnichannel and in innovation. So overall, it was a good ﬁrst half performance. And
we're well positioned for the back half of the year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 70You've heard me talk about our ﬁnancial priorities over the past couple years. And
they haven't changed. There's strong eﬃcient growth, consistent operating discipline
and strategic capital allocation. And I'll spend a few minutes providing more color on
each one of these.
We continue to prioritize comp sales and e-commerce growth over new stores. And
this chart I think shows our ongoing transformation as well as any. Over the past
several years, we've made signiﬁcant progress in generating more growth from
comp sales and e-commerce while slowing new store openings, particularly in the
U.S. So we see FY '15, approximately 2/3 of our sales growth came from new stores
and clubs. That's represented by the blue shading in the slide. In FY '20, we expect
this number to be less than 10%. As we continue to elevate the customer experience
in our stores, you've seen momentum with four years of positive comp sales in traﬃc
in Walmart U.S.
In U.S. e-commerce, we continue focusing on improving the customer value index.
And you're going to hear more about that from Marc later this morning. We're also
seeing good comp growth in International. And we're including expansion of
omnichannel initiatives in key markets like Mexico and in Canada and in China. So
you will continue to see us to invest in areas that will deliver strong, eﬃcient growth.
I'm really pleased with the progress we're making around operating discipline. Our
cost culture is more evident again in Walmart. It's impressive how the Walmart U.S.
stores team has leveraged expenses for 6 consecutive quarters even after raising the
facility start rates earlier this year. There's a lot of good work going on in Walmart
U.S.
Last year, you heard me mention for the ﬁrst time a formal zero-based budgeting
process. You also now -- you'll hear that referred to as cost transformation or smart
spin. We have a team in place that's helping the organization ﬁnd and execute on
new savings ideas. On my desk, there's a list of more than 300 cost-savings
initiatives that are currently being worked or evaluated. There are some big ideas,
some of which are going to take more time. And there are a lot of smaller initiatives
that can add up. You know Walmart well. You can take a lot of small projects, scale
them across the business and they can lead to some pretty impressive savings.
I'm also proud of the work we've done in working capital over the past few years. It's
been a true total company eﬀort. Over the past few years, we've taken out nearly $10
billion in working capital, which has allowed us to invest for future growth. We're
leveraging technology, data and analytics in new ways to be more productive. We're
testing robotics and automation to handle routine tasks so associates can spend
more time serving customers. And if you were on the store tours yesterday, you saw
a number of these examples.
Another example of a new approach to innovation is our new tech incubator in
Austin, Texas, where we're working on analytics, AI and machine learning. It's aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 12 of 70diﬀerent approach that allows us to recruit some of the brightest minds to a tech hub
to help us solve complex problems more eﬃciently and eﬀectively.
So when we tie it all together, we'll continue to make progress on lowering expenses
as a percentage of sales. We believe we can achieve about 20 basis points of SG&A
leverage next year and believe we can generate a similar level of year-over-year
leverage for the next few years, assuming consistent levels of comp sales.
Let me give you a few more examples of leverage opportunities. One example is
utilities. We're in the process of a multiyear rollout of replacing all ﬂuorescent ﬁxtures
with LEDs in our stores, our clubs and our parking lots. And not only is it good for
the environment, these changes could reduce our annual energy costs by $200
million over time. A little more than a year ago, we brought together the ﬁnancing
global services organizations, the former group called Walmart Enterprise Solutions,
to drive more eﬃciency across the business on common services and practices. The
Austin tech hub you just saw is part of that group. It's still early in development. But
we're making progress.
One of our focus areas has been on bots. And as Doug mentioned earlier, we're
starting to automate these manual repetitive tasks in areas like accounts payable.
And that allows associates to focus more in engaging impactful work, which is good
for our associates.
Another area of opportunity I've mentioned over the past year is Goods Not For
Resale, or GNFR. We buy tens of billions of dollars in goods and services just in the
U.S. So think travel services, cleaning services, maintenance, supplies. Recently, we
hired a new Chief Procurement Oﬃcer to lead GNFR, who has more than 25 years of
direct and indirect procurement experience with multinational companies. We're
really excited about having him join the company and believe this can be a big
opportunity for us.
Here's an example how GNFR can improve our business. Take the ﬂoor wax that we
use in our stores. We recently changed to a new ﬂoor wax. Not only is the new wax
cheaper, it's also sturdier. It doesn't need to be buﬀed as often, resulting in less
spend on the actual buﬃng as well as fuel for the machines. That one change in ﬂoor
wax will save us over $20 million a year. So these small diﬀerences can make a big
diﬀerence to Walmart. So I think you can see we're attacking costs diﬀerently than in
the past. And it's starting to pay oﬀ.
When you see the changes in our capital allocation over the past ﬁve years, it's
another opportunity you can see the company transforming. The allocation of capital
is quite diﬀerent from before and aligned with how we'll serve customers in the
future. We've shipped the spend away from new stores and clubs in the U.S.,
represented by the black shading here. And have allocated more capital to e-
commerce, store remodels, supply chain and technology. And this is roughly the
type of allocation I think you can expect over the next couple of years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 13 of 70While we transform, we continue to return a signiﬁcant amount of cash to
shareholders. Over the past 2.5 years, we've returned nearly $34 billion to
shareholders. We've increased our dividend for 45 consecutive years. And we
remain committed to our share repurchase program. When we instituted the current
$20 billion program a year ago, we estimated utilizing this authority over
approximately two years. Earlier this year, we paused buybacks for a while due to the
pending Flipkart announcement. Now that we've returned to a more normalized
pace of buyback, we expect to utilize the remaining authorization over the next 18
months or so. And that's considered in the guidance that we've given you today.
So speaking of guidance, let's turn to how all this comes together. Let's start with
how we've done versus guidance we gave both at the ﬁrst of the year as well as our
recent guidance in August. Certainly, the Flipkart acquisition makes comparability a
little more challenging. And we'll try to make that as clear as we can for you today.
In our Q2 earnings release, we updated full year guidance for this year on several
metrics that excluded the impact of Flipkart as it hadn't closed when we had our
earnings release. Today, we're reiterating that ex Flipkart guidance as we still feel
good about the underlying momentum of the business. However, today, as you saw
earlier, for simplicity, we're formally updating our FY '19 EPS guidance to include
Flipkart. When we closed Flipkart, we noted that we expected a negative impact to
FY '19 EPS of approximately $0.25 to $0.30, adjusted pro forma for a closing date.
And this included, if you remember, operating losses as well as interest related to
the debt that we had issued. So we're adjusting our full year '19 EPS guidance down
by $0.25 to adjust for Flipkart. So the $4.90 to $5.05 adjusted EPS ex Flipkart from
August will now be $4.65 to $4.80, including Flipkart.
Okay. So to be clear, there's no underlying change to the EPS guidance that we gave
in August. This is only an adjustment to include our best estimate of the Flipkart
impact in FY '19 EPS.
So in coming back to the slide, as you can see, when compared to the original 4-year
guidance provided in February, we met or, in most cases, exceeded and raised our
guidance in our August update. One number I want to call your attention to is the
International net sales number. It's about halfway down the slide. When we gave
guidance early in the year, it didn't include the Brazil transaction because it hadn't
been done at that time. If Brazil were in our sales number for the rest of the year, we
would have exceeded our February guidance, which is why we have that check mark
by that number even though the actual number will be lower than we guided in
February. And I just want to make that clear for you. So we're doing what we said
we'd do.
Let's turn to expectations for our next ﬁscal year. Before I get to the guidance,
though, I want to mention a couple of things. Certainly, we're in a dynamic period of
time. And that includes the current environment around tariﬀs. It's important to
remember that 2/3 of our U.S. purchases are made in the U.S.A. and that we import
from numerous countries around the world. Our merchant teams are monitoring
market pricing and will respond as warranted. Our goal is to always be the low priceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 14 of 70leader. We will actively manage pricing and margins through this period. Of course,
we never want to raise prices. And we will minimize impacts on our customers as
much as possible while balancing the interest of investors.
I hope you'll appreciate today that we're giving you as much guidance as we believe
practical given that we're still several months away from the start of the ﬁscal year.
And we'll update this guidance for you as we get to February as we typically would.
All of our FY '20 guidance includes Flipkart. And that's how we'll report in the future.
However, in order to give you a better apples-to-apples sense of our business
performance in the press release this morning and in our discussion today, I'll
reference a few metrics ex Flipkart.
Judith will talk about Flipkart in a few more minutes. We know you want to
understand Flipkart and particularly, things like the path to proﬁtability more clearly.
We're very excited about this investment in India. It's a dynamic market. And we
certainly intend to win there. And as you can imagine, it is our objective to be
proﬁtable over time. We're going to continue to ﬁnd a balance in giving you some
visibility to Flipkart. But we ask you to also understand the competitive aspects of
disclosure.
As I said earlier, we have a lot of levers to pull across the business to ensure the total
company results are what we expect and also what you expect. So with that, let's talk
about guidance. As always, guidance includes a number of assumptions, including
net inﬂation, currencies, tax rates and economic conditions stay relatively consistent
in all of our major markets. Guidance also excludes any changes in the value of our
minority interest in JD.com as we had an accounting change this year. Also, recall
that Flipkart is only in our FY '19 numbers for only a little less than half the year.
So let's start with top line growth. We expect to deliver total net sales growth of at
least 3% on a constant currency basis. Now as a reminder, we had Brazil in our
consolidated results for a bit more than half of FY '19 and it won't be in our
consolidated results in FY '20. We'll also continue to see additional planned
reduction of tobacco sales at Sam's as we pursue our strategy there. Those 2 items
will account for about 100 basis points of headwind next year. Without those items,
we would have expected sales growth to be more in a 4% range.
We expect continued momentum at Walmart U.S. with FY '20 comp sales growth of
2.5% to 3%, which includes Walmart U.S. e-commerce. Walmart U.S. e-commerce is
expected to continue strong sales growth of around 35% in FY '20 on top of the
approximate 40% growth expected this year. So with those 2 growth rates, that
would represent nearly a doubling of that business over a 2-year period.
In International, we expect continued strong growth from Walmex as well as the
addition of Flipkart to drive International sales growth of around 5% on a constant
currency basis. Sam's Club comp sales, excluding fuel and tobacco, are expected to
grow approximately 3% on top of solid growth this year. We expect Sam's total salesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 15 of 70to grow only about 1%, though, due to the tobacco sales reductions that I just
mentioned earlier. So overall, we expect continued strong top line growth.
Turning to proﬁtability. We expect operating income dollars to decline by low single-
digit percentage next year, primarily due to Flipkart being in for a full year next year
and only a partial year this year. If you were to exclude the operating losses from
Flipkart in the current year and next, we would expect operating income dollars to
be up a low single-digit percentage next year. In other words, we expect the
proﬁtability of the underlying core business to increase. We also expect EPS to
decline by a low single-digit percentage in FY '20. Excluding the approximately
$0.60 full year EPS dilution expected from Flipkart versus only a partial year dilution
this year, we would expect EPS to reﬂect a low to mid-single-digit percentage
increase.
Let me talk for a minute about e-commerce proﬁtability. We've been saying for a
while that breaking out the proﬁtability of stores versus e-commerce is becoming
more challenging given that the customer is shopping in an increasingly omni
fashion. As the lines blur further, we will likely ﬁnd it increasingly challenging to
break this out for you. However, we do want to give you some guidance for next
year. As you know, we did increase our loss expectation for Walmart U.S. e-
commerce in August. And given how we measure it today, we expect losses to
increase some next year.
We continue to accelerate investments in same-day grocery delivery, people and
technology in order to nail the fundamentals of e-commerce, including increased
investments in Store 8 to help shape the future of shopping. In addition, some of the
acquisitions we've made as well as getting additional home and apparel brands
online will help improve margin mix over time. But overall with the company, the
proﬁtability of the total underlying business is in good shape.
We've made good progress on being more eﬃcient in lowering costs, especially in
Walmart U.S. stores. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect to leverage expenses by
about 20 basis points next year. And it would have -- I would have expected it to be
higher excluding Flipkart.
As to tax, we expect the tax rate in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%. This may seem a little
high to you. But remember that the Flipkart losses will have very little tax beneﬁt in
the near term as we said earlier when we announced the closing.
We expect CapEx of around $11 billion in FY '20, fairly consistent with prior years.
And we expect the allocation of capital by segment also to be pretty similar to what
you see this current year. We expect to only add a few new stores in the U.S. next
year, which has been the trend.
In International, we continue to see good opportunities for new store growth,
primarily in Mexico and China. So we'll add slightly more than 300 stores across
International in FY '20, many of which are fairly small in size.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 16 of 70Judith McKennaAs I said earlier, we're in a dynamic period. But we feel good about the things that
we can control. And as I stand here today, we believe our momentum will carry over
in FY '20, as you can see from this early guidance.
As I close, I hope you've gotten a sense of why we're excited about the future and
the strategy that we're executing. We're leveraging unique assets in ways that few
can. Our business is strong. We're changing how we work to operate with discipline.
We're leveraging expenses. We're balancing investments for growth and proﬁtability.
And we continue to be thoughtful on how we allocate capital. And we're delivering
against our guidance.
This is a unique company. And I could not be prouder to be part of the team that you
see sitting over here. We have a lot of leverage to pull in order to deliver the near-
term results while ensuring that we win long term. I'm conﬁdent that we're going to
be a winner. And I want you to leave here today feeling the same way. Thank you.

{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning. Well it's
certainly been a busy eight months in my new role. And we've got a lot to talk about.
And I know this morning many of you want to talk about Flipkart. And I promise I'm
going to focus on that shortly.
But ﬁrst of all, I'd like to set a broader context around the changing shape of
Walmart International. Today, we're a $118 billion business. On a stand-alone basis,
we'd actually be the largest retailer outside of the U.S. Over the last four years,
International has delivered a consistent performance. We're seeing sales rising
around 3% and proﬁts growing ahead of sales. There's been a really clear strategy.
But we recognize today that what got us here won't necessarily get us to where we
need to go in the future.
Around the world, customers' expectations are increasing, competition is
intensifying and the macro issues are more complex than they've ever been before.
And Doug spoke about seizing the moment, about adapting and changing. And
that's exactly what we've been doing. We've been proactive. We've taken thoughtful
and deliberate actions to position our portfolio and each of our markets for future
success.
Over recent months, you've changed -- see us change the shape and structure of the
portfolio. We're linked in to e-commerce and omni channel, investing in Flipkart to
grow in India, strengthened our last mile capabilities in Mexico and Chile with the
announced acquisition of Cornershop. And in Japan, we entered a joint venture with
Rakuten for grocery delivery. And Doug mentioned our partnerships in China with
JD and JD Daoija.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 17 of 70But as well as investing, we've taken deliberate steps to simplify our business. We're
divesting of noncore assets like our bank in Canada and our ﬁnancial services
business in Chile. And we've made more fundamental moves to position our
business for that long-term success.
In June, we announced the sale of an 80% stake in our Brazilian business to Advent.
And in April, we announced the intention to merge our U.K. business, Asda, with the
#2 retailer there, Sainsbury's. And we'll have a 42% shareholding in the new
combined business when that concludes. Now some of you might have seen this
morning a statement from the U.K. competition authorities. That's simply an outline
of what they're going to investigate and how they're going to investigate. And just so
that you know, that contained no surprises for us whatsoever.
The common link in all of these actions is that we're being deliberate about where
and how we choose to operate. And as a result, we're creating strong local
businesses; accelerating omnichannel capabilities; prioritizing our resources; and
ultimately, providing greater access to growth because Walmart International's role
in Walmart is to create long-term sustainable and proﬁtable growth. And we're going
to do that through a strategy that is really simple: strong local businesses powered
by Walmart. Strong local businesses means locally relevant, customer-focused in
each of the markets in which we operate. And powered by Walmart is the
competitive advantage that's created by being part of the Walmart family.
Around the world, we know that one size does not ﬁt all. And to be a successful
international retailer, we need to be even more local in the eyes of our customers.
But at the same time, we have to continue to be deliberate about where and how we
allocate our resources, both people and capital. And that equation is going to be
diﬀerent by market. Today, there's 3 of our business I'd like to add some color to for
you before I move on to talk about powered by Walmart a little and then India:
Canada, Walmex and China.
Turning ﬁrst to Canada. We've got a really strong business in Canada. It's closely
aligned to the U.S.. And it's going to continue to be one of our most proﬁtable
businesses with strong returns. And in addition, it continues to provide real talent for
the rest of the Walmart world. The team there are innovating to modernize the store
base. But at the same time, they're rapidly building out omnichannel capabilities
with a focus on getting a greater access to urban centers across Canada. They're
partnering with forward-thinking companies like Penguin Pick-Up in the Toronto area
for grocery and general merchandise. And in Vancouver, they're partnering with
Food-X, a company that specializes in last mile delivery of local unorganic groceries.
So turning next to Mexico round Central America. Walmex are the market leaders.
And they have got attractive scale, positioning and performance. And before I talk
any more about them, I do want to say congratulations to the Mexico team for being
shortlisted on the IGD's global store of the year. They're doing a fantastic job.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 18 of 70And overall, Walmex continues to be one of our most successful business. Last year,
their total sales were $30 billion. And they provided strong returns. And that strength
continues. So far this year, Mexico speciﬁcally have delivered a 7.5% comp. And as
that market continues to formalize, we're going to continue to invest in our physical
stores and our clubs.
But the team there are also increasingly focused on e-commerce. Our store footprint,
our logistics network and our leadership position gives us a unique opportunity to
build an omnichannel ecosystem tailored to the Mexican customer.
So for example, we recently launched an app called Cashi, which gives customers a
secure and ﬂexible form of digital payment on their mobile phone. In a market
where most people are unbanked, what's unique about Cashi is that it allows
customers to come in to our stores and load cash onto their mobile device. It can
then be used in our stores, on our online sites. And they can also use it to pay bills
and utilities. It's available in more than 200 stores today with plans to be in many
more by the year-end. It's a great innovation. But it's also solving a real pain point for
Mexican customers.
And moving on to China. This continues to be a signiﬁcant opportunity for growth.
With 1.4 billion people, a rapidly evolving retail environment, it's going to be the
single biggest source of global retail growth over the next ﬁve years. Last year at this
meeting, we told you we were rebalancing the business, diﬀerentiating our customer
value proposition and partnering for omnichannel success. We're executing on all 3
of those. We've continued to open new stores in our priority provinces while, at the
same time, closing stores when necessary. We're evolving our customer value
proposition with improving fresh food quality, a new supermarket format, smallest
footprint supercenter and a future-thinking Sam's Club layout, the ﬁrst of which will
be a remodel in Shanghai opening in December.
And alongside our ecosystem partners, we continue to imagine retail for the future
for our customers, trialing new concepts, investing in our digital oﬀering to serve
them even better. One of my favorite examples of this is what we're doing for
Walmart and Sam's Clubs there with small urban fulﬁllment centers. Think 2,500
square feet, around 2,000 items tailored to Chinese families' everyday needs. The
items are picked in around 5 minutes by our team of associates and delivered to the
customer by JD Daoija in less than 60 minutes. I saw one ﬁrst-hand in Shenzhen
recently. And they are really busy units. And we're learning a lot from the concept.
These are going to be an important part of our omnichannel oﬀering going
forwards.
So strong local businesses. But let me turn to powered by Walmart. This is an area
where we're sharpening our focus, simplifying our approach to maximize the value
we can bring from our unique scale and capabilities. Some examples would be
leveraging capabilities and partnering with the U.S. to accelerate grocery pickup and
delivery in Canada, developing centralized cost analytics tools to equip merchants in
every market to more eﬀectively negotiate with suppliers. And we're investing in our
sourcing capabilities, technology, processes and people to increase our leverage inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 19 of 70this area. If I just stay with sourcing, it's worth saying that we're taking our scale and
expertise. And we're learning how to provide sourcing services for commercial
partners such as Advent in Brazil. And that's something that we might in the future
develop as an external service even more broadly.
And ﬁnally, on powered by Walmart is people, an incredibly important part of it. Our
people make the diﬀerence every day right around the world. And one particular
aspect for us is global mobility. Not only is it a great way to develop leaders. But it
actually allows us to eﬀectively share best practice and learnings across markets
really fast. And we're introducing some new programs this year speciﬁcally to
support that.
So let me turn now to talk a little bit about Flipkart. I want to talk to you about our
rationale, to give you some color about the ecosystem that's operating there and
then also to give you some insights into how we've been thinking about some of the
key questions that you've been asking.
So on the rationale, I think of this in 3 parts: Why India, why e-commerce and why
Flipkart. Why India? Well people forget that we've actually operated best price stores
in India for the last 10 years. They're our cash-and-carry format. So we know the
challenges of the format -- we know the challenges of the market. And that gives us
the conﬁdence that we can operate there. But we also understand the tremendous
growth that's available.
Today's population in India is 1.3 billion people. They have a median age of just 28.
There's a developing middle class and GDP growth. And the Indian economy is
projected to be the third largest in the world by 2030. So given that, why e-
commerce? Well this is a market that I can promise you is generation skipping. There
are more than 300 million smartphone users in India today. And while e-commerce
is only about 2% of retail sales today, it's growing at 4x the rate of total retail. And to
give you some context for that, China was at 2% in 2009. And today, it's at 25%.
So we have no doubt that e-commerce in India is the right place to be, which brings
me on to why Flipkart. Now this is already a very successful business. They've built
signiﬁcant scale and momentum and have got leading positions in key categories
like mobile, appliances and apparel. They're a homegrown business with a strong
team who are really focused on developing innovative solutions for the Indian
customer. And what I can tell you, that this is a unique market and it needs a unique
local approach. And that's because there's many Indias. There's 22 diﬀerent oﬃcial
languages across 29 states. The cities, towns and villages at really diﬀerent stages of
development. I was visiting the team out in India a couple of weeks ago. And I visited
a rural farming community on one hand and on the other hand, one of our best price
stores in a more urban location. They were extraordinarily diﬀerent experiences. And
one of the states that I was in, which is Uttar Pradesh -- and by the way, if it was a
stand-alone country, by population, it would be the ﬁfth largest in the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 20 of 70Flipkart's leadership team understands these diﬀerences. They're making customer-
focused decisions and customer-focused solutions. And it's an integral part of their
approach and their success. I am really conﬁdent having spent time with the team
that at all levels, that team is one of the real strengths of the business.
So this is a successful business already. They ﬁnished their ﬁnancial year to March
2018 with net sales of $4.6 billion. And sales momentum continues to be strong.
They have e-commerce active customers have grown to 64 million. And Flipkart is
continuing to build out their ecosystem through organic development, acquisition
and partnership.
So let me talk about the ecosystem for a while. Now there's a lot of parts to this
ecosystem. But there's a couple main ones that I'd like to describe in some more
detail to you. 3 e-commerce platforms, Flipkart, Myntra and Jabong. And I'll talk
about those ﬁrst. Then I'll come on to talk about the logistics business, eKart and
PhonePe.
Flipkart is the core platform. It represents around 80% of total revenue for the group
through a broad category oﬀer. They have got a true passion for solving problems
unique to that Indian customer, whether it's in the project that they sell or the
technology platform that they've created. From Day 1, the Flipkart team recognized
that bandwidth would be an issue for smartphone users. So they designed their app
to be able to use the smallest possible amount of data. And it's a real advantage for
them. And they've applied that kind of thinking to categories as well such as mobile
phones. They were the pioneers in this category. And they partnered with suppliers
to develop a full range of products across price points. They've even created their
own successful private brand called Billion to increase aﬀordability without losing
functionality. And to round out the oﬀer, they introduced a guaranteed buyback
program, warranty and repair services and installment payment options.
So you can see that what Flipkart have done is actually built out an important
relationship with the customer through a mobile phone. Access and aﬀordability
brings in new customers, while service and reliability builds trust and earns repeat
business. It's just one example of their laser-like customer approach. But they've also
got leading positions in many of the categories that count.
They're also looking to continue to build out their customer oﬀer, whether it's
appliances, furniture, apparel, books, electronics. But they've also recently entered
into grocery, starting with a small pilot in Bangalore and plans to expand into 3 more
cities this year. That's an area that as they learn from the trial, we really think we're
positioned to support them.
Turning next to Myntra and Jabong. And these are the group's fashion specialty
sites. Their vision is to make the world a more stylish, colorful and happier place,
which I quite like. But together, they're the market leaders in online fashion. They
oﬀer a wide range of international brands, including more than 100 exclusive labels.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 21 of 70And they've also created a strong private brand oﬀer that includes celebrity
partnerships.
But it's not just their leadership position in assortment that's impressive. Their
innovation in technology is as well. I was there recently. And I was able to test their
shoe sizing functionality on their app. It uses augmented reality to measure the size
of your foot. And by the way, it's accurate because I've done it. So the result is you're
happy because you get a shoe that ﬁts. But cleverly, we also minimize returns. So it's
also cost-eﬀective. It's really clever. And by the way, yesterday, we launched Myntra
product on the Walmart Canada website just in time for the festival season.
Now as Flipkart grew, none of the existing delivery partners were able to keep up
with them. So they created their own logistics service called eKart, another key part
of this ecosystem. It picks up from sellers, it operates fulﬁllment centers and it
delivers to customers. They provide a personal doorstop service. With a network of
fulﬁllment centers that serves 90% of Indian ZIP codes, eKart have a low cost-to-
serve model with one of the broadest reaches in India. Today, they deliver on
average around 600,000 packages a day. And at peak, they'll deliver more than 1.5
million.
They continue to focus on their service and reach with eKart, which brings me ﬁnally
onto PhonePe. This is part of the ecosystem. But it's also a platform in its own right.
And it's one that's anchored in digital payments. We're really excited about the
possibilities here. It's a business that only launched in September 2016. And they
designed their app to work with an interface that was developed by the Indian
government for interbank transactions called UPI. And because they were an early
mover, they're already becoming -- or they already become India's second largest
payments company.
Today, they have 130 million app installations. 100 million monthly transactions. And
as of September, their annualized transaction processing value, TPV, was $32 billion.
And to give you some idea of a perspective for this, in their last quarter, TPV grew by
over 1,000% year-on-year.
Their growth is impressive. But what I really like about them is that PhonePe is an
open platform that helps create real stickiness for the customers who use it. They can
send money across the country in real time simply by exchanging a phone number
with another user. They can pay for anything, from utilities and mobile charges, to
insurance premiums and credit card bills. You can even buy and sell gold online,
which, if you understand India, you'll know is a really important category.
But at the same time, PhonePe are expanding their reach. For example, they have
micro-apps that allow you to pay for your ride share through Ola, book a hotel room
through OYO or even pay for your meal at any McDonald's in India through the
PhonePe app.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

Page 22 of 70But the real advantage for them is they recognize they're not going to win with a
single use case. They're providing simple solutions for customers to send, spend,
manage and grow money. And I promise you, their tech team that is delivering this is
really impressive. We've seen in other markets around the world how powerful
payments in ﬁnancial services can be. And that's why we're excited about this
particular part of the system.
Now switching gears. You might have heard about Big Billion Day, which is the
annual online event created by Flipkart. It's their biggest week of the year. And it
took place last week. It was their most successful event ever with record numbers of
customers coming to the site and purchasing. But to give you a bit of a ﬂavor for the
excitement that builds around there and kind of the way they present this, let me
show you a couple of adverts.
(presentation)
So you can see, it's a business with personality and a sense of humor as well. Now I
recognize that a lot of you have questions about Flipkart. I got a number of them last
night. So I thought I'd end by trying to give you some insight into how we're thinking
about some of those questions. How will Flipkart win? How will we keep their
entrepreneurial spirit and operate Flipkart? How do we think about balancing
growth and proﬁtability? And ﬁnally, are we still on a path to an IPO?
Well on winning, I hope that I've illustrated the capabilities and approach that
Flipkart have got. But I'd sum it up by saying this: they're focused on the unique
needs of the Indian customer. They're leading in key traﬃc-driving categories such
as apparel and mobile. They're innovating in the use of data and AI, not only to serve
and acquire customers but to drive eﬃciency and lower costs. And they're building
out a sticky ecosystem that includes PhonePe, a tailor-made, digital platform
anchored in payments, all with the foundation of a strong management team at all
levels through the organization who have the vision and the expertise to win. We
expect to see strong competition in India. We were aware of that when we entered
the transaction and we're prepared for it.
And I'd also remind everybody that Flipkart was successful in a very competitive
market long before we came along. But one of the things I really like about the
Flipkart team is they keep their focus ﬁrmly on their customer and how to serve
them, not on what everybody else is doing.
And that customer focus is part of who they are as is their entrepreneurial spirit.
We've been very deliberate in the way we've partnered with this business and our
fellow shareholders to preserve that. We've made no changes to operational
management. And that management team continues to run the business, with the
Flipkart board guiding strategy and ﬁnancial performance.
The board structure has representation from Tencent and Global and Tiger Global,
along with Walmart and independent directors. We trust this team to test and learnFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 23 of 70Daniel Thomas Binder

Daniel J. Bartlettand absolutely empower them to innovate at a local level with speed. It's very much
part of the spirit of strong local businesses powered by Walmart. And where our
global scale, leverage and best practice can help them, we're making that available.
And we set up a new function called partnership services to make that easy.
So how do we think about balancing growth and proﬁtability? It's always a challenge
to articulate this. What I'd tell you is that we're in India for the long term and we're in
India to be successful. You've heard me say that the business has got good
momentum. And as Brett said, we have a long-term path to proﬁtability. But we're
not changing our guidance today. The team are thoughtful about how they scale the
business, though. They deliberately grow categories such as apparel, which helps
the overall margin mix, letting them grow in a healthier way.
In addition, they're looking at how they use data and services to create new revenue
streams and lower transaction costs. One example of those services would be at
Volta, which is one -- a Myntra application, which is using AI to digitally design
clothing product. But it also informs range selection as well. That product can be
licensed externally.
We know that the key here is long-term success. And we're going to continue with
Flipkart to create a strong and healthy business model for the future, which leads me
to the IPO question. You should take it as a measure of our conﬁdence that we
believe that this is the right path for Flipkart. It's important for retaining and
incenting the right talent. And although we're not putting a time line on it, we're
supportive of it as is the Walmart -- as is the Flipkart board.
So let me sum up for Walmart International. We've improved our access to growth.
And winning in India is a key focus for us. We're accelerating our omnichannel
capabilities around the world. We're prioritizing our resources and actively working
with partners for long-term success. And we're committed to building strong, local
businesses, which are ultimately powered by Walmart. Thank you.

Page 24 of 70Janey W hitesideI'd like to introduce 2 leaders; they are new to Walmart. Barbara Messing, would you
please stand? Barbara's our new Chief Marketing Oﬃcer for the Walmart brand here
in the U.S. Barbara was most recently the CMO for TripAdvisor. She's responsible for
creating brand consideration and awareness across our U.S. stores and e-commerce
businesses as she leads the marketing team. Thanks, Barbara.
I'd also like to introduce Janey Whiteside. Janey, you can start making your way this
direction. She joined us in August as our ﬁrst ever Chief Customer Oﬃcer for the U.S.
She's working with Greg and Marc to deliver seamless omni-experience for our
customers. When we created this role, we thought it was really important to have
someone whose entire mission was to think about everything that touches the
customer. That includes marketing. But it also brings together customer care,
product management, customer experience, insight and data strategies and
Jet.com. Janey and her team will ensure we infuse customer centricity, integrate
design thinking and work in an agile fashion to ensure we show up where, when and
how our customer wants. Janey joins us after spending more than 20 years at
American Express, where she led the expansion of Amex products into new areas,
connecting with younger customers and creating experiences and rewards for card
members.
Please welcome Janey to the stage.
{BIO 20679101 <GO>}
Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everybody. It is a really special privilege for me to
be here today. After such a long career at American Express, I knew that if I was ever
going to leave, it needed to be for another purpose-driven brand. And I consider
Walmart to be the ultimate purpose-driven brand. In these increasingly anxious
times around the world, it's vital that we don't lose our humanity. And that's why I am
proud to be part of a company that is people-led and tech-enabled.
So I've been on the job for a whole 11 weeks now. I've had the chance to travel the
country and meet so many of our associates. And having met them, I am even more
proud to have the opportunity to serve alongside them. Now Doug has been very
clear with me that it is my job, it's my responsibility to represent the customer and be
their advocate and voice across everything that we do. I like to think about my job as
understanding the role that Walmart can and should play in customers' lives and
ensuring we put an exclamation point on the customer experience in every
interaction. There is only one customer and no interaction with them happens with
us in a silo. And that's why it's important that we create one seamless Walmart
experience. One that is contextual, consistent and frictionless, no matter when, how,
or where the customer wants to engage with us. That's the beauty of putting
marketing, customer experience and strategy, product design and customer care all
under one roof. It allows us to think diﬀerently, to work together to solve problems
on behalf of the customer.
So what does that all mean? Well let me give you an example. It's probably not
surprising that the #1 question customers ask our associates in the store is, "Where isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 25 of 70a particular product?" Enter Store Maps, what I consider to probably be the ultimate
omni-channel project. We used an agile iterative process to bring teams together
across the organization to quickly develop a solution that spans the in-app
experience digitally and changes physical signage in the stores.
I had the opportunity to go to a store in Alabama 2 weeks ago and associates were
excitedly telling me about how they thought this is going to help customers change
their lives by downloading the app and making ﬁnding things easier. And that made
me feel really good. But not only are we making customers' lives easier, we're also
making our customers feel special. Take, for example, our grocery pickup customers.
On Mother's Day, every mom that came to the store to pick up a grocery order got
this bag of treats designed just for her. Think shampoos, chocolates, ﬂowers and all
presented with a simple signed card from their personal shopper. The reactions
were pretty touching, just like this one. "I have 3 adult children and the card I
received from Walmart was the only card I received. I even have it sitting on my
table. Thank you, again, one very satisﬁed customer for life." Honestly, I doubt she's
shopping our customers -- competitors anytime soon.
So ﬁrst order of business for me has been getting to know the customer better. I
think most people have pretty preconceived notions about who our customers are.
And I think they'd be surprised to ﬁnd that our customers are actually the fabric of
America, no matter how you look at it whether by age, by income, by household size,
or by ethnicity, the Walmart customer and the American population are a near mirror
image of each other. It makes sense, right? 165 million people come through our
doors each week, as many as 100 million people visit Walmart.com each month. And
in fact, 90% of America shops with us at least once a year. So while that's all well and
good, we wanted to understand the American shopper better.
So we went back to look at our data. In fact, we looked at loads and loads of data.
We looked at proprietary data. We looked at public data. And we've linked that data
to actual purchasing behavior. And what did we ﬁnd? Well we found 6 broad
shopping behaviors. What's common across those shopping behaviors is that
everybody is looking for value. What's diﬀerent is the way that people deﬁne that
value. We're seeing the value equation as being a function of price, convenience and
the emphasis that shoppers place on quality. We're just starting the work to lay out
how each of these groups solve this equation with their shopping habits and more to
come on that over time. While today, we serve all of these groups to diﬀerent
extents, we have the opportunity to expand our share of wallet and drive growth by
oﬀering new assortment and new ways and places for customers to shop with us.
Think about all of our oﬀerings. Our stores, our omni-channel options, Walmart.com,
Sam's Club, Jet.com and our newly acquired brands. These assets work in harmony
to help us serve more of America. And as we do that, we balance out margins and
gain entirely new customers.
Our core customer is most concerned with price. We can't lose this customer. We
won't lose this customer. And we will always ﬁght for them. But we can't achieve our
growth ambitions without expanding beyond them. And we're going to do that by
focusing on what it takes to win the hearts and minds of 3 design targets. If we canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 26 of 70appeal to these customers in the right ways, we will simultaneously pull in customers
from other groups too. For example, when we design a great experience for a time-
pressed mom who needs grocery pickup on the way home from school, that service
is just as valuable to a convenience-seeking baby boomer on the way home from the
golf course. Or when we design technology to speed transactions for unbanked core
customers, this technology allows us to reinvent the way customers interact with
services, with pharmacists and with our returns process. And as we designed voice
shopping technology for tech-savvy millennials, we're shaping the future of retail for
everyone.
By focusing our team and our assets on speciﬁc customer personas, we can achieve
something really special. So let's have a look at some of the customers we're
designing for. And why don't we let them tell you more about themselves and their
thoughts on Walmart.
First, let's meet Casey, our core customer. Casey is working hard to provide for her
family by working 3 jobs. She's a single mom of 2 kids and is juggling a busy
schedule, ﬁnances and everything that life is throwing her way. Let's meet Casey.
(presentation)
So Casey represents the largest segment for us, both in terms of population. But also
in terms of wallet share to Walmart. Many customers like Casey spend most of their
retail dollar with us. 76% of these customers want consistently low prices over the
best sales. Grocery makes up most of her retail spend, more than 60%. Casey needs
us and we will continue to work vigorously to protect and defend Casey.
Now let's take a look at Erica. We've got a lot of opportunity with her. Erica is all
about family. She's a busy mom of 4 who went back to school and started her own
counseling business. Let's hear from her.
(presentation)
So as you can tell, Erica is busy and she puts a premium on her time. She's seeking
the ultimate value equation, quality products at a low price in an eﬃcient way. You
heard her. She loves grocery pickup. Customers like Erica use grocery pickup 2.5x
more than other segments. But she still needs to keep her budget and nearly 70% of
customers like Erica set a ﬁrm budget before they set out on shopping occasions.
This is an important customer for us. As you've heard from us before, an omni-
channel customer spends more with us. In fact, about double what a store-only
customer spends. This is our sweet spot. Erica. And those like her, care more about
brands. They're twice as likely to buy the latest trend and 3 out of 5 are buying
organic. Today, Erica shops with us for some things but not everything. We're
changing that. We have a huge opportunity to continue to double down and win
with this customer.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 27 of 70Marc E. LoreFinally, let me introduce you to Mindy. She's our Jet customer. Mindy lives in
Brooklyn. She's just engaged. She's about to settle down and get married. She's
younger. She's more aﬄuent and she's managing the hustle and bustle of the city, a
job and trying to keep a social life. Here's Mindy.
(presentation)
So just like Casey throws apples into her shopping cart, Mindy tosses Apple AirPods
into her online basket. While Mindy represents a much smaller piece of the overall
pie, winning her over is important and doing it early even more so. We'll do that by
the newly acquired brands like Bonobos, ModCloth and ELOQUII. And diving into
things like conversational commerce that will thrill her. These are unique oﬀerings
that add diﬀerentiated value for our customers.
Let me be clear. Our primary focus is on Casey and Erica, our core customer and our
sweet spot. But we can't take our eyes oﬀ Mindy, who opens up entirely new avenues
for growth. By focusing on these 3 design targets, we'll deliver great experiences
that capture more share of their wallet and allow us to expand our customer set. And
as we get this right, we grow.
So let me leave you today with 3 takeaways. First, we're infusing customer centricity
into everything we do. We will show up when, how and where our customers want us
to. Secondly, we know our customers. Quite frankly, we've always known them and
we will always serve America. But in order to grow, we have to be strategic about
designing great experiences for our customers. And thirdly, our customer set is
widening. And as we build omni-channel convenience and add new brands and
services, we will continue to lean into that. It's still very early days for me and for this
role. But I'm really proud to stand here today and to start to share a clear vision for
our customer. I'm looking forward to continuing the dialogue and sharing more with
you over time. Thank you.

{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Good morning. Welcome. It's great to see so many familiar faces. I really enjoyed all
the great questions in the discussion last night. I really did. Hopefully, we'll have
some more discussions again today.
So last year, I shared our e-com strategy with you and since then, we've been making
really good progress. We're moving fast, we continue to add really strong talent and
we keep testing and learning. We still got a lot of work to do. But I feel really good
about where we are.
Brett talked about the ﬁnancials. Let me just tell you that last year, we told you we
expected to grow approximately 40%. And we're on track to do that. Then oﬀ a
much larger base, we expect to grow about 35% next year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 28 of 70So here's the strategy I shared with you last year. It hasn't changed. There's 3 parts.
First, we have to focus on the fundamentals. We have to get that right. But equally as
important, we have to leverage our unique assets and start to play oﬀense. And this
is an area that gets me really excited. When I think about playing oﬀense, I think
about how do we make sure Walmart.com is the primary destination when people
think about shopping for their online orders. Then while we're doing both those
things, we also need to be thinking about the future. How do we win the future of
retail? So let's spend the majority of the time here talking about the fundamentals
because that's where we're really focused.
Last year, I introduced this concept called the CVI, the customer value index. This is
an index we created to track our progress against the fundamentals. It's comprised
of 5 bellwether metrics: have it, ﬁnd it, display it, price it and deliver it. Do we have
the products people want? Can they ﬁnd them either via search or through
navigation easily? Are they displayed with all the content, pictures, descriptions,
reviews necessary to make a decision? Are they priced right? And are they delivered
fast and on time? And if we could do all 5 of those things really well, we believe that
the fundamentals will be in a really good place. So we set a pretty aggressive target,
as you can see there in the green line in terms of our plan to grow CVI over the year.
And we're running well ahead of that right now. So we're making really good
progress, primarily driven by have it and deliver it. Those are the 2 biggest areas of
opportunity and 2 of the biggest areas that we've seen the biggest improvement.
Now if you think about CVI, that's really about the inputs. Do we have the products?
Are they priced right? The Net Promoter Scores, the output, what are customers
saying? Are they willing to, now, refer the experience to a friend more so than they
were a year ago? And the answer is yes. If you look at the Net Promoter Score, it's
gone from 44 to 53 in one year, that's a 9-point increase. That's a big increase for
those of you that know NPS. So really happy that customers are telling us that they
are noticing a diﬀerence in the value proposition.
So I want to spend a little time on have it here. So when we think about have it, we
kind of think about it in 2 pieces. We think about sort of the top million SKUs, which
are largely driven in the experience driven by humans and then sort of the long tail,
which is really driven by technology. On the top million, I mentioned last year that
we're going and start hiring category specialists to really focus in on categories, to
make sure the experience is perfected. And I said we're going to add about 40 to 50
category specialists a month. We've been doing that steadily every month since last
year. So we've got a really nice size group of specialists and when they get trained
up, we see that they're making a big impact, not only on the customer experience
but also on contributed proﬁt. So revenue is growing, proﬁt's better. We just need
more category specialists focus on more categories. But feeling really good about
that.
We've also launched this next-generation dashboard we call FlightDeck, which is
really empowering customer -- sorry, empowering the category specialists to be able
to do a lot more faster. And as we invest more in that technology, we'll be able to get
even more leverage out of those.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 29 of 70The other big area of focus for the category specialists has been breaking brands.
We know how important it is to increase that have it score and have the brands that
customers want. And over the last 12 months, we've actually added over 2,000 new
brands. It takes time. And we're starting to see momentum. And I'm really happy with
the progress on that front.
Moving over to the long tail, let's just start with Marketplace. Marketplace, we were
adding SKUs really fast, if you remember, just got to like 70 million SKUs last year.
We're adding so fast that we hadn't really kept a very high bar in terms of the quality
of the SKUs and the quality of merchants on the site. So last year, we took a breather.
We added more than 20 million SKUs to Marketplace. But at the same time, we took
down about an equal amount. So the overall quantity didn't change but the quality
did. The quality's much better. And you can see that the Net Promoter Score went up
almost 20 points as a result. So I feel like we're in a really good spot. We've got a
really high bar for merchants and for SKU assortment. And we're ready to sort of kick
that into gear.
The other place that we're adding and investing in sort of that long tail marketplace
is to retail partnerships. And the ﬁrst party business long tail were really helping
accelerate that with specialty retailer acquisitions. It's really important that we get this
long tail growing and we add those brands and ﬁll in those missing gaps because
one of the biggest challenges we face is margin mix. We've got a really robust head
business and we do really well in the best-selling assortment, the assortment that
you would typically ﬁnd in the supercenter. But we have not made enough progress
in that long tail and the money is made in that long tail. That's why we're so focused
on really building out the tail in multiple diﬀerent ways.
The 2 big ways, I just said, the partnerships and specialty retailers, I think we made
really good progress in this last year. We did a partnership with Rakuten Kobo e-
books. We launched Lord & Taylor premium shop, which added about 150 premium
brands. We launched EV1 with Ellen DeGeneres. And that's doing really well. The
Love Denim Jacket actually sold out in 3 weeks. Things were selling really fast. We
think that's going to be a really good brand for us. Then just this morning, we
announced a deal with Advance Auto Parts to create a specialty automotive store on
Walmart.com.
So you're starting to see a little bit of a trend here with Lord & Taylor, Advance Auto
Parts. We think it's an opportunity to create lots of these types of partnerships. While
no one on its own is going to make a huge diﬀerence, when you start to add up and
string these together, it can and it will, not only for assortment but also for margin.
On the specialty retailers side, you know about Hayneedle shoes and Moosejaw. We
just recently also added Bare Necessities. Now, these specialty retailers are very
separate and distinct from the digitally native brands we're buying. These retailers
are really meant to help augment our ﬁrst-party long tail business. We're buying
experts -- merchandising expertise. We're getting product content. We're getting
vendor relationships. And we're improving our contributed proﬁt in these long tail
ﬁrst-party categories. So we're looking every day for special retailers in diﬀerentFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 30 of 70categories that could help accelerate our business and expect us to do more both
partnerships and retailers in the coming future.
On the deliberate side, we've also made really good progress. I talked about last
year the importance of inventory mirroring. We've been doing that pretty
aggressively and it's really helped with delivery speed. The number of orders that it
delivered in 2 calendar days has almost tripled. And the way we deﬁne 2 calendar
days is with a midnight cut-oﬀ. So if you order at 11:59 p.m. on Friday, it means it has
to arrive on Sunday to count. And we've almost tripled in the last year the number of
orders going out with that speed. And at the same time we're driving speed, we're
also driving down the cost of fulﬁlling an order. So the variable cost per unit has
gone down 10%. So we're doing both at the same time.
I'm also really happy about the team that we brought in. We brought in some really
amazing leaders across both replenishment, transportation and fulﬁllment itself. So I
feel like we've got the right team. We're in a really good place. I mentioned last year
that our network, the way our warehouses are positioned and where we've got
CapEx that we had the potential to deliver 87% of the country overnight via ground
and 99% in two days. And so as we start to mirror the inventory, we get closer and
closer to being able to deliver on that. So I think we're really well positioned to dial
up delivery speed next year and start pushing out more product overnight. And that
gets me really excited. I think that's a big opportunity, I'm feeling really good about
how we are positioned there.
In addition to the CVI and the 5 bellwether metrics, we've also focused on elevating
the experience and the look and feel of the Walmart.com site. This is, again, is as
much for the customers as it is for attracting brands. And again, there's lot of
premium brands that currently aren't on Walmart.com that we want to attract. And
this was a big lever that needed to be pulled and it's working. We're deﬁnitely
seeing more interest from the brands. So this was the homepage before and I'm sure
you've all seen this. But this is the homepage after, you can see it's much more
modern. It's more personalized. It's more localized. And in the bottom left there, we
really make pickup and same-day delivery a much bigger focus. And we're deﬁnitely
seeing traﬃc -- a lot more traﬃc come in through in that regard. So a couple of other
things I'll show you, this was Shop by Room before. I think Doug mentioned this. And
this is Shop by Room after. Notice the rich imagery here is a theme that you'll see
throughout the entire site. Also, all those products in that image can be bought on
Walmart.com. This was the nursery before. And the nursery after. Again, look at the
imagery. Baby is a really big focus for us given our focus on busy families.
Then, we also, at the same time, just recently launched a new Jet.com website. And
we really wanted to position Jet.com and push it more upmarket and really focus on
the higher income, urban millennials. It's much more curated. It's got that sort of
themed homepage, it says NYC there. We're going to be rolling up themed
homepages for each of the major cities. We're deﬁnitely attracting much more
premium brands on this site. We've got Nike. We've got an Apple Mac store.
Bonobos is coming onto the site in another week. So we're deﬁnitely targeting a very
diﬀerent customer with Jet than we are with Walmart.com. And I think both brandsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 31 of 70are very complementary. They're both leveraging the same back end infrastructure
and logistics. So we're getting a lot of synergies there. But on the front end, they are
targeting very diﬀerent customers. The Jet.com relationships we're building with
brands, we believe, will be beneﬁcial in helping to bring those brands onto
Walmart.com in the future.
So that was the fundamentals but the fundamentals we know aren't enough. It's
really important that we start playing oﬀense and really leveraging our unique assets
to do things that only Walmart can do. And so I want to talk about a couple of areas
that we're playing oﬀense. One is sort of intermediate and one a little bit more
longer term. The biggest area that we're playing oﬀense right now is with our stores.
We've got, as Doug mentioned, 4,700 stores within 10 miles of 90% of the
population. And we know where the puck's moving. If you look at delivery speed, it's
moving towards same day. Customers want products faster than ever before. And
nobody is better suited, better situated to deliver same day. We can deliver same
day the entire supercenter fresh, frozen and everything else at a lower cost to serve
than anyone else because of a few things. One, we're moving product in full
truckloads. From the RDCs to 4,700 stores, that's something that the stores have
really mastered. So that's number one.
Number two, these stores, they're already proﬁtable. So if you think about them
doubling as a warehouse, when you think about that marginal cost to pick that item
out of there, all the ﬁxed costs are covered. If you would open up a dark store
warehouse, you got to cover your ﬁxed. And you need to do a certain amount of
volume. So you have this incredible volume. You have lower throughs on fresh food
because you've got, in some cases, more than $100 million of sales coming out of
one location. Then we've got picking capability now in over 2,000 stores going to
3,000 next year. And so we've done really the hard part. And it's just about same-day
delivery using third-party crowd-sourced vendors and doing it ourselves. So I think
we're in a really, really good place to start playing oﬀense with same-day delivery.
But we've actually started to play. The beginning of the year, we started to roll out
same-day delivery and the store's team has done an amazing job of rolling this out
with speed. So by the end of this year, 40% of the U.S. will have access to same-day
delivery, that's in over 100 markets. And by the end of next year, over 60% of the
population, that's about 200 markets.
So you can see that we've actually started to make things happen. This is something
that we haven't really, in essence, we really haven't levered up until the beginning of
this year. So I expect this to be a great way to sort of build that sort of primary
destination back with consumers on .com. Then as we bring together that same-day
delivery, grocery, combine it with the Walmart.com site in the future, hopefully, we
would have monetized those relationships of people coming back every week to sell
into that long tail that we're so focused on building.
The other area that we're playing oﬀense. And this is a little bit more longer term, I'd
say, is with digitally native vertical brands. So we bought ModCloth last year, we
bought Bonobos. This year, we launched our own incubated -- our own mattress
company called Allswell, which is doing really well. We proved that we can actuallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 32 of 70incubate these brands and then we recently bought ELOQUII. And I think it's really
important to just stress the diﬀerence between these digitally native vertical brands
and the specialty retailers. I think a lot of times, people want to just come by and say,
"Walmart's making these acquisitions." Then they'll throw ELOQUII and Bare
Necessities together because they're both in apparel. But they couldn't be more
diﬀerent. Again, the specialty retailers are really about helping to sort of grow our
ﬁrst-party business and accelerate and they're selling third-party goods. So they're
getting us access to a lot of brands. This is much more oﬀensive. This is thinking
about a future world in which there's SKU parity.
We pretty much get parity on pricing now online with everybody matching. There
will be a point in time where everybody sells everything that everyone else sells. And
so how do you diﬀerentiate? How do you actually create a reason for customers to
shop on your website versus your competition? And I think this is one way. This is
one big way. Having proprietary content. It's not going to be just 4 brands aren't
going to do it. But imagine 40. So the idea is over a long period of time, they
continue to incubate and buy and build so we have a portfolio of brands and unique
content. And the other great thing, the margins are incredible. The margins run
about 40% in terms of contributive proﬁt; that's after all variable expenses. That's not
gross, that's sort of after all your variable expense of 40%. So imagine 5% of sales at
40% CP, you're adding almost 200 basis points to the entire business. So before
when we talked about the importance of needing to sort of mix out margin and push
into more premium, higher margin goods, this is a big critical part of the strategy.
The third part of this strategy is really about innovating for the future. We need to
prepare to win what future game looks like 10 and 20 years into the future. And that's
where Store 8 comes in. So last year, we told you that we formed this umbrella called
Store 8. Well we've been really busy in the last year. And we've actually incubated 5
companies inside there. These are companies that have the potential to shape the
future of retail. Ring fenced from the rest of the organization, they're able to move
with speed. We hire a CEO, we give them capital and they run. This is not a sandbox
or an R&D sandbox. Each startup has a vision for how and what it wants to be and
how it's going to change the future of the company. And again, we're thinking more
like 10 years out. So we have talked publicly about 2 of these. Jetblack and
Spatialand, the other 3 you'll hear about this year. With respect to Jetblack, I couldn't
be more excited about this one. This is conversational commerce. This is about using
text and voice to buy absolutely anything you might want. So you can just text
Jetblack and say water, iced tea, Cheerios. Because you would've gone through an
extensive onboarding, it knows what brands, it knows what sizes and all you have to
do is text those things and you get a text back that says here's the prices coming
today. So you can also say, need a gift for 15-year-old girl, $200 and it'll come back
with 3 amazing recommendations. The recommendations are so good because of
the onboarding and the personalized approach that 79% of the time, people are
actually taking the recommendation that we make.
So I think this really plays to Walmart's unique strengths around product and
merchandising. So we're investing a lot in sort of the recommendation engine. We're
investing a lot in the decision trees. And we're seeing lots of conversations. And
because these conversations are, sort of, today, largely human-powered, we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 33 of 70Gregory S. Foranseeing exactly how people would ideally want to converse. We need those
conversations because the more conversations we have, the closer we are to be able
to use machine learning to automate it. So that's the long-term goal. 10 years from
now, we're not going to be humans. We're going to have seen enough
conversations that this will be automated. So super exciting. Customers love it. As
Doug said, we've got a waitlist. The NPS score is over 90 and I do think that this is
the future in the way people are going to shop. People are not going to, 10, 20 years
from now, be using search the way they do today. It will simply be a voice or text
communication.
The other story company that we mentioned, we went out and acquired Spatialand,
which is a virtual reality company. This is deﬁnitely a lot further out. But you can think
about this as the natural extension of conversational commerce. Once you get to a
point where people are just conversing via voice and buying stuﬀ, the next thing is
immerse me, show me, let me experience these products in a way that's not possible
through a 2D-type world. So really excited about that. But that's deﬁnitely much
longer term. Before I leave Store 8 here, I just want to leave you with a little taste for
where the future of retail is heading.
(presentation)
Well isn't it exciting to think about where the future of retail is heading? Imagine just
coming home from work, opening the fridge and there are the groceries. We
deﬁnitely think that this future is a possibility and what's even more exciting is
nobody's better positioned than Walmart to be able to deliver this. Having fresh and
frozen food within 10 miles 90% of the population is a must to pull this oﬀ, having
picking capability in the store and having the ability to deliver it. So we've got the
capabilities to deliver on this and so it's really exciting to think about what's possible.
So that's the strategy. We're doing all 3 things at once. I can't tell you how excited I
am about next year and I can't wait for you to see what we have in store. I just want
to leave you with a few key takeaways. We're getting traction on the fundamentals.
You can see it. It's evidenced by the CVI score moving up so aggressively. At the
same time, we're playing oﬀense, especially with same-day delivery. And at the same
time, we're building companies to shape the future of retail. We haven't lost sight on
what it's going to take to win 10 years out. Thank you.

{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Good morning. And thank you. Thanks for making the trip to be involved and
spending some time and learning more about our business and getting out to 5260
yesterday and seeing some of the innovation.
Let me begin by giving credit where credit is due. And that's to our associates.
You're going to hear us talk a lot about leveraging our physical assets. But those
physical assets don't amount to much without the human capacity to power them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 34 of 70And frankly, it's our people that do that. More than that, however, our people can
create a personal relationship with customers. And that's something that we believe
that Walmart is uniquely positioned to do. When all is said and done, it's probably
personal relationships that are likely to be our biggest competitive advantage. When
we met last year, I talked about the challenges in our U.S. stores business of moving
from ﬁxing to leading. And we put a plan in place to take us in that direction. And as I
stand here today with you, I can say that we did what we said we would do.
The productivity loop is turning. We're buying for less. We're selling for less. We're
growing sales. And we're operating for less. And I think our results proved that we
implemented the right strategy four years ago. We invested in our associates,
notably compensation and training. We've reduced inventory throughout the supply
chain. We lowered prices. We've steadily improved the customer experience. We're
adding services, including new and enhanced apps for our customers and
associates. Our comp store sales have increased. And we've been able to leverage
expenses in stores. So we're pleased with these achievements. But at the same time,
we know that we have a lot more to do. And in this competitive environment, not
only we -- must we clear the bar. But we must continually set it higher. And here's
what I mean.
I'm out in stores constantly. And the other week, Doug and I happened to be in
Alabama at the same time. So we shut out early to go and do some store visits.
Frankly, the ﬁrst store that we went to was not all that good. We were oﬀ process.
Store's a bit dirty. And it certainly wasn't equipped for the day's trade. So we got into
the second store. And actually, that is what we would call an average store. We were
on process. It was certainly a lot cleaner and we were ready for business. The third
store that I got into, arguably, our toughest one in the market to run, was actually in
great shape. That's what I expect when you've got a terriﬁc team of associates
supported by a fantastic and impressive store manager. Everything was on process.
We were spick-and-span. We were wonderfully reﬂective of the neighborhood that
we were operating in. So again, I think we have made a ton of progress. But as I saw
with the ﬁrst store that I was in a week or so ago, we still got our share of outliers,
which is why we continue to pursue the fundamentals of the strategy that we set out
last year, strengthening those 4 key pillars: one, running great stores; two, delivering
value; three, being great merchants; and four, providing convenience. And as we
progress from ﬁxing to leading, we'll reﬁne how we'll execute.
Now we've got 3 areas of focus. We'll continually improve the retail fundamentals.
We won't ever let up on that. Two, we'll build the tech-empowered store. And three,
we'll extend our omni-channel capabilities. So back to the retail fundamentals. We
began this journey four years ago and I can tell you that our passion for it has not
lessened, not even for a minute. We ask a lot from our associates and we hold
ourselves to account for everything from the cleanliness of the parking lot to the
quality of the asparagus, from the in-stock of herbs and spices to clean and empty
back rooms. From fast and eﬃcient service at the front end to a personal touch as we
load the groceries that you ordered online into the trunk of your car. And regardless
of how well we're performing in any one aspect of our business, we mandate
improvements and we force innovation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 35 of 70Steve BratspiesAnd this requires several things. Perhaps above all, truly engaging with our
associates, training them and equipping them with the latest tools to do their jobs as
eﬃciently and as eﬀectively as possible and creating learning experiences through
academies and promotions, university institutions. And when we do these things, we
hold ﬁrm to one of this company's founding principles, a principle that has made
Walmart great. Our people make the diﬀerence. Not just a diﬀerence, the diﬀerence.
But we have more to do. And when it comes to retail fundamentals, we know that the
standards are never met. They just keep getting higher. Now, one of the ways we'll
raise the standards is by creating a tech-empowered store, a place where the
customer and associate-facing technologies are seamlessly integrated. And you're
going to hear Steve and Marc talk about this idea in some more detail. But the core
message is simple. And it's this: remove friction from the way that associates and
customers interact with a physical store. Create eﬃciencies, help people save time
and money and, ultimately, grow the sales. Two quick examples, one from grocery
pickup and delivery. When customers use a check-in app, we're able to get their
order pre-staged. We get an alert telling us that they're about to drive up to our
store. So that when you arrive, we're ready and what that results in is really fast,
friendly service.
Well one that, I think, is going to be a big hit with our customers that Janey spoke
about, Item Finder (sic) (Store Maps). Thanks to the blend of digital and physical, you
can now basically Google Map your way to each and every item in a store. Those are
just some of the elements that make up the tech-empowered store. Now ﬁnally,
we're going to bring the foundation of our retail fundamentals together with the
tech-empowered store and the result is going to be powerful omni-channel
capabilities, which provide convenience and value. One of the central features of this
combination is a store as a fulﬁllment center for both online and oﬄine shopping.
This model has game-changing potential. But make no mistake, it's going to be hard.
It's going to require the combination of retail expertise with supply chain expertise,
associates who will need to be highly ambidextrous. But I'm conﬁdent that we can
do this. We've already proved we can do many things others thought were not
possible. To sum it up, the plan we have put in place four years ago is working.
We've made meaningful progress to run great stores, deliver value, be better
merchants and provide convenience. We're doing well. But we can and must do
more. And to that end, we've put a plan in place that will focus our eﬀorts to execute
against our goals. We will continue to improve our retail fundamentals. We will go
deeper on building the tech-empowered store. And we'll create omni-channel
capabilities.
Now I'm going to hand it over to 2 of our great colleagues that I have the privilege of
working with: Steve Bratspies, our Chief Merchandising Oﬃcer; and Mark Ibbotson,
who looks after our Realty and Central operations. Steve, over to you.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. At Walmart, we oﬀer customers great
items at everyday low prices. It's a key part of the productivity loop of selling for less.
It's a bedrock principle for the day our company was founded. So today, I'm going toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 36 of 70talk about 2 important elements of that, growing sales and reducing costs. So let me
begin with growing sales.
There are 3 core components that we talk about for growing sales: price leadership,
great assortment and customer experience. So let me start with price leadership.
Now our position on price is clear. We will maintain price leadership, full stop. We
believe, more than ever, in the power of the EDLP model. So you're going to see us
remain committed to the price investments that we laid out three years ago. The
momentum and the comp sales performance that Greg referred to prove that our
pricing strategy is working. We see it in traﬃc. We see it in basket metrics. And we
see it in our expanding price gap with competitors. And we're going to continue to
make thoughtful investments. But we're not going to win the price battle on
investments alone. So we're using advanced analytics. And by doing so, we're able
to identify categories where increased price gaps drive overall box market share.
And we're going to continue to learn and reﬁne our models. And as we do, we'll
adapt to shifting market dynamics and various competitive situations. All of this is
going to drive more sales.
Now the next piece of the equation is assortment. And at Walmart, we're item
merchants. We'll never lose that focus and the importance of delivering great
products to our customers. We think about assortment in a couple of diﬀerent ways.
We think about simplicity. We think about quality. And ﬁnally, innovation. So let me
talk to you a little bit about simplicity. Now the guiding principle here is to have the
best, roughly, 100,000 items that our customers need and want. This is what we refer
to as the head of the assortment. And we're going to continue to improve upon it.
We're using new data sets and advanced analytics. We're able to reﬁne our oﬀerings
store by store. And we've gained a deeper understanding of our customer, about
customer loyalty, about item substitutability. And about incrementality. And this
understanding helps us to drive more sales through assortment.
On quality, we're going to maintain a relentless focus on quality. Now, there are a lot
of great stories I can share here. But I want to just take a minute and talk about fresh.
We're spending a lot of time through sourcing, buying, supply chain. We've elevated
the quality of our fresh produce and our meat and bakery in our stores. And
strawberries are a great example. There's almost no product that does a better job of
communicating fresh to our customers. And with our new fresh speed network,
we've removed steps in our supply chain to give our customers an additional four
days of freshness, that's basically doubling the freshness that a customer gets on that
product.
We also recently announced the use of blockchain. Doug referred to this earlier. It's
establishing an unprecedented level of quality control and visibility throughout the
produce supply chain. And we're also collaborating with agriculture entrepreneurs
to test models for vertical indoor farming. Our work is paying oﬀ. In Q2, fresh food
sales were strong and led to the best grocery comps we've had in nine years. Our
commitment to quality isn't just limited to fresh, though. We extend it to all of our
private brands. So whether we're talking about great value, equate, market-side,
mainstays or our new apparel brands, we're going to continue to innovate and investFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 37 of 70to ensure that every product at Walmart delivers great quality. So for example, in our
GM business, we're now using data for return rates and customer reviews to get
closer to our customers and improve on the product development process. We've
leveraged this in development and launch of our 3 new apparel brands. You can see
them over to my right and sales are accelerating. Customer feedback has been
great. We're really excited about this and I'd encourage you at a break to go over
there and touch, feel the product. I think you'll be really impressed with the quality.
The attention to design is something we're really excited about.
Now, another terriﬁc quality of play is over here, which is our winemaker selection.
Now, this is a premium private brand wine and our goal is to increase our quality
perception and build customer loyalty. It is selling great. We've launched the ﬁrst 10
varietals in May and they added nearly 100 basis points to our overall wine business.
So we're going to add another 11 SKUs next spring. It's been a real winner for us so
far. Now hand-in-hand with innovation -- with quality is innovation and we've got a
lot of product innovation at Walmart. And we're going to continue to add new items
and capture the innovation that's in the market. We do it with our private brands and
the addition of new national brands like Nix, Yankee Candle, Cuisinart and Bose.
We're also really proud of our ability to bring our customers exclusives that no other
retailer can. So this holiday, in toys alone, our customers will be able to get more
than 1,000 items that they can't ﬁnd anywhere else. Now one standout item is this
one right over here that's sitting up front. This is our Barbie Dream Camper by Power
Wheels. This toy is half traditional ride-on and if you come around to the back, it is a
full-play kitchen for our customers. This is exclusive to Walmart. And the ﬁrst 5 to 6
weeks, we're selling about 6,000 of them so it's really, really accelerating. And we
think this will be the #1 ride-on item this season.
One more I want to share with you. Are there any Galaga and Pac-Man fans out
there? Doug, I hear you're pretty good at Galaga, yes, your favorite. Well this item
right here is capturing the trend of retro games. It's been a huge trend in the past
two years. Pac-Man and Galaga are the #1 and #2 arcade games of all time and we
have both of them exclusive at Walmart this year. $299, I really think it's going to be a
huge winner for us this holiday season.
We're also innovating as we build upon our historically strong physical media
business, right? Walmart has dominated that business for a long time. But it's
changing. So we're innovating with VUDU, with e-books, with shoppable ad
capabilities, plus joint ventures with Echo and MGM for original content. We're
innovating to deepen our engagement with customers and their daily digital habits.
Finally, the third component of our strategy to drive sales is a great customer
experience. Now there's a whole lot that contributes to a great shopping experience.
So today, I'm just going to touch on 2 of them. Store space and customer apps. So
reimagining store space is key for us to take full advantage of our physical footprint.
So a few things we're doing. You're going to see an updated entertainment set, a
new apparel pad and a hardware destination that we call Tomball. We're also testingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 38 of 70next-generation space, expanded seasonal pads and service counter consolidations
amongst sporting goods, paint and auto centers.
Finally, we're being opportunistic with space. There's a lot of toy volume up for grabs
this year so we've bought broader and deeper in this category. But more importantly
than that, we've expanded permanent toy space in over 235 stores to winning toys
today and tomorrow. So the takeaway on store space is that we're moving with
speed and purpose to leverage space as a unique advantage for Walmart.
Now, of course, the customer experience isn't just deﬁned to the physical space. But
the digital space as well. So we're reimagining the customer experience with a
robust set of Walmart apps. Apps are designed for the customer ﬁrst. The goal: low
friction and high-speed. We've got Mobile Express Returns, pharmacy and money
services. And our Mobile Express services lets you complete much of the transaction
before you even get to the store. Once you get there, you can skip the line, ﬁnish the
transaction. And bang, you're done. It's that simple.
So there's a lot there under growing sales. And we plan to keep up that momentum.
Now the other part of the equation for generating growth is to lower our costs,
leveraging our assets to drive greater eﬃciency. And again, there are 3 things I want
to talk about: how we buy it, how we ship it and how we sell it. Now, a big part of
buying boils down to relationships with our suppliers. As with everything we do at
Walmart, we buy with the customer in mind. We approach negotiations from the
standpoint of being advocates for the customer. And as I think most of our suppliers
would tell you is that we're pretty tough. But I think they'd also tell you that we're fair
and that all sides realize the beneﬁts from the growth that we're driving.
Now I know many of you probably also have tariﬀs on your mind and you heard Brett
talk about them earlier and I had the opportunity to chat with a lot of you yesterday
about tariﬀs. My point to you is no, that we are actively working to minimize any
impact on our customers and our shareholders.
Next, ship it. Under leadership of Greg Smith, our Executive Vice President for
Supply Chain, incredible work has been done over the past 1.5 years. We are
strengthening our supply chain today and at the same time, innovating for tomorrow.
And we'll share a lot more of that with you in the future.
Finally, there's selling costs. Now earlier, I talked about simplifying the assortment.
But we're also implementing cost-cutting measures, things like inventory reduction, a
more precise feature-planning process, leveraging AI tools for smart forecasting and
the use of packaging for truck-to-shelf precision.
So those are just some of our initiatives that focus on both growing sales and
reducing costs. The customer is responding. We're proud of the progress and we
know we can and we will do even more.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

Page 39 of 70Mark IbbotsonSo now it's my pleasure to introduce Mark Ibbotson to share a little bit more about
how innovation is going to drive both sales and lower costs. Thank you very much.
{BIO 17944301 <GO>}
Well. Good morning. It is such an exciting time to be at Walmart. You've heard us all
talk about the omnichannel retail platform. We talk about operations inside of the
store. We're really thinking about the heart of the omnichannel experience. It's an
end-to-end process powered by people and enabled by innovation. The result, it's
an unparalleled retail experience for our customers. At the heart of it, we have an
empowered associate who have the tools to own their work and more customers
that walk away satisﬁed.
First oﬀ, empowering associates. With our store-based apps and training technology,
we're enhancing how our associates work and how we help them drive eﬃciency
and increase sales. Three solid pillars: ﬁrst, training; secondly, managing inventory;
and lastly and most importantly probably, growing sales.
So training. That's where it all starts. Associates can't help customers if they don't
have the right training. Our academies have made a real diﬀerence in the skill level
many of our associates have. But academies focus mainly on store managers and
department managers. What we've now done is deploy virtual reality, VR technology
in all our stores in the U.S. It brings the same level of training to more than 1 million
Walmart associates across the entire U.S. Currently, our VR training is being used to
help associates learn how to operate our pickup towers right in their store. It even
allows associates to be trained before the towers are actually installed. So VR is
being used to train associates on many things, including Check Out With Me, which
is a brand-new program. And I'll talk about that in a moment. The training only takes
a few minutes. And because associates can do it when they want to, we can pick and
target slower times of the day.
Finally, we've actually gamiﬁed a good deal of our training. And we just introduced
an app called Spark City. It's a sim-type game that lets associates learn store process
and customer service in an interesting and engaging way. Because it's right on their
phones, the associate can play anytime. And here's something else: anybody,
anybody in the world can download this app. If you go on the app store now, put in
Spark City, download the app. I encourage you to give it a try. And if it's not too
much trouble, if you could rate it as 5 stars. That's my appraisal in about two months
and it'd go a long way.
So app technology is ushering a new and an exciting sea change into inventory
management. The Availability app is a great example. Gives associates insight into
how their store is performing over time. It automates information about products
that are out of stock and shows associates speciﬁcally what time that out of stock
occurred.
When taken together, our entire productivity suite of apps, these tools eliminate the
amount of time spent on the mundane. Instead, associates are on the shop ﬂoorFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 40 of 70helping customers ﬁnd what they need.
What about sales? Let's start with volume-producing items, VPIs. VPI was a concept
introduced by Sam Walton. He wanted to instill the thrill of merchandising in all our
associates. His goal, to help underperforming items become great selling
merchandise. With the VPI app, we've actually digitized this program, making it far
easier for everybody to participate. We now have more associates participate with
the VPI competition in one month than we previously had in an entire year.
Another way we're helping associates drive sales is the Check Out With Me program.
Sales associates can use a handheld cellular device with a Bluetooth printer to check
out customers and provide an electronic paper receipt on the spot. The program will
be rolled out chain-wide by Black Friday. The technology adds yet another great
customer convenience for the busy holiday season.
The initiatives I've described to this point empower associates through better
process and digitization. Behind these is a set of automation and robotic
technologies that liberate our associates from the burden of predictable, repeatable
and manual tasks. Not only does automation drive eﬃciency in the store, it frees up
associates to engage in the aspects of their job that they ﬁnd more interesting, more
exciting and ultimately, fulﬁlling. Those of you that were in the store yesterday may
have seen a couple of these.
I'll start oﬀ with the FAST unload. Until now, product was unloaded as it arrived at the
store through a complex, highly manual process that's seen little innovation in the
last 20 years. The FAST unload automatically scans and sorts the items based on the
department. Takes about 1/3 of the time out of the truck unload. Most importantly, it
prioritizes out-of-stocks. Bottom line, we're seeing signiﬁcant improvement in the
eﬃciency of unloading a truck. But just as important, we're seeing corresponding
increase in sales at the same time we're seeing a reduction in turnover in an area of
the store where associate attrition tends to be unusually high due to the onerous
nature of that work.
We have a shelf-scanning robot, provides real-time view on on-shelf merchandise
availability. It improves the process of restocking by identifying where the in-stock
levels are, where they're low, where they're out of stock, where prices are wrong or
where labels are missing. The information then directs the associate to the area of
the store that needs the most attention. We're currently testing this tool in 50 stores.
So far, we've logged 7,000 miles, 12,000 hours over about an 18-month period,
during which time we captured over 1 billion images of our shelves.
We have a fully autonomous ﬂoor scrubber. It relieves associates of a job that, quite
frankly, is unpopular. It's being used in 85 stores throughout the country. We plan to
roll this technology into about 360 by the end of this ﬁscal year.
These technologies all communicate. Out-of-stocks are captured by one, sorted by
another or reducing the friction for associates and increasing the sales. We'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 41 of 70Gregory S. Foranbuilding a connected network in our store. Technology in this network brings
together several signals which we can quickly read and then direct an intervention.
The sum of the parts is far greater than the individual element.
We're innovating today with tomorrow in mind. We're currently piloting a robot pick
technology in Salem, New Hampshire. It automates the process of picking items for
grocery pickup. It uses robots to gather items from a high density storage system
located in the back of the store. The current test will pick 20,000 SKUs at a rate that's
about 10x of what we see in our stores.
Next is an innovation that we're piloting in Sherman, Texas that automatically
dispenses grocery pickup orders. It's like an ATM, as it were, for fresh, frozen and
ambient food. And as some of you saw yesterday in 5260, we're automating the
storage, allowing us to double the capacity a store is able to fulﬁll for grocery pickup.
We've got electronic shelf-edge labels or ESLs. On average, there's about 600,000
price changes per year per store. Our associates have to print, apply each one to
every shelf in the backroom and on the sales ﬂoor. ESLs will revolutionize this
process by automatically updating pricing and the tag content. It will improve
accuracy, ensure compliance and crucially, remove a generally cumbersome process.
Because the ESL will communicate with some of the autonomous scanning I
described earlier, we'll be able to communicate ESLs in the backroom, alerting
associates when to ﬁll an item, adding another element to the network.
Over the past few minutes, you've heard me talk about associate apps, technology
and automation. Now not only are we transforming our stores, they're playing a big,
big part in our grocery pickup and delivery. We're becoming more robust and more
integrated. We believe they form the basis of a vision of the store as a fulﬁllment
center, part of an end-to-end supply chain from DC to doorstep, serving customers
where and how they want. We see the store as a fulﬁllment center is a signiﬁcant
advantage as we continue to expand our omnichannel capabilities and build a
dynamic retail platform.
I'll now turn to Greg who will wrap up. Thank you.

Thank you, Mark. And thank you, Steve. That was terriﬁc. That's a lot, I know it. And at
the risk of sounding like Yogi Berra, it's a lot because it's a lot. But everything you
saw yesterday and everything that we've just talked through today is geared to
improving productivity and increasing sales in order to drive better SG&A. And when
those things are happening, we can lower prices. And that helps our customers save
money and time. And we can help their families live better.
So as I said at the top, our plan is working and customers are responding. But trust
me, we will not rest easy. And we will continue to challenge ourselves to be better.
And we're going to maintain a laser focus on our goals: grow the top line and the
bottom line, win in fresh, accelerate our omnichannel capabilities, create a seamlessFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Good morning. Well look, I know we've talked about a lot this morning because
there is a lot to cover. But I plan on leaving you with some optimism about what
we've got going on at Sam's Club.
So when I talked to you, many of you, here last year, we spoke about the need we
had in the business to improve our position and accelerate growth and accelerate
our comp growth in a meaningful way. So I talked about a plan that had 3 parts. One
was respecting the past. And that means executing to the business model we have.
The second was managing the present. So we needed to focus on delivering great
results and raising the expectations. And third, we have to innovate for the future.
And so what I want to do today is talk about the plan, where we are. And I want to
start by explaining how we've become more focused.
One way that we got really focused is by concentrating on our target consumer. And
our target consumer, just to remind you, is a family that earns somewhere between
$75,000 and $125,000 a year. They've got 2 to 3 kids at home. And they've usually
got 1 or 2 jobs and some own a small business. And the best way that we can serve
our core member is to focus on our core capabilities which are our people, our
product and our digital capabilities.
And so under people, we've been investing in some really key diﬀerences that are
making a diﬀerence. And those include our merchants, our fresh associates in the
club and then ﬁnally, our technologists.
So for merchants, we decided to make the merchandising job at Sam's Club a
destination job. And I've spent most of my life in diﬀerent jobs around the company
in diﬀerent countries and I can tell you, it's hard to ﬁnd too many positions that can
make more of a diﬀerence than a Sam's Club merchant. And we've got less than 100
senior merchants in the business. And in that environment, with limited SKUs and the
need to focus, we need each and every merchant to be an expert in the category. So
we raised our pay, we raised our expectations. And we've seen our tenure and jobFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 43 of 70double in just the last three years. And the reason that's important, I just want to
show you an item that some of you have seen before. And this is the cotton candy
grape. Now this is an item that -- it's named the cotton candy grape because it
actually tastes like cotton candy and then has to do with how sweet it is. But this is
one took ﬁve years to develop. So Russ Mounce and his team worked on this ﬁve
years from the time they had the idea until launch. And they're now working on how
they can get more acres grown. And this product goes from the vineyard, where it's
harvested for about 4 to 6 weeks each year, straight to the clubs. So the tenure is
really important to bring products like that from the idea all the way to life.
Now second on people, we invested in additional manager in our fresh department
in the clubs. We also put a new incentive structure out that gives the managers
incentive to drive sales in fresh. Then we launched a new training program for fresh
associates in the club. And associates who become certiﬁed over the program, which
takes anywhere from 1 to two years, can receive up to a 40% to 60% increase in their
salary, which would result in an annual earning position of over $50,000 a year. So
big progress in fresh in the club.
Then the third is, we invested in a robust technology team. So we built a team of
technologists who are allowing the business to move with speed and innovation.
And some of the team work here in Bentonville, some are in Dallas, others are in
India and China and then several are in the SamsClub.com building out in the Silicon
Valley. And we've also really improved our position with a really strong product
management team led by Eddie Garcia. And that team has been able to build us a
long list of commercial-grade tools. And those are for both associates and for
members. And a lot of the tools they're building, some of the apps they're building,
they can get launched in just a matter of weeks from the idea to test. And it's been
really impressive to see how fast they're moving.
Then as I mentioned before, we talked about the grape already. But the whole point
to a wholesale club is great product. You can't have a great wholesale club without a
great product because people pay us a membership fee so that they can get access
to something they love, that they can buy at Sam's Club or something they just can't
get anywhere else. Items like the grapes and the fresh food, those help us drive
traﬃc. And we've seen our fresh traﬃc grow about 5% this year.
And we've really dialed up our focus on the Member's Mark brand. Now about three
years ago, we got all the brands narrowed down and we got to just one brand. And
the power of having one branding has been really strong and then we hold
ourselves to a really high quality expectation. So the other item that's here, this is the
Member's Mark Donut Shop Coﬀee. And this item came about from about one year
of work. The team had to go around the world. And they tested over 100 coﬀees.
They went through a number of diﬀerent roasting facilities. And it took a year of work
to get to the coﬀee that we landed in the club. And we think it's just great quality and
the ﬂavor is outstanding. So again, focusing on one brand has helped us grow
penetration pretty signiﬁcantly over the last few years and it's really working.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 44 of 70Then additionally, you can't talk about membership value without talking about
price. We made a number of strategic investments in price around the club. And it's
important because warehouse clubs, Sam's Club has to have disruptive retail prices.
And we have to do it in a way that doesn't compromise product quality just like
we've talked about. So in the clubs where we've made these targeted investments,
we've seen sales grow, we've seen units grow, we've seen more sign-ups. And we
are seeing higher retention rates, which is really important.
Now something else we've talked about and you heard already from Brett this
morning is the movement that we have in our tobacco business. So we've removed
tobacco from a number of clubs already. And it is a category that it ends up being
sold to a ﬁnal consumer that's quite diﬀerent than our target consumer. And so by
removing it from certain clubs, it's helped us focus the business back onto the things
that make us serve our target member much more eﬀectively. So by the end of the
year, we'll have tobacco out of about 150 clubs. But we'll keep reporting our comp
sales with tobacco. So I'd encourage you, when we release our numbers, to look at
our impact or look at the impact tobacco is having on the business to understand a
better picture of how we're managing the core of the business.
Now the third area of focus I talked about earlier is digital. And look, it's been a lot of
fun seeing how a legacy brand can change when introducing new types of
technology in the business. And we see the same sweet spot that Greg talked about
and Janey talked about when someone downloads the app or they shop at
SamsClub.com or they use Scan & Go, their overall spend goes up. But also their
overall likelihood to renew also goes up. And you saw in the opening video, we
simpliﬁed our membership tiers into just 2 tiers. There's a club membership and
there's a Plus membership. Then following that announcement, we announced that
for the Plus membership, you can get free shipping on SamsClub.com on about 95%
of the assortment. And so far, the response has been a lot better than we expected.
Since launch, we've had over 1 million members upgrade to Plus, which is a great
number. And we've seen 28% growth in the ﬁrst half of the year just in e-commerce
sales. Then we started partnering with Instacart for same-day delivery for members.
So a number of things on the digital front have really helped. One of which we had
talked about before is Scan & Go. And Scan & Go allows you to shop with your
phone and then skip the checkout line altogether. And we're the only warehouse
club to date that oﬀers that service. And we've seen penetration grow another 180
basis points this year. And we're about to add adult beverages to the Scan & Go
category, which will pretty much make Scan & Go a tool that you can use then across
the entire box.
And I also need to talk about tools that we built for our associates. So we've
launched a number of new tools that help them all over the business. They've saved
hundreds of pages of paperwork per person in some cases. And that's a signiﬁcant
amount of time that they're now able to spend out on the ﬂoor and get out of
backrooms.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 45 of 70Then the ﬁnal thing I want to talk about on digital is Workplace. We launched
Workplace about a year ago. And this has just been a fantastic tool for the teams to
rally around ideas. And so what happens, we can put direction out and then you'll
see clubs immediately posting what they've done. And the clubs are competitive. So
they'll look at other clubs' posts and then it's a race to get things done. So this is one
of the things we did earlier this year. It's #uncomfortablyfull. And when we asked the
clubs to try to focus on getting everything they could out of the steel and onto the
ﬂoor for sale, it was just a matter of hours until the posts were up and running and
then we're oﬀ to the races.
Now an important part of the plan is to realize we looked at all parts of the business
as it aligned to the new focus. And I talked about that a bit last year. Under the lens
of focus, we looked at all of our programs. We looked at our membership oﬀering.
We looked at our merchandise categories. We looked at our locations. And after
doing that, we've become a healthier business. And so as I stand here today, we
have 2 tiers of membership. We have 597 operating clubs. And we converted several
of our older clubs to fulﬁllment centers. And we're focused, at this point, on
absolutely the right categories to serve the target member, particularly in fresh food.
And as for our goal of accelerating comp growth at Sam's in a meaningful way, we're
pleased with what we're seeing. So this is a graph I showed you last year regarding
our comp performance and here's where we are today. And we're really proud of the
team because we ran a 5% comp last quarter, which is a big change in trend. And
something that we did share already is that we do have a signiﬁcant amount of comp
activity from the transfer of members from the clubs that we closed early in the year.
And that's been going better than we expected. So about half of our comp just last
quarter was from transfer. So overall, good strength on the top line.
But the thing we think a lot about as we look to the future is, how's our membership
program going? So trends are healthy in membership. And just a reminder that
membership is primarily the way we make money in our format. So year-to-date, our
rates are up on renewal. Our sign-ups are up. Our Plus member penetration is
growing and our member count per club is up. And in fact, even with our smaller
footprint, at the end of this year, we think our membership count is going to be very
close to what it was a year ago.
So these are promising signs. And I want to be really clear, it didn't come from just
doing one thing. They resulted from the team thinking about the business in new
ways, a lot of new initiatives and a lot of hard work and follow through. And I'm
really, really proud of the team for the way they're constantly focused on serving
members and they're just obsessed with getting this right on behalf of our
members.
Now we know we've got to go faster and we know we've got to move farther. But I'm
proud to stand here to say, this business is much better positioned than it was a year
ago. And we're real excited about where we could still go in the future.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

building a healthier business, we're making changes actively to serve our target
member, we're staying disciplined and focused. And we are innovating for the
future.
And we're innovating for a future where we use technology to keep eliminating
friction for both associates and for members. So I want to leave you today with a look
at some of the technology that we're building and that will absolutely change the

In case you're wondering, hiring Dan Binder has not reduced the number of diﬃcult
questions he asks us. It only increased his access, which we didn't completely think
through when we made the decision.
I want to introduce Jacqui Canney. Jacqui, would you stand up for a second. I've got
a few direct reports that haven't been on stage today. Jacqui Canney is one of them.
She leads our people area. And one of her focus points is digitizing the associate
experience to be consumer-grade and making good progress doing that.
Dan Bartlett leads communications, sustainability, corporate aﬀairs, areas like that.
Does a great job.
Then Rachel Brand joined us in April. And Rachel is the Executive Vice President of
Global Governance, Chief Legal Oﬃcer. And she's the Corporate Secretary. She
came to Walmart from the U.S. Department of Justice where she served as the
Associate Attorney General. As the leader of our global governance organization,
she's got responsibility for not only legal. But compliance, ethics, our investigative
functions, security and aviation. So she's got a bunch of pilots that report to her, too.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

I'm going to miss that. So on the guidance from this morning, the implied gross
margin guidance is lower. And I was wondering if you could address it throughout
the various aspects of the business. Online, what the pricing environment is online
with the SKU growth? Then where do you think we are in the price investment within
the stores? Just the various pieces, wonder if you could break that out for us.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Okay. Why don't I kick oﬀ the ﬂoor with gross margin and turn it over to Marc and
Greg to talk as well. So we gave you -- I knew when we gave you leverage guidance,
you would go right to gross margin. And what I'd ask is that we keep -- I really
wanted to give you the leverage guidance to get you focused on leverage and the
fact that we can lever as a company. And we're starting to get good traction with
that. That does imply the gross margin deleverage, as you mentioned. I keep saying
this. And I think you may be getting tired of me saying it, about the levers that we
have to pull. And so getting that leverage gives us. And we've talked about this for a
long time, it just gives us ﬂexibility to do what we need to do as a company to make
the total work. So we're very thoughtful about price investments. These guys can talk
about it. We like, as Steve said earlier, we like where our price gaps are today. We'll
be very thoughtful and strategic about price investments. But that leverage gives us
some ﬂexibility that, I think, our competitors probably don't have.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yes. I've been asked a few times to ask sort of how we're feeling about the price
investment, what are we into now, about our third year. And our intention is to
continue down that track. I like the shape of a P&L for the stores that has margin
coming down and costs coming down. I don't see the environment out there less
competitive. I actually see it more competitive. Steve and I were out on the stores on
Saturday. And our competitors are out there selling -- I'm talking about Aldi in this
particular case -- a gallon of milk at $0.99 and a dozen eggs at $0.99. And I'm notFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

reasonable process for doing this. We build the muscle. And we're fortunate that, as
Brett mentioned, we've got some levers that we can pull. But the actual shape, I
think, of having SG&A coming down and gross margin coming down is a good
shape for Walmart when you're in the business of saving people money.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Just go to Peter, right next to Bob.
{BIO 3350921 <GO>}
Peter Benedict at Baird. Want to talk a little bit about wages, maybe what you're
seeing in trends in wages, both in the stores. But also in the distribution channel.
Then with the stores becoming so much more tech-enabled and actually serving as
fulﬁllment centers, how do we see, you go down 3 to ﬁve years maybe, what level of
labor investment is going to be required in the stores? How diﬀerent is it than it is
then that you see today?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Look, it's a good question. And to answer it fully, it's quite complex, would take time.
So let me try and give you some of the highlights. When I reﬂect, Doug, on where we
were four years ago, we were paying, I think, $7.63 an hour. And thanks to you, thanks
to the board, thanks to the family, we moved it to $9, moved it to $10. Judith, you
were part of all of that and you encouraged us, me, to get us to $11. And that's our
starting rate at the moment. But the reality is, I could take you to any number of
stores around the country where that's not the starting rate because this is a big
company and we operate right across this vast country. So if we're in California, we
pay a lot more than $11. So we have quite a large number of our stores where we
already pay well above $11. We have other parts of the country where $11 is the right
amount of pay. We have a process where every 2 weeks the ﬁeld team collect the
data, they bring it back in and there's a good, robust discussion around what we call
hotspots. And we take action where appropriate.
Remember that our stores, it's not just starting rate. You heard Doug mention in his
opening address about beneﬁts, whether it's maternity, whether it's parental leave.
Our PTO is a very good part of our program. And we spend circa $650 million a year
on store bonuses, what we call MyShare. Every single associate in Walmart has the
opportunity to earn a bonus. And I think, from memory, about 95% of our stores
actually got the ability to earn a bonus. Now if you max on that bonus, it's a pretty
decent amount. You're talking $550. The average is less than that. So our associates
look at the total package. And we deal with hotspots as appropriate.
Speciﬁc to fulﬁllment centers and distribution centers, nearly all of them are $15 or
above. And in fact, the average is, in fact, well above $15. So not any signiﬁcant
pressure there over and above what we just deal with day to day.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

Q - Michael LasserWhen you think about all the things that Mark, in particular. And his team showed
you yesterday and you think about the things that we shared again with you today, is
that going to change the way that we operate a store? Yes. Is it going to be
signiﬁcant? Yes. And that's a piece of work that Julie Murphy, who looks after our
people in the U.S., working very closely with Mark. And in fact, we were meeting
early this morning, half past 6 this morning, talking about it and working out actually
how we step this forward. But roles will change, how we work will change, ratio of
managers to associates, a lot of those things are things that we're thinking about and
working through so that we maintain the shape of the P&L. We get the GP coming
down and we get the SG coming down without damaging either the associate
experience or the customer experience. We actually want those to go up. But there's
a lot of change. And with 1.3 million people, associates, boy, I don't underestimate
how challenging that's going to be for us. But we think we can do it.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Only thing I would add is that the conversation frequently is about starting wage
rate. But with our retention going up and the training academies and how we're
progressing people through the system, what is the number of hourlies? Our
management ranks are like 2/3 came from our hourly ranks. So there's a pipeline
here that you get pulled through. So as we talk to our associates, we're thinking
about that whole relationship. And if they were here, as we've talked to them in
stores the last few weeks, they would say, don't remove the MyShare bonus, don't
remove what you do for stock purchase, thanks for what you did on the beneﬁts. And
those of us that have been here for a while just want to be rewarded for the work
we're doing, taking advantage of the training. Don't, talking to us, get too hung up
on where the starting wage rate is.
Now having said that, as Greg said, we'll be competitive by market to get the talent
that we need. But it's not just about the new people we've hired, it's about the
people that have already been here.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
And it was interesting. I was out touring a store with Dacona Smith, who looks after
our west division the other day. He's got 1,000 stores. He's been with us a long time.
And we're in a store and we were talking about the diﬃculty of getting some
associates to unload the trucks. And you've seen some of the innovation that we've
got going there. And Dacona, I didn't prod him or anything, he just jumped in with
the manager and said, "Haven't you got a bunch of colleges around you? Great. Why
don't you go out and access that talent? Think about the shifts that you want to run.
And remember that if those students stay with you, $1 a day and they can get a
university education." It's for real. Some of the stuﬀ is actually going to play out and
that helps with retention.

Q - Michael LasserIt's Michael Lasser from UBS. One for Brett and one for Marc. Brett, how would you
rank the diﬀerent factors that are going to weigh on the gross margin next year?
Looks like if you unpack the guidance, there may be 30 to 50 basis points of gross
margin degradation for the business. How would you rank things like e-commerce
losses, price investments, tariﬀs, mix of the business?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. There's a lot you had in your question, Michael. There's a lot of things in gross
margin. I'm not going to pack that fully, which I think you would expect.
Transportation expenses have been a challenge this year, whether that's driver
availability or fuel prices a little bit as well. We're expecting that, that will continue
some into next year. When you look at price investment, we talked about that. We
like where -- I said earlier, we like where our price gaps are. We'll be thoughtful
about that. But we're prepared to ensure that we will continue to be the low price
leader.
When it comes to tariﬀs, there's a lot of things going on with tariﬀs and a lot of
potential outcomes that we could see over the next several months. And Greg and
Steve, as you heard earlier, their teams are thinking through and working through all
of those potential scenarios. And the assumption we've made as we look at gross
margin, again, it's the challenge of talking about something today that we'll talk
about again in February. But the assumption is that we will manage through what
comes out. As I said this morning, we'll do everything we can not to raise prices. But
there are certain environments where we would raise prices because of those tariﬀs.
And we'll have to manage margins in a way and price in a way that makes sense for
customers and shareholders. So the gross margin question, there's a lot in that,
Michael. And that's just about, from a competitive standpoint, about as much as we'll
talk about it.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
I remember being up here and feeling like we could forecast an annual margin
number with some accuracy. I don't feel that way today like we did then. And for
some time now, it's been much more ﬂuid. So we have a cadence that we follow.
We'll get together again tomorrow, going through our forecast, thinking about
what's happening with e-commerce growth and e-commerce investment; where is
Greg on markdowns, how is he thinking about the price investment we're working
through; John, how's Sam's Club looking; what's happening in international with a
number of variables? Then saying, okay, change this, do that, let's roll this way and

And a quick follow-up for Marc. Seems like the e-commerce proﬁtability is a little bit
behind where you thought it was going to be a year ago. If you broke that down
between the head and the tail, maybe you're a little bit behind in the tail. But how is
the proﬁt pool associated with the head performed over the last year? Has that beenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

need to make and that's also weighed on the proﬁtability of the business?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. It's not really -- it's more of a mix issue. So we're driving a lot of the growth in the
head. We just need to have more balance between the head and the tail. And right
now, we just don't have that assortment to really lever the head traﬃc that we're
bringing in. So that's the reason why we're pushing on specialty acquisitions to
accelerate the ﬁrst party, why we've elevated the website design to attract more
premium brands, like all the things that we talked about and the strategy there are
really to help improve that mix.
{BIO 22151706 <GO>}
Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer. So 2 questions on Flipkart. So as you look at the
pricing of Flipkart versus your other e-commerce players and brick-and-mortar, how
is pricing compared to peers? Then second, as you look at the consumer, how do
you rank the reasons why consumer chooses Flipkart versus competitors? Is it
pricing, assortment or something else?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
So on the pricing one, Flipkart is committed to being competitive on pricing. And
one of the ways that they've done that is by the use of private brands as well. So they
are very strong from a private brand and a private brand development perspective.
That's their way of keeping items aﬀordable in India.
So actually, if you think about the mobile phones example I was talking about, that's
why they introduced the Billion brand was to help lower the prices overall. But at the
same time, not compromise in any way what the customer has. It's slightly diﬀerent
by category that they operate in. But they understand the Indian consumer is just as
price-sensitive as any consumer around the world. And that's why they focus on that.
From a future perspective from that, they'll continue to develop out private brand
and just look at how they can get some leverage.
From a -- why do we think they're a successful business and why do we think they're
going to be successful? Again, talked about that. One of their greatest advantages is
that they're an Indian business. They're local to that market. And they understand the
ins and outs of their customer in a way that probably outside really customer-centric
businesses like a Walmart do. So I think that's one of their real advantages in it. But
the whole ecosystem that they operate is the thing that really made it special for us,
which is there's no one part of it that you'd single out and say, "That's the winning
formula here." It's all of that together and the way they're creating stickiness for
customers for the long term. So I think that's one of the reasons that we think that,
long term, they're the right business for India. And I was just talking to somebody
earlier who was saying that they're a Flipkart user. And it's a great experience. So
that's one happy customer in this room. So I'm keeping working on it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

We'll go to Matt next.
{BIO 1509751 <GO>}
It's Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. And my question's focused on U.S. e-
commerce. Today, you heavily emphasized same-day delivery and the last mile and
your focus on the store as a vehicle for that service. Can you talk about what's
getting you there on cost and logistics, also the evolution of your customers'
expectations on that front and anything on the fee structure that will enable you to
make this work?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Okay, yes. So I mean, the strategy is pretty clear. We're going to drive and become
the primary destination, largely by leaning on same-day delivery out of the
supercenter, as really building that relationship where customers are coming on a
weekly basis. We're going to need to bring together the sort of grocery experience
and the Walmartomics experience together so we can monetize that traﬃc to sell
into the long tail, which will be delivered by the FCs and logistics network. And we're
continuing to push on faster delivery times there. As I mentioned before, we're now
at a place where we can do a lot more overnight delivery via ground in one box. So
that will really drive down ship cost. And fulﬁllment cost come down 10% last year.
And we see lots of opportunity to continue to drive that down in the future.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
A lot of hands up over here. Go to Chris next.
A couple of questions on Flipkart as well. Covering the stock like Wayfair, a lot of
times, when you get momentum in that -- in the money-losing business, sales grow
faster and beat your expectations. You end up losing more money. So as you think
about potential for that over the next 18 months, is the business at a point where
actually the underlying proﬁtability improves, such that if you beat your top line
expectation, it doesn't become a big drag to the bottom line? Then in thinking about
the $0.60 headwind, I think about $0.40 of this in the operating proﬁt dollar portion.
How would you think about that pressure between the grosses and the SG&A and
how that dials up to this implied 30 bp hit on gross margin next year?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Okay. So from an overall basis, that business is doing a really nice job. It is true that if
the top line accelerates -- now we've clearly taken a lot of that into account by the
forecast that we've got. However, what they're doing a great job of is balancing out
the mix of categories that they've got. So it parallels a really great example with both
Myntra and Jabong and a parallel on Flipkart as well, where that is a much higher
contribution margin than some of the other categories. So the mix is no diﬀerent to
some of the things that Marc talks about, which is mixing out the categories and alsoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

Q - Robert Frederick Ohmeslong tails versus head in order to think about how do they grow this business in a
healthy way over time. So we are happy with the guidance that we've given, based
on everything we've seen in the business today. How we think about it versus kind of
margin to SG&A? We're not going to break that out. But what I'll tell you about that
business is they are focused on every dollar, on every rupee. And I think part of that
comes from the fact that they were a funded business. So therefore, they have a real
EDLC mindset, which is not a rupee to waste in that business. And what that they're
doing is using that to ﬁnd ways to keep their investments where they need to make
them. The other really interesting thing that they're doing is they're using data and
they're using artiﬁcial intelligence to make them more eﬃcient and more eﬀective.
So if I think about areas like the eKart network, in the same way that Marc talks about
fulﬁllment cost as one of the key drivers in the business, it equally is for them as well.
And the data analysis that they're doing is helping them become more eﬃcient in
the way they're operating that network. So there's plenty within there for them to pull
levers on, just like in any other business.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Okay. Take one from Robbie upfront. Then on the side -- then we'll come back to
you. Plenty of time for Q&A.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
Well just a few quick general questions. First, I apologize if I missed it in the past. You
guys have, on e-commerce, talked about a ratio of when you convert a store-only
customer to an e-commerce customer, that their total spend goes up. I think you've
said numbers like 2 to -- 2x. Is that still 2x?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. Janey brieﬂy mentioned it. But we didn't elaborate on this as much as we did
last time. But that still holds.
{BIO 1541955 <GO>}
Then just on stores. So the comp guidance for ﬁscal '20 of 2% to 3%, can you give us
any thought on what component of that you would expect to be store traﬃc and also
what component you'd expect to be ticket?
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
I don't think we provided any guidance on that. So no.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
And that can -- traﬃc and ticket can ebb and ﬂow some too with fuel prices losing.
For instance, if fuel prices go up, sometimes you get a little diﬀerent mix of traﬃc. So
it would be tough to try to forecast that exactly. But we like the trends we're seeing
right now.

Let me see if that works. So Walmart Spark is our crowd-sources. It's a Walmart

it. We've got a couple hundred drivers. We're in about 4 markets. First delivery is
made by a student, 21 year old young lady. So far. So good. We have high hopes for
it. And we're just going to let that grow as part of the diﬀerent way we will deliver in
the future. If you're interested in being a driver, by the way, there is no fee.

Let's go stay on this side of the room, upfront to Chuck. There's Chuck. There he is.
On the ability to go to the long side of the tail, how quickly do you think you can add
some of those new brands, Marc, in terms of trying to expand in some of the digitally
native companies? Then for the U.S. business, obviously, the Second Quarter was
phenomenal, 4.5% comps. Wondering if you guys could try to unpack that? How
much was micro? How much was macro company-speciﬁc stuﬀ? How much was
weather? Clearly, the economic backdrop is really good. Just wondering how
sustainable that level of traﬃc increase can be.

I'll start. Look, in terms of the comps for the Second Quarter, I think we've all seen
out there in the market 2 things, that April was unseasonably cold. So that depressed

Q - Karen Fiona ShortMay, which, of course, took that into the Second Quarter. So that was a bump of
some signiﬁcance. Overall, I would say that our sense of the market is that it's really
good. It's really solid. Trying to unpack that down to how much is due to this and
how much is due to that is really diﬃcult. But look, we're happy with how we're
traveling.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
And in terms of the tail, this is more of a multiyear sort of problem. It's not going to
be ﬁxed in months. We onboarded about 2,000 new brands since the beginning of
the year. And we're starting to accelerate on a monthly basis, especially retailer
acquisitions are helping but they just take time to integrate, same with the DNVB. So
making good progress. I think the site redesign has helped a lot. We're deﬁnitely
getting a lot more inbound from more premium vendors and merchants than we
ever have before. So I like the direction we're heading. But it's not going to happen
overnight.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
We're going to hit this cluster here. Let's go to Simeon and then we'll go to Karen
after that and then Paul.
{BIO 7528320 <GO>}
Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. I think mine are both for you, Brett. First, high level
on guidance. You talked about eComm losses stepping up a little bit next year. And
while some of us were hoping they'd go the other way, in a way, it feels that the
overall guidance for EPS growth is more conservative. Because this year, they ended
up being higher than you thought. So I just wanted to get your sense on that point. Is
it fair? The second question is assuming you're not going to disclose the
contribution from click-and-collect, can you tell us whether the -- in ﬁscal '20, there's
a big change in the click-and-collect contribution to comp versus the core business?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, our guidance is -- you use the word conservative. Our guidance is what
our guidance is. That's what we feel good about today. And when you put all these
pieces together, being able to give you a range, put it all together, that's where we
think we'll end up when we get to next year. We haven't talked -- haven't unpacked
that eCommerce to total versus online grocery click-and-collect. Online grocery is an
important part of that number. And we've said that. Obviously, that's growing next
year. Our growth rate's still pretty much in line next year with what we've had this
year. So it's really all of those pieces, add it up. And that's about as much as we'll
break it out competitively, Simeon.

A - C. Douglas McMillonKaren Short, Barclays. So this is also for you, Brett. Looking at your free cash ﬂow
growth. So I mean you can take whatever time period. But maybe starting '11 through
to today, it's kind of been in that 8-ish % range. So you can you talk a little bit about
on how to think about it going forward?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Our -- if you look at that period of time, I'm going back and think about FY '11 in
my head, we've had nice growth, as you pointed out, in free cash ﬂow. And it's been
-- the operations are -- operating income has come down. But when you look at what
we've done from a CapEx standpoint, CapEx is actually quite a bit lower than it was
six years ago when we were building out the supercenter business. And over the last
3 to four years, working capital has been a really important part of that free cash ﬂow.
I mean, I mentioned in my presentation that we've grown $10 billion -- or taken $10
billion working capital out over the last few years. I don't -- it's hard to predict that
we can continue that pace of working capital improvement. But every piece of the
business is really doing a nice job in work capital. So I do expect working capital to
get better next year. We look at that free cash ﬂow number, we know it's important.
It's how we pay you back, the shareholders, is what that free cash ﬂow. And so we're
very aware of it. But I appreciate you mentioning that it has gone up. I appreciate
that.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Then just a second question for Marc. I mean, I think there's some perception out
there that the brands or the companies that you've -- assets you've acquired maybe
are perceived less favorably by their core customers so that the sales may not be
robust. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what the sales have been doing at the
acquired company?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Sure. Deﬁnitely, early on, there's some press when we ﬁrst do the acquisition. But if
you look a few months later, the repeat curves, the traﬃc, everything sort of comes
back. So actually, all the brands are in a good place right now. And I don't think that
that's something to really worry about going forward, just that initial dip from some
of the early press.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
So Marc, as it relates to incoming momentum and why we make these acquisitions,
what you said earlier about the distinction between DNVBs and acquisitions that are
done for assortment, maybe it's worth repeating. On some of these -- maybe Marc
can say this better than I can. So I'll say it brieﬂy and he can elaborate. But on some
of these, we're trying to acquire a merchandising team that has depth of knowledge
and experience in a category, brand relationships that can accrue to Walmart or Jet,
hopefully both. And then some cases, others, whether it's Hayneedle or Moosejaw.
And do that with speed. And these acquired businesses are ﬁnding that it's really
hard to scale because of the cost, the cost of a new customer. So they may have a
good oﬀer, good prices, good service. But the cost to acquire, the CAC, is so high
that they stall or they reach a level where they can't punch through. It makes sense,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

Q - Paul Trussell
A - Brett M. Biggsactually. In our case, we've got all this traﬃc. So if we can take a great assortment and
a good team and give them the volume that we've got, we'll beneﬁt from that over
time. There is probably a set of tipping points as we do this, because just doing one
of them doesn't move the needle that much. Doing them collectively so that a
customer can ﬁnd everything they're looking for would. So that's part of what's
going on.
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. And just to add on top of that, too. The other beneﬁt you get is ﬁrst-party sales
in a long tail category. So walmart.com might not have a lot of sales in a certain
category that's long tail and we can't aﬀord to bring the product ﬁrst party because
of the holding costs are too high. But then when you add the volume of the specialty
retail, suddenly, it make sense to carry ﬁrst party, which comes with higher margin.
So that's -- and better experience as well because we're able to warehouse the stuﬀ
and ship it in the same box. So.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Got a lot of dots to connect here. When brands that are thinking about selling to us
consider it, they look at website design, they look at on-time delivery, hitting the date
you said you were going to hit, the holistic oﬀer. So the CVI that Marc covered today,
this customer value index that we're measuring and that ability to deliver on time
while bringing together the assortment from all others, doing the website redesign,
connecting it to the mobile app in the right way, all those things have to all be
worked on. And I think it's just a gradual improvement as you earn -- and earn
business that you will also attract more brands.

Paul?
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
Paul Trussell, Deutsche Bank. 20 basis points of expense leverage is impressive, just
given it's a consolidated number, including Flipkart, including the incremental drag
from eCommerce. So if you can just talk a little bit about how we should think about
that in Walmart U.S. versus international or Sam's, if there's any additional color that
you can provide on smart spend or to what extent the automation and digitization is
already playing a key factor and contributing to the leverage today versus is that
something that's more to come down the line? Then I mean, you already spoken on
wages a bit. But just overall, to what extent, as we think about overall hours, are you
leveraging payroll? Then just lastly, on the same topic is to what extent then is the
comp threshold that's needed to just maintain ﬂattish expense rate on a year-over-
year basis? Is that something closer to, I don't know, 1.5 comp? How should we think
about that?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Let me, I'll let Greg deal with wages. From a leverage standpoint, 20 basis points
would be -- it's an inﬂection from where we've been. And it's -- like I mentioned in
our -- in my presentation earlier, it's a lot of diﬀerent things. Some of it is -- we'veFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

A - Gregory S. Forannever -- we didn't lose the EDLC culture. That didn't get lost. But it wasn't what it was
several years ago. And if you're in our oﬃce now versus a year ago, I think you'd hear
a diﬀerent conversation about expenses. So some of that is, I think just getting back
to the culture a little bit and everyone looking at expenses a little diﬀerently. We're
approaching it diﬀerently. I think that's why it's getting maybe more traction than it
has in the past, where in the past you might just say, "Hi. you cut 5%. You cut 5%, you
cut 5%." It's really not what it is. It's go change your process, go ﬁgure how we can
put technology into something to change the way we're working. So not just get
more eﬀective -- I mean, more get eﬃcient, get more eﬀective as well while we're
doing it. So I think those 2 things matter. The fact that we started a year ago on a
formal process, I think, helped a lot to say, we're going to go do this. And we have
Amanda Whalen actually in the back who's leading this eﬀort and doing a great job
with that. But the partnership with the people you see up here in the stage has been
phenomenal. I mean, this has been -- everybody is saying, this is the right thing to do
for the business. And we're going to go make it happen. There'll be some big things
that come up. I think goods not for resale is something that's going to beneﬁt us.
We're really early innings in that. But it's kind of all those things together, Paul. You --
and to your kind of your last question, you remember times where we leveraged
expenses at ﬂat comp. I can remember that back to 2010, 2011. But it wasn't how we
wanted to get there. It was more of that cutting, like I was just mentioning earlier.
And that's not what we want to do. I don't -- 3 comps help a lot in leveraging
expenses. And it's not lost on me. And that's why I gave the guidance the way I did
today. But I think there are -- there's a leverage point that's below a 3 comp. It just
depends on kind of where the sales growth is coming from.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
Just to add to that from an international perspective, which is the same focus is
happening in every market around the world as well. So -- even the programs, the
programs are being shared, the best practices are being shared because everybody
recognizes that in order for the productivity loop to work, we need to ﬁnd ways to be
smart about costs in the business. So each one of the markets equally has a smart
spend program. We have a Center of Excellence in Canada for that, for example, that
has teams in every market that's leveraging. And Amanda and the team will take
learnings from them as well as we go to that. So it's not just a U.S. program. It's a
program for us and I know it's a program in Sam's as well.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
I think fuel prices are about $2.90 a gallon compared to $2.50 a year ago. The tariﬀ
issue is there. Interest rates tick up. You've got mortgage pressure on customers that

assortment expense, just from being food and consumables to seasonal general
merchandise to other key general merchandise categories. So -- part of hopefully
what we've been able to demonstrate to you is that we have a bit of a road map that
says, "Put in fast unload, start to develop the automation that's going up and down
the aisles, work out how to do electronic shelf labels." And as we put those things in,
you can expect that hours that we're assigned to do that is task come out. Now some
of that's going to get added back in again, because as we expand the ability to pick
and ship from a supercenter, we've got to convert that over. But net-net, it does
come down. And it's going to be a real task and challenge to deliver that. So
keeping the sales up is one way that helps you do that. That's why the merchandise
is so important.

Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Wondering if you could talk about your long-term
proﬁtability objectives for both Flipkart and U.S. eCommerce. I think I got the
message that Flipkart, the objective is to be proﬁtable over time. So just curious on
the time frame. Is that a 10-year process? Or any color you can give? Then also in the
U.S., this is the third year of talking about losses bottoming and now it's going
deeper. So will it ever -- will that discussion ever change? Is this a 10-year process?
Or just how should we think about that over time?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I'll just hit -- take both of them actually. Judy said there's a lot of similarities
about how you -- whether it's Flipkart or it's U.S. eCommerce business, how you end
up leveraging that business and getting proﬁtability where you want it to be. We
want to be proﬁtable in these businesses. And we wouldn't have continued to invest
here or made that acquisition if we didn't plan to be proﬁtable over time. U.S.
eCommerce. And I mentioned this in my comments, is getting tougher and tougher
in the U.S. business to say what's Marc's proﬁtability, what's Greg's proﬁtability.
Obviously, we have a way to look at that. But the customer is so omni that it is going
to get more challenging for us, I think, to communicate well with you, what the split is
between those 2 things. Flipkart, when you look at the opportunity there, there's 2
countries in the world that have 1.3 billion people. This is one of them. And you look
at the increasing middle market there in India, the business that we bought. We plan
to win. We knew it's going to be competitive. We know it's going to be competitive.
But for us to try to put a time frame on that today just wouldn't be practical.

performance. And granted free cash ﬂow is being good. But if you look at earnings,
you look at EBIT, I think EBIT, I was looking this morning, is down 24% since ﬁscal '14.
When do we inﬂect? I mean, I know this is something we talked about as, again,
ROIC. And that's also going to decline again next year with Flipkart. When do things
inﬂect and we see this great strategy, great team bring it to the bottom line?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Yes. I wish I could tell you exactly. When I moved in this job, I did not anticipate all of
this happening, by the way. I think we're learning every week, it's amazing what the
cycle times look like. And a year ago as we were sitting here, we didn't know we
were going to go do Flipkart. There were conversations under way. We were aware
of them, certainly, aware of some of the things happening in the market. But things
accelerated in a way that I wouldn't have anticipated. I think it's going to take some
time. I think the guidance we've given you for next year is the best guidance we can
give you. And I don't think we should try to forecast out beyond that year. I am,
though, excited about building out this ecosystem and bolting on things that are
core -- or to our core. And the story I keep telling everybody, it may not be the best
story, is one when I was at Sam's Club and we were paying people to haul oﬀ the
core, get bales from behind the club. We thought -- we've baled the cardboard and
we needed it to leave. And somebody was willing to take it away as a service and we
pay them. And we went through this lens change, John was part of it, where we
looked at the world diﬀerently and somebody said, "Plastic is oil. Cardboard is trees.
There's value here." And in one year's time, we went from paying somebody to take
it away to making $15 million at Sam's Club in income because we should have been
selling it all along. Well our data has never been monetized. And we have a tiny ad
business. It could be bigger. We can make progress on the margin number on
eCommerce. It's taking longer than I thought it was going to. And I've been
surprised at just how many brands there are out there to get signed up. I keep
asking Marc and Scott Hilton, "How can I help? Because we got to get these brands
online." It's exciting that we've got 2,000 of them. Who knew we needed 2,000 of
them? I didn't. I thought I knew retail and kind of knew all the brands. But the Pareto
chart in eCommerce looks diﬀerent than it does for the stores. So most of the people
we call want to be part of what we're doing here. Some of them need to be
recruited, some of them will be on Jet before they'll be on Walmart. That's not all
within our control. So I hope that in a year's time -- there aren't that many Chinas and
Indias in the world. But if something came up in China that looked like a great
opportunity, even considering what's going on politically, I think we would consider
it because we want to be positioned to have a business that's large and growing for
the long term. Hopefully, you think that the decisions we're making on portfolio
focus are important. We think they are because we can't do everything. TheFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

than we might have normally. We tend to hold things back until we're ready to scale
them. But one of the reasons why we decided to show it to you is because it's --
there are speciﬁc examples of things that we can do to drive the productivity loop
that will help relieve proﬁt pressure. So to the extent we want to reinvest, we can. I'm
trying to balance short term and long term. But if you force me to choose, I'd lean
long term. We're trying to balance sales and proﬁtability. But if you force me to
choose, I'd lean toward sales because of the customer relationship and the long-
term viability of this company. I believe that the culture of this place, the associates
we have and the role that we play in the world is worth investing in to be here for the
long term. Now having said that, I know -- even if you're on our board, any member
of our board, by the way, will say, "Yes. We want to make the right decisions for the
long term. And when are you going to grow proﬁtability? And when this return on
investment turnaround?" These pressures are coming from the board as well as from
you, all of them. So we're trying to do the best job we can of balancing it out. But
we're not going to run this thing for one quarter or six months. We're going to run it
for longer than that. So I hope it turns quickly. And I hope you're here and we can
smile and say, "We ﬁnally delivered that for you." That's our objective. But that's

Greg Melich with Moﬀett Nathanson. So I guess I want to follow up on your point,
Doug, precisely because I think it gets to the heart of where we're going longer
term. If the free cash ﬂow has improved and if CapEx looks constrained, say, $11
billion versus where it was. So CapEx and D&A are roughly ﬂat. How do you think
about the board's willingness and your own to sort of take on another Flipkart, not
next year or something. But just in the next 3 to ﬁve years? I guess is there a point
where instead of thinking about the geography, you think about a capability,
perhaps buying a marketplace that already exists or you've seen Amazon ﬁnally
monetize their Prime membership through 3P fees and advertising. It sounds like
you mentioned a little bit about other ways to monetize. I just want to get your
thinking about when you think about that CapEx budget longer term, you think
about sustainable margin. Is that a lever that we need to go so that Walmart truly can
monetize this great franchise that's been built on the retail side?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Yes. We would deﬁnitely be open to things like that, capability acquisitions that
would deliver proﬁtability and return over time. The board and I would say, "Every
single investment we make needs to be made because of an expected return on
investment." So all the rigor that you would expect to see relate to those investments
exist. I think the only disagreement we might have with some people in the room is
payback period and how fast it happens, the long-term, short-term trade-oﬀ. But yes,
we would be open to that. Some of the things we represented on the ecosystem
chart would point to you -- that point you towards the types of areas we might beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. I wanted to ask a follow-up question as it relates to
working capital. Inventory improvement, understandably, has received a lot of the
focus as it relates to improved cash ﬂow. But the payable days has been really
impressive too. And that improvement has been congruent with improving comps.
Can you help us understand how important comp growth is to improving your
payables days? And is it reasonable to expect that as comp growth sustains, that we
would see corresponding improvement in payables days?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I'll let maybe Marc -- I mean, Greg talk a little bit about that piece with the suppliers.
Inventory has been amazing. And it really started with Walmart U.S. and what we've
done in inventory and being able to take the days of inventory we did out and
continue to increase in stocks is a real testament, I think, to Judith, when she was in
the stores and Steve and Greg and Marc, great testament to them. On payables, we
were driving a lot of comp growth. Then I talked about earlier with the 3 comp in
Walmart U.S., you're talking about almost $10 billion of growth. And I think it's tough
for suppliers to ﬁnd $10 billion of growth out in the market. And what I would say is
we just -- we need to ensure that we're getting what we should and what's fair
because we're driving that level of comp. It's -- you just don't ﬁnd that very many
places in the market today. I don't know, Greg, how you think...
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Steve, why don't you maybe pick up that?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
I think -- Brett, you said it. Our goal and we're going to (survive) and I said it on the
stage and you just said it again, it's tough but fair. And we're working with them to
understand how we create leverage from the sales that we are driving in the
marketplace and when we run high comps, it certainly makes a big diﬀerence. We've
gone back and looked at all of our policies and our terms with our suppliers. And
quite frankly, we weren't always this consistent as we needed to be. And we spent a
lot of time driving consistency across our suppliers and having those discussions.
And it's made a diﬀerence, clearly, in the numbers. And we'll continue to do that and
stay disciplined on it. That's my job with the buying team, to make sure we stay
disciplined with our suppliers, drive those terms. But more than anything, they're
looking for growth. And if we can deliver that growth, it puts us in an advantageous
position.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
I just want to seize this moment to say thank you. The job that Greg, Steve, Judith,
you and the Walmart U.S. team has done over the last few years, that included

Q - Joseph Isaac Feldmanbackrooms, is the best I have seen. We were not in a great place. And if you know
much about retail, inventory management is a great indicator of the quality of
management. And not only the -- I mean, the payables number and cash ﬂow are an
outcome of that inventory management focus. And it's extraordinary. With the
company, cannot thank you enough for the work that you guys have done. Got to
keep it going.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
John, you have any...
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Yes. I think I'd add a couple of other points that helped. One, there's been a lot of
work that's been done all across the company in supply chain. And I'd want to
recognize the work that's happened upstream and everything, from the number of
DCs we've operated per operating unit has improved over time. So with the same
amount of inbound and more outbound, it's easier to keep inventory levels lower,
because at a point, the boxes just can't handle more inventory. You physically max
out your space. And to the second, there's been a lot of great work done in
technology that enable associates to work realtime on the ﬂoor, whether it's the CAP
program at Walmart or own your inventory in Sam's but around the world that make
it easy to ﬁnd out-of-stocks, issues with inventory, ﬁnd the inventory, get it in front of
consumers very quickly so that the turns are better. And we're even going as far as
gamifying some of those experiences so associates have fun and actually can
compete versus other associates in their market or their region to have the best
availability inside the clubs. And all those, it's a bunch of things, everything Steve
talked about, supply chain and the way we operate, that all adds up to diﬀerent
pieces of it. And I think you can improve inventory in turns in a way that doesn't
require comp sales growth. Certainly, it helps. But a lot of things we've done have
improved it even without that.

Q - Beryl Bugatchdoes seems to make a lot of sense. How do you build that? Do you grow that? Do
you want that to be a key driver for you in the future?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. Both 1P and 3P are both, I would say, equally as important. We sort of think
about 1P as sort of being the head of the assortment and call it the top 100,000
products and then that long 1P tail. Then 3P, you're thinking about the 3P that's
warehoused and the 3P that's not. You kind of take the 2 pieces in the middle, which
is the 1P tail and the 3P warehouse, put that together, that's where the proﬁt's really
made and that's the hard part. It's getting millions of SKUs into the warehouse to be
fulﬁlled, together in the same box with the same means of shipping. That's the
challenging part. That's the piece that we're sort of attacking right now.
{BIO 4772233 <GO>}
Isn't it -- just a quick follow-up. How do you guys plan to integrate VUDU more and
make that part of the ecosystem? Is that central to creating the whole loop in some
respect?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Yes. Steve, you may want to comment, too. We've got an opportunity -- go ahead
and pop up. Going to let you answer most of this. So we've got an opportunity,
without investing a ton of money, to improve our customer oﬀer. And there are lots
of people that are coming to us asking for us to participate in this. And I'm excited
about the steps you've taken so far.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. I think that VUDU is a wonderful platform. And I'd encourage you, if you haven't
used it, I think it's one of the best ones out there. And I would argue, Doug, that we
probably haven't done enough of it over the years. And we can do a lot more.
There's a big opportunity there. And we're talking to a lot of diﬀerent people,
looking at a lot of diﬀerent opportunities. But this idea, to be more integrated into
the digital lives of our customers through entertainment component, is something
that we think has a lot of opportunities. So you have VUDU, signed opportunities
with e-books. We're starting to put our toe in the water in a small way in original
content. But we're thinking about what does the future look like for entertainment in
a Walmart way. So we're not going to follow anyone else's model. We're thinking
through what that uniquely means for us. But VUDU will certainly be an anchor
platform for that. But there's a lot of discussions going on. And I'm sure at some
point, we'll come back and talk about it a lot more.

A - Judith McKennain the store between the assistant manager and department managers, changing
that mix. And now with the continuing change in the productivity we see, do we see
much change again in table of organization inside the stores? What looks like the
task and versus some other kind of work will change over time as some of that
productivity happens, I'd be curious to see your thoughts on that, Greg.
{BIO 4687375 <GO>}
Yes, lots, lots more change. And as I mentioned previously, we're starting to work
through that at the moment. But you can probably get a sense that what we've done
is we've standardized a number of processes. So what happens in this department is
actually now the same as what happens in this department is what happens in that
department. We've taken away tasks that we think we can automate. And quite
frankly, we've struggled to ﬁnd associates who want to do those tasks on an ongoing
basis. And a combination of that, along with more technology that we can start to
introduce, I think, is going to see that the ratio of management to associates will
change again. We'll expect, I guess, a broader span of control from the leadership in
the group. We took some action earlier on this year where we reduced the amount
of co-managers we had in the stores. So many of the stores were running 3 or 4 co-
managers, now they'll run 2 co-managers. And if you're below $85 million, you'll run
one co-manager. So all of that is up for grabs and changing. But you have to change
the way that you work. And that's simplifying some tasks, training people. And if you
do all that in concert, then I think we can make a really meaningful diﬀerence to the
way that we operate a Walmart store in the future. And we need to do that. So that's
part of our thinking and part of our planning. Now as that unfolds -- we've got a
number of trials running at the moment. As it unfolds, we can share more with you.
But we are early into that at this point.

of coming up from South America. How do you think about kind of remaining
competitive in those markets, particularly as it relates to eComm? Then second,
when you refer to China, you kind of teased out that you might be open to an
acquisition there. How do you feel about your asset base in China and how much
investment is required from an eComm perspective to kind of keep that
competitive?
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
So to start with Latin America. So clearly, we've just announced the investment in
Cornershop, which is important to us, because what's really clear overall at the
markets in which we operate is that omnichannel and last mile delivery is going to
be one of the really key winning strategies. The markets that we've gotten, the
positioning and the market-leading positions that we've got, mean that we're really
well positioned to be able to do that. So the primary focus for the teams isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

Q - Beryl Bugatchomnichannel. The teams are still continuing to build our eCommerce as well. But the
primary focus is the omnichannel. And we've got partnerships in some of the
markets where we appear on other people's websites with our product in order to
drive some of the other eCommerce businesses. So key area of focus. It's an
expanding area of focus. And I talked about Mexico in particular. We think that we've
got an opportunity to build out a kind of ecosystem now that's tailored very much for
the Mexican customer. It's unique for us to be able to do that because of the assets
that we've got there. And from a China perspective, I'll just comment on the assets
that we have, which is that we told you last year that we were looking to still balance
the portfolio there. And that's what we're continuing to do. So prioritizing the
provinces where we know we can create -- grow strongly in, we're doing that. We're
continuing to open new stores there as well. But the asset that we've really got there
is, again, this omnichannel. It's a theme that you're hearing through every single part
of the business, which is how do we use our store footprint or, in China's case, the
kind of new mini-fulﬁllment centers that we're doing to anchor our sales as part of a
broader ecosystem in that market. So the opportunity in China is still signiﬁcant. And
we're still learning all the time about what combination of assets at work. So that's
deﬁnitely one that, today, we're focused on. How do we grow our stores where it
matters, how do we develop some new formats and how do we make most of the
partnerships that we've got with the last mile delivery being a really key part of that?
And JD Daojia and the investment there was critical in ensuring that we did that.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
I was there last week. And the new supermarkets, this smaller supermarket format, I
think we're going to have 7 of them by year-end, looked really good. So we've got an
opportunity there not just with super centers. But supermarkets. And Sam's Club
continues to be great. And then this delivery capability is important.
{BIO 4806787 <GO>}
The thing -- one of the skills that we've got in China is fresh food. And again,
common theme is you see about things that people are focusing on, have an
excellence in fresh food in whichever market that we operate in is really important to
us. And we're taking lots of learnings from each other. And the supermarkets are
opening in China, took a lot of learnings from neighborhood market and other
markets around the world as well.

everything to -- or all the private label to Member's Mark. I wonder if there's much
left to be done in terms of curating new SKUs and what penetration we might see
going forward in that particular area.
{BIO 19351533 <GO>}
Well there's certainly more that we can do. And Budd, you remember back about
three years ago, we started assembling a really great team of people, led by
Chandra Holt and others, to develop great quality products and then source it away
where we can provide a great value to. And pretty good growth the ﬁrst couple of
years where I'm really happy. The penetration, it's in the high 20s now and sales and
even higher in units. But there's certainly a number of items that we think we can
continue to improve and categories that we still haven't entered in. We've been
strong in general merchandise over time, packaged foods and then condiments and
confection have started to grow. So great progress. But it's important part of the mix.
And there was probably a point when we had so many brands, we thought a private
brand is way to improve margin. And that's really shifted over the years, where now
we think of -- this category and this brand, the mini categories, that is the oﬀer and it
is the best oﬀer. And margins not really the goal of it. It's in line with the rest of the

we're driving volume.

sense of how you're thinking about that down the road.

Yes, sure. We like our AA credit rating. And when you look at the bond deal we did
to ﬁnance Flipkart, it was really a good deal. And that AA helps. What we've seen,
though, is go back eight years ago and you had some AAAs, you had more AAs,
we've stayed AA. But relatively, we're better than we were even a few years ago

detail and helped them understand how we saw the company long term. We're not
married to that credit rating. It's important to us. And it's beneﬁted us a lot as a
company. If we wanted to do something that we felt was really good long term for
the business, that credit rating in and of itself wouldn't be the reason why we
wouldn't do something. It would be considered. But it wouldn't be the reason.
I have a $1 million question. (J. N. Kniﬀen, Jay Rogers Kniﬀen.) On the auto parts deal,
can you give us a little more about what this does for Advance and what this does for
you?
{BIO 3597588 <GO>}
Yes. I mean, this is part of the strategy of just trying to bring unique assortment onto
walmart.com, to give customers a broader assortment and also to help with margin
mix. So it ﬁts squarely in our strategy. For Advance, it's opportunity to leverage the
traﬃc on walmart.com, which is quite a bit. And either another auto player is going
to take -- get access to that traﬃc or it's going to be Advance. So I think it was a
good deal on both sides.

{BIO 15313233 <GO>}
Doug, the business model shift that you referred to is very exciting. But it does add
complexity and risk, especially versus the simplicity of the historical productivity loop
of Walmart. As we're on this journey, what are the due proof points that we should
be focused on? So you've gotten deeper into one key initiative, which is driving the
same-day delivery with grocery and then trying to cement the relationship to get that
customer to shop long tail on the dot.com. I guess it's early here. But is there any
data or evidence you can give us to show that this is working? Then, I guess what are
some of the other new proof points that we should be focused on that this evolving
business model is going to pay oﬀ the way you hope it will?
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
Yes. Obviously, it's really early. We're talking to you in somewhat of a conceptual
manner. And I think the way you evaluate us shouldn't change too quickly. You
understand what it takes to run great stores and what metrics you should be
watching. You're starting to hear more and more about how we're building
eCommerce but when you think about health care, ﬁnancial services and some of
these areas, I think the way to think about is through the lens of the customer and
how our relationship with them, measured by share of wallet or share of household
spend, goes up over time. And the commonality that exist today is related to dataFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

these diﬀerent ways. And it looks to us less vertical than it used to look. When I was
going to business school or my early days at Walmart, we heard language and
thought of our businesses in silos. We have Sam's Club. We have Walmart. We have
eCommerce. And I don't think that's the way to think about things today as much. I
think it's more of a holistic lens related to the customer, how they spend their time,
how they spend their money and what assets do we have including the capabilities
of our own people that can be used to have a more holistic relationship with them.
So I think there'll be metrics that'll emerge over time. But share of household wallet,
those kinds of metrics, I think, are going to be part of it. NPS score, obviously, will
matter a lot. We talk a lot more about NPS than we used to in various parts of our
business.

{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Thanks.
{BIO 17082935 <GO>}
This leadership team, hard-working, committed to the business and loves learning.
We are learning together, we're adjusting, we're adapting, in some ways creating
together. And it's a lot of fun. And I really have a lot of respect for this team that I
work with. And I'm very appreciative of how they're helping get this company ready
for the future. Many of them are represented in this room. Even Dave Cheesewright
is back here. He didn't present today. But he just had to come watch because he's
still involved with the company, which we're appreciative of.
Then just maybe to you, I hope you can sense -- Karen and I were talking a little bit
about this last night, that there's a change within the company that is related to
mindset, culture, behavior. And we're inventing again, not that we ever completely
stopped. But it's diﬀerent today than it was even one year ago or two years ago. And
so I hope you'll assess us as a company of the future and not just think of the
company in the way that you might have thought about it years ago. Coming and
spending time with us is probably the best way to get your mind around that.
So thanks for making the investment. Have a safe trip home.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-10-16

Great. Well that will conclude our meeting. We have lunch that will follow. And we
appreciate your interest. Thanks.
