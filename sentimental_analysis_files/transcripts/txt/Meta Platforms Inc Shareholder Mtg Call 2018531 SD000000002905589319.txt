Good morning. Welcome. Thanks for joining us for Facebook's 2018 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders. I am Dave Kling, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary
of Facebook and Chairman of this annual meeting, which I now call to order.
Let me run through today's agenda. First, we'll focus on the formal business set forth
in the proxy statement. Then, Mark will spend a few minutes talking about how
Facebook has been doing. And ﬁnally, we'll conclude with a Q&A session.
Before we begin with the formal business, I'd like to remind you to please turn oﬀ all
mobile devices and of the rules of conduct that were provided to you when you
entered the meeting, including the rule prohibiting photos and recording of any
kind. Thanks for your cooperation.
Let me start by introducing the members of our Board of Directors who are here
today: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Erskine Bowles, Ken Chenault and Sue
Desmond-Hellman. I would also like to introduce 2 other people who are inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

accounting ﬁrm; and Kris Veaco, who will act as the Inspector of Election for this
meeting and who will tabulate the results of the voting. Ms. Veaco has previously
executed the oath of Inspector of Election.
Turning now to the formal business. I have a copy of the notice, together with the
declaration as to the mailing, of the proxy statement made available to all Facebook
stockholders of record as of April 6, 2018. I also have a list of stockholders entitled to
vote at this meeting, which is available for inspection by any stockholder present or
by any proxy holder who is representing a stockholder and which list will be ﬁled
with records of the meeting. I'm advised by the Inspector of Election that the holders
of shares representing at least the majority of the voting power of our Class A and
Class B common stock voting together as a single class are present or represented
by proxy here today. And the requisite quorum to conduct business is therefore
present. Accordingly, this meeting is authorized to transact the business set forth in
our proxy statement.
We have 8 proposals to consider at this meeting, each of which is described in the
proxy statement. We'll discuss these proposals momentarily. First, however, I will
remind you that, today, voting is by proxy and written ballot. If you've already sent in
a proxy, you do not need -- and do not intend to change your vote, there is no need
for you to cast a ballot today. Your vote will be counted automatically without any
further action on your part. However, any stockholder present who has not turned in
a proxy or who wishes to change their vote may cast a ballot at this meeting. Does
any stockholder wish to cast a ballot today? Great. If so, raise your hand. And one of
our volunteers will bring one to you.
Okay. It is currently 11:06. And the polls are now open. You may vote at any time
during our discussion of the proposals on the agenda. Once you ﬁlled out your
ballot, please raise your hand in the air. And our volunteers will come and collect it.
I will now review the proposals to be voted on at this meeting. The ﬁrst item of
business is to elect our Board of Directors to serve until our next annual meeting or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal. The director-nominees are: Marc
Andreessen, Erskine Bowles, Kenneth Chenault, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Reed
Hastings, Sheryl Sandberg, Peter Thiel and Mark Zuckerberg. The qualiﬁcations of
each proposed director are set forth in the proxy statement. No other director-
nominees have been properly submitted for election pursuant to our bylaws or SEC
rules. Therefore, no other nominations may be accepted at this time. The Board of
Directors recommends a vote for the election of each of the nominated directors.
The second item of business is to ratify the...

we'll have management on the stage. And we do welcome everyone to ask
questions or make statements at that time.

Page 4 of 28Christine Joann JantzFinally, we've received 6 stockholder proposals that complied with the requirements
of our bylaws and SEC rules and, therefore, are eligible to be voted on at this
meeting. The Board of Directors recommends a vote against each of proposals 3
through 8. Each stockholder proponent may now make a statement in support of
their proposal. I will call you up one by one to one of the microphones. Please limit
your statements to no more than 3 minutes. First, for Proposal 3, which is the
proposal regarding a change in stockholder voting, Christine Jantz will be speaking
on behalf of NorthStar Asset Management. Ms. Jantz? Oh, my gosh.
{BIO 18778582 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Christine Jantz from NorthStar Asset Management of
Boston, beneﬁcial owner of 37,758 shares of Facebook common stock. Fellow
shareholders, I am here to represent resolution #3, a good governance proposal
about equal voting rights. This proposal has never been as crucial as this year given
the highly concerning issues our company is currently facing. As shareholders, we do
not like reading news that states, "Facebook believes that the data of up to 87 million
people was improperly shared with a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica." So
if privacy is a human right, as stated by Microsoft's CEO, then we contend that
Facebook's poor stewardship of customer data is tantamount to a human rights
violation. We must remember that, as of last week, the EU General Data Protection
Regulation went into eﬀect, which will clearly aﬀect Facebook's business in Europe.
Government regulation is necessary. But it is not suﬃcient when management fails.
Facebook's management and board have consistently minimized our input as
shareholders by reducing our voting rights. The Cambridge Analytica scandal is an
egregious example of when a board is formed by a CEO to meet his needs, primarily
insiders or other aﬃliated people rather than truly independent directors who will
provide proper management oversight to protect shareholder investment. Given the
existing share structure, the current status of shareholder outrage against the
company board can have no corrective action. Despite the fact that board member
Peter Thiel is directly connected to Cambridge Analytica, it's mathematically
impossible for non-entitled shareholders to vote down Mr. Thiel's nomination.
Shareholders cannot even assume that management will take action when it sees an
overwhelmingly high vote by others and insiders against a management proposal or
board member as evidenced by our company's attempt to create a third class of
stock despite outsider common shareholders' vote against it in 2016.
Soon, you will hear a shareholder proposal about risk oversight committee, an issue
that is clearly vital to our company right now. But even if every single outside
shareholder vote is in favor of that proposal, it will still fail if Mr. Zuckerberg votes
against it. We are at a vital impasse for our company. We are faced right now with a
situation for which Facebook clearly does not have the expertise to manage. Yet, if
these crucial governance proposals fail, shareholders will have no assurance that
management will be held accountable or the critical issues will be addressed. My
ﬁrm and our colleagues have been bringing this issue to Facebook shareholders for
years. And clearly, the recent scandals exemplify the need for the shareholder rights
overhaul. Shareholders, we urge you to vote for proxy item #3.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

Will J. Lana{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Great. Thank you. Next, for Proposal 4, which is proposal regarding a risk oversight
committee, William Lana will be speaking on behalf of Trillium Asset Management.
Mr. Lana?
{BIO 18464073 <GO>}
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, fellow shareholders. My name
is Will Lana. And I'm here on behalf of Trillium Asset Management and Park
Foundation to hereby move item #4, seeking a report discussing the merits of
establishing a risk oversight board committee. Facebook could beneﬁt from putting
into place a board committee structure to meet the unique challenges and demands
it faces. It is not necessary or helpful to read oﬀ a list of controversies facing
Facebook. We all know what that list looks like. We have identiﬁed at least 15 distinct
controversies. Suﬃce to say, the list is long. And the list is serious. Accordingly, the
risk that the company and its shareholders face are profound and real. It is evident to
us that Facebook's piggybacking of risk oversight onto the audit committee no
matter how well utilized is not up to the task. The purpose of the audit committee is
to focus on ﬁnancial reporting processes, not on big-picture risk oversight. The
board statement on the proposal says the audit committee has, "The appropriate
time and resources to oversee risk exposure." But we must ask ourselves, if the audit
committee does have the time and resources to oversee these issues, why is the list
of controversies confronting Facebook so long and so serious? The proof of the
current structure's inadequacy is on display in the daily headlines. It's worth noting
that the lack of a board risk committee is just one of several signs that risk oversight
is downplayed on Facebook's board. For example, conspicuously absent from
lengthy corporate governance guidelines published to Facebook's website is any
mention of risk. The board -- bios for the directors also do not mention risk, nor does
any director have explicit risk management expertise.
Being put forward today is a commonsense ﬁx to prioritize risk, an approach The
Conference Board and Harvard Law School Forum generally considered good
governance. ISS, the proxy adviser service, recommending a vote in favor of Item 4
calls our request reasonable, acknowledging the sheer volume of Facebook's
controversies and observing that, "Shareholders would beneﬁt from more
information about proactive steps the board has taken to reform its risk
management process to ensure the company is proactively assessing and mitigating
risks."
I think it is apparent to everyone that 2018 is a pivotal year for Facebook.
Considerable money and resources have been diverted to multiple eﬀorts that
address a litany of problems. This is all well and good. But to be eﬀective, these
reactive measures must be paired with a proactive improvement to Facebook's
fundamental risk oversight. Let us not miss this opportunity to make a simple yet a
powerful change that will go a long way towards laying a foundation for a successful
future, a successful future not only for the company and its shareholders. But for
Facebook's users and communities around the world. Thank you for your time and
attention and for your support of Item 4.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

Natasha L. Lamb{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Thank you. Next, for Proposal 5, a proposal regarding a simple majority vote, (James
McRitchie) will be speaking on behalf of the proposal.
Super majority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most
shareholders. But opposed by board seeking entrenchment. Most S&P 500 and
even S&P 1500 companies have no super majority requirements. Mark Zuckerberg
and associates own 89% of Class B shares or 60% of total voting power. However, a
provision of the charter speciﬁes that when class B common shares represent less
than a majority of total voting power, bylaw will still require at least 2/3 of the voting
power of the company. Therefore, even if those shares are sold oﬀ or converted as
requested by NorthStar's Proposal #3, super majority vote requirements could still
impede shareholder action. A simple majority standard will give shareholders an
equal and fair representation in the company by limiting the power of shareholders
who own a large stake.
Facebook is clearly a trendsetting company with tremendous inﬂuence over our
nation, as evidenced by the most recent presidential election. Will our country be
increasingly headquartered to corporate dictatorships? Will corporate dictatorships
support a strong, democratic government in here, in these United States of America?
Or will they continue to seek short-term power and proﬁts for the few at the expense
of conditions that favor the long-term broader interests of all their shareholders and
users? How shareholders -- how shares are voted today at Facebook on NorthStar's
Proposal #3 to recapitalize the company and our Proposal #5 to move to a simple
majority vote could send a clear message. Even if its votes were strictly tied to its
economic stake, Mr. Zuckerberg and other class B shareholders would still wield
considerable power. Turning around corporate governance at Facebook could
dramatically enhance the reputation of our company and Mr. Zuckerberg as well as
providing a higher probability that cumbersome regulations can be minimized.
George Washington was encouraged to continue as president for life. But stepped
down for the good of the country. Mr. Zuckerberg could take a page from history,
emulate George Washington, not Vladimir Putin. Vote for Proposals #3 and 5 make
Facebook more democratic and accountable.

Page 7 of 28David Kling
Natasha L. LambMy name is Natasha Lamb. I'm here to move Proposal #6 on behalf of Arjuna Capital
and co-ﬁlers, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the Illinois
State Treasurer. We're asking our company to publish a report on corporate content
governance. From political subterfuge, fake news, hate speech and sexual
harassment, it is clear that content that violates Facebook's own terms of service
poses a risk to the company's market value and brand. Last year, at this very meeting,
we highlighted the risk posed by fake news propagated over the platform. And while
our board opposed reporting, we learned six months later and only through
congressional testimony that 126 million Americans may have viewed Russian
propaganda prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Four months later, we
learned that 87 million Americans' data was compromised by Cambridge Analytica
with the intent to manipulate users for political gain. In the wake of that scandal,
Facebook's market value dropped nearly $100 billion. And while today's proposal is
broader, I'm surprised to see a similar reaction from our board, a recommendation to
vote against greater transparency and accountability to investors. Fines and
regulation by governments, lost advertising revenue and a soured brand may further
impact investment returns. In fact, users may leave the social media platform if they
feel its content lacks integrity. A recent poll indicates fewer than half of Americans
trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws. And proxy adviser, ISS, has noted the
company's failure to protect its users' privacy has eroded the level of trust among
users, calling into question the company's business model and its governance.
Turning to the era of MeToo and TIME'S UP, Facebook has not adequately addressed
the role of social media in perpetuating sexual harassment. According to Pew, 8 in 10
young women believe online sexual harassment is a major problem. And Facebook's
platform has been criticized for sexual harassment policies that failed to protect
women. Facebook's ability to proactively assess its content governance, reporting
mechanisms and enforcement capabilities will inform how successfully the social
platform will navigate a complex landscape. Yet, disclosures have been inadequate.
And content policy is reactive, not proactive. In a recent interview, Mr. Zuckerberg
admitted, "Frankly, we didn't spend enough time investing in or thinking through
some of the downside uses of the tool." Today, we are asking for a more forward-
looking, transparent and accountable approach.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Thank you. And for Proposal 7, a proposal regarding median pay by gender, Ms.
Lamb will again be speaking on behalf of Arjuna Capital.
{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Again, my name is Natasha Lamb. And I move Proposal #7 on behalf of Arjuna
Capital and Baldwin Brothers, Inc. asking for a report on gender pay equity. This is
the third year this proposal has gone to a vote. Yet, reporting remains limited to
qualitative assurances rather than a quantitative approach adopted by peers. In
Arjuna Capital's recent gender pay disclosure scorecard, Facebook earned a failing
grade across 9 metrics. The median income for women working full time in the
United States is 80% of that earned by men, a gap that is not expected to close for
40 years. Of note, the gap for African-American and Latino women is wider at 60%FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 8 of 28David Kling
Unidentiﬁed Participantand 55%, respectively. Gender and intersecting racial pay inequity represent a
structural barrier to diverse leadership, posing a risk to company's performance and
investor returns. Of particular note, the United Kingdom now mandates disclosure of
median gender pay gap. In the U.S., investor engagement has thus far led to
disclosures not on median pay but statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work
numbers, assessing the pay of men and women performing similar jobs. Facebook
says they pay men and women fairly on this basis. But unlike peers, they do so in the
absence of quantitative backing. And while U.S. peers have taken a good ﬁrst step
towards disclosure, the equal pay for equal work number alone fails to address how
discrimination aﬀects diﬀerences in opportunity. That is, it does not reﬂective the bias
in the jobs women hold. The median pay gap reﬂects a structural deﬁcit when men
hold the majority of higher paying jobs.
Facebook published and reported the median pay gap for its United Kingdom
operations that it's near 10%. But it has not published the global median pay gap
requested by today's proposal. PayScale reports Facebook has a mean pay gap of
18%, over $20,000. Top proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, recommend
support for this proposal noting, "The equal pay for equal work statistic does not
address the reported systemic bias that has resulted in the low number of women
compared to men employed at the company, particularly the low number of women
compared to men in technical and senior leadership roles, which tend to have
higher pay. A vote for this resolution is warranted by reporting gender pay gap
statistics similarly as is required to do in the U.K. Facebook could provide
shareholders with a better gauge of how its diversity initiatives are improving
opportunities for women." Our company is best served by a proactive approach to
address this structural bias, quantitative reporting and goals to close the median
gender pay gap. Thank you.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Thank you. Finally, for Proposal 8, a proposal regarding tax principles, (Gary
Coleman) will be speaking on behalf of the AFL-CIO Reserve Fund. (Mr. Coleman)?
Actually, it's (Richard Phillips) presenting. But I'm here to present on Item 8 on behalf
of the AFL-CIO, a proposal to request that the board articulate a set of responsible
global tax principles that ensure that the company pays taxes where value is actually
created, ensure that these tax principles are aligned with Facebook's stated goals
regarding sustainability and consider the economic and reputational impact of
Facebook's global tax strategies. The company's stated principle of complying with
existing tax law is noble. But a commitment to leave a compliance alone is clearly not
enough to ensure that the company's tax principles are aligned with the desired
sustainability and transparency goals, nor has it resulted in tax practices that do not
cause reputational harm to the company. The company has already been caught up
in multinational tax scandals in the U.K. and the U.S. and is investing signiﬁcant time
and resources into a legal battle with the IRS. In fact, Facebook has already
acknowledged that it could owe somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion in
additional taxes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 9 of 28David KlingScandal is not good for the company's bottom line. Trying to increase proﬁt through
tax-avoidance strategies provide an inaccurate picture of the company's ﬁnancial
performance and health and doesn't make up for the reputational damage and
losses resulting from the scandals. Growth in new membership and engagement are
currently expected to decline. The loss of young users in recent years and loss of U.S.
users' trust in following the Cambridge Analytica scandal has been widely covered in
the media. Another tax scandal could result in even greater losses of users and
reputation, which reduce the attractiveness of the platform to advertisers, the
company's almost sole source of revenue.
The tax-avoidance strategies used by Facebook and other companies have attracted
attention from governments and policymakers here and in Europe, who face rising
public pressure to end such practices. As tax laws change and enforcement
increases, the possibility of large ﬁnes and interest payments may also increase. A set
of responsible tax principles will help, the board more easily adapts strategies as
laws change, avoiding or limiting ﬁnes and interest payments and putting the
company ahead of the curve by reducing uncertainty caused by changes in tax laws
and enforcement. Corporate tax avoidance has resulted in the loss of tens of billions
of dollars from U.S. revenue and across countries around the world, which has
devastating impact in many communities. Facebook is about building and
connecting communities. Shouldn't its tax practices contribute to that goal? We urge
you to vote in favor of this.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Thank you for your statements. The company will not be providing statements at this
meeting as the company's position on each proposal has already been set forth in
the proxy statement.
We will now be collecting any remaining ballots. Please raise your ballots. And our
volunteers will come around to collect them.
It will just take a minute or 2 -- or a second or 2 to collect the ballots. Got one over
there, I think.
One more. One more.
(Voting)
Okay. All votes have been cast on the proposals to be considered at this meeting.
And as of 11:28, the polls are now closed. I will now confer with the Inspector of
Election and report on the preliminary results of the voting.
So based on the preliminary report from the Inspector of Election, the vote required
to approve Proposal 1 is a plurality of the voting power of our Class A and B common
stock voting together as a single class. And again, based on the results tabulated on
a preliminary fashion by the Inspector of Election, each of the 8 nominees has beenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

8 is the majority of the voting power of the Class A and Class B common stock voting
together as a single class, in each case, properly cast for or against the proposal.
Based on the preliminary results tabulated by the Inspector of Election, Proposal 2
has been approved by at least the requisite majority of the votes cast. And Proposals
3 through 8 have been rejected by at least the requisite majority of the votes cast.
Final results of the voting will be ﬁled with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on a Form 8-K within 4 business days.
There are no other items of business on the agenda. So this concludes the formal
part of our meeting. The annual meeting is now adjourned.
Now before I ask Mark to come to the stage, I want to remind you that Mark's
remarks and the Q&A that follows may contain forward-looking statements
regarding future events and the future ﬁnancial performance of the company. We
caution you to consider the important risk factors that could cause actual results to
diﬀer materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risk factors are
more fully detailed under the caption Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-
Q ﬁled with the SEC on April 26, 2018. In addition, any forward-looking statements
that we make today are based on assumptions as of this date. And we undertake no
obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future
events. Mark?
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
All right. Thanks for all coming out. How are you doing this morning? Thank you. So
this is -- a lot has happened since the last year when we were here. And we faced a
number of important issues I want to get through in just a minute. But before talking
about that, despite the important issues that we faced, our continue -- our
community and our business continued to grow really well. Now more than 2.2
billion people use Facebook every month around the world. More than 1.4 billion
people use Facebook every day. And that doesn't even include the work that we're
doing with WhatsApp and Instagram as well on top of that. In addition, the business
continues to grow. In Q1, the business grew by about 49% in revenue to more than
$12 billion in revenue. So that shows a lot of good continued momentum and that
we're continuing to serve a lot of businesses around the world well.
Now when I think about where we are now as a company, the big theme that we're
focused on is making sure that we take a broader view of our responsibility to
everyone we serve, the people in our community, the businesses we serve, the
communities around us. And when I look back at the company's focus for the last
decade or so, we've often focused on all the good that connecting people and
technology can bring. And there's a lot, right? As these services have grown around
the world, people have gotten powerful new tools to stay connected with people
they care about, right? In terrible situations, like in Hurricane Harvey, people were
able to come together and raise tens of millions of dollars to -- for the relief eﬀorts
and to help their fellow people in their community. And one of the things that we're
most proud of is that there are more than 70 million small businesses around the
world who use our tools to grow and to create jobs. And in polls that we've done,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 11 of 28more than half of folks have told us that they're now hiring more people because of
their use of Facebook's tools. So that's all good.
But at the same time, I think it's also clear that over the last several years, we didn't
do enough to be proactive in looking at how people could try to abuse these tools
as well. And that goes for a lot of the things that we've all been reading about and
thinking about, whether that's fake news or interference in elections or having app
developers making sure they don't misuse people's information in ways that people
don't want.
So the main thing that we need to do right now is make sure that we take a broader
view of what our responsibility is to our community, not just reacting when issues
come up but being more proactive about going out and making sure that there's
less of bad content in the system, making sure that it's harder for any kind of nation-
states interfering in anyone else's election and making sure that all of the app
developers who signed up to use our system are getting reviewed before they --
their apps go live and that we'll work proactively auditing more of the work to make
sure that all the people in our system are doing good work. So that's what we're
going to do. And we've dramatically increased the investment that we're making in
security and use diﬀerent kinds of investment. So much so that we expect that the
dramatic increase in security investments is going to aﬀect our proﬁtability going
forward. But we believe that, that is the right thing to do for our community and will
serve both our community and our business better over the long term. So we feel
good about that and feel like that is clearly the right thing to do.
I want to walk through for a couple of minutes some of the speciﬁc things that we're
doing to be more proactive. On the content side, we're -- whether we're talking
about issues like fake news or hate speech or governments trying to interfere an
election, the road map is to just be more proactive in reviewing the content. So
instead of -- what we've done historically if people share what they want. And then
people can -- if you see something bad in -- on the surface, you ﬂag it and we look at
it reactively. We're now investing a lot more in building AI tools to go out and be
able to proactively ﬁnd problematic content. And one of the areas that we're really
proud of is that if you take terrorist content, for example, 99% of the ISIS and Al
Qaeda-related content that we take down is ﬂagged by our AI systems now before
any person in our community gets to it and ﬂags it for us. So we think that it's
possible to have that kind of good result across a broader number of areas as well.
We, by the end of this year, are going to have more than 20,000 people at the
company working on security and content review. And we're rolling out other kinds
of tools, like the terrorist-related tool that I just mentioned, to make sure that it's
harder to spread fake news and for governments to interfere as well. And in rolling
those out, we've already started to see better results in diﬀerent elections, including
the French presidential election, the German election, the Alabama special election
in the last year, where we've been able to take down tens of thousands of fake
accounts that could have been trying to do sketchy things.
In addition to being more proactive about governing and managing the content,
we're also very focused on being more transparent. So that way, we can, on a regularFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 12 of 28cadence, be reporting to the world on the types of bad content that we're ﬁnding,
whether it's violent content or hate speech or fake accounts. We started rolling out
these transparency reports, including one in the last month that just highlighted the
dramatic increase of attempts that we're seeing to create fake accounts on the
service. In the last quarter alone, we took down more than 500 million fake accounts
that were created, mostly the vast majority of which within minutes of being created
or during the process to create them. So it's a big eﬀort that we need to do to push
on that and make sure that the community stays safe and that we can keep people
safe. And we think that working on transparency is going to be a good way to how
people in the community judge our progress towards this and hold us accountable
for what we're doing. We also think that transparency is going to be helpful for
holding advertisers and other folks in our ecosystem accountable, too. So one of the
things that we're doing, especially on the political side to make sure that people
aren't trying to advertise in elections in ways that violate the law or our community
standards, we're going to make it so that here, now, every person who's trying to
advertise and run political ads or issue ads needs to be veriﬁed. Or if you're running
a big page that has a lot of followers, you'll need to have your identity veriﬁed by
sharing with us a government ID. So that we know you're not a fake account who is
trying to spread bad content. So those kind of transparency eﬀorts, verifying and
making sure that the ads, content that people run, that now anyone can go look at all
the ads that a page are running, those kind of steps are going to make it harder for
bad actors in the system to interfere or spread bad content. And we think that that's
going to have a very positive eﬀect in making the service better for people who use
it and having a broader and more positive impact on society overall.
So I wanted to make sure I hit those points upfront because that's so important and
it's so much of what we're focused on now. And I'm happy to take more questions on
that when we go to Q&A in a minute.
But before we do that, I also want to talk about some of the things that we're doing
to keep building going forward. Because right now, I feel like our biggest
responsibility is keeping people safe and interrupting some of these issues. But we
also have a responsibility to keep building new ways for people to connect in new
meaningful ways. I mean, that's what people ultimately rely on us for and why they
come to our services and the unique value that we provide. So we need to make
sure that we keep doing that, too. So we're doing that across all of the apps and
things that we're building.
In Facebook, for the app, the main focus is on helping people connect more with
their friends and family and building communities. We've changed the way the News
Feed works to highlight more friends and family content and prioritize interactions
and conversations rather than just passively consuming viral videos and content that
can take a lot of your time. We're focused on building communities and helping
people ﬁnd communities on Facebook that are going to be meaningful to them,
whether that's a group for new parents or people who might share a disease that
you have or some other interest you have, whether that's around volunteering or
coming together in some way. A lot of the groups that people join on Facebook are -
- a lot of people tell us they're some of the most meaningful parts of their experience
there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

Page 13 of 28A - David KlingOn Instagram, a lot of the focus is on just helping people capture any moment that
they want. Stories on Instagram are growing incredibly quickly. It's been extremely
successful. I think that there's a huge opportunity to continue growing that new
format for just sharing video and photos throughout your day. And in general, that's
going really well.
WhatsApp around the world is just -- it continues to grow extremely quickly between
WhatsApp and Messenger, our 2 messaging services. People now send almost 100
billion messages every day. So that is dramatically bigger than the global volume of
SMS. People love these services. People love the security and the encryption on
WhatsApp. People really like the features and the ability to share in rich ways on
Messenger. And we're going to keep building those out as well. And while we focus
on messaging, a big part of the trend that we're seeing is that people don't just like
texting each other, they really like video chat, right? That's, I think, a really important
trend for the future and across WhatsApp and Messenger and now Instagram, where
we're rolling that out, too. It's going to be billions of minutes every day. People are
going to be able to not just call someone, hear their voice. But be able to see the
person that they're talking to. And I don't know about you guys and how you've used
this. But I know when I'm traveling, it just makes a huge diﬀerence to me to be able
to see my kids when I call home at night. And that just makes a big diﬀerence to me.
And we hear similar feedback from a lot of people around the world who use this.
So I want to make sure we have enough time to get to Q&A. So I'm going to wrap
up. But it is a really important time for our community and our business and for the
company. We face a number of important issues. We're going to make sure that we
take a broader view of our responsibility, a more proactive approach to managing
and making sure that the content and app developers who are interacting in the
community are abiding by our standards. And at the same time, we also feel a
responsibility to keep building the next generation of new experiences that are
going to help us all connect in meaningful new ways. And that's going to be the plan
for the next period of time. And I thank you all for being our shareholders and
supporting us and being along for this journey to do something that I think is really
important in the world. So thank you.

take the ﬁrst question from Reverend Jackson.
{BIO 14009902 <GO>}
Good morning. Let me express my thanks to you, Mark. And to Sheryl. Today, we
respect your integrity and your intent, question of judgment (is -- connect to)
inclusion. We've globalized technology. But not globalize human rights, workers'
rights, women and children rights, (environmental security) must globalize. Unless
we do, we'll ﬁnd ourselves in a big hole. The leadership more diverse on boards of
election -- on boards a few years ago, going from 3 to 20 in the last ﬁve years. I want
to thank you for putting tension on the most able businessmen on the board, brings
about a lot of experience that will be a value to the company. But beyond the board,
the C suites, the top 15 employees are white. And that does not represent a random.
It represents some lack of intention now to be inclusive. We now know that at stake
here is elections. And while there's a big focus on the national election out of
Washington, many of us lose or win based on 5,000 votes, not 5 million votes. The
question becomes, are we secured in the next -- in the 2018 election and
congressional elections and then state elections? We know that the Russians sought
to undermine the system last time around. And that had some impact. Has that
impact been eliminated this time around? And it seems that everybody seem to
accept the present. We all must care about this. We really brought dialogue today.
There's a sense of urgency now about the integrity of our election, the integrity of
our election that we globalize human rights as we have globalized technology.
Thank you very much.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Thank you. We appreciate your commitment as a shareholder and always coming to
our meetings. The -- I'm going to talk about the election issue. And then I think we
have an announcement today that we want to make on diversity, which Sheryl will
speak to. On -- the election integrity issue is one of the most important issues that we
face and that we need to make sure that we deliver on. There's no doubt that in
2016, we were slow as a company in identifying the kind of misinformation
operations that Russia tried to run. We were looking for more traditional types of
cyber attacks, like traditional kinds of hacking and phishing of people's accounts.
And we found a lot of those. And we notiﬁed people. But we weren't tracking this
new threat. And since then, it has been a big wake-up call. And we've invested a
huge amount in building AI tools and stepping up the new content review and
making a lot of the systems more transparent around the ads that people run. And
the thing that gives me a lot of conﬁdence going into 2018 is that there have been a
number of important elections since the 2016 election where we've seen adversaries
try to do similar attacks. And we've been much more successful at being able to
thwart them. So I mentioned in my opening comments the French presidential
election, the German national election, the Alabama Special Election in the last year.
And those were all elections where we saw people trying to spread bad content and
where our AI systems were able to identify and proactively take down tens of
thousands of fake accounts before they can do anything that would be a problem. At
the same time, we're taking more proactive steps as well around partnering with
election commissions and countries. So a lot of the issues that we noticed in
Germany were ﬂagged by the German government and the election commissionFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg
A - Elliot Schrage
A - Sheryl Kara Sandbergthere. So that's an important part of the playbook going forward. And increasing
transparency. So now around advertising, overall, if you're an advertiser and you're
running ads to diﬀerent people and diﬀerent audiences, anyone can now -- will be
able to go to -- when we roll out this tool, the advertiser's page, whether it's a
business or a political actor, can be able to see every single message that, that
advertiser is sending out to diﬀerent audiences. So that will make it much harder for
anyone to be disingenuous and say diﬀerent things to diﬀerent people. That will
hold people more accountable. And on top of that, we're also going to verify the
identities of anyone running political or issue ads, starting in the U.S. and a couple of
countries but then spreading more broadly beyond that, to make sure that it's much
more diﬃcult to have any repeat of the kind of issues that we had seen in the past.
So this is an incredibly important issue. 2018 is a very big election year, not just in the
U.S. for the midterms but around the world. There are big elections in Mexico, in
Brazil, in India coming up in the next year, Indonesia. A number of big elections
around Europe. The EU elections in 2019 coming up. So we are on this. And this is a
really big focus of ours to make sure that now that we're aware of this security threat,
we're going to make it signiﬁcantly harder for anyone to do that in the future. And
the last thing that I do want to say is that these kind of security issues, you never fully
solve them, right? So security is an arms race. And we're going to keep investing in
order to make sure that we stay ahead of these adversaries. But some of the
adversaries that we face are very well funded and very motivated. And it's going to
be a constant battle that we're going to need to keep on pushing on. And we're
never going to be able to just rest on our laurels or say that we've done enough. And
what we're going to do is just need to keep on pushing on. But this is deﬁnitely a
huge focus for us. And given some of the recent results, we feel more conﬁdent
about the path going forward.

Great. Thank you. Let's move to the other aisle and take ﬁrst questions from this side.
{BIO 14001405 <GO>}
Yes. Mr. Chairman, fellow shareholders, my name is Patrick Doherty. And I'm here
today on behalf of New York State Comptroller; Thomas DiNapoli as sole trustee of
the New York State Common Retirement Fund, holder of over 6.6 million Facebook
shares valued at over $1 billion. It's one of our largest holdings. As previously noted,
our fund was a cosponsor of Proposal #6, calling on the company to review and
report on the eﬃcacy of its content management policies. Comptroller DiNapoli
recently pointed out that, "Hundreds of millions of social media users are at risk of
being exposed to fake news, hate speech and sexual harassment if the company
cannot enforce its own user agreements. Unless safeguards are put in place, the
company is at risk of ﬁnancial losses, lawsuits and serious reputational damage.
Facebook needs to confront that its customers and its investors want protection
against abusers of the platform. The company can receive -- can reassure millions of
users by clearly explaining how it will enforce its own terms of service to prevent
sexual harassment, fake news, hate speech and other prohibited behavior on the
platform." Thank you.
{BIO 16033194 <GO>}
So why don't I respond to that? Mark alluded to that in his remarks where he talked
in 2 dimensions, ﬁrst, about the broader sense of responsibility that we have towards
protecting the community that we serve. And the way that we do that is really
through the mechanism that he described. And that was introduced in the
resolution, which is this concept of transparency about telling people what's
happening on our platform and telling people what we're doing about it across all of
these dimensions. And we've taken a lot of steps over the course of the last year.
And particularly even the last few months, in being much more explicit so that
people can see what we're doing and frankly hold us accountable. The 2 biggest
steps that we've really taken have to do with our community standards in terms of --
up until, I think, April of this year, we published a more general sense of our
community standards. It's really our principles by which we deﬁne what a safe
environment is on Facebook. But what we did more recently was we went into much
greater detail of specifying the particular kinds of behaviors, whether it's with
respect to incitement or hate speech, whether it's with respect to other forms of
content that we evaluate and determine are not permitted on our platform. And we
didn't stop there. What we did -- so that was in April. But just earlier this month, just a
couple of weeks ago, we released a transparency report. Now we've done that

ﬁrst time ever, we introduced this idea of being transparent about precisely what
you're asking, how many pieces of content or how much content is prevalent on our
service with respect to hate speech, nudity, violence or other objectionable content
that violates our standards. And we introduced for the ﬁrst time methodologies so
that people can understand how we examine this problem and how we assess our
performance. Now to be sure this is the ﬁrst time the methodologies are evolving
and adapting. And we'll be changing those. But we thought it was essential so that
our shareholders, our users and all of the members of the Facebook community can
understand the steps that we're taking and how we're doing it.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Elliot. Let's come back to this side.
My name is Nell Greenberg. I'm a member of Avaaz. And I'm here representing
millions of people around the world who are concerned by this information. And this
is speciﬁcally a question about false accounts. I really hear you guys trying. I hear that
you're genuine about it. But in your own quarterly report, it shows that false accounts
rose from 3% last year to 4% this year. In 2012, there was a court case that came out
last year that said that your own engineers say that it was a no-brainer to detect and
delete those accounts and that the board directs them not to because of revenue. I
know that your revenue model would incentivize you not to remove all accounts or
bots or duplicate accounts. I know that you -- because governments don't
understand your platform, because citizens don't, you can put forward halfway
measures that halfway deal with this problem. I am asking you, will you direct your
engineers to delete as many of those false accounts as possible to get that number
from 4%, where it's at now, to as close to zero, as you can? And I'm not just talking
about the new accounts that you delete every second. I'm talking about the old
existing accounts. Just 6 Russian accounts were able to inﬂuence billions of people.
So I'm directly asking you, what are you directing your engineers to do now about all
the false accounts still on your site? Thank you. So much. And I really do appreciate
the steps that you've taken so far.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Yes. Just to be clear, we want to delete all of the fake accounts that we see. So I don't
know what the quote was that you just pulled out around saying that we somehow
ﬁnd fake accounts and don't want to delete them. But there's no way that, that's
right. And I want to make sure that, that's clear to people here. And it's going to be
clear -- and it's clear to the people inside our company as well. People don't like fake
accounts. It doesn't help our product. It doesn't help our business. Getting rid of
them is good. We need to do that. And the reason why there is some % of fake
accounts, it's because it is actually quite hard to be perfect at this. As we released in
the transparency report, we were able to take down and stop more than 0.5 billion
fake accounts from being created. The ones that get through, we also have eﬀorts to
try to ﬁnd them once they're in the system. But this is hard stuﬀ. And we have a large
team that's focused on doing this, that's working on very sophisticated AI techniques
to be able to identify what the fake actors are in the system. And when we ﬁnd them,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

Good morning. My name is (Andre Kranell). And I'm a senior at Berkeley High
School. My question for you, Facebook's impending 750,000-square-foot deal of all
Park Tower will make you one of San Francisco's largest tech tenants. How will you
help build housing for your workers since the inventory is low already?
{BIO 16033194 <GO>}
Let me take that. But that's -- it's a great question. We talk about bringing people
together as a corporate mission and building communities. It's also something that
we take incredibly seriously as a company in the real world in terms of the physical
communities. We've been really focused in addressing issues of housing, economic
opportunity. And frankly, also transportation. That began as we built out our
corporate headquarters here in Menlo Park. And it's exactly for that reason that we're
expanding, partly because the space here has been tight. But partly also because we
view the challenges of expanding our headquarters, not as a challenge for Menlo
Park. But it's a real challenge for the Bay Area. And we've really spearheaded -- I'm
actually very proud of the eﬀorts we've made to address housing issues. We've
spearheaded an initiative that began in Menlo Park with our partners right across the
way at East Palo Alto to put together a housing fund focused on aﬀordable housing.
That started out at $18.5 million -- with an $18.5 million commitment from us. That's
now with a partnership of LISC. It is now up to $75 million. We've just added in the
last couple of months a partnership with the San Francisco Foundation. We've got an
additional $1 million from them. Our goal is to address 3 sets of issues. One, to bring
in additional partners on aﬀordable housing from the private sector because we
think the private sector has a huge responsibility. If we are employing people, we
also have to create an environment where they can live and commute easily. So
that's absolutely one. Transportation is another issue, where we've been working
both in the community here. Anybody who lives in Menlo Park knows that traﬃc is a
challenge. We've been working very closely with the city here. It's an issue that we've
work with, frankly, in San Francisco as well with respect to our shuttle buses and
making sure that the shuttle buses cooperate with the SFMTA. And also an economic
opportunity. Because even as we bring the people in for high tech and more
sophisticated jobs, we also want to have people across the income spectrum be able
to beneﬁt from the economic opportunities that are created by us and other tech
companies. I think you'll see that with our new facilities in San Francisco, we will
become even more active in the communities there. Some of the investments and
the funds that we have created for the local area around here are going to expand,
not just for housing. But for community service across the board.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

Mark, I'm -- my name is (Eric Sprague). I'm a shareholder from the Sacramento area.
Last earnings call, you said that messaging is more transactional than feed. And
there was a Bloomberg article this week saying that WhatsApp payments could
transition soon from a pilot program such that it's fully live. So I'd like to know your
thoughts on the landscape there with competitors like Google Pay. But also more
broadly, you've said the goal isn't necessarily payments but helping businesses be
more eﬃcient using messaging. The Philippines example is nice. I'd like to know
about more examples, if you can't go too in depth today, if there's some sources you
could cite that I could read about. Thanks.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Sure. So overall, we think that news feed is good for sharing information broadly. But
in general, if you, as a business, are sharing something in news feed or you're
putting an ad there, then a lot of people are going to see your content. Whereas,
messaging is more one on one, right, by its nature. So if news feed is good for
generating awareness about what your business is doing, then we think that
messaging could be an ideal surface for closing the loop and actually completing
transactions or doing customer support after a transaction or buying more things
after you've already bought something and continuing a relationship that you have
with the business. Payments, they're going to be one part of that. So we don't view
payments as the business itself. But payments are one tool for people and
businesses to be able to do what we think they want to do in these threads, which is
interact around and do transactions. We're certainly working on rolling that out more
broadly. We've gotten good feedback so far on the pilot program in India around
WhatsApp and are optimistic about that. Then -- and for speciﬁc cases around
businesses having success in Messenger, we should follow up and make sure you
get to see this video that we produced for F8 in which -- where we have a number of
our partners talking through F8 at our developer conference, with a bunch of the

Great. Thank you. I think we do not anticipate issuing a report like that right now. But
we thank you for your question.
Over on this side.
Good morning. My name is Justin Danhof, General Counsel with the National Center
for Public Policy Research. Mr. Zuckerberg, you mentioned you have 20,000 or so
employees working on content. You stated before Congress that you don't know the
politics of those individuals and that politics plays no role in hiring decisions here at
Facebook. However, you also said that you are well aware that Silicon Valley is
primarily populated by liberals. You then suggested that you are aware of employee
political bias and try to make sure it does not aﬀect their work. How do you know
their political bias if you don't know their politics? You also said that politics play no
role in what content these individuals decide to remove. I just don't see how all
those things can be true at the same time. In 2016, former employees told Gizmodo
how the company was diminishing conservative voices on your platform. Before
Congress, it was conservatives such as Ted Cruz who continued to complain about
Facebook silencing their voices. And now a group of more than a dozen prominent
conservative organizations have formed a coalition to combat what they see is
Facebook censorship of their voices. Silicon Valley leads often preen about
commitments to diversity inclusion. But I don't think many of you know what that
means. Diversity isn't what someone looks like. It's the sum of what they think, feel
and believe. Perhaps, you should consider actually talking with your employees and
potential hires about their politics. Because when it comes to Silicon Valley, the
region seems to suﬀer from a lack of viewpoint diversity. Hiring a few conservatives
may help balance out the oﬃce and avoid potential groupthink problems. Will you
commit to increasing viewpoint diversity amongst the ranks of Facebook? And what
tangible steps can you take to commit to doing that?
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Sure. So it's really important to me and to the company that Facebook and our
systems are platforms for all diﬀerent ideas. And I know that there are a number of
concerns about that kind of bias. Silicon Valley, I mean, generally, is a very left-
leaning place, right? So without knowing or asking speciﬁc people at Facebook for
their views, I think that, that's a reasonable assumption, is that a lot of the people
who work -- and based on our Silicon Valley headquarters are going to be -- are
going to skew that way. But the people who are doing content review are all aroundFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

have very strict guidelines on how these policies need to be enforced. And if people
aren't doing what the guidelines say, then they're not going to be able to continue
doing that job. So we're very serious about that at the level of content review. Across
the company, I do think that having diﬀerent voices is incredibly important. And we
have a number of people from all diﬀerent political and ideological views on the
board, on the management team and all of the diﬀerent roles. And I do think that,
that is an important aspect of making sure that we represent all the people in our
community well. So we care about this. We're committed to being a platform for all
ideas. I understand the concern that people have. Although I personally view, from
the work that we've done so far and what I've seen in the results, that I don't think
the concerns are necessarily founded, although I understand why -- if people might
have them. And we're certainly committed to being a platform for all ideas.

you've stressed in recent months the changes you and your team are making to
protect data and the privacy of the user. But I wanted to ask if you've explored other
companies' policies and practices such as Snapchat's to use as a model going
forward?
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
So yes, this is a major thing that we think about. And I can give you 2 examples just
from within our own product, right? We can talk about WhatsApp on the one hand
and then Facebook on the other, which have very diﬀerent approaches to basically
using data to deliver a service. There's a core tension, I think, that people face, which
is, on the one hand, I think most people don't want a lot of their data to be out there.
They don't want to give -- they want to give as little of their data to services as
possible. And that's why a service like WhatsApp is built to be encrypted. So we
don't see the message and content that's there. And that's a lot of the value that, I
think, people perceive. At the same time, if people are going to see content and
they're going to see ads, they want the ads to be good, right? So we recently went
through this process of rolling out our ﬂows and settings for GDPR compliance, ﬁrst,
in Europe. And we're going to do it around the world. And one of the settings that
we ask people proactively to make a decision on is, do you want your ads, for how
we do ad targeting, to be informed by the other apps and websites that you use?
People have to proactively make a decision. Yes or no. Do they want that data used?
And the majority, I think we can even say vast majority of people say, yes, they want
that data used. Because if they're going to see ads, you want to see good ads, right?
So I think that this is one of the core questions that society faces and individuals face
across the diﬀerent services that we use, are how do we want our data to be used
and where? In some cases, we may want it to be encrypted so that companies canFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

content in news feed and ads, what we're seeing is people generally want us to be
able to use the full set of available data in order to give them the best experience
possible. This is not a simple issue that's only going to have one answer, which is why
I think that they're going to keep on being questions about this and as we deﬁne
new products. This is going to be a core thing that we need to think about going
forward. But we think about it very deeply as this is a -- just a core part of the value
that we're trying to provide.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Thanks, Mark.
Michael Verdone. I am past President of San Mateo County Association of Realtors.
And I'm a Director for the National Association of REALTORS on Public Policy. I
almost sat down when I heard the young gentleman talk about housing, which is
primarily my question. And yet, when I hear $1 million here, $1 million there, it doesn't
really address the issue. I was thinking $1 million doesn't buy a single-family home
here on the Peninsula. I'd like to know, especially in light of -- you reported that
you're going to be increasing your staﬀ here by almost $30,000 -- excuse me,
30,000 employees, which is pretty much the population of all of Menlo Park. I'd like
to know, what are you going to do to be a lot more proactive in maybe building your
own workforce housing so it takes oﬀ the pressure from housing prices, rentals,
transportation? And I certainly applaud what you're doing with respect to the
Dumbarton project that may be -- existing in transportation. But you need to do
something locally for workforce housing, building your own housing perhaps to
handle these employees. Thank you.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Yes. And just to be clear, we're -- we bought a bunch of land for our oﬃces. And
we're dedicating a bunch of that land to housing. And we got a special allotment to
be able to build housing on that instead. That way, there can be more housing in the
community. And Elliot can take...
{BIO 16033194 <GO>}
Again, I can go on and on and on. It may be -- look, our position is that Silicon Valley
has been this extraordinary engine of economic opportunity. And if we can't solve
the housing and transportation issues, Silicon Valley won't be Silicon Valley. These
companies, like ours, will expand elsewhere. So we feel a real sense of urgency
around that. And you're right that some of the numbers are small. But that's just our
piece contributing. Frankly, those numbers are primarily for aﬀordable housing.
We're working very closely with other developers. And we have the construction in
Menlo Park. We are dedicating resources for mixed-use housing on our campus. Part
of the reason that we've moved facilities to San Francisco is to have a broader
catchment area for housing. But as you suggested with Dumbarton, we see real
opportunities for helping address some of the housing issues by absolutely
transforming the transportation nightmare that exists today. So if we can really getFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

the people who come to Facebook's headquarters already in Menlo Park do not
drive. They come either by shuttle bus. They come by other -- by Caltrans or other
forms of transportation. If we can get a better public transportation, more diﬀerent
kinds of services, including, for example, ferry services, we feel that there are real
opportunities to reduce the extraordinary pressure people feel. And the good news -
- and then the good news is that people are coming together around this. I think
there are -- Google is very focused on this. Genentech is another company we work
extremely closely with. The industry is coming together. Governments are
cooperating in ways they have not before. So again, if you want to talk bigger
dollars, since some of the ballot measures that are up for California, even as regional
measure 3, there are governments that are now focused on providing the resources
necessary. We are late. And frankly, we have been slow. We are actually a relatively
newcomer as a young company at only 15. But I think it is fair to say that we have
really made an investment. And we consider this an existential issue if we're going to
remain a company in Silicon Valley for the long term.
(Charles Aiken Hansen) from Atlanta, Georgia. And I'm a Ph. D. student in
Instructional Technology there at Georgia State University. So regarding
transparency, what qualitative -- sorry, what quantitative and mixed message
research methodologies are you all currently engaging in, in response to the voted-
down proposals which are pitched by or on behalf of the diﬀerent stockholders?
Adjectives and descriptive phrases like big jump, dramatic change are pleasant-
sounding but ultimately meaningless on a grand or pragmatic scale. Although, I
understand there are conﬁdentiality and disclosure agreements, what can be said to
reassure that we, stockholders, are being heard and having our salient concerns
addressed again in response to the voted-down proposals? So I know you
mentioned certain methodologies were being disclosed. So I would like to know
either where are those and then what further disclosure will be made to let us know
that we are being heard.
{BIO 16033194 <GO>}
Sure. With respect to the transparency -- with respect to the content issue, I think my
point is we're doing what's already -- it's not that we're committing to doing it. We
have already begun to do it. And we've done it in 3 ways. We've reported on the
principles that guide our content decisions. We've given the details of the protocols
of how we evaluate content decisions. And so what people -- people can know
exactly what we take down and what we permit. And I have to confess that a lot of
people are critical. They say, "You're going too far and taking down too much stuﬀ
here, or you're not going far enough in these places." But the step that we just went
to in May was to actually give the numbers of the prevalence of these kinds of issues
on our platform. All I was suggesting is it's the beginning. And even if we would have
adopted the report, you have to start somewhere. So even if we had adopted the
resolution, we would simply have begun a process of disclosing. What we're saying
is we've already begun that process. The number is -- it's
facebook.com/transparency (sic) (transparency.facebook.com), I believe, is the
website. If you want to sit and -- if you want to chat afterwards, I can give you a long
list of it. I should say. And again, these are my worlds. So I spent a lot of time on this.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantIt's not limited to the transparency report. We've committed to transparency in
disclosing all of these things.
May I reclarify? So what I mean by transparency is, for instance, the CDC currently
doesn't study gun violence. So what I'm saying is, for instance. And I don't know
what can be said because I don't (inaudible) recording. So for instance, when they
were discussing the gender pay and discrepancy, to my knowledge from reading the
proxy statement, they were talking about just proper reporting and more disclosure
and better analysis and like I said research. So -- but that got voted down. So that's
what I'm trying to say as far as transparency and research into the issues that we are
bringing to light what is happening. Because as of right now, it's just like, "Okay.
Those are voted down."
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Yes. Let me just jump in real quick on that. Sometimes, some of these proposals are
voted down. But that doesn't mean that we don't think that there are important
issues that are discussed. Or in many cases, that doesn't mean that we don't agree
with some of the things that are said on those proposals. Oftentimes, it's just that we
don't necessarily agree or the Board doesn't agree that, that's the best way to
actually implement some of those things. So for example, content governance
report. Having the board issue a one broad report that covers every single content
governance issue on Facebook, that's not necessarily the way that we think it's best
to approach that. We've taken a whole bunch of diﬀerent steps. Elliot has gone
through some of them. He can go on all day. It's literally true. So we are doing
things...

He means that in the nicest possible way.

So I mean, we talked about you're implementing it, you're doing it. But you're not
actually talking to your investors about these issues and asking, "Well what are you
looking for?" Like, these aren't prescriptive proposals. These are fairly broad. Engage
with us on these issues. And we're on the same team. We're looking for win-win here.
So that's all I would say.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
And we agree with that. We do -- we actually -- and we do a number of the things
that you've requested. We actually already do some of those things.
So I want to keep moving so that we can actually get some of the people who've
been waiting in line for 0.5 hours here. I'm going to move over to this side because
the gentleman in front of you just gave up his spot. But...
I'm (Ryan). I'm a senior in high school, proud owner of 2 whole shares. And I'm just --
I think it's amazing that Facebook's platform is used for so many diﬀerent purposes
and in so many diﬀerent contexts. But I noticed the company, for some reason, hasn't
made a lot of headway in the professional networking area. And I was wondering if
you guys consider LinkedIn to be a competitor. And if so, in what ways are you
chipping away at their market share?
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
So I would say -- I don't think -- I don't consider LinkedIn to be one of our more
direct competitors. But we are trying to help people ﬁnd jobs through Facebook.
And I don't have the exact stats oﬀ the top of my head. But we started this eﬀort in
the last year. So basically, it makes us that -- all of the businesses have pages, right?
And I mentioned before there are more than 70 million small businesses around the
world that use the platform and have pages, can list the jobs that they want to hire
for. And people can go search for those. And I think what we're seeing is something
like -- it was a very large number. I don't want to get this wrong. Do you...

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantI think it was hundreds of thousands.
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
Yes. That was what I remember, too. So hundreds of thousands, I think, in the U.S.,
right, of people who are basically ﬁnding jobs through these job listings. So that is --
we consider this to be an early product. It might not be exactly the same types of
jobs that people network for on LinkedIn. But we think that this is a really important
way that we can help small businesses. And businesses continue to grow, that we
can help connect people with real opportunities and contribute to the economy and
to the communities that we live in more broadly. So we're very focused on that. But
more just as a way to provide value for the community than as some kind of
competitive strategy that we have.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
And I'll add one thing because it's one of the things I think we're most proud of,
which is that all of these tens of millions of small businesses around the world, we've
been surveying them both externally and internally for a long time. And about half of
them will say that they are actually hiring people because of the growth they're
getting from using our platform. So when you add that up, we put out report after
report. But there are millions of jobs being created by these small businesses. And
they're not tech jobs. This is your local bakery, your local ﬂorist, your local plumber,
who is able to hire and grow and both ﬁnd those people on Facebook to the
product Mark was speaking. But more broadly, ﬁnd the demand because they have
customers who are going on Facebook. And so we believe very deeply in the
responsibility we have to communities. You've heard about some of that in housing.
Probably, the area we probably contribute the most is in creating small businesses
and in helping businesses hire people all over the world. And that's the majority of
jobs. The majority of jobs around the world is not large companies. It's small. So it's
an area we are very focused and I think seeing real impact.
{BIO 19444861 <GO>}
Great. All right. Last question. I know there's a couple of people who are in line who
didn't get a chance to ask a question. If you still want to ask a question, please ﬁnd
one of our volunteers. Write down your question. And we'll work to get an answer, or
email it to investor@fb.com. And we'll work to get back to you.
Thank you very much for the -- let me start oﬀ by saying thank you. Thank you for the
environment. Thank you for the opportunity to ask my question. For context, my wife
was the ﬁrst director of marketing at Facebook back into 2005. I spent the last 10
years teaching doctors how to use Facebook as a tool and how to teach their
communities how Facebook can be healthy for you. My question is, it feels by
watching what's been going on for the past year, let's just say, that most of the
marketing, most of the messaging has been very defensive. And my question is, why
not be more proactive to teach businesses how to create meaningful content and
really teach consumers, users of the platform, how they really are in much more
control of what they see in the news feed by choosing who they accept as friends, byFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-05-31

A - David Klingbeing able to curate it. So that much more responsibility gets back to them as
opposed to what feels as both a shareholder and a consumer that the media just
keeps punching Facebook as if it's all Facebook's fault, which I don't think it is. So my
question is, why not more messaging to let people know that they have much more
control of what they actually see in their news feed?
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
I think we need to do that. And that's certainly part of it. But we're a company that, I
think, just takes a lot of responsibility when we see issues. And right now, there is a
lot of criticism about the company. And I don't agree with all of it. But I think some of
it is really fair in pointing out a lot of issues where we should have been doing a
better job and where we're now committed to doing a better job. And as building --
it's kind of the culture that we want to build here. I want us to be a company that,
ﬁrst, takes ownership of issues and deals with our stuﬀ before going out and asking
other people to take responsibility for their part. But I do think you're right that this is
shared. And I think that as we move towards the end of the year and into next year,
we'll have really made a lot of progress on solving and really just moving forward on
a lot of the issues that have been ﬂagged. And that's our commitment and what
we're going to focus on doing.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
And we also have done, to your suggestion, many things that tell people the controls
they have. So for example, we published into the top of News Feed, here are all the
apps you're connected to and an easy way to delete them. Taking the GDPR
controls. And we'll be rolling those out across the world, those do exactly what
you're saying, which they give consumers the ability. When you look at our ad tools,
you can go to any ad you see and you can see why am I seeing this ad and I don't
want advertising from those advertisers. So you are right that while we're very
focused on taking responsibility, we also are as part of that building tools that show
consumers -- a lot of these are controls they've actually had for a long time. But we
need to make them easier to use, easier to understand. You've seen a lot of that from
us. And you're going to continue seeing it. So...
{BIO 15103277 <GO>}
And more.
{BIO 15339456 <GO>}
And more. Good suggestion. And we are working on that as well.
