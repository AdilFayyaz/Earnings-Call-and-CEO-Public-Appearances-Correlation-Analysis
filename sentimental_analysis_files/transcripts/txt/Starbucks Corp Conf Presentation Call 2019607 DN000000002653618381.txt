{BIO 16056418 <GO>}
Good morning everyone. I'm going get us kicked oﬀ here this morning. My name is
Deb Schoneman, I'm President of Piper Jaﬀray. And I just want to welcome you all to
the 39th year of our Legacy Consumer Conference. And each year, I feel like it kid,
more and more special we've have an amazing group of senior analysts, who've
been working together for 10 years. Who, I think keep ﬁnding new and creative ways
to bringing this conference to you each year. Really I would say the foundation's are
really thoughtful research, our analysts are bringing together really world class
companies frequently and whether it's large or small, public or private and you really
see that here today.
One of things that we're excited about, you notice that the name of this conference
is titled consumer marketplace. We're really bringing together brands and products
and services to you that you can actually consume. You're on the second ﬂoor
through our marketplace. One of things we're excited about over the last few years,
the number of participating companies in this conference has doubled and so we
continue to see it expand and we're so appreciative of the opportunity that we are
able to create this platform to allow companies and emerging industries really to tell
their story.
Now, see from the schedule, there's a number of panels today and just a couple of
items that I would highlight just to give you a quick preview. You're going to hear
leading companies discuss the growing importance of really environmental, social
and governance and incorporating that into your business models. You will hear
about new technology shaping the way restaurants operate both from the front to
the back of the house, and really an entire track that you're dedicated to global
opportunities in the cannabis industry. So I just want to thank both the presenting
companies as well as all of our investing clients for attending today. And I just want
to wish you a great day both learning and exploring.
And with that, I will turn it over to Nicole Miller Regan. Thank you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-06

Thank you for that introduction. So it's my pleasure to introduce Pat Grismer. He is
the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer of Starbucks. He joined the
Company last year and he has a very accomplished ﬁnancial background. It spans 25
years with many prominent restaurant leisure companies, such as Hyatt and Yum!
Brands and Disney. Thanks, Pat, for coming.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Delighted to be here.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
So, how fun is it now to be at Starbucks, and what does the brand mean to you
personally?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, it's a tremendous thrill. We all know that Starbucks is a global iconic brand, a
very special brand in the minds of consumers. And I've been a fan of the brand for
many decades now. So to have the opportunity to be part of the leadership team
that is charting the next leg of growth from one of the world's most admired brands
is truly a privilege.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
Starbucks is very much a growth company. In the last call, you and Kevin very well
outlined that Starbucks as a portfolio investment model. And this involves the
variable approaches to company ownership, licensing and franchising in diﬀerent
territories. So how has Starbucks captured best practices for development pretty
much in a way that you experienced at your other global companies in terms of
expansion?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, Starbucks has very much embraced the model of stimulating international
development through partnerships, largely through the establishment of
relationships with large well-capitalized licensors, who share our passion for the
Starbucks plan. And what we found and this is consistent with my experience at
other consumer-facing companies that have a global footprint is that local partners
understand local consumers. And they can, in many ways, help to accelerate the
pace of development for us in countries around the world. But at the same time, we
also recognize the importance of attaining the ownership in countries that have a
favorable proﬁle economically for us.
So, that's one of the reasons why alongside the U.S., China is one of our lead growth
markets for the long-term, because it's obviously a country with signiﬁcant long-termFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 13Nicole Miller Regan
Patrick J. Grismergrowth potential and the business that we've established there over the last 20 years
having been built in China for China has a very favorable economic proﬁle. We
enjoyed strong proﬁtability, strong returns on new unit investment and we feel very
good about the position that we've established with Chinese consumers with a
brand that has resonated quite strongly with all generations of consumers.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
I think that's a very relevant topic. Actually, it was around this time last year that we
traveled to China to tour the stores in Shanghai. And I remember it was interesting to
see many of those stores carefully combine the elements of the third place with a
digital as a fourth place in a really balanced way. So how do you compare and
contrast Starbucks update and modifying a more mature U.S. footprint, where you
started with a third place and now you have to add this fourth place, whereas in
China you can do it all at once?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Terriﬁc question. And so I'll start with what the two markets have in common. And
what they have in common is the essence of the Starbucks brand, which is rooted in
a very unique customer partner connection, we call our employees partners. And a
point of diﬀerentiation -- a key point of diﬀerentiation for us at Starbucks is the
quality of our partners in our stores and the connection that they establish with
customers. We know that consumers all over the world are valuing increasingly
experiences over products. So as we think about what we bring to market, of course,
it starts with high-quality products that are highly diﬀerentiated and customizable,
which is what consumers are looking for. But that is ampliﬁed by a very special
customer partner connection, and that's what the two markets have in common.
But focusing on China and how it is diﬀerent from the U.S. to your point, it is -- it has
grown more rapidly, more recently. So when you look at our store base, a larger
percentage are newer stores and at the same time we are taking what is a very
special third-place experience and complementing that with this fourth-place
experience, which is how we are able to expand our business through digital
channels. And for us in China that has started with a very special partnership that we
enjoy with Alibaba.
I mentioned previously, China business has been growing through partnerships and
we have a very tight connection to Chinese consumers and partners who support
our business in many diﬀerent ways, and Alibaba is a very important partner to us.
And so we collaborated with them to enhance our digital platform and then to
launch delivery. We know that one of the important need states for consumers
generally and this applies across the world is convenience. And certainly, Chinese
consumers are looking for opportunities to engage with brands that can meet them
when they have a particular need. So we know that delivery is an important occasion
or need state for Chinese consumers, and Alibaba has proven to be a very eﬀective
partner to us in unlocking that and being able to provide that kind of fourth-place
experience, as you mentioned.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 13Nicole Miller Regan
Patrick J. GrismerIn terms of how then marry that with a third place, the Chinese team was very
thoughtful about how we designed the menu for delivery, knowing the consumers
value, the quality of our products and the type of experience they get in our stores,
we wanted to make sure that through this fourth-place experience, we were not in
anyway diluting that. So the team thought through what we oﬀered on the menu and
there are certain products that don't travel well in delivery if the target is to deliver a
beverage in 20 minutes or less, think about it. I know a macchiato or a cappuccino,
something that has foam, it doesn't hold up well after 20 minutes. And so there were
certain products that were removed from the delivery menu, so that we could, with
conﬁdence, enter into delivery knowing that our consumers would be having a
comparable high-quality product and service experience whether in that fourth
place or the third place.
Just to round out the question you asked in terms of how that compares to the U.S.?
The U.S. is a more established business, but still rapidly growing. Even for a business
of our scale in the U.S. fairly well penetrated with Starbucks, we have about 15,000
stores in the U.S. There is still open territory for us for development, so we are still
growing even at that scale at a rate of 3% to 4% units per year. We are at the same
time unlocking new opportunity to grow average unit volumes through a fourth-
place experience, whether that's expanding the impact of our Starbucks Rewards
loyalty program and also the advent of delivery.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
The work convenience really struck me, I think, that is an important way to think
about the framework of what we're talking about. So how wide open is the growth
opportunity for China? Because convenience can mean the digital aspect. It can also
mean more stores. And so as a CFO, how would you like to see this accelerated
development that's happening balanced against positive same-store sales as a
metric in a perfect world? We know that we take dollars to bank and not percentages
yet, we always come back to this question?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Terriﬁc question. As we think about what the China market opportunity represents in
the long-term, particularly given the growth of the consuming class, we see
signiﬁcant potential we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on that. And
therefore, given the strength of our new unit returns and how our brand continues to
resonate with Chinese consumers across all demographic categories, we are
developing aggressively. We're encouraged by the results that we see as we open
new units, not only in the existing, more heavily penetrated Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities,
but in lower tier cities as well. The question then as to how we balance the
opportunity to grow through units versus the importance of sustaining same-store
sales growth that is fundamental to our ability to sustain high returns and good
margins is one that we think about quite a bit.
And we believe and this is consistent with my experience at other companies, that in
a high-growth environment like China, it is important to secure that ﬁrst-mover
advantage. And so as we think about the growth opportunity, we are looking toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 13Nicole Miller Regan
Patrick J. Grismer
Nicole Miller Regan
Patrick J. Grismerenter many new cities to establish our position, to establish our presence, to build
awareness that we know provides competitive advantage as the overall category
grows. So one way to think about it is that in our aspiration to grow, to your point,
total sales and total proﬁts, about 80% of our growth equation is through new unit
development, the other 20% through same-store sales and improved proﬁtability of
our existing store base.
So that, that does mean that as we grow at a more aggressive pace, there will be
sales transfer or cannibalization. But we do that mindfully and intentionally and in a
controlled fashion to ensure that we maintain good strong unit economics, which are
fundamental to our ability to realize strong returns on the capital we're putting
behind this growth.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
And that's a great way to frame it up. I think it really opened my eyes and I urge
people, you have to be there to see it, because the Tier 1 city versus the Tier 2 and
Tier 3 is something we're talking about last night, the white space. It's back, it's a
completely open opportunity. So --
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So the one thing I would like to say is that, obviously, operating a business in China
provides lots of opportunity, but there are challenges as well. It's the type of
opportunity that we don't take lightly. We feel very privileged to be operating there
and we feel very good about the relationships we've established with our partners,
about 50,000 partners in China. We employ the suppliers in China who supply the
goods and services that are fundamental to our ability to have such a large and
growing retail operation and then the partnerships with Alibaba and others. And so,
we feel very privileged. It's a type of business, where we remain a humble and
balanced perspective on the opportunity and how we are positioned to capitalize on
that.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
So if we switch gears a little bit and think globally about the umbrella of Starbucks,
there's a lot of scales we had as a brand, really along global points of distribution. So
I've always wondered when you think about channel activities, what's the sequence?
Is it better to go in with a store and then retail, or retail and then a store? Because I
would think the Nestle relationship really impacts that model?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, we deﬁnitely think about Starbucks as a brand that plays well across the entire
coﬀee category, the entire coﬀee addressable market. Well, yes, our heritage and
our strength is in specialty retail, and that's where we have focused most of our
resources. That is but one element of the total coﬀee category. So we are mindful of
the away-from-home experience, single serve, whole bean roast ground and instant,
including foodservice.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 13Nicole Miller Regan

Patrick J. GrismerAnd so, our partnership with Nestle aﬀords us the opportunity to penetrate those
other categories within coﬀee leveraging the strength of our brand and credibility
that we have in coﬀee, generally high-quality coﬀee. What we have found is that,
leveraging that relationship will accelerate our penetration across more than 100
countries, but preference or priority given to those countries where we have an
established presence with specialty retail.
So there is a natural sequence. As we've built the relationship with Nestle, we have
given preference or priority to those markets where we have a good strong specialty
retail presence that has created a lot of brand awareness and brand preference and
then we can capitalize on that as we come behind that with strong oﬀerings and
collaboration with Nestle to ensure that we are building share in categories like EPG
and foodservice.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
I have not heard it prioritized that way that sequencing is very helpful. So let's also
think about Starbucks and the beneﬁts of scale in digital development. A couple of
quick questions in terms of digital, I'll just ﬁre away. So how should digital tactics
best align to support guests new trial and frequency?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, certainly, we see digital as a signiﬁcant opportunity for us to increase customer
engagement, given that consumers increasingly are moving to digital channels to
engage with brands. And so from a tactical perspective, our focus has been on
removing or reducing those points of friction in digital engagement, weather making
it easier for customers to sign up, easier to place an order by removing the steps.
I think, last year, we've reduced from seven to three steps to place an order and then
continuing to enhance our customer analytics capabilities and our machine learning
capabilities. So that as consumers are engaging with us on the mobile apps to place
orders, they can see recommendations that are very relevant to them. They can see
the history of their orders that facilitates placing future orders. So those are some of
the tactical ways we're looking to improve the digital experience in ways that drive
even higher levels of guest engagement, both in terms of frequency and spend.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
I imagine, you've already touched on Alibaba in China in that regard, but there must
be some best practices that you're bringing back, is this the case?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
There are and I'm delighted to say, actually that as both China and the U.S. are
focused on unlocking the opportunity in digital. There's no house sharing between
the two. So it's not one way from China to the U.S. or U.S. to China, but the teams are
communicating and collaborating to adopt the best practices. So an example wouldFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)

Patrick J. Grismerbe in the case of U.S. innovation around the early work we're doing with delivery,
signiﬁcant development and innovation around packaging, how to protect the
quality of the product, how to preserve the integrity, so that there is ' there's tamper
evident packaging, which is important to consumers. Even lids that reduce the
amount of spill through delivery, there has been knowledge transfer from the U.S. to
China.
And in the case of China, they have done substantial innovation in partnership with
Alibaba around what new retail formats may look like. So I was in China recently and
had the opportunity to tour what is called the Hema Supermarket and the Ele.me,
which is a division at Alibaba delivery operation there that involves a hidden kitchen,
because of a consumers placing an order for delivery, it doesn't really matter where
that is prepared.
What the consumer cares about is that, it is of high-quality and that it's delivered in a
timely fashion. And so they're experimenting with hidden kitchen type operations in
China, and we're learning from their experience to understand how we might bring
a similar model to life in the U. S., particularly in large metro markets like New York.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
That's very fascinating. In March, I was looking to Annual Meeting and you discussed
the plan to modernize Starbucks and the part of that was going to start here in New
York with a U.S.-based delivery approach, how is it going?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So we launched delivery in partnership with Uber Eats in fall of last year through a
pilot program in Miami. Since then as of the end of our second ﬁscal quarter, we are
1,600 stores across seven cities here in the U.S. So we are gaining experience as we
go. In the case of New York, speciﬁcally, on top of the delivery opportunity, we are
looking at new retail formats that will allow us to best meet the needs of consumers
in a market like metro New York. When you consider, for example, Manhattan and
the diﬀerent use occasions or need states that our customers have, the idea of
having a mobile order and pickup location, it doesn't involve a cafe operation. We
think we have strong appeal in terms of how we can improve throughput, better
accommodate demand, reduce the lines and satisfy customers as we go. So we see
delivery working alongside innovations in retail format in order to best meet the
needs of consumers and capitalize on the total demand opportunity.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
So China, important. Digital, critical. But I always come back to Starbucks, for me,
most of us at its core balancing that convenience in community. So how do you work
to achieve that balance? Is it simply AMS speed and PMS engagement? How do you
engage the consumer and balance that?

Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 13Nicole Miller Regan
Patrick J. Grismer
Nicole Miller Regan
Patrick J. GrismerNumber one for us across all day parts is the customer partner connection. It is the
single variable that has the highest correlation with comp sales. When we see strong
customer connection scores by market, by country, we will see better comp
performance sustain. So that is the goal, number one now. The beauty of that from a
throughput perspective, you highlight the morning peak period, which can be quite
challenging. As we innovate ways to evolve our service routines and introduce
equipment innovation, introduce technology that reduces the administrative burden
on our store team, so that allows them to dedicate more their time, energy and
attention to customer connection. So it has the dual beneﬁt of improving throughput
and freeing up time to drive better, stronger customer connection. So that is the
primary focus for sure.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
I've actually -- I'm curious about how the reserve in the grocery stores ﬁt into this
equation. So I've been in many of the reserve stores, I'm actually the one in London
always fascinates me. I think that's a test reserve store, they do a lot of cool things
there. Obviously, you've invited us all into the Roastery numerous times. So how is
that as a physical footprint necessary to do the engagement that you're talking
about?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
We see the Roasteries as occupying a special place in our portfolio, a limited
number of them, because these are ﬂagship retail stores. And as you would expect,
the economics are more challenging with those stores. But we believe that it is
something that is very unique to Starbucks, something that only Starbucks can do in
the coﬀee category, something consistent with our statures of brand within coﬀee
globally and something it allows us to therefore amplify the brand.
It's a unique opportunity to invite customers who are Starbucks fans or who are new
to the concept to understand and appreciate the high-quality that we represent and
the innovation that we are bringing to the category in ways that allows us to continue
to evolve the oﬀering in our core stores. So the Roasteries serve that purpose
elevating and amplifying the brand, while at the same time being a catalyst for
innovation in terms of how we drive continued news into our core stores.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
So this next question is tough and I guess, I'm kind of thinking about the U. S. store,
because everything is constantly evolving, but I know I get asked this question a lot.
How do millennials ﬁt in? So the question is, who is the Starbucks customer today?
And how has that changed?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, we feel very good about our customer base globally. What's worth noting in
the case of the U.S. is that our recent -- our most recent consumer research has
substantiated that we enjoy even higher levels of preference with millennials andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-06

Patrick J. Grismercentennials. So we enjoy strength across all demographics, but we see even stronger
brand preference, among younger consumers, which I think is a validation of the
strength of our brand when you consider that Starbucks has led the growth of the
category, we've opened up the category and have invited in eﬀectively through this -
- the appeal that we've demonstrated with a specialty coﬀee retail other brands,
right? It's actually heightened competition, and yet as competition has intensiﬁed,
we have maintained our strong position and we are even more preferred by younger
customers who see our oﬀering as relevant, innovative, fun and increasingly digital.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
That's interesting to me, too, because when you break it down, they might not be
coming solely for caﬀeine. Sometimes these are caﬀeine-free beverages. Sometimes
it's the act of socialization. So this was also announced back in March at the Annual
Meeting, but there's the important aspect of where the -- what the brand stands for.
And I -- it seems a big part of that is the $1 billion sustainability bond, $100 million to
the Valor Siren funds. Are these things that help draw that connection to that
consumers?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
They are. I mean, we think very holistically about our brand. Yes, it starts with the
highest-quality coﬀee. It continues with a high-quality experience. But an important
aspect of the brand is how we're positioned in the hearts of mine and minds of
consumers and partners. I talked about the importance of the partner experience to
delivering the superior customer experience. And what we do and what we stand for
as a company in the area of sustainability and strengthening communities and so
forth is part of the magic that allows us to attract and retain outstanding partners in
our stores and inspire and motivate them to provide these extraordinary experiences
to our customers. So that is an intrinsic part of what we do, where we look to invest
and spend our time, because it is another diﬀerentiating feature for the brand that
has contributed to the stature that we've enjoyed that has grown over time.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
And the other peace of the equation that's equally, if not more important, is the
heart and soul of the brand and this is Starbucks partner. And you recently discussed
this as a partner-ﬁrst mandate. So can you talk a little bit about how important that is
that you're serving essentially millions and millions and millions of guests?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Critically important and certainly, one of the areas of focused investment for us
ensuring that our partner compensation programs, including our highly
diﬀerentiated beneﬁts continue to appeal to and reward the partner talent that is so
vital to the health and strength of our brand and continuing to invest in in-store
technology that not only enhances that customer experience, but enhances that
partner experience. So that the partners are able to devote more their time eﬀort
and energy to those customer connections.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-06

Patrick J. GrismerSo investments in technology that improve or enhance and streamline our inventory
management routines that enhance our ability to keep stores looking fresh and clean
in a way that we allocate our hours, making sure that as we continue to grow
channels like mobile order and pickup that we are making the necessary
modiﬁcations to our store design to facilitate the delivery of that in-store without
disrupting the ﬂow of the product production process for our cafe customers. So lots
of diﬀerent dimensions to what we're doing to enhance, as you say, the partner
experience, which is such an important part of what we do and who we are as a
brand.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
So it was very helpful that you would agree to kick oﬀ, today we talked about the
marketplace and the group that we brought together. And so one thing I want to ask
you about is, we're going to talk about labor all day, I think probably in most of our
conversations. So as an industry, is it getting better or worse than what would you
urge us to focus on today in our later conversations?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, it is getting more challenging and then we'll talk about the U. S. And as you
would expect, right, with lower levels of unemployment, with the continued growth
in the economy and therefore, more companies competing for the same talent. And
so that's why it's so important to us to continue to be industry-leading in terms of the
unique value proposition that we provide our partners to attract and retain the very
best and to motivate and inspire them to deliver their best, but it is getting
incrementally diﬃcult.
We believe that we have the advantage of the brand Halo and all of the positive
qualities that we represent. Meantime a Starbucks partner, and as I mentioned at the
start of our conversation, I feel I'm very excited and quite privileged to be part of this
leadership team to be a Starbucks partner. So that is an important part of our DNA
and it is part of what gives us that advantage. So as you think about how we all
grapple with labor challenges in an environment like this, ﬁnding those
opportunities to establish a point of diﬀerentiation with respect to the employment
value proposition is critical.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
Right. It wouldn't be any fun to the talk to the CFO if we don't talk some numbers, so
three last numbers questions. If you compare and contrast your past experience,
now you're doing commodity purchasing, so what's that like and how about taking
price, setting price for the Starbucks products?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
So on the subject of commodities what is diﬀerent in my experience at Starbucks
compared to other companies is that, we are more backward integrated. And I think
that speaks to the importance that we placed on the quality of our coﬀee, the rangeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-06-06
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 11 of 13Nicole Miller Regan
Patrick J. Grismerof coﬀees that we oﬀer, what makes that coﬀee drinking experience so unique and
diﬀerent. So we're more backward integrated. And that also ties into what we're
doing from the standpoint of the sustainability and strengthening communities.
We're very actively involved in strengthening farming communities in various parts
of the world, because that is instrumental to our ability to sustain that supply high-
quality coﬀee, particularly in an environment where coﬀee prices have been under
pressure. That's on commodity so much diﬀerent.
In terms of pricing, I would say that Starbucks is no diﬀerent from any other
consumer-facing company in the sense that, particularly in a competitive
environment, pricing is probably the last lever you would pull, because you want to
maintain a strong value proposition. The important thing is that, as you're being
more discriminating with your pricing is you're bringing real intelligence, being
more surgical in the way that you're taking pricing, considering a variety of factors.
And I think that Starbucks is world-class in that respect. And what I've observed and
experienced in my brief time with the company is that the tools are becoming
increasingly sophisticated. The knowledge and experience that we're gaining, the
technology we're planning to customer analytics, understanding customer elasticity
of demand in relation to pricing is helping to inform those decisions.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
And then at the end of last year actually, you announced the ideas to action in 100,
so that's the number, that's the metric. How is that going? Any examples?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Yes. We feel very good about the overall progress that we're making towards that
goal. And it really started with what our CEO, Kevin Johnson, announced about a
year ago under the banner of growth at scale, which is an agenda or framework for
how we're thinking about growing oﬀ of this position now with more than 30,000
stores globally, and an important aspect of that is evolving the organization in a way
that we work. So that we can be more nimble, more agile, responding more quickly
to the evolving needs of our customers and our partners.
And so that is sort of the backdrop for this. And I believe that we have made very
good progress in streamlining the organization with a more focused agenda and
with new tools and capabilities like the Tryer Lab, which we launched in Seattle at our
corporate headquarters earlier this year, providing us with focused capability, new
space and new mindset to more quickly evaluate new equipment innovations, new
store layouts and with the help of our store partners very quickly assess how those
will prove our operation and improve the customer experience.
So I can't disclose some of the upcoming equipment innovations. But I will tell you
that there are some that have moved very quickly within that zero to 100 days. So
that we could quickly qualify the eﬀectiveness and the business case underpinning

Congratulations on that 30,000 store opening that you just mentioned, letting that
sink in. Last question, what excites you the most? And how do you think about what
will have a more immediate impact on results? And what will have a really long
lasting impact on the brand?
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
Well, I'm very excited to be joining Starbucks at this point in its history. I feel that the
company is actually at an inﬂection point. With the growth at scale gender, as I
mentioned, that Kevin, our CEO, announced about a year ago, that has brought
focus and discipline, where perhaps we didn't have it before as a company given the
speed with which we had grown. And so I'm excited now to be part of the team
reinforcing that focus and discipline that we are conﬁdent we'll continue to unlock
that next leg of growth and we've seen that in the last few quarters of performance.
And so it is that improving performance momentum from a comp perspective, from
a margin perspective that I remain conﬁdent we will continue to unlock with this new
agenda and with a heightened level of focus and discipline.
{BIO 5884270 <GO>}
Fantastic. Thank you for your time.
{BIO 15965217 <GO>}
