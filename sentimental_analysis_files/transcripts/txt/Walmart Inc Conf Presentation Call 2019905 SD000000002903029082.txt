Presentation
Okay. We're going to get started. We're doing this lunch a little bit diﬀerently than
yesterday because this is being webcast. So we are kind of have to start on time. But
we're planning to wrap this up a little bit before 1:00. So you'll have a little bit longer
of a break post the Walmart presentation.
Welcome to our lunch keynote today. We are speaking with Steve Bratspies, Chief
Merchandising Oﬃcer of Walmart U.S. The Walmart U.S. business just posted its
strongest 2-year stock comp in 10 years when it reported Q2 results in August. Our
positive thesis on Walmart is based on its ability to leverage its store base for e-
commerce while growing traﬃc at the stores and improving proﬁtability. Walmart
also guided U.S. comps towards the upper end of its prior range of 2.5% to 3% with
positive expense leverage.
We think Walmart's strength is coming not only from the ease and convenience of its
delivery and pickup options. But also from its strong merchandising, as the company
continues to improve its oﬀering to customers, both in-store and online. Focusing on
how Walmart has changed and improved its merchandising in the U.S. will be a focus
of our conversation today.
To introduce our speaker, Steve has held a variety of merchandising roles, most
recently overseeing Walmart's food business, including responsibility for private
brands and global food sourcing. He also has held merchandising roles responsible
for dry grocery and general merchandise businesses. He joined the company in
2005 and was promoted to Senior Vice President of Marketing in 2007.
I'm going to turn the ﬂoor over to Steve for a minute. And then we will sit with our
ﬁreside chat.

A - Steve BratspiesThank you. And thanks for having us. We appreciate it. Thanks, everybody, for
joining. Just before we start, I ought to do our normal disclaimer around we may be
making some forward-looking statements. So I encourage everybody to please refer
to our safe harbor statement that's available on our corporate website. Thank you.
Questions And Answers
Okay. I think where I wanted to start out just because it's been so exciting and it's
been such an exciting part of your story is the rollout of grocery pickup, which has
been available now at -- is 2,700 doors?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. It will be 3,100 by the end of the year.
Okay. So I wondered if you could talk about what you've learned from this initiative
and why do you think it's bringing new customers into Walmart that might have
been shopping for their groceries elsewhere?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Sure. Online Grocery pickup, or click-and-collect, as some people refer to it, has
been a really big success. And it's one of the reasons we're rolling it out as fast as we
possibly can. So as I said, we will hit 3,100 stores by the end of this year and -- it
continues to gain momentum. It's proving to be highly incremental to our business
and bringing in new customers and with strong repeat.
Now the average basket size is about 2x what a standard grocery basket is. So
obviously we're excited about that. NPS is a measure that we use broadly across the
company. But the NPS score on Online Grocery is over 80. So it's really strong. And
we're starting to see a little bit diﬀerence in mix. This customer, (we could) sell a lot
of organics and a lot of healthier products through Online Grocery, which has been
an interesting dynamic for us. And it's forced us to merchandise a little bit diﬀerently.
As we pick throughout our stores, diﬀerent times of the day, we got to make sure our
in-stock is at peaks at diﬀerent times of the day. So it's working its way through the
entire infrastructure as a company and continues to prove to be a pretty good
growth vehicle for us.
Okay. Great. And it sounds like you plan to start testing InHome Delivery of groceries
later this fall. Just if you can maybe walk us through how that will work, what you're
testing, what you're looking for and what we can expect from that.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve BratspiesYes. InHome Delivery, it's an interesting concept and one that -- and as I look around
the room, I see diﬀerent smiles and looks on people's faces because it's -- for some
people, it's a real stretch to say I'm going to let somebody inside my house to go do
this. But we've been testing it for a while. And we've had really good response. The
people who want to do it really love it. And there are some customers where it's just
not for them, which is ﬁne.
But we'll be rolling out at the end of this year into Pittsburgh, Vero Beach, Florida
and Kansas City. So big markets. There will be about 1 million customers who'll have
access to it by the end of the year. And it literally allows us to replenish customers.
And they don't have to be home when we do it. And it enables also some real cost
eﬃciencies for us from a delivery perspective because we have more ﬂexibility on
when we deliver. So I don't have to schedule an appointment with you to be at your
house at a certain time. That allows a lot of labor scheduling and smoothing over
time. So we're pretty excited about all the diﬀerent paths we have to serve
customers.
We talk about Online Grocery. Now we're talking about InHome Delivery. There's
also scheduled delivery. If you wanted to ship us directly to your house, we're going
to have NextDay delivery. So we're really working to build an ecosystem and several
diﬀerent delivery methods that allow us to serve all customers.
And as a company, as we continue to grow, our focus is how do we become, we call,
channel agnostic. We just want customers to choose Walmart. And whether you want
to come to shop the store normally, you want to pick it up at the curb or we bring it
to your house, we'll do it however you want. But we just want to capture as many
customers as we can and serve them as broadly as we can.
Okay. And this question, maybe I should have asked prior. But with the click-and-
collect, it's just grocery right now. Is that correct?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
No. Actually, it includes general merchandise.
It does.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. So when we started, it was primarily grocery. And it's one of the reasons we call
it Online Grocery as our internal vernacular. But really, we're talking about it much
more broadly than that. So it's better to refer to it as click-and-collect. And one of our
big focuses is to add more general merchandise to that basket. One, obviously
there's a margin beneﬁt in terms of doing that. So we can mix it out a lot better. But
the other component is we want click-and-collect to represent the traditional
Walmart experience, which is one-stop shopping. So we need the customer to thinkFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve Bratspiesabout click-and-collect holistically. And we can serve all of their diﬀerent needs. And
we're rapidly expanding the GM assortment that's available.
And have you disclosed what percentage of the general merchandise is available for
click-and-collect (at this point?)
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
We have not disclosed the %. But it's a large majority and it's continuing to grow.
There will be certain categories we just won't do because they will never be eﬃcient
enough. But in general, we want to be able to meet the broad base of general
merchandise needs for click-and-collect.
Okay. Great. If we can maybe drill down to some of the category work that you've
been doing. Maybe ﬁrst focusing on grocery. Just maybe, could you start with some
of the changes we've seen maybe in your grocery merchandising over the last year?
Are there certain areas where you think share gains have accelerated as a result of
some of your initiatives?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Sure. Obviously, grocery has been a large focus for us. And we've been pretty
pleased with our performance, in general. Let me start with our fresh business. And
we've talked a lot about it. And we think we've made pretty signiﬁcant progress in
fresh over the last couple of years. In terms of produce. And starting with produce,
it's really the ﬁrst thing you see when you walk in the door. We've worked on
produce all the way from the farm through the cash register and really even into the
customer's house because we're trying to drive increased freshness there.
But relooking at how we source, who we source from, the quantities that we're
sourcing, how we then move that through our supply chain more eﬃciently, how it
gets unloaded at the back of the store, we've almost completely changed all the
store processes on how associates deal with product, how they stock the shelves, call
the product. We've changed what the assortment looks like and the layout. So we've
touched almost everything in produce. And we've seen a lot of progress, in addition
to investing in price on it. So we feel good about the momentum we have in
produce. There's more work to be done and more opportunity. And we're not nearly
as good as we need to be and will be. But we feel like we've gained a lot of
momentum. And that's resulted in share growth there.
The other parts of fresh, bakery and meat, have really improved as well. Just to
spend a minute on bakery. Bakery is a business that's been growing incredibly well
for us the last couple of years, double-digit comps. And a little bit of a diﬀerent
approach there. That was about simplifying the assortment. We were over-assorted
in bakery. And the shopping experience was just a little too complicated. So we've
reduced the assortment. The team dramatically improved the quality, got back to
item price merchandising because it's ultimately what we do best. We're an itemFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

Page 5 of 20Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve Bratspiespriced merchandising company, made that really clear a space. And bakery has
improved dramatically.
So we feel pretty good about momentum that we have and the improvement we
have on the fresh side of the business. But we're trying to really match that then with
kind of center of the store and dry grocery as well. It's incredibly important. And the
growth there has been a lot of changes in space, adjacencies, more intuitive to the
customer. Private brand has played a big role in that. And price investment, which
has continued to work and drive units. So we feel pretty good, in general, about the
holistic body of work that we've done in the grocery business. Share has improved
and continues to grow, which we're excited about. But we also realize we have a lot
of opportunity in front of us. Everything that I talked about, we can continue to get
better at. And we don't think we've reached the peak on any of it yet.
Okay. And you mentioned private brand. And again, if we could just maybe focus on
the grocery piece before we go into the other categories with regards to private
brand. I mean how much runway is left for increasing penetration? And what roles do
you see for private brand versus national brand and how you balance that?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Private brand has been -- we've been on a journey. And as I said, we're pretty
pleased with the progress that we've made. And it starts with a philosophical
diﬀerence or change in how we approach the business. I would say, in the past, we
had a private-label approach versus a private brand approach. And I think there's a
really important distinction between the 2 of those. My experience before for
Walmart is packaged goods industry. And it was about disciplined brand
management. And we're now running our private brands the same way you would
expect any CPG company to run their brands, the way they think about product and
quality and price and packaging, all those diﬀerent components. We've brought that
capability and that approach to Walmart in our private brands and grocery. So
particularly Great Value and the Equate brands, which are our 2 biggest ones.
So a lot of discipline, a lot of product quality improvement and really thinking about
the role that it plays, speciﬁcally inside of each category. At the same time, we've got
rid of a lot of brands. We just had a lot of private brands that weren't a value to us
and it was cluttering the assortment. So we simpliﬁed the assortment, simpliﬁed our
portfolio and then really started to use it as a proactive lever to drive growth for our
business.
And I would tell you 2 reasons why private brand has been successful, beyond the
fact we're just better at it, is customer today, millennial customer is just intuitively
more open to private brands and more accepting of private brands. I think part of
that is just they're a little bit diﬀerent and part of it is everybody's gotten better. It's
not just us. The industry has gotten better. So the oﬀering is stronger. So they're
more naturally accepting of it. And sometimes, when other brands, national brands,
larger brands aren't innovating at the same pace they had been in the past,
sometimes price gaps get too wide. And they price themselves out. So it allowsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantspace underneath. And our private brands have certainly grown because of that. But
it's something that we think can continue to grow.
We still are probably under-penetrated versus some of our competitors. And we're
actually okay with that. I don't have very speciﬁc clear targets on I want this level of
penetration. We really let the customer choose. And if the customer wants more
private brands in that area, we will give them more private brands. If they're not
interested, we'll pull back. So there's no actual speciﬁc target. But it certainly has
been increasing.
And do you feel, like in grocery, most of the categories lend itself to having a private
brand?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. The vast majority of them do. There's only a few that we don't have private
brand in. So there's opportunities everywhere. Now that penetration ranges. Some
are more highly penetrated than others. But most of the categories, with a few
exceptions, private brand can play in.
Okay. And just we were curious. Has there ever been an example of when you've
pursued a private brand -- and maybe not a brand. But within a category where it
just didn't work? And how do you assess that? And what are kind of the
improvements that you need to make if it does not work?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
We tried chocolate. We had Great Value chocolate at one point. It didn't work. And
the reason it didn't work is it just wasn't good enough. And we couldn't get the
product to a point that we were really happy with it and we thought it could compete
at the level that it needed to. So we pulled out of it. So that's usually one of the best
examples that I have. That's a category where everyone has their diﬀerent brand that
they like and diﬀerent ﬂavor proﬁle that it worked. And ours was okay. It was good.
But I don't think it was better than or up to match with some of the other ones. So we
just pulled out of the category and said that's not an area we're going to focus on.
How quickly do you realize something like that? I mean chocolate is very speciﬁc. But
I mean, in general?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Pretty quickly because the sales weren't there.
Ever? Yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve Bratspies{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. It just didn't sell that well. So we said -- we gave it some time, obviously. Let it sit.
But it just wasn't good enough. So we took it out of the module and moved on.
Okay. So if we can move on from grocery to more of the general merchandise
categories. And I know you're doing a lot of work here, especially in the apparel and
home categories. Maybe you could maybe start out with just what we've seen in the
store and what you see -- what you've done online with the home and apparel
categories.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Sure. That same -- what I would say -- I'd start with this, that same kind of discipline
from brand management perspective we talked about in grocery applies to the
general merchandise side of the house, too. So all those disciplines, that's all
consistent. And we're doing a much better job on that front. For home and apparel,
ﬁrst I'll start with apparel. We're spending a lot of time on and a lot of eﬀort on a
project that we call apparel reinvention, which is a re-layout and rechange of the
apparel ﬂoor and what it looks like, the height of the walls, the height of the racks,
the signing, the navigation, all the things to make the pad more appealing and
easier to shop and more engaging to the customer.
In addition to that change, which is being rolled out, a lot of work has been done on
product and branding. We introduced 3 new brands at the beginning of this year:
Terra & Sky; Time and Tru; and Wonder Nation in kids. All are doing really well. And
we're pleased with the performance of those. We also kind of revamped George
inside the U.S. portfolio for men at the same time. So a lot of work, a lot of
investment to get that product to where it needed to be on spec, on ﬁt, quality of
fabric, all of those diﬀerent things coming into it to make sure that we continue to
lean into that business, while we do an incredible basics business inside of apparel
at the same time.
So when it comes down to basics of socks, underwear, we sell an incredible amount
of that product. Some of it branded, some of it private label. So we want to hold on
to that while we surround it with additional new brands. And that's worked pretty
well. So we're going to continue to do that and continue to look for new
opportunities to leverage brands, whether they're online brands or whether in the
store.
In home, we're not as far along with a reset in store. We have one that's coming that
we really like. That makes home also easier to shop. The adjacencies are much
smarter than they've been in the past in terms of how people are going to shop. And
again, some lower counters, better navigation. So you'll see that start to roll out next
year, which I think is going to make us a lot better.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

Page 8 of 20Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve Bratspies
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve BratspiesBut I would tell you, the biggest improvement at home. And what I think the team
has done the best job on is product quality. The product is just simply better. We
have work to do. There's plenty of opportunity. But we're using online ratings, 4-star
ratings. If the product doesn't have 4 stars online, we're not putting it in our home
assortment. So we're starting to cross that digital and physical line. And the team has
done a nice job of continuing to grow and build that business, leveraging our big
brand mainstays in there and also -- and better homes and gardens and also national
brands at the same time. So we have a lot of great experience in that kitchen
appliance brand with some of the national brands. And they continue to grow.
So both of those are a big focus in stores. And recently, we talked about it in our
lease. They're performing better online as well. And that's been a focus for us to
drive margin, improve proﬁtability through those categories. And some of that is
adding new brands and some of it is just managing the assortment. But good
momentum there.
Do you feel you're at a point where apparel and home could be the sole reason why
somebody comes to Walmart? I think -- correct me if I'm wrong. But I would think
grocery is the bigger traﬃc driver into the store. Do you think apparel and home will
get to a point where that drives traﬃc on its own?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. I would tell you -- I mean, yes, grocery is obviously the biggest traﬃc driver we
have because of the velocity. For some customers, it's already there. Our challenge is
to grow that pie, right? And we have plenty of customers who all they do is buy
home and apparel at Walmart. And that's why they're very sizable businesses. Now
they don't appeal to everybody and they never will. And we understand that. We're
going to continue to expand from a good, better, best assortment. We know we have
opportunity to move into better. And we'll see about best in terms of apparel. But we
-- what we have to do is stay incredibly focused on our core assortment, on our core
customer while we expand. And the trick is don't lose the core. And we've gotten
away from that a little bit in the past. So our incredible focus and our maniacal focus
is serve our core as we expand. So we're going to stay with good, better, best. We're
going to continue to try to climb that ladder. But we're going to make sure we don't
lose focus on the core as we do it.
Okay. One thing that we've heard from you guys over the years is just increasing the
number of SKUs available online. But we were curious about that philosophy of
increasing SKUs in the stores. Are there certain categories where you're trying to
either increase or decrease the SKUs? And does the assortment vary from store to
store and region to region?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Sure. In terms of store count -- or SKU count, sorry, in a store, we roughly carry in a
supercenter 100,000 to 120,000 SKUs. And there's a lot of movement inside of that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 20Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve BratspiesAnd I would tell you, as I walk a store and I work with my buyers, there are categories
that I think we are over-assorted. And I think we have a lot of opportunity to simplify
the assortment. At the same time, we have categories that are under-assorted. That
need work. And we can add more to do that. So it's really a category-by-category
decision. I'm always very careful to give directives on you need to reduce SKUs
because it's a bottoms-up business. Walmart runs best when we run it as a bottoms
up. And we let the buyers do their thing. I'm there to help and help navigate. But
they need to do the thing. The challenge I give them is I want you to have the
broadest assortment you can that's eﬃcient at the shelf. It has to be eﬃcient. So we
have to help the stores from a productivity perspective. And that means we have to
have the right holding capacity on the shelf. We need more shelf-ready packaging.
We need inventory to be right. It needs to be easy to stock. All those kinds of things.
Once you ﬁt inside of those criteria, we want to serve as many people as we possibly
can and as broad of assortment as we possibly can. So you'll see us adding in some
areas and detracting in others. It just depends on the category and the situation of
the business.
And in terms of does assortment vary store to store? It does. But the vast majority of
assortment is consistent. Then we try to get to, what we call, store of the community,
of making sure that the store represents that community. And some of that is at a
very granular level in grocery. Some of it could be the local sports team or making
sure, like if you're near a lake, we probably should have more ﬁshing space and
boating space. If you're in a -- if you're in the desert somewhere, having a big section
of life preservers and paddles for rowboats and things like that probably doesn't
make a lot of sense. So we try to customize by sort of the community when it makes
sense geographically or if the demographics are diﬀerent. But the vast majority of
our oﬀering tends to be pretty consistent.
Okay. If we can move on to the topic of price investment. This is a question that we
get a lot across all the retailers that we cover. But it's a complex and ﬂuid topic, we
understand. And you guys use it very eﬀectively. Could you maybe walk us through,
just generally, how you think about price investment? But then when drilled down to
more recently, it sounds like Q2 is maybe a little bit higher than Q1 in terms of price
investment and why that was the case.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Sure. Let me do it in reverse order. Let me talk about Q2 versus Q1. What I would tell
you is we set a budget for price investment for the year and then we break that out
quarter to quarter. You shouldn't read Q2 as any real change in the marketplace or
change in our strategy. Some quarters we hit, as we roll out geographically, a few
more stores than other quarters. And those things change us because we do it by
market. So no strategy change or anything, Q2 to Q1. That's just how we budget for
the year. And we'll deliver on the budget that we have for the year we set for pricing.
In terms of how we approach it, the thing that we're most focused on is making sure
that we deliver on our everyday low price promise. And part of everyday low price
promise is not only leading on price. But a consistent downward pressure on price.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 20Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve Bratspies
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve BratspiesAnd Walmart thinks about pricing a little bit diﬀerently than most other retailers and
a lot of manufacturers in that we don't ever talk about how high of a price we can
command for an item. We actually go the other way and say, "How low can I sell this
item, still make the margin that I need to and sell a lot more?" which is a bit diﬀerent
thinking than a lot of other people in the industry.
So with that as the backdrop, we built this pricing strategy that is very focused on
serving customers. I won't go into too much detail for competitive reasons. And we
don't really share the strategy. But what I would tell you is we use an awful lot of data
to understand where pricing makes the biggest diﬀerence and how we should price
eﬀectively. And quite frankly, we're much smarter on it today than we were four years
ago when we started this. So we're using data, changing our approach where it
makes sense, making sure we're pricing appropriately against hard discounters and
managing that.
We have a lot of regional competitors that we need to deal with. But we're just really
focused on continuing to keep prices low, maintain the price gap that we need. And
people ask me all the time, why are you doing, how long you're going to do it. We're
doing it because the customers are responding. Our traﬃc continues to grow. Our
units continue to grow. Units per basket, which is a metric I look at all the time,
continues to improve. So as the customer continues to respond, we're going to
continue to invest and drive that business as we go forward.
And is there any role -- or have you embarked on any kind of dynamic pricing when
it comes to either the store or online?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. We want to be consistent on pricing as much as we possibly can. We're not
perfect. There's always opportunities. But one of our -- one of the key premises of
everyday low price is the consistency. And we think it builds a trust with our
customers and that they trust Walmart on price and they trust the consistency.
Customers really get annoyed when they buy something and they come back a
week later and they see it, it's a diﬀerent price, particularly when you get into more
expensive goods, like in general merchandise side of the business. So we think
consistency equals trust. And we think trust is just a fundamental part of our brand
and how we try to work with customers.
Okay. Great. Last question on price investment. Is price investment more of a
grocery-speciﬁc conversation? Or is it across the board?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Sure. It's across the board. But it's sequenced. So recently -- or up to today, the vast
majority of our spend has been on the grocery side and has been our focus. Next
year and going forward, as we've kind of completed the geographic rollout, it frees
up some of the budget to move over and be more focused on general merchandiseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

A - Steve Bratspiesthan we have in the past. We'll still continue and spend and invest on the grocery
side of the business. Back to what I said earlier, consistent downward pressure on
pricing and always need to make some adjustments. But because we're not
reentering new markets, we now can spend more on the general merchandise side
and attack some of the categories where we have opportunities over there to
increase our price gap.
Okay. Great. When you last spoke to The Street, management raised their full year
guidance on top line. I wondered if you could maybe walk through the factors that
are driving that primarily in the second half of the year.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. We have good momentum in the business. We like the underlying dynamics of
traﬃc, basket size. We like the programs that we have coming in the back half and
we continue to take share. So it gives us the conﬁdence that the business will
continue to improve. And we're -- I promise you, we're not resting on our laurels.
There's a lot of work going on. And we think we still have opportunity to do better.
And when it comes -- going back to the grocery pickup, I'm not being very eﬃcient
with my questions, sorry. One thing, one question on that we get is that once you are
through the grocery pickup -- or I'm sorry, the click-and-collect since it's more than
just grocery, what happens when you get all your stores online? How do you comp
the success of that launch in those stores?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Sure. What we're seeing is stores that have been open over three years, they're still
comping in Online Grocery. So we feel pretty good that there'll be continued
growth. We continue to see new customers. The repeat rate continues to grow. And I
think that, as we expand the assortment and you have even more opportunities,
there's no reason to think that, that won't incur more occasions as we go forward. So
long term, way, way out, we'll see how it plays out. But what I can tell you in the data
set that we have today is the stores from the beginning are just continuing to comp
positive on Online Grocery. So we're encouraged.
And is there any way to tell how much of that comp is being driven by a brand-new
customer to Walmart?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
We can tell through traceable tender and things like that. It's not data that we
actually release and talk. But we have the ability to understand the customers that
are new, who's moving across channels and things like that. And ultimately, what
we're trying to get to is. And I think I mentioned it earlier. But we don't care which
channel you shop. We just want you to choose Walmart. And what we're seeing isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

A - Steve Bratspiescustomers come in through one channel and adopt other channels. Other times,
we're seeing our core customers just spreading their volume. So it varies. But we're
seeing a lot of movement across channels and people using diﬀerent channels
based on the occasion, what their need is at that time.
Is there any major category that is kind of -- that you can lean into in a more and
meaningful way that the customer is asking for, that you think is missing as you
continue to reﬁne the store?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Well I think one of the big ones that we're leaning into is adult beverage. So alcohol
is something that, I think, we're under-shared in, under-spaced in. And we've got
plans to address that as we go forward. It's a very large business that we don't have a
huge share in. And there's all kinds -- there's all state rules and local rules and all
those things. So it's a very complex business that you have to navigate. But it's a
business that, we think, is a big opportunity for us to address. And we've got a few
test stores out there right now with very diﬀerent sets and expanded space that
we're pretty excited about and we think can make a big diﬀerence in the business.
And do you have an example of another category that you may have leaned into
that's resulted in maybe better-than-you-thought expectations? Or...
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. I don't know if better than expectations. But if you look at one of the businesses
that we are fundamentally disadvantaged at from a size perspective is hardware. And
we've got a new layout in tools that is rolling out through all of our remodels and
driving signiﬁcant comps in that business that we feel pretty good about. We're
never going to match assortment with Home Depot or Lowe's in that front. So the
challenge when you work in a supercenter mass merchandiser as a merchant is you
have to make some real choices because you just can't. In total, we carry a lot. But if
you're an individual business, you're undersized in space versus your competition.
So you have to make some really speciﬁc choices. And I think the team in -- and we
call it Tool World, has done a really nice job adding some products, changing the
assortment, simplifying some other areas. And we're seeing a lot of good progress
there.
I would say the other area that we've leaned into and have done well in is toys. Now
obviously, there's been disruption in the industry there and a big change in the
industry. But beyond just having more inventory and selling in a couple hundred
stores, we went and actually changed the physical space and added more counters
to enable that business, which is not inexpensive. And it's not without its
complications. But we're ﬁnding those opportunities and leaning in aggressively.
And when we do that, we seem to be having pretty good success so far.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

A - Steve BratspiesOkay. Great. If I can ask kind of a bigger question on just the U.S. e-commerce
strategy. It seems like you've been redirecting some of your investment spend
towards the core of Walmart.com. So I just wondered if you talk -- could talk about
what some of the bigger areas of investment have been.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
I think the biggest focus for Walmart.com is assortment and how do we get more
eﬃcient and proﬁtable in the business. And we're working towards that and we have
a lot of work to do as we go forward. We're working on mix and managing mix more
eﬀectively, working on contribution proﬁt for each individual item and how that plays
out across the site. When we moved to NextDay delivery, which is a bit
counterintuitive for some people. But costs actually go down because we forward
deploy inventory and mirror inventory the best couple hundred thousand SKUs
across all our fulﬁllment centers. Then when we ship from there, we actually have
fewer split ships and reduce freight costs, less air and all those kinds of things. So it
actually gets more eﬃcient and eﬀective in terms of doing that.
So really working on focusing on the core business and those couple hundred
thousand SKUs that drive the majority of the business. So the way we're thinking
about it is kind of almost from the inside out in that we're trying to use the stores as
forward kind of distribution centers, as in fulﬁllment centers, as we go forward. We
add the e-commerce fulﬁllment centers around it and you start to create the
connectivity and the ecosystem for moving product more eﬀectively and eﬃciently
to be able to serve more customers and the best -- on the products that they need
the most. We'll still have 1 million to 2 million ﬁrst-party items that we'll carry and
ship. And at the same time, we'll build out marketplace. But we're really trying to
focus on the core and then build out marketplace. And we've made some changes in
our marketplace structure. Jeﬀ Shotts, who was the CFO of e-commerce, is now in an
operating role running marketplace, really focused on that every day. So we're kind
of -- we're doing a lot of things at one time and trying to ﬁnd that right balance and
mix. But we'll continue to build the tail and -- but heavy focus on our core right now.
Are you able to speak to the marketplace opportunity and how Walmart is thinking
about that longer term? And I guess one of the bigger feedbacks on marketplace is
just the quality control and how you manage that. So...
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. I'm not an expert on marketplace. But I'll tell you, kind of at a high level, we still
see it as a big opportunity. We may not ever -- we'll never be maybe as big as our
biggest competitor in that space and probably don't want to be. I think we're up to
about 75 million items on marketplace right now. So we've grown pretty dramatically
over the last couple of years. One of the challenges on marketplace is ﬁltering and
making sure you have not only the right product. But avoid diﬃcult situations. And
we've had some of those with a graphic T-shirt or a Halloween costume and some
diﬃcult things that we wouldn't necessarily have chosen to put on the site. And weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

A - Steve Bratspiestake action appropriately when that's found and it ends up being unfortunate. But
we're working on that process of not only what are our oﬃcial guidelines. But then
how do you ﬁlter it and how do you manage it. So there's technology solutions that
are coming to help us do that better. So we get the best of the best and avoid some
of the more complex areas.
Okay. We're asking all the management teams that sit with us at the conference for
questions. So I'm going to launch into those now. The ﬁrst is. And we've touched
upon this a little bit. But your expectation for the macro environment in the second
half of 2019 in the U.S. relative to recent results, better, same or worse?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Sure. I'll tell you, the data that we looked at and that we have tells us that our
customer is in pretty good place and is feeling pretty conﬁdent based on their
behavior and other surveys and studies that we do. So we feel positive about how
the customer is, how they're responding, how they're spending, their attitudes. They
feel pretty good. So we're positive on the macro outlook. Now if I actually knew, I'd
be doing a diﬀerent job than I'm doing right now. But I think from our customer
perspective, with the data that we look at, it's still pretty positive.
Okay. The second question is on inventories. Do you expect inventories to go faster
or slower than sales in the second half?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. I mean our objective is always to have inventory growing slower than sales. I
would tell you, we came out of Q4 heavier than we normally would. But we feel really
-- it's all good inventory. And to me, that's actually the most important part, is the
numbers will ﬂuctuate a little bit quarter-to-quarter based on timing. But our
inventory is really clean. We were heavy because of a couple of market opportunities
that we took advantage of and we bought up on the mirroring of inventory across
the FCs, drives inventory up a little bit. We've had some issues with the way we're
importing product, bringing in stuﬀ from the East Coast versus the West Coast, which
adds a little bit of in-transit time. So there's a few diﬀerent things that have driven it
up. But our goal is always to manage inventory at lower than the rate of sale. So we'll
continue to work on that inventory as we go forward. But the most important thing
for us it's good go-forward inventory and not backlog, if anything.
Okay. Tariﬀs, which haven't come up yet. The question is, though, what is your
biggest lever to mitigate tariﬀ pressures? Is it moving production or supply chain
reconﬁguration, negotiation with vendors or price increases?
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}

Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 15 of 20Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve Bratspies
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve BratspiesI got to it.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
That's my favorite. So obviously, it's complicated and there's a -- I wouldn't tell you
there's one lever. We -- we're using lots of them as we go forward. And just to give
everybody just a little bit of backdrop on how we think about this and the approach
that we've taken. So list 1 through 3 came out and I was really pleased with my team
and how they handled it and managed through it. And we built a very disciplined
playbook, literally a playbook that the buyers go through and the tools and the
levers that sort of teach everybody the best way to handle this. And -- but it
continues to grow as they learn new things as we go forward. And if you look at list 1
through 3, in general, we mitigated it. There were a few prices that we took up. But
they were not -- there's no consequence to that. Units continue to grow at the rate
that they were growing. So it really didn't have any eﬀect. So we were pretty pleased
with that. And what -- we used lots of diﬀerent tools to do that. There was some price
decrease. But a lot of negotiation has driven that.
List 4 obviously is more complicated and covers a much broader range of products.
So we're using the same playbook, though. And probably, the most important part
of that is we literally go through item by item by item. And sometimes, as you think
about tariﬀs. And I was talking to a group earlier, you get lost in the big numbers,
right? And we all talk it's this billions, it's that billions. It really comes down to an
individual product. And our team literally lays out every single item and goes
through and makes decisions on how that item, inside its category, how we can mix,
what are the diﬀerent levers, can we negotiate, can we source it diﬀerently, can we
just push back and negotiate it, is there something we can do diﬀerently on supply
chain. There's a lot of diﬀerent ways to think about it. Our last resort is to raise prices.
And I would tell you that, back to the point I was making earlier, we constantly want
downward pressure on pricing. We don't want them to go up because we think
that's best for the customer. If we can't deliver on what we need to deliver, then we
will have to move some prices. There's no doubt. But that will be our last resort. And
we'll pull all the other levers that we have to, to get there.
You mentioned moving volume to other places. It's more of a longer-term play to do
that. I would tell you that the last time I was in China, I met with the top 15 of our
suppliers and that was a hot topic of discussion. They are -- there is activity around
that. They are moving. But it's not something, with our volume, you can ﬂip a switch
and just move to another country. So that's a longer-term play. But that is going on.
Okay. Just one follow-up question on that. You said you had a lot of success in
mitigating the impact, list 1 through 3. Can you talk about how much harder it was to
mitigate at 25%, 30% versus 10%?

Page 16 of 20Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve Bratspies
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve BratspiesYes, good stuﬀ (for -- just from) the math. But it -- but I would tell you, though, again,
it goes back to the individual situation because there are some areas that we get
25%. And at 25% you can handle it just because the dynamics of the category, the
nature of it, the spreads you have, there's a lot of diﬀerent ways to approach it. And
there's no one way you could get it, right? The other advantage that we have, quite
frankly, is we have a really big box to mix it out across, right? We have grocery and if
we have to spread -- I can think holistically about the entire portfolio. We don't have
to just apply a tariﬀ to an individual item. We can think about how to move it.
And the other part I would just remind everybody, as we think about tariﬀs, because I
know it's on the top of everyone's mind, is if you think about our total business, 2/3
of our business is sourced here in the U.S. So now you have another 1/3 left. And not
all of that is sourced from China. So while it's still a big number. And I don't want to
downplay it, it's obviously a big impact, it's not as big as some people think when
they think about our total business.
I would imagine, too, being a global company, that there's probably some
opportunity to, if you still have production coming out of China, to ship to those non-
U. S. countries and not have to be subject to a tariﬀ versus maybe shipping to the
U.S.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. We have to be careful on how we do that just because of the restrictions and
how that moves. But I think anything coming out, we still get hit with, I'm not exactly
sure. But yes, we have -- there's diﬀerent ways to leverage global sourcing. And what
I would tell you is one of the advantages we think we have, one of the beneﬁts is we
have a very well-established global footprint and global sourcing organization. And
we're already set up in all these diﬀerent countries to manage change and manage
the inﬂux of support. So we've got a pretty good infrastructure that we can lever as
things evolve over time. At the end of the day, though, we're going to import
product from China. I mean don't -- we're not moving everything out of China. Our
suppliers won't move everything out of China. It's just not practical and probably not
the right thing to do. But there will be some movement.
Okay. Then our last question that we're asking everyone is, over the next two years,
do you expect your store base to be larger or smaller? I know I'm talking to Walmart.
But just curious what the answer might be.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. We haven't been given direct (guidance) on that. But I'd tell you, if you look
back the last couple of years, we're not building stores at the rate that we used to.
And I'd probably suspect that our investment will be more in technology capability
than it will be in stores going -- new stores going forward. We'd rather (be spending)
that money on remodeling our current asset base.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

A - Steve Bratspies
Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThen my last question before we open it up for a few minutes to the audience is, just
with the amount of investment that's taken place and especially in technology, I
wondered what investment in technology has made your job easier.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
It's a great question. There's a lot of diﬀerent things. One of the areas that we're
spending a lot of time on, in merchandising speciﬁcally, is negotiation and
merchandising tools for our buyers. And I'd say there's 2 big things.
First, on the negotiation side. Coming up with new products that enable our team to
prepare for negotiations faster and have the capabilities and the data that they need
to be prepared. There's always the old joke of you have a Walmart buyer sitting at 1
side of the table and an SVP and 25 analysts from the largest manufacturer sitting
across the table. And what we're doing is equipping our buyers with the data that
they need to be more proactive in discussions with suppliers. So instead of the
suppliers coming to us ﬁrst, we're going to them with here's how the business
opportunities lie. So there's a lot of data being collected and produced into, we call
merchandise -- or negotiation tool that's going to help our team be a lot more
progressive. I saw the latest prototype of that just last week and I'm very excited
about that. It's going to be a big deal for us.
The other side on technology is on assortment. And we have a lot cleaner insight to
transferability and substitutability of merchandise. So when a buyer is making
assortment decisions and deciding, well, do I want to keep that brand, do I want to
move that brand, do I want to cut this item, the ability to understand where the
demand is going to transfer or what product can substitute for another or what
brand can substitute for another is incredibly empowering. And we've built that data
capability through technology over the last couple of years. And it's making a big
diﬀerence.
So on the merchandising side, it's using technology to use data better. Then there's
a lot of technology being added to the stores to drive eﬃciency at the same time. So
whether that's how we unload trucks, robotics, self checkouts, the front end, all of
those things are helping us create the leverage that we've been able to create for
the last couple of quarters. So it's a big focus for us and a big investment. And that's
one of the reasons why store investment probably just won't grow and we'll spend it
on our current ﬂeet.
Great. Okay. We can take a few questions, please.
Steve, could you please comment how Walmart has historically looked at marketing
as an expense? And now currently, Walmart is looking at marketing as an investment
where you're working between your team power of one, Publicis with the best copy,
the best creative, the best advertising and media buying and placement. So youFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

to convert customers from either viable competitors or contracting or collapsing
competitors in food, drug, discount and specialty.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
So I'm sorry, I missed the ﬁrst part of what you're saying. So you're trying -- our
approach to that or...
The -- your marketing and advertising has really evolved from something that was
historically looked at as an expense. And now you're looking at it as a strategic
investment where you've gone to best in the business and really accelerating your
growth versus all channels of competition to convert more and more customers to
Walmart and getting existing customers to buy more in terms of eﬃciency and
eﬀectiveness of the buying. But also the best copy and creative in the business with
the work you're working with Publicis.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Thank you. Sorry about that. Yes, I think -- we believe market -- I mean, I grew up in
marketing. So I'm still a marketer at heart. I think leveraging the message that we
have is pretty compelling. And we're very proud of our brand, we're very proud of
the concept of save money, live better. We think that resonates as a true brand and
needs to be marketed that way. And there's -- what's great about marketing at
Walmart is you have this incredible brand, this incredible brand message and you
have all these assets underneath to activate, whether it's click-and-collect we talked
about, whether it's new brands and all kinds of products and services. So it's kind of
a -- it's a great marketing job to have and to leverage. And we're being more
proactive than we've been in the past and making sure that we're driving a holistic
message, using great partners to help us get there. I mean the world has changed in
the last 10 years since I was in marketing with the way social media is running. I mean
you go to market very diﬀerently than you did 10 years ago. And we're leaning in to
use all of those diﬀerent channels and partnering with the right people to help us
get our message out there.
Great. So my question is a follow-up on the tariﬀ. It's really interesting that you talked
about the diﬀerence you're seeing in terms of your ability of negotiating with
vendors, depending on the product or product category. If you can just give us more
color in terms of where you're seeing more opportunity to negotiate, where there's
less ﬂexibility, that would be great. And similarly, in terms of in the medium to longer
term, moving the supply chain out of -- outside of China, what kind of product
category where you're seeing most opportunities, which are more likely to stay in
China. I imagine they have a lot to do with regulation, product complexity and labor.
But given your vantage point, love to hear your insights.

Page 19 of 20Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Steve BratspiesSure. I won't get into speciﬁc categories or speciﬁc suppliers and who's more willing
to negotiate and who's not because it really depends on the situation. I'll tell you,
we've had success with categories -- the same supplier with some categories and not
others because it also depends upon their cost structure and where they are. So it is
literally an item-by-item approach, not even a supplier-by-supplier or category-by-
category. It really goes down to the item level.
And we've had success at diﬀerent levels. But we're often able to mix it out. And one
of the examples on mixing. And I used this with a group earlier. So I apologize, I'm
going to use the same example. We've had an occasion where we had small kitchen
appliance that was subject to the tariﬀ. And there's a wide range of product. And
part of the category was growing really fast because it had the newer technology on
it. And the other part of the category really wasn't growing. We had volume there, we
had to keep it because of our broad assortment of good, better, best. But it wasn't
where the growth is. So we thought very carefully about if we are going to take
pricing, we're not going to take pricing on a high, fast velocity growth part. We're
going to put -- maybe burden the other part of the category a little bit more. So
we're mixing it out very diﬀerently. And it depends upon the individual situation.
Other times, it has been -- to your question, we just said no. And we've given them
reasons why we push back. And it has been absorbed. So it varies. And there's not
one case that ﬁts all.
In terms of where there's opportunity outside, (boy,) diﬀerent suppliers have
diﬀerent views of that. And it often comes down to how they want to run their
businesses. And I don't necessarily think you'll see, in a short term, massive industry
shifts versus supplier shifts. Now in the long run, that might change. But it's more a
supplier-by-supplier base right now. There's a few trends inside of a couple of
categories. But not everybody is moving.
I'm just going to take one more question. And we'll wrap it up.
Steve, you've mentioned CPG companies a couple of times now. Could you address
the question of these companies -- of many of these companies establishing their
own DTC, direct-to-consumer relationship with consumers and how you're handling
that? So it's about the channel disintermediation question. But also a who owns the
customer question.
{BIO 18295554 <GO>}
Yes. There are some of them that are -- they're working on those businesses. I would
say they're relatively small today and haven't been disruptive. But we have a lot of
very lively conversations about that and how we're going to handle that and the
businesses that they're planning on building and growing. Fundamentally, we think
we're the best way to reach customers. And we think we're the most eﬃcient way to
reach customers and we think we have the broadest reach and create the greatest
access and the best experience. So we're happy to have those discussions. And I'm
very conﬁdent that when we lay out our case and explain to them why we're a better
choice, many of them listen over time. Some don't. And I wish them well in terms ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-09-05

A - Steve Bratspieshow they build that out. But we're going to continue to run our model and build our
model because we think it's a winner.
Sometimes we learn from them about why they're doing it. We think maybe we need
to do some things diﬀerently to make sure we're engaging as broadly as we can. But
I think the Walmart brand is pretty powerful. And I think it is well positioned to serve
the vast majority of the U.S. We have -- 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of
Walmart. That's a pretty impressive and hard to compete with infrastructure. And as
we continue to leverage the forward-deployed inventory and using our stores'
fulﬁllment centers over time, the eﬃciency that we're going to bring out of that is
going to be really hard to compete with, especially kind of on a one-oﬀ brand basis.
