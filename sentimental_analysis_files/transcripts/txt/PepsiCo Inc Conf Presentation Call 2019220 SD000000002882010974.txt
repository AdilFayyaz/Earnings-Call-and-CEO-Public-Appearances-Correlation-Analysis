So we're ready for next presentation from PepsiCo. So we're very excited to have
PepsiCo back at CAGNY again this year. Joining us today for the ﬁrst time as
Chairman and CEO is Ramon Laguarta; along with Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh
Johnston; and VP of Investor Relations, Jamie Caulﬁeld.
Ramon, I'll turn it over to you.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Right. Good afternoon, everybody. Do I sound okay? Good. Thanks. Thanks, Bryan,
for your introduction. And thanks for hosting all of us, Hugh and Jamie, myself,
today. It's a pleasure to be in this beautiful place. For a Mediterranean guy, to be in
the sun is something invaluable. So thanks for taking me out of New York down to
the sun. And thanks for this terriﬁc event.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20

Page 2 of 16I must admit, for those of you who listen to the call on Friday, this might be a little bit
repetitive. And you guys might be probably tired of this faster, stronger and better
concept. But we will repeat it again. For those of you that were not on the call,
hopefully this is a good use of your time as you think about the next chapter for
PepsiCo.
Let me spend a couple of minutes on the process itself, how we got to this new
chapter. Because it was a good process for the management team. It got us all
together and it got us into a future vision that was very exciting for all of us. We spent
-- about 30, 35 people. So it was not only the top of the pyramid, it was a group of
senior leaders from the company, over four months, diﬀerent sessions, talking about
our performance historically and then trying to go after areas of dissatisfaction with
our performance. But also trying to align ourselves, what inspires us, what really
motivates us and what is the potential of our company? So the chapter you will see is
the aligned input or output of those sessions. And really, a common purpose for
what is the top management of the company overall.
There were 2 areas that, although we were quite happy with our historical
performance, as you will see, there were 2 areas that we said were not really
capturing the full potential of PepsiCo. And one was we're not gaining market share
consistently across the world. We have a lot of good pockets of great performance.
But we're not gaining share consistently. And second, we thought that the speed of
transformation of our capabilities, our cost, was not fast enough. So those 2 were the
2 areas of dissatisfaction. And that's what we want to call ourselves in this mission of
taking PepsiCo from being in a very good place to being in a great place.
And before I go into the detail, otherwise Jamie will kill me, please read the safe
harbor statement, or you can ﬁnd it in our -- in pepsico.com.
This chart summarizes the next chapter. So let me just spend a couple of minutes on
this chart. The key idea is we think we can deliver a balanced, sustainable ﬁnancial
performance. And therefore, good value for all of you as investors in PepsiCo, by
having a growth model that's based on an accelerated top line expansion with the
right levels of reinvestment so that we can transform ourselves over time and sustain
that performance.
And there are strategies around becoming faster, around becoming stronger,
around becoming better that are distinct from the past. And I'm trying to summarize.
And there are strategies around accelerated investments. So how we're going to be
investing in the business; about becoming a much more centric -- consumer-centric
company; the way we're organized; the way we think about our costs; the way we
think about our investment in capabilities, with very intentional areas where we want
to invest; and also the way we think about our purpose and how we integrate that
into our strategy. So let me unpack all of this in a couple of minutes.
Before that, I think what diﬀerentiates us from many other companies is we start from
a position of strength. We start from a very strong foundation. And this is not onlyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 16because we play in very attractive categories that grow very fast. They are large. So if
you think about our beverages category, it's almost $1 trillion globally and is growing
almost at 4%. The same with micro snacks. Micro snacks is almost $800 million
globally and growing even faster than beverages. So we compete in very strong
categories, complementary, a lot of common occasions between our 2 categories.
We have -- within those categories, we have very strong, leading brands. And we
have a very good product portfolio, as I'll show you later, that helps us cover a lot of
these spaces in those categories. And we can evolve the portfolio with our brands
into new spaces that get generated with new consumer needs.
We have a strong geographical footprint. We have a lot of positions of strength in
many countries around the world, both in developed and developing markets, from
which we can accelerate our growth.
In terms of the capabilities. We have strong, relevant capabilities in top line growth,
also in productivity, that we can scale across the globe.
Then we have, I think a diﬀerentiated culture that is centered around growth and a
very (good) talent in many parts of the world. I think that will become a competitive
advantage going forward.
With that, we've been delivering, I think good performance over the last few years.
So if you think of from 2012 to today, we've been delivering almost a 4%, 3.8% top
line growth. Although it's true that the last two years, we've been probably lagging a
little bit behind what we think is the potential of the company. We've been
expanding our core operating margins. We've been delivering 9% EPS year-after-
year. And we have been increasing our ROIC. And obviously, returning dividends
and share repurchases. So a pretty good ﬁnancial performance. But as I said, 2 things
that leave us dissatisﬁed is our marketplace performance; and it's the way we're
transforming ourselves, the speed of transformation of our (inaudible) to remain
competitive and within the marketplace.
So with that, let me go into the priorities that will set this next chapter of PepsiCo.
The ﬁrst one is about becoming faster. And this, of course, is the #1 priority for us, is
accelerating, increasing the speed of growth of our top line. And with 2 things:
becoming more consumer-centric in our innovation, the way we think about the
diﬀerent consumer spaces in our categories; but also taking a higher investment,
higher-growth posture against the opportunities that we have in the marketplace.
So 3 things here. First, we're going to play our portfolio against all the diﬀerent
multiple vectors in our categories, I'll show you later; and then investing in both our
large U.S. businesses and our international business for future expansion.
Before I go into the portfolio, there's a growth model that applies to both our snacks
and our beverages category. It's been proven for us over many years. And all our
commercial initiatives will be centered around this growth model. And this is a, what
we call, the 4 key beneﬁts that our consumers are looking for in our categories.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Number one is variety. And variety is very important in both snacks and beverages.
Those are 2 (relative) to our categories. I mean, the majority of consumers. And you
probably (yourself) yourself, snack several times a day, drink several times a day. And
you guys choose diﬀerent brands, both in snacks and beverages, for diﬀerent parts
of the day. (Having) a repertoire of brands and products that cover multiple demand
spaces, be it in the morning, at night, during the day, diﬀerent satiation needs in the
diﬀerent occasions for snacks or diﬀerent functionality in beverages, it is critical to
really capture all the occasions.
The other important piece for us is ubiquity. Ubiquity means -- we're an impulse
category. So the ability to be everywhere where you have the need for a snack or our
beverages creates a lot of value for you as a consumer and for us as a manufacturer.
So for us, investing in this capability of being everywhere is a must-do.
The third one is creating brands that obviously hook the consumer, creates higher
loyalty, creates that emotional link with our products.
And the fourth one is value. And value in developing market is clearly about
aﬀordability and price points. In developed markets, it's also aﬀordability. But it's
more about what are the beneﬁts that go with the product so that we have a full
consumer experience.
So everything you will see in our business. And we'll talk in the future, is around
giving the consumer those 4 key beneﬁts on a consistent way and on an advantaged
way.
Now our portfolios and how we think of our portfolios. You see, this is a -- I think a
great portfolio. Broad. It covers all the spaces from indulgent to nutritious. It covers
diﬀerent price points. It covers individual consumptions, social consumption. The
way we think about this portfolio, obviously, we will keep evolving the portfolio in all
the diﬀerent vectors. We want to maximize the coverage that we have, all the
diﬀerent occasions of micro snacks. But we think about the portfolio in a way that we
want to make sure that our global brands, our core brands are funded, they are
healthy, they keep being modernized, they stay relevant to the customer every other
time. Then we add to those big, global brands; big, core brands, some smaller
brands that will become bigger in the future but -- that will give us the growth. But
clearly, without our core brands healthy and growing, the whole portfolio doesn't
work.
As you think about snacks, obviously, the big idea for us is taking this (beautiful
portfolio) around the world. I must (say) we're not there right now. And that is a huge
opportunity per se. But the other idea is as you think consumers moving more
towards convenience and on-the-go, we will try to expand ourselves into occasions
that are closer to mini meals, very close to street foods in developing markets. And
that will be a huge area of growth for us going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 16You think about our beverage portfolio similarly. We have -- we cover indulgent
occasions. We cover nutritious occasions. We cover (personal). We cover hydration.
We cover a lot of diﬀerent locations. We have beautiful brands. And we have
solutions for many diﬀerent need states. As you think of ourselves in the future, we
will be innovating across all the diﬀerent spaces. Again, we want to make sure our
core brands stay healthy, well-funded, they grow. Then we will obviously invest in
new spaces that will deﬁne the category for the future.
Also, you should think of ourselves investing quite a lot in creating a beyond-the-
bottle space, what we call beyond the bottle. I mean SodaStream is a great example
of how we're thinking about new spaces of consumption that do not require a bottle
and still allow the consumer to personalize their consumption. And we eliminate the
need for a bottle and plastic and everything else. So that's from the portfolio point of
view.
In terms of the geographical priorities. We want to -- we had -- in this meeting we
had with our people, we saw that there were growth opportunities everywhere. And
including our beautiful U.S. business. And so if you think about the way we want to
invest, we want to fortify North America. North America is a huge part of our
business. It's healthy. It's growing. We want to make sure that those businesses are
well invested.
If we start with Frito, to me, is one of probably the best consumer companies in the
world, very well run, excellent management, excellent brands, great infrastructure.
But still huge opportunities. And I mentioned in the call on Friday, we're only 19% of
micro snacks. You think micro snacks, we're only 19%. So there's 80% of occasions
that we don't capture in -- with Frito-Lay in the U.S. You see channel opportunities,
geographical opportunities. So we think this is a business that, well-funded, will
capture much more growth. And obviously, we have huge return on investments on
this business. So we plan to invest in our manufacturing capacity. We plan to invest in
our brands. We plan to invest in our go-to-market and enable Frito-Lay to continue
this journey and also accelerate their market share performance.
The same applies to NAB. NAB, we know we have been underperforming the market
for the last couple of years. Our goal is to get the business back into growing with
the market. We know we have the brands to do it. We will -- and we started last year
repurposing some of our A&M against our (bigger brands), taking money away from
our smaller brands so we have a more holistic growth model.
We are investing in go-to-market. We think that we have opportunities to get more
(capillar), at the same time, improving the way we service our large customers. We
want to make sure that we have a cost-competitive and very ﬂexible supply chain
and also that we have an organizational model that allows us to service big, global
customers but also be very locally relevant. And that's the recent announcement you
saw on NAB. We're trying to have an organization that is able to be a bit more
ﬂexible in its pricing, in its understanding of the local routing and local opportunities.
And I think we will generate additional performance because of that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Internationally, you think about snacks, this is a great opportunity for us globally. I
mean we have strong positions in many markets, in developed markets, in a lot of
the developing markets. We have a very clear playbook on how to develop the
category, how to build per caps of our business and how to build strong market
positions, both with our potato chips. But some with our other products. So we will
replicate the models that we have in Mexico, we have in Turkey, we have in Russia,
we have in many markets around the world. We're going to try to replicate them
globally. And obviously, the big dream for developed markets is to have the
portfolio that I just showed you for Frito-Lay in all the developed markets. So if you
go to Australia, you go to Western Europe, that would be our dream, to have that
portfolio in those markets. And it's only a question of execution and discipline on the
execution.
When you go to beverages, there we have diﬀerent market positions in diﬀerent
parts of the world. We're going to have a much more nuanced approach to
beverages, investing more where we have the right to succeed, where we are
leaders or we have strong battleground positions; and then being more smart about
where we invest, how do we invest when we have a smaller market share. So again, I
think I covered this, where we're going to make investment. We're going to make
investments in manufacturing capacity, digitizing the business, supply chain, go-to-
market and A&M. Yes.
The second pillar of our strategy. And to me, is most important, is how do we
become stronger? And the word stronger to me is -- this gets to the operating
machine of the company. This really gets into the how do we operate in a way that
we are leaner, that we're more agile, that we're more focused, that we're more --
we're operating with more precision? So it's how do we get our supply chain, our
go-to-market, our insights, our marketing to be much more precise, agile? And that
is a journey that, if we do it right, I'm sure we'll do it right, will give us the
sustainability of the accelerated model. So that -- this is what keeps the model
sustaining itself and allowing for us to become more competitive every day versus
our competitors in the marketplace.
There are 3 things that we put here. One is elevating cost to a much more strategic
role in the company. So we want to make sure that cost and cost management and
cost transformation get a lot of management time. And we have -- as I show you, we
have a playbook. We have some very clear principles. And we're going to transform
holistically our cost structure on an ongoing basis, adopting technology, adopting
data in a way that allows us to execute with more eﬃciency, at the same time, be
more eﬀective.
Then we're going to be very intentional on where we invest those savings. There are
a few things that will make us really perform much better in the marketplace. And
those are the capabilities we really want to be best in class. And they will give us the
superior performance. I'll talk to you about it. These are capabilities in the areas of
consumer, customer and an end-to-end supply chain, which is going to be a big
accelerator.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 16And the third point is all this will not happen if we don't have the right talent, a
diﬀerentiated culture that is focused on high performance and an organization that
allows us to be very locally relevant, winning every geography. But at the same time,
be connected as a company in what could make a diﬀerence globally. So let me
unfold that a bit better.
In terms of cost. We're going to work on 4 areas -- 4 big areas of cost. Obviously,
redesigning work so that we create better jobs. And at the same time, reduce labor
costs, right. So we're seeing that some of our positions, our jobs, our current jobs,
will not be sustainable in the future. People don't want to do them anymore. We
need to rethink them. So we're rethinking the way we operate in our warehouses,
some of our sell-in, even some of our back-oﬃce roles, we need to really side them
with technology in a way that will create better jobs for our employees. And in that,
there will be a lot of, I think, eﬃciency. And then we'll do the work in a better way.
Obviously, reducing nonlabor cost. Increasing the ROI of the commercial
investments. And by that, I mean trade, space management cost and obviously A&M,
getting into a much more rigorous way of understanding the return on those
investments. Then increasing the utilization of assets, be it warehouses, be it vans, be
it factories, be it our oﬃces.
And we -- as a group, we created a set of cost principles that we're going to apply
across the company. And those principles are not rocket science. But I think they
give us a very clear expected behavior from all of us. And this is -- the ﬁrst one is very
relevant, which is local aﬀordability ﬁrst. We want to be competitive in every market
around the world. And clearly, developed market costs cannot apply to developing
markets. And so we need to think locally as we think about being competitive in
every single market around the world. There are things like multifunctional
collaboration. We think the next generation of value will be created by functions
collaborating on an end-to-end of any process versus the very vertical functional
optimization. And you will see one example as I talk about end-to-end supply chain,
that (inaudible) is about the supply chain, factories, the go-to-market and marketing
working together to unlock value.
And so there is a few principles that I think are very important. This one on not all
capabilities and costs are equal is a very important one. We tend to invest in many,
many things in our company. Making sure that we're very intentional on which
capabilities will make the diﬀerence is a very important metric.
So we will -- as we apply those principles, we will change our operating models. And
you saw the announcement in NAB this week. And we just changed also our
operating model in the Asia, in AMENA region, trying to be much delayered and
faster, agile. We will look at global business services as a way to service the company
in a much more intentional way. We'll look at go to market. And for example, what I
mean by this is if you think about, for example, our Mexico business, we are -- by
applying technology to that business. We used to call on, I don't know, 22 stores per
day on a normal route. By applying technology, we're able to increase that to 25 per
day, reduce the number of hours that our employees work to the concept of making
the work and the jobs more better for our employees. And at the same time, we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 16able to execute with much more precision, creating closed loops of executional
management that we didn't have before. So clearly, a win of eﬃciency, be much
more eﬀective and ways that we will win in the marketplace. These are all the areas
where we will be attacking.
In terms of where we want to reinvest and which are the things that we believe will
make us a better company if we're best-in-class. And there are 5 of them. There's
what we call consumer intimacy. You could call it consumer-ing or understanding
consumers. I'll try to unfold that a bit more detail.
Building indispensable brands. Clearly, that has changed, how you used to build
brands and how you build brands today. And so we need to adapt ourselves to the
new reality.
How do you have top innovation that is based on science and is based on design?
So we're good at that. We want to become really best in class.
The fourth one is very critical. As the consumers are moving into multichannels or
omnichannels, we need to be able to service them in all these channels without
friction. And that is a capability that we're building. We're good in e-commerce.
We're good in DSDs. I'm not sure we're good in putting it all together. So that's the
idea.
Then end-to-end supply chain. As we look at the future and we're able to
disaggregate demand and understand consumers with much more detail, our ability
to service that complexity will depend on having a very ﬂexible supply chain. So it
doesn't work if you understand your consumers in a very granular level and you're
unable to service that because you have very rigid supply chain. So having end-to-
end supply chain agility, being able to service your consumers in very diﬀerent
channels and with the complexity of the portfolio that we'll have in the future is a key
capability.
Let me tell you about consumer intimacy just to get a sense of what we mean. And
we'll talk more because, clearly, that's an area where you should know we're
investing the money. And hopefully, we get returns from it.
So building consumer intimacy. This is the journey, for example, for the U.S. business.
So we want to do 6 things. The ﬁrst one is, obviously, understanding the consumer in
a much more granular way. We used to understand consumers in groups of millions,
cohorts or those big words. Now we're trying to understand at the household or
individual level with multiple sources of data. Once you have that information, you
can then go into personalized communication. This is an area that we're doing a lot.
But we will do much more. Now we're maybe creating 20 messages for 100
audiences. In the future, we'll be creating 1,000 messages for 1 million audiences,
this kind of magnitude of complexity in our communication. Clearly, having a
machine that understands the return on your investments, to the point of commercialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 16investment optimization that allows us to understand much more real-time, what is
the best way to invest our money to get the best return for sales.
Then the last one is very critical, which is okay, eventually, we want to get to a place
where we can have almost personalized pricing or personalized pricing for a group
of consumers so we maximize the value creation for each consumption occasion. So
that is the type of capability we're investing on.
The same one I was talking about end-to-end value chain and how do we unlock
this, this cannot be unlocked by marketing working in silo and sales working in silo
and the manufacturing and warehousing guys working in silo. This is the new way of
unlocking value for companies, which is multi-functions working together with the
same set of information against the same principles. And these were -- by us
understanding consumers in a very granular way, being able to leverage our DSD to
cover much more than just retail outlets that we go today, go supply in e-commerce
and supply many other channels. And then have the ﬂexibility of our infrastructure,
manufacturing infrastructure, to supply that complexity is going to be a big
accelerator of growth for us. And to tell you the truth, we're not even 6% of the
journey here. So that's a big opportunity for us to do much better as we think about
the future.
Okay. I think that's all. I covered that. But clearly, we would not be able to realize all
this without changing our leadership behaviors, changing the way we're organized
in a way that is much more empowering our local markets, our local organizations, to
be closer to the consumer, have local portfolios, have local go-to-market systems,
have local A&M. And that is going to give us, I think, a bigger return. But at the same
time, we need to connect the company. We need to connect it because is a global
scale and we can bring a lot of value as a global company to our local operations. So
that's the complexity of how we want to get organized.
The same with the culture, their behaviors around being faster, being more agile, act
as owners, that we want to make sure that every one of our associates lives those
values. And that will be, I think, a competitive advantage for PepsiCo going forward.
And the last point is very important to me. And it's very important to all of our
associates, which is we want to be a better company, a company that really makes an
impact in the planet, makes an impact in the communities we service, make an
impact with our own associates. And we're going to double down on this. We're
going to double down on how do we become a better citizen. But we want do it in a
way that we integrate it with our commercial strategies.
So for example, the SodaStream acquisition is a clear example of how we want to
connect our commercial strategy with our purpose. So SodaStream allows us to
improve the use of -- or reduce the use of plastics. Okay, to me, the way of we grow
and also we help the planet. So we want to do more of those and make sure that
purpose becomes integrated with the way we're going to accelerate the company.
There's 4 areas where we want to make a diﬀerence: Making a sustainableFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20

Page 10 of 16Q - Bryan Douglass Spillane
Q - Andrea Faria Teixeira
A - Ramon Luis Laguartaagriculture; reduce the water consumption. But make actually positive water impact;
creating a circular packaging economy; and then obviously, continue the
improvement of our products, reducing salt, reducing fat and reducing sugar.
So those are the kind of the long-term strategies that will feed our long-term value
creation. We talked on Friday about our guidance for '19. Three key numbers here.
We want to grow 4%, at least 4%. We want to grow 4% as we -- and then obviously, in
future years, we'll get better, we'll grow 4.5%, 5%. But this year is a 4% year. We want
to invest back in our business in a way that it helps our acceleration, it helps our
transformation.
We guide a minus 1% constant currency EPS. There are some factors that Hugh and
Jamie talked -- took you the other day, which is we're going to have -- we'll have an
increase of our tax rate of about 2 points going into next year. We're lapping some
one-oﬀs last year in terms of strategic asset sales or refranchise. Then the rest is
investments in the business to make sure that we really deliver on our commitments
for an accelerated growth. We're increasing our CapEx as well in a way that,
especially in the next two years, we can -- this is a lot of capacity, a lot of
manufacturing capacity and system capacity.
Okay. And with that, a ﬁnal slide. We're convinced as a team. As I told you, it was an
aligned process of the management, the whole management team. We're convinced
that there -- PepsiCo is a growth company. We're very lucky of the categories where
we operate. We're very good, strong in those categories. That, I think, allows us to
promise that we can be a faster-growth company, a company that creates more value
by being a fastest-growth company. And with that, a balanced ﬁnance performance,
expanding our margins every year 20 to 30 basis points and then being a high
single-digit EPS, consistent ﬁnancial delivery.
With that, I think we'll take questions. So we have 20 minutes.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2147799 <GO>}
Okay. And let's start with Andrea Teixeira.
{BIO 1941397 <GO>}
So Andrea Teixeira from JP Morgan. I wanted to just double click on NAB. Obviously,
you've given some sort of a bridge of a recovery. And you have said that even within
the ﬁscal '19, we should be expecting some stabilization of market share. So if you
can elaborate more on how the plan that you have built into this guidance can lead
us to (believe). And if you can also elaborate in terms of how much money will be
invested back within NAB.

Page 11 of 16Q - Bryan Douglass Spillane
Q - W illiam Bates Chappell
A - Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. And I will not go into speciﬁcs, obviously, for competitive reasons. But what I'd
like you to take away is that we started this year already investing in NAB on a serious
way. It was an A&M-focused investment against our core brands. We're seeing a
good response on some of our core brands, especially Pepsi. Pepsi is growing nicely.
And so we're back to growth. There are some other brands that need a bit more fuel.
But the way we're investing this year is more also on go-to-market. You saw the
changes we're making in our organizational structure that would allow us to be much
more locally relevant and faster. So you should think of NAB as a multiple-dimension
investment, both in growth but also in capabilities and in organizational executional
power.
{BIO 2147799 <GO>}
Bill Chappell?
{BIO 1737315 <GO>}
Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Maybe if you could step back, understand the kind of 4-
month process. But in your opinion, kind of how did you get there? Especially from
NAB of kind of falling a little bit behind? And was this a process of you're taking
over, we need to turn the page and look at everything once again? Or was it we have
a real problem we need to address? And just help me kind of understand the
process of how the company got to this state.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
I think it's -- I mean you've seen the performance over the last six years. It's a pretty
good performance, right? But as we got together as a group, we said, "Okay. Are we
happy with our performance?" And we said, after a really long -- this was, I think, how
many, 4 sessions or 5 sessions of two days. We said, "I think we can aspire to more." I
think we wanted to have -- as a group, we were dissatisﬁed with a couple of areas,
which I mentioned, especially the share of market performance, not only NAB. I think
there's opportunities in other markets. So we said, "No. We want to aspire to be. And
we can be, a company that gains market share consistently across all the markets,"
and that's what we want to be.
So I wouldn't focus on NAB per se. I think as a company, you should think of we're
operating beautiful categories that are on trend, that are growing 4%, that are
massive globally, they're aspirational for many people around the world. They serve
a lot of -- we serve a lot of needs that are unmet. So we think that we -- in those
categories, we operate from positions strength in many of those markets. So why not
investing?
And we went through the rigorous process of understanding opportunities and then
say, "Okay, what if we ﬁrst take discretionary funds that we have today in the
business and we apply them to those opportunities?" Okay, yes, we can grow faster.
And second, are there still opportunities that are unmet? And we said, "Yes." Then
we said, "Why not? Well let's go and invest more to accelerate the business," and set
for ourselves what is, I think a much more aspirational mission, which is we want to
be a (growth) company. We want to be top-tier growth company. And we want to
have a growth model for all of you, as investors, where we deliver balanced ﬁnancialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20

That was the process.
It's really -- it's not a new book for PepsiCo. It's actually a new chapter for us. It's a
new chapter that ﬂows very nicely from the foundation we've created over so many
years and being in categories that grow, (building) strong positions. And now it's
more of a -- we know where we can invest. And we know that to maintain that
acceleration, we need to transform ourselves. So that's what I'm saying. Being faster
is important. And I think we can do it. But being stronger is what's going to make us
faster over the long term. So our ability to transform ourselves, build real capabilities
that are diﬀerentiated, look at our costs in a very aggressively and think, "Are there
better ways to do things that are more eﬃcient, eﬀective?" That's the charcoal that is
going to make us a better-performing company sustainably. So that's how I would
life for you guys to think about PepsiCo in the future.

Okay. Ali Dibadj?
{BIO 15328592 <GO>}
So in that process, in the 4, 5 meetings in the 4, ﬁve months that you went through,
how did you get comfortable about the ROI to get to what sounds pretty ambitious,
given what we've heard all week, the 4% to 6% in particular top line growth, the high
single-digit EPS growth? And I ask that in the context of 2 things. One is the
nutritious versus indulgent spectrum that you -- actually it's up there, actually that
(was the) equivalent of the spectrum. So I'm not sure that nut mix is that big of a
category for you. But beverages, I haven't had in a while. So I don't know how big of
a category that is for you. And I think the cooler in the back is Coke products,
actually, outside. So those are really small categories. And they're growing quick. So
in that context, number one, how do you get to 4% to 6%? And number two is,
everything that we've heard from the food companies this whole week is that they're
not food companies, they're snacks companies. So I'll almost re-ask the question I
asked last year at this time, which is how does that impact your view on Frito-Lay in
terms of getting that same growth targets? So again, I'll just try to get to that one.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yes. A couple of things, Ali. I'd begin with the fact that we really started investing in
the business kind of second half of '17 and into '18. If you recall, we talked a lot about
that with North America Beverages. And we saw responsiveness to those
investments, some of which was incremental investment which we funded from
elsewhere in the P&L; some of which was shifting resources from products that,
frankly, we launched and didn't do as well, the Lemon Lemons of the world and
things like that. But it was the response that we saw to the advertising in particular
that encouraged us to do more. Now truth be told, as we were investing in some of
the smaller products, our competitor was investing primarily behind CSDs. And we
needed to do some things there to be more competitive as well. All of this is not
news, we've discussed all this in the past. So that gave us some level of conﬁdence.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20

Page 13 of 16A - Ramon Luis Laguarta
Q - Bryan Douglass SpillaneWe also -- as we started to put a bit more money behind Frito-Lay, we saw
remarkable responsiveness there as well. It was clear that the business could use
more investment not because it was coming from a position of weakness. But rather
quite the opposite, a position of strength with -- combined with more investment
would result in what we felt were going to be much better outcomes for that
business over time, certainly in the U.S. and then internationally as well. Our snacking
position internationally, obviously, is quite large. Our market shares are quite good.
The opportunity there, we've talked about in the past, is per-capita consumption
development. And we do that through a combination of basically the model that
Ramon showed earlier. So I think it was the -- some of the experience that we had,
along with what we know are good structural and category advantages that led us to
the conclusion, we think we can do this and earn a really good return for investors
over time.
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yes. And Ali, to your point on snacks and the competition there. Obviously, the fact
that everybody's trying to go into snacking tells you that there's tailwinds to that
category in terms of people are going to unstructured meals. And obviously, they are
snacking more and more every day. So that's -- from a concept, that's, I think we all
understand. We have very strong positions. So I mean it's hard to -- when you peel
the layers of advantage that we have in that snack business, from the farming all the
way to the execution at point of sale, the brands we have, we have pretty high
chances of capturing that growth. So we want to make sure that our -- all our units
are well funded, that they have the muscle to compete when those other players
come into the market.
And our experience is that the more we are in the category, the more we're investing
in each one in our brands, in our innovation, that drives the category. That drives
more space in the store. It drives more consumer GRPs on the categories. So it's
normally positive. So we're looking at this as a, ﬁrst, these are good categories;
second, we feel comfortable that with the right level of investment and capabilities
we have, we can win in those categories; and third, we like the fact that there's
multiple players developing categories. If you think about any developing market,
like I don't know, Turkey or Pakistan or whatever, the per caps is less than a kilo, less
than a kilo per person. If you think about our developed markets, U.K. or here or
Canada, we're talking about 10 kilos-plus. Imagine the opportunity we have. And we
cannot do it on ourselves. It's great to have multiple players trying to develop that
category. So it's good news for us in terms of, yes, these could be high-growth
territories for us. So we're ready for competing. We respect everybody. I mean we
like competition, actually. If anything, sometimes our snacks people become a bit
arrogant because they have 70% share in some categories. So we want our people
to be motivated and be challenged and to give their best. And I think competing is a
very good way for us to be a better-performing business. So that's how we're
thinking about it. And I don't want to sound arrogant in a way. But I want to make
sure that you guys understand that we feel good about our snacks business, our
ability to capture share and to keep developing the categories.

Great. So in the past, it's been challenging. And it's -- look, it's diﬃcult to do. But it's
been challenging for you to balance some focus on the brand health of the larger,
more important brands. And at the same time, nurture and grow smaller, faster-
growing brands. So is the answer to that just more investment in general? Because
it's a little bit what I'm hearing. Or are there other things that you're doing to
improve the execution? Maybe changes in the incentive system, changing in the
network, in which you can do better, have a better balance doing that?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
I think it's a combination of all of them. I think the fact that we're putting more
investments in the business tells you that, yes, we think that there is a more sustained
way -- sustainable way to invest both in the growth of our core brands and investing
in our smaller brands. The funding for those investments will come, I think, from
many areas. One is repurposing money from other parts. And that's the process we
did, repurposing money from the discretionary funds into a better funding model for
our core and smaller brands. Second and very important, the process that I was
talking about is getting stronger by really elevating cost to a much more strategic
role in the way we manage the company. We will be able to generate the right
amount of savings that we'll be reinvesting both in capabilities and in our brands.
And I think that's how you should think about it. The third element is not irrelevant, is
this one I was talking about, about a higher return on investment on our commercial
investments. That is a very important piece of the improvement of the company and
how, by taking trade, A&M, space management and some of the other growth
drivers and making sure that we're a bit more scientiﬁc in the way we allocate money
to drive growth, I think that's going to help us as well. So it is all the above. And we
feel comfortable that we will have a much more balanced growth between our core
and in our smaller brands going forward.
{BIO 2147799 <GO>}
Okay. So Brett Cooper, then we're going to come to Judy Hong, please.
{BIO 17398526 <GO>}
Two questions. And I think it was in 2012, we went through a rebase. We've rebased
today. So what gets put in place in the future to avoid that happening, whether it be
5, 6, seven years down the road? Then just wondering philosophically, how you
address, like, you need more brands in a world where the consumer is more
fragmented, your competitors are smaller so forth and so on?
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yes. In terms of your ﬁrst question, Brett, 2012 was, I think fairly diﬀerent from where
we are right now. In 2012, we were really re-basing, I think, from more of a position of
weakness. Advertising and marketing had gotten down to about 5.2% of sales.
During and perhaps just a bit after the ﬁnancial crisis, the organization was pushing
to make targets that were challenging in that economic and consumer environment.
Contrast that with today, where the company really has been performing prettyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20

A - Ramon Luis Laguartastrongly now for 5 or six years. This is much more around realizing, I think, a set of
excellent opportunities that present themselves because of our categories, because
of the structural advantages that we have in place and because the leadership team
is highly execution-focused on both delivering ﬁnancial results and consistently
gaining market share, which means the revenue growth rates will be higher. That
higher level of revenue growth will lead you to a sustainable level of ﬁnancial
performance, which should basically put us in a position where we can reinvest in
the future while delivering around our long-term ﬁnancial targets.
{BIO 2147799 <GO>}
We have Judy, yes, please.
{BIO 22723741 <GO>}
Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. So one is just a quick clariﬁcation, Ramon, just your
aspiration on market share gains in NAB. Is there a distinction in terms of focusing on
gaining within a segment? So gaining share in sports drinks, CSDs versus the
broader non-alcoholic ready-to-drink category? Then my broader question is just in
terms of your decision to keep the North American bottling assets in-house. How
much of that is because you don't want the disruption while the business is trying to
improve its market share performance versus you fundamentally see an advantage
of keeping that business and sort of enabling you to be faster as you kind of think
about that business going forward?
{BIO 18967774 <GO>}
Yes. On the NAB question, I think we talked Friday. I think we believe that this is a
business that we'll make great by working on 4 things, right. One is having very
strong brands that are well funded and cover all these spaces. And I think that is a
question of resources, innovation and marketing versus franchising, not
refranchising. The second one is by, we want to make sure that we service our
customers, the large national customers, with the best service possible across the
country. Then we're able to cover the small up and down the street and smaller
(brands) with the same level of high service and precision. And I think there, for the
large customers always, I think we have an advantaged model being an integrated.
And so we have one piece of innovation, we can roll it out across the whole country.
We can respond to any sort of promotion. We can give better service overall. So for
the large customers, there's no doubt in my mind that having an integrated model is
better. For the smaller customers, what we're trying to do is, with this new
organization, is make sure that we have the local servicing also better understood.
So I don't think it is anything to do with the refranchising model, it's having an
organization that can react to the local opportunities in a much more agile way. So
that's how we're approaching it now. The third piece is having a very ﬂexible and
very eﬃcient supply chain. And to me, our integrated model is also a way to have
much, much better utilization of assets across the whole country. The fourth one has
to be with culture. Has to do with culture and high-performance culture. And there,
you would say, "Okay, sometimes, smaller companies act much more as owners than
large companies." So it's a process of how do we, along with the organizational
change, we create a culture of ownership, we create a culture of agility and quick
decision making, which I think we can do. We have it in Frito, we can do it in NAB.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-02-20

success factors. Then when you say, "Okay. Are we better oﬀ in a refranchise model
or an integrated model?" we say, "Listen, I think we're better oﬀ as we are." Then,
again, when you add the complexity of a potential refranchising, you say, "It doesn't
work at all." So that's how the thought process is right now. And we're comfortable
with this decision. We're actually pretty, pretty conﬁdent. And we're seeing the
market...
