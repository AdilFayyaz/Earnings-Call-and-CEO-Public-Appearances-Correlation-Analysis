I'm Stephen Ju with the Credit Suisse Internet Equity Research Team. Welcome to the
conversation with Sridhar Ramaswamy, Senior Vice President of Advertising and
Commerce of Google. Before we start, I will read oﬀ the safe harbor statement.
Some of the statements that Mr. Ramaswamy will make today may be considered
forward-looking. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to diﬀer materially. Any forward-looking statements that
Mr. Ramaswamy makes are based on assumptions as of today. And Alphabet
undertakes no obligation to update them. Please refer to Alphabet's Form 10-K for a
discussion of the risk factors that may aﬀect its results.
So before we kick it oﬀ, I think there may be some of you who may not be as familiar
with Sridhar's role at Google. So I wanted to kick it oﬀ with a brief bio. Sridhar
oversees all of Google's advertising and commerce products, which includes Search,
Display, Video Advertising, Analytics, Shopping, Payments. And Travel. He joined
Google as an engineer back in 2003. And since then, he's been an integral part of
the growth of AdWords and Google's advertising businesses.
Prior to joining Google, Sridhar was Director of Engineering for the analytics
platform at E.piphany. He also held research positions at Bell Labs, Lucent
Technologies, Bell Communications Research. And Bell Corp. Sridhar earned a
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology at
Madras. And he has a Master's Degree of Science and a Ph.D. in Computer Science
from Brown University. He has also published numerous papers on database systems
and database theory and holds several patents in that area.
Also, another preamble. And the last one, I promise, we are launching a new piece of
technology this year in which you can now ﬁre up the CS Technology app,
conference app. And type in your questions. So open your app and hit the AgendaFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29

So without any further ado, we'll start the Q&A. So Sridhar, we have seen you present
at the Google Performance Summit as well as other industry meetings. But this is
probably the ﬁrst time that you are speaking in a room full of investors. So would you
give us a quick glimpse into your day-to-day responsibilities and where you spend
most of your time?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Thank you, Stephen. Glad to be here. I run the Ads and Commerce teams. And when
I think of our priorities, both within my team and to external groups, we, as a team,
focus on key areas like search, video advertising, programmatic advertising. And
app-install ad promotion. And much of the focus of my team for the past couple of
years has been on mobile. That's where the growth is; that's not very surprising. And
so a lot of the time that I end up spending day to day is on product development
and commercialization of our products in these key areas.
We continue to make large and dramatic changes to our products. I think the pace of
innovation is really, it's a strength and a necessity because the world around us is
changing so rapidly. So a lot of time is spent on product development. I also work
very closely with Philipp Schindler, who's the Head of Sales, on how we actually take
these products and commercialize them and take it to our advertisers and make sure
that they realize the value that we think our products can provide for them.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Now, two years ago, we had Neal Mohan here on the stage. He talked about one of
the priorities, that Google was to quote-unquote crack brand advertising. Where are
we now versus two years ago? Where do you think the remaining pain points are?
What problems do you feel like you still need to solve for your advertisers?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes. A lot of our brand advertising strategy, unsurprisingly, is centered around
YouTube, which is just an amazing, amazing consumer property with incredible
growth. We've talked about mobile growth being in the many, many tens of %, for
example. And so our brand advertising has been focused on things like how do we
get our largest advertisers to reach the kind of audience that they increasingly
cannot reach with traditional TV.
And YouTube and Google is doing very well in video advertising. But I'd say it's still
pretty early. Just this year, we announced a lot of product changes. We're very
excited about a new format called Bumpers, which is a six-second ad that we think is
very, very suitable for mobile. And programs like Google Preferred continue to doFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29

Stephen Juvery well in terms of attracting commitment and TV dollars. We're going to see a lot
more change come through in how brand advertising is doing.
I would say we are doing well. We have real and large relationships with some of the
largest brand advertisers in the world. But it's still early. There's still lots more
opportunity in growth.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. You talked about the rate of change before and the need to keep up.
Google has been a very heavy investor in AI. So would you talk about your
advancements here in machine learning and how this is helping you and your team,
whether it's in the rollout of consumer-facing products or tools to help advertisers
make better decisions?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
So Ads has been one of the earliest and largest users of machine learning at Google
and, frankly, the world. This is because we've been very intimately involved with
things like predicting click-through rates of ads, which show us good an ad is for a
consumer. And we have done this from very early on, because we've also used these
predicted click-through rates to price ads. So machine learning has been an integral
part of the ad system, pretty much since the time I joined. And gosh, that was like
2003.
And as new waves of machine learning, whether it's algorithms based on boosting
or, more recently, algorithms based on deep learning and neural networks, have
been developed, we are often eager and early adopters of this technology. And so
deep learning and neural networks now are an integral part of how ads are served,
both on search and on display. And we continue to work closely with these teams.
We develop many of these innovations ourselves because it has such a big impact
on us. But we continue to work closely with these teams to take the latest and
greatest in their technologies and make our prediction algorithms more and more
eﬃcient.
I would say, again, keeping up with the pace of change that's going on here is really
important and yields rich dividends for the ad team and for Google.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. Now, after some of the more recent controversies and topics from investors,
take a step back and look at what spurred Google's advertising revenue growth over
the last 24 months or so. Some of it seems like it has come from an increase in ad
load on both Search as well as YouTube. We're not used to thinking about Google
running out of inventory any point soon. But how worried should investors be in
terms of hitting some sort of a ceiling when you take the sponsored links from two to
three and four, in some cases?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29

Sridhar Ramaswamy
Stephen Ju{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes. So it is really important. And I've stressed this in meetings with many of you. I've
stressed this to my team. I've stressed this, again, externally, that we put the user ﬁrst
when it comes to consumer experiences. So we've built up elaborate methodologies
that we have published papers on for things like ad blindness, the cost of serving
ads to users. And we always optimize for the long term.
While it is true that we're serving four top ads -- four ads, for example -- on a very
small fraction of queries. And you can determine this number empirically yourself,
just by running a basket of queries, I'll point out that that is a very small number. And
this total number are this little fraction of queries on which we show ads overall has
more or less remained constant over the last 10 years. Because user behavior in
terms of what they search for in terms of commercial content hasn't really changed a
whole lot. And so we think of ourselves as very careful stewards of the user
experience. And we have the mathematical expertise to actually ﬁgure out, is a
change like this good for the long term? What's okay. And what's not okay? And
we're pretty happy with the trade-oﬀs that we've made over the past many years.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. Back to the topic of brand advertising. And TV in particular, TV ad dollars
seem fairly resilient, despite what looks like ongoing declines in ratings. So can you
help us reconcile this with the growth rates that YouTube is experiencing?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
It's one of those cases where I don't particularly feel like this has to be an either/or.
And increasingly, if people want to reach audiences of a certain age -- the younger
audience, for example -- YouTube is kind of the place to be. And the reach that
YouTube oﬀers -- again, we have published stats on this -- in terms of things like the
18; to 34-year-old demographic, say, on mobile, where it's larger than that of any
cable TV channel, it's pretty remarkable.
So we have been very good at providing advertising for a very large set of our
clients. Regarding whether there is going to be a mass shift from TV this year versus
that year, that question tends to vary by country. In western Europe, I think TV is still
well more established. And in the US, you also see more and more people coming
up with unbundled packages for consumers to use and stuﬀ like that. I think there's a
big convergence that's going on. So it might end up being the case that there's not
really like one moment in time where there's a mass shift, where everybody adopts
each other's techniques in a pretty big way.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. Another topic that's a recent topic on investors' minds, I think everybody's
consumed with the topic of seeing the anniversarying of the beneﬁts that Google
saw from the additional sponsor links on the Third Quarter of last year. But at theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29

Stephen Jurecent performance you were onstage to introduce an array of new products and
services, updates, including expanded text ads and the ability to bid individually
across diﬀerent devices. So will you give us an update on how these initiatives are
going?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes. Back to the point of needing to innovate continuously, this is still a very nascent
ﬁeld. Mobile commerce is still evolving. We'll talk a little bit more later on about what
we, like my team, is doing to make mobile commerce more eﬃcient. But we think we
need to continue to drive the user experience forward.
So at the Performance Summit, we introduced what we call enhanced text ads, a new
format, two little, separate headlines, more suitable for mobile, a cleaned-up, visible
URL. While these seemed like cosmetic changes, trying to get a business that is tens
of billions of dollars large to shift completely over from an old format to a new
format is the change that we are in the process of making.
It's going pretty well. Advertisers are seeing pretty positive results in many cases
from these. Similarly, tablet bidding was a control that many of our advertisers
wanted. They felt like they could realize diﬀerential value from doing this. And so
that's going pretty well. Things like re-marketing for search ads with (inaudible), that
is also something that a lot of advertisers are taking advantage of. In addition, we've
also continued to work on innovations within the core of our mobile search ads work.
All of these have kept the momentum going there. And things like the enhanced text
ads migration, we expect to be well on our way to ﬁnishing it up in the ﬁrst half of
next year.
So overall good, positive momentum in the ecosystem and good, positive
momentum in the value that advertisers are getting from mobile.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay. So I think there's, in some quarters and under, I get the perception that there's
a lurch forward because of a new product innovation. But the case that you want to
make is one of continuous innovation.
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
And again, as an engineer and product leader at Google, I focus on how can you get
the most changes out the fastest? When you start worrying about a year-on-year
comparison to a nice change you're about to launch, you're in trouble. Clearly, there
is a strong belief on the part of management, on the part of my team, that we will
continue to drive that innovation forward. And that's really what we push for.

Stephen Ju
Sridhar RamaswamyGot you. You have also spoken at conferences about being mobile ﬁrst at Google.
Does this open up possibilities for Google to better address the roughly 85% of
commerce that is not yet happening online? And to this end, you have introduced
new features to help advertisers attract store visits. What has been the reaction from
advertisers. And how nascent is this opportunity for you?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes. So I've talked in a number of places about how mobile can drive an enormous
amount of local commerce. As Stephen said, 80-plus % of commerce happens
locally. And advertising clearly inﬂuences some of it. But how do you create product
that actually make a measurable diﬀerence to retailers?
So we worked on things like local inventory ads, which is now a three-year-old
product that helps you see what is available from the stores around you. In addition,
we have done things like put location extensions in your search for a store or a
particular product so that the advertiser can tell you, "Hi. this product -- a bicycle -- is
actually available in this store that is next to you."
So based on our location data that we get from people that use our apps and
phones, we released a product called Services about -- I think it was two Decembers
ago, 2014. And we've been scaling it up to more and more countries, in 10 or 11
countries. So roughly speaking, an advertiser can see how many store visits to the
locations that they give us that actually are driven by clicks that happened on their
ad.
That's one thing to see. A lot of them are very happy to see this metric. But of course,
there are follow-up questions of how much of this is incremental? How do I value this
in the context of the advertising dollars that I'm spending overall? Some people are
able to make the math work for them, where they take things like average order
value that a consumer spends when they walk into a store and back out a value that
they should be putting into bidding or spending.
But as you can imagine, this is a complicated process, because most retailers
manage their local store budget, advertising budget, completely diﬀerent from their
online budget. And it's really these conversations that we are in the process of
driving, I would say they are still -- early, nascent conversations, how to turn it all into
an eﬃcient feedback loop that Google search advertising is so famous for. That's a
work in progress.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Building on the oﬄine commerce discussion, I think Google has recently taken steps
to show advertising on maps.
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes, yes.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29

Stephen Ju
Sridhar Ramaswamy{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
How is this progressing. And what are the challenges to monetizing maps
eﬀectively?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
It's still super early. We are very conscious of the need to be, again, very thoughtful
about user experience and user value. When I ﬁrst announced it, some of the
reporters were like, "Oh, are you going to show ads, then, on our driving directions?
That might be distracting." So we are still iterating on the format. We are running a
number of experiments. It's pretty early to say anything deﬁnite about it. But it's an
area that we will continue to invest in. You'll see more about it in the next few
months.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. Let's talk about travel, switch gears a little bit. So you recently released
Google Trips, the app itself, which helps consumers plan their trips better. It seems
like to me that between ﬂight and hotel search, the underlying pieces are there for
Google to create probably an intermodal search engine. If I wanted to go on a trip to
Barcelona, I'll need to just, "Barcelona," it should be able to put together the entire
trip for me. Is Google Trips basically the ﬁrst step toward that goal?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
So I would place this into a larger context of mobile search needing to satisfy your
goal or your task as opposed to answering a query that you have currently. This is a
vision that Larry has talked about before publicly, a vision of assist and suggest,
where we do more than answer a query.
What you're seeing in Travel is one expression of that. And this is where you see the
full strength of Google come into play. Google Flights is an amazing product. It can
answer questions that most other search engines, ﬂight search engines, cannot really
answer -- questions like, "I want to go to a sunny place," or, "What are all the
locations I can ﬂy to from San Francisco within a certain budget range?" So we are
pretty excited by that. We're pretty excited by our ability to make recommendations
to you. For example, if you visit a new place and use the Trips app, you can come up
with a list of essentially highlights around you that you can go and visit. And I've
been pleasantly surprised. And I've gone to diﬀerent towns and realized, "Wow,
there's a dam right next door." So I think we are interested, ﬁrst and foremost, in
creating a great consumer experience.
We think things like monetization in areas like hotels and other places that you might
look at will naturally come. So our scale product is still Search. And if we can help
you do a great job in terms of planning a trip, whether it's ﬂights or hotels or other
attractions, I think we actually have done a pretty signiﬁcant job. But if we can even
convince you as a consumer to use the Trips app and have all of that informationFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29

Sridhar Ramaswamyavailable -- even oﬄine, mind you. One of the things that all of us run into is we go to
a new place, our plan quite doesn't work and it becomes a struggle to actually use
our phone. The Trip app makes that easy as well.
So it's part of a larger consumer vision for what we think travel can be. And we built it
very much with the mentality of if we get the product right, we will get monetization
opportunities.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes. Well here's to hoping that it is the next billion-user platform Sundar can
highlight.
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Deﬁnitely our hope as well.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay. So talking about assistance, as you look longer term, you talk about mobile-
ﬁrst world. Are we moving to a voice-driven world? And in that world, what kind of
ad units do you think Google might be serving?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
I think we need to be open-minded about this. At this point, the assistance team --
and there's an assistance team within my group as well. The main assistance team is
part of the Search team. They're laser-focused on creating an amazing consumer
experience and on making sure that that experience is really, really a joy for people
to be using.
We are keeping an open mind about the kind of monetization opportunities that
there are going to be. I think it can range from being purely transactional, meaning
we make it convenient for you to fulﬁll a transaction with the Assistant, or it can
involve promotion. But one thing that we are all clear about is the days of three top
text ads followed by ten organic results is a thing of the past in the voice-driven
world. So we're very much keeping an open mind on what this needs to be and
focusing much more on what's the consumer experience. If it's scaled, we'll ﬁgure
the rest after that.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes. Seems like to me, if you make it easier for the consumers to do something, they
should be doing more of it?

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 14Stephen Ju
Sridhar Ramaswamy
Stephen Ju
Sridhar RamaswamyThat's correct, that's correct. I mean, this was our thesis for mobile. If people recall,
there were a lot of worries about was mobile incremental? Was it taking away from
desktop? But it turned out that mobile expanded the pie. We need to have a similar
positive attitude towards voice search and Assistant and focus on creating great
consumer experiences.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes. Another sore topic. Let's talk about ad blockers. So it seems like for Search and
YouTube, it should not be a huge problem. But it does aﬀect your display business.
The fact that consumers are opting to use ad blockers is a signal for change. So what
can Google do to help the consumer as well as the advertiser?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes. It's a real problem. And as you correctly point out, it's a consumer issue. I think
there are still too many sites in which the ad experience is pretty bad, whether it's
ads that start autoplaying a video or ads that completely cover up the screen and
you can't quite ﬁnd the X. All of us have been through it. And it can be very
frustrating.
So we announced recently, just a couple of months ago, that we were going to be
part of a coalition that the IAB in New York, which is a US advertising body, was
starting. This is a coalition for better ads. We are working with them to come up with
a quantitative standard for what an acceptable ads experience is going to be. Then
we want to work with the larger ecosystem of browsers, for example, to make sure
that there is pressure and self-regulation on the part of advertisers and publishers to
only run ads that consumers don't ﬁnd oﬀensive.
I think that is very, very sorely needed. And we think that that's the right way out of
this current problem. I think without self-policing, there's going to be more and more
bad experiences and more and more consumers turning oﬀ ads across the whole.
And I think, frankly, all of us suﬀer because it's going to drive a lot of small publishers
that have valuable sites that you and I use on a regular basis out of business. So we
view pretty passionately that this is part of Google's larger mission, of making the
world information be available to everybody. And so there's a certain sense of
urgency that we feel about getting this coalition right and making sure that it's rolled
out right.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes. Then another product that you introduced recently, Accelerated Mobile Pages,
how does this help you toward that end goal?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Accelerated Mobile Pages was an attempt at a much better consumer experience. It
started as an ad vertical in mind, a news vertical. Many of you see that on the results,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 14Stephen Ju
Sridhar Ramaswamy
Stephen Juif you search on Google for news. It's been doing very well. And it's based on an
open standard. Anybody can adopt it, anybody can run Accelerated Mobile Pages. It
doesn't have to be just Google. And people have introduced ad formats into
Accelerated Mobile Pages. The results are pretty early from that front in terms of
what is the monetization compared to the increased number of page views that you
get from having faster-loading pages. We continue to work on making that better.
But in general, we think that the mobile ecosystem can be made much better for the
consumer. And doing that will actually lead to increased usage.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Switching topics a little bit. So advertisers have been grappling this year with issues
around transparency. There are well-publicized issues with third-party auditing on
Facebook impressions and recent A&A report about what's pretty scathing on the
use of rebates by ad agencies. So do you think advertiser concern about
transparency helps or hinders Google's ad business in general?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
So you actually asked a complicated, two-part question. One was around metrics
and transparency. We work closely with third parties -- comScore, Nielsen -- to make
sure that the results that we provide for display advertising are measurable and
veriﬁable by third parties. We've been very open about that.
And recall also that the vast majority of Google's revenue comes from direct-
response advertising, which has built-in measurement. It's based on conversions that
advertisers see. So value is being measured cleanly and by the party that is most
aﬀected by it. So we think we have overall a good story in terms of working with the
industry in making sure that metrics that we give for brand advertising are real and
veriﬁable.
On the other side, when it comes to our interaction with agencies and advertisers,
we strive for transparency. We don't do things that contrast. We have all of this
information be available to folks so that agencies and advertisers can have the right
conversation about where these dollars go. So we feel pretty good about where we
are on both these fronts. And we'll continue to work with our big advertisers and
agencies for making it even more transparent. So we are making sure that people
feel like fair value is being realized for their dollars and for their eﬀort.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Another somewhat general question. But wondering if you can talk about the
underlying trends you're seeing for programmatic. Ruth highlighted it as a growth
driver in recent earnings conference calls. And secondarily, header bidding comes
up as an issue for the display business. So are you concerned? If you can go into a
little bit about what header bidding is and how that impacts you and what are your
concerns.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 14Sridhar Ramaswamy
Stephen Ju
Sridhar Ramaswamy{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes. So header bidding is a technique by which publishers try to satisfy the demand
for some of their pages even before things like Google's Ad Exchange are called. It's
a way for them to realize more value on their most valuable pages. And we have --
header bidding by itself is not bad. Its implementation can be bad sometimes, in
that you end up having a lot of calls on the client side that can slow down the
loading of the page. So we work with publishers to see what are technologies that
are needed in the underlying platform.
We have a version of header bidding called Exchange Bidding that's built right into
our platform products that a number of our publishers are using. So we'll ﬁgure out
where this is, at the end of the day, Google's publisher products need to serve
publishers. We need to make sure that they can realize the most value that they can
for the content and the eyeballs that they have. So we don't particularly think of it as
a threat to our business. But an important evolution in the business that we're happy
to be a part of.
Now, going to programmatic, DBM is one of our fastest growing programmatic
products ever. We have talked about it in multiple earnings calls. Overall, it has
excellent usage by top advertisers. Of Ad Age's top 100 advertisers, something like
80-plus % of them use DBM to get widespread adoption. They have very solid
growth across the board. It's an area that we?re very, very happy and comfortable
with.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Got you. At I/O Google introduced updates to Android Pay to make it easier for
consumers to pay for merchandise on the mobile Web. Anything you can share in
terms of consumer adoption and beneﬁts and conversion that advertisers may be
seeing? Presumably, this helps to take down transactional friction overall.
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes. Reducing transactional friction is a really important priority for the commerce
part of my team because that ends up helping scale out advertising products. We
announced a pretty ambitious program based on a change to Chrome that can be
used to provide a much better payment experience for consumers' payment
credentials. But that requires changes on the part of the retailer.
So even before going there, I would highlight a simple feature that we launched in
conjunction with the Chrome team, which is Chrome Payment Autoﬁll. I don't know
how many up here have used it. But I have my credit card that is stored on Android
Pay available to me whenever I am ﬁlling out a credit card form on my phone, also
on my desktop. And that has actually been a signiﬁcant factor in making commerce
easier for me and for a lot of other users. We think that's the really important thing
for us to be doing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29

Stephen JuWe announced partnerships recently with both Visa and MasterCard in order to
facilitate better payment credentials transfer on the Web. It's a sad truth of today that
in-app payments on both Androids and on iOS work much better than the Web. Our
goal is to make sure that it's actually transparent across the board. Each year, Apple's
eﬀorts, for example, to make transactions much better on the mobile Web on Safari.
That makes mobile commerce better overall and ends up helping everybody in the
mobile ecosystem including, of course, Google. So I think nice progress overall in
this area.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes, I think at the time you showed oﬀ the product at I/O , I think you disclosed that
the gap in the conversion rate is, I think, 66% versus, I think, the desktop?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
I don't recall the number.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes, I think there's a pretty healthy gap that you can close and that theoretically
should help raise the value of the inventory on the mobile Web. Got you.
Another cool product that we saw at I/O that just really didn't get that much press, I
think there was like a spatial recognition technology that you have on the phone that
helps you, I guess, plan out or map out the interiors of buildings. Can you talk about
the potential for the commercialization of this technology?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
It's not from my team. I would say that part is still early. But we are deﬁnitely
interested in much better location data for all the reasons that I talked about earlier,
because products like search advertising in general can end up driving a lot of store
visits. We work extensively with many advertisers to deploy, really, Bluetooth low-
energy beacons that can be used to better detect anonymously, in aggregate, when
users actually walk into stores.
We think location continues to hold a lot of promise. But the killer app for location,
one that compels you to take your phone out when you get to a location, hasn't
quite happened. And we're still optimistic about it. But it's been a slow change.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Okay, got you. Taking a step back and looking at a more global perspective, it seems
like in the US, we are, shall we say, a little bit overburdened with the existing
infrastructure, whether it's in commerce or advertising. And in some cases, the
emerging market countries, they may skip building physical infrastructure and go
straight online. So what's your perspective in terms of whether, I guess, the pace ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29

to be faster-growing for Google?
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes, I think this is a really interesting question. And one that brings many diﬀerent
perspectives. Surely, yes, we are burdened in a number of areas. But I think that
works pretty well. What I mean by that is when you talk about Android Pay, you're
talking about an experience in which you have to take out your phone, unlock it. And
then go and tap. Come further, until very recently, it's taking out a credit card,
swiping it once. And three seconds later, the transaction's done. Okay, that's the
legacy technology, except that it works really well.
And so something like Android Pay or person-to-person payment is not a mass
phenomenon, that it is in a place like China. Similarly, when it comes to commerce,
as we were talking, you can pretty much order from the top 100, 500, 1,000 retailers
within the US. And you can be pretty guaranteed of a very good experience. Things
will show up on time. If you don't like it, people will take it back. Not the case in
emerging markets.
So I think it becomes a little hard to compare. There are many people that are
coming online in emerging markets who went straight to a mobile-only experience.
They're much more comfortable doing commerce. That's a positive. But you're also
seeing several countries. And truly this has happened in China, where Google
doesn't really play a role, where it tends to get dominated by one or two people.
And when there is one or two people dominating an area, there's not much of a role
for advertising, because you have to go there all the time.
So I think it's a tough comparison. I think there are many advantages here with the
diversiﬁed commerce world and well-developed infrastructure. But then you also
have a population in areas like China and India that's very, very mobile-ﬁrst, much
more ready for change.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Yes. I think lastly, Sridhar, I think your title, you've run all of advertising and
commerce. And I can't help but think that within Google's product portfolio, from the
top of the consumer marketing funnel to pretty much the bottom, all of the
underlying pieces are there for Google to help advertisers drive volume. So can you
talk about where you are in terms of that opportunity, linking it all together? A broad
question there.
{BIO 18644257 <GO>}
Yes. That's part of the -- it's a work in progress. I think a number of pieces are
deﬁnitely in place. Truly, we do an exceptional job close to the bottom of the funnel.
Search is incredibly eﬀective as a medium. We do a pretty decent job close to the
top of the funnel, where YouTube brand advertising is pretty eﬀective. We'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-11-29

Sridhar Ramaswamyincreasingly working at personal products -- for example, the shopping team has
done a number of nice launches to help you ﬁnd, say, the look for a dress that you're
interested in, where you don't quite know the exact dress or shirt that you want. But
you're able to look at a pretty clear design or at a particular store's collection. So we
have eﬀorts along those fronts.
We're also working on personalization across these formats. And here, actually, we
have a number of products that we're rolling out that have a lot of promise because
with something like Universal App Campaign, an advertiser tells us, "Here is my app.
And here some assets where there are images or videos. And here is a price for
install that I'm willing to play. Go ﬁnd me all the consumers that you can." All of a
sudden now we have a rich canvas in which I can show you a quote-unquote brand
ad for this app, potentially on YouTube. And actually convert you on some other
product, like Search. So we think constructs like that, the Universal Apps Campaign-
like eﬀorts, are going to really deliver a product that's much more end-to-end,
because you now have a canvas that can stretch across all of Google?s diﬀerent
properties. That's a vision we are driving towards. But it's the individual pieces that
are being worked on.
{BIO 6658298 <GO>}
Great. Well looking forward to following your progress in the years to come. Thank
you very much, Sridhar.
