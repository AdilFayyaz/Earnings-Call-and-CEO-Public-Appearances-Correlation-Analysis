{BIO 3224315 <GO>}
Good morning. Good morning and welcome. It's fantastic to be back here in New
York City. We have a lot to show you this morning. It's hard to imagine that it was just
10 months ago that ChatGPT ﬁrst came out. And it's clear, like if you just look around
since then that something new is happening in our industry and far beyond and it's
exciting. And we've done a lot in these last 10 plus months. GitHub Copilot is turning
natural language into programming language. In fact, last night in my hotel room, I
was so excited to have access to Copilot Chat in my personal account. Finally, it's
awesome.
It's -- even think ChatGPT and Bing Chat, I mean, what should I say? I mean, in a
market that's dominated by one player, we are striving to breathe some innovation
and life into it. And even with Microsoft 365, there's a wait list. I mean, it's crazy. It's
kind of like the 90s are back. It's exciting to be in a place where we are bringing
some software innovation and really having fun enjoying this entire journey. Of
course, it's not just about the Copilots that we are building, it's all the apps that are
being built by partners, whether it's Spotify or Shopify to the London Stock
Exchange to Epic. Each piece of software from consumer tech, to ﬁnancial tech, to
healthcare tech is changing. And we've learned a lot in these last several months.
It's been energizing to see and hear what you all have been able to do with these
new capabilities. From developers who say, ﬁnally, Copilot has brought joy and ﬂow
back to their work, to artists who say it sparked their creativity, to all of us as
knowledge workers and ﬁrst-line workers, right, who are able to rid ourselves of just
this drudgery of sometimes this work. Business leaders who ﬁnally have a new tool
to be able to reimagine, simplify, optimize business processes, whether it's sales,
marketing, ﬁnance, customer service, what have you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21

Page 2 of 16In some sense, perhaps the biggest learning is what God has all started, whatever, in
the last 70 plus years around this computing revolution in the ﬁrst place. I recently
had a chance to reread a book, Bootstrapping, which I think came out perhaps in the
early 2000s. It's a story of Doug Engelbart and his life, his vision. Obviously,
everyone knows about his contributions to some of the seminal things that we all
enjoy in personal computing, whether it's the mouse or the graphical user interface.
But the thing that he writes about, how he chose to sort of get into the computing
industry and motivated his life's work, deeply resonated with me. He felt that both
the complexity and the urgency of the humanity's problems, both big and small
were growing at such a fast rate that our ability to cope with them was being
challenged.
And he envisioned, therefore, a new system of computer and human collaboration
that could augment human capabilities and give each of us more agency in tackling
these challenges. And that's always been the ultimate dream of this entire
computing revolution. And now, as we stand here today, we have a couple of new
capabilities. To me, there are two real underlying technology breakthroughs with this
new generation of AI. The ﬁrst is that we now ﬁnally have, I mean, we've been talking
about moving [ph] for decades, but I feel we are at the place where we ﬁnally have a
new natural interface and it starts with language, but it's going to quickly go beyond
that, right, you've to see, to hear, to interpret and make sense of our intent and the
world around us.
And a new reasoning engine, which helps us make sense and ﬁnd patterns in all that
is digitized, right, which is people, places, things. And together, they have created
what is essentially a new category of computing. This is as signiﬁcant as the PCs in
the 80s, the web in the 90s, mobile in the 2000s, the cloud in the 2010s. Just like
you boot up an operating system to access applications or use a browser to navigate
to websites, you will invoke a Copilot to do all these activities and more, to shop, to
code, to analyze, to learn, to create. And we believe it has the potential to help you
be more knowledgeable, more productive, more creative, more connected to the
people and things around you.
It starts with building on what we have learned to date. We've seen that the most
magical and empowering moments people have experienced with AI is when it's
informed with the context that extends way beyond what's in front of them. For
instance, when you're able to create a PowerPoint presentation, taking advantage of
all the conversations you previously had in Teams, Outlook, even the ﬁles you have.
Or when you're able to plan a family vacation based on your preferences,
communications, and what Bing knows about the destination you're trying to go to.
The more context and memory a Copilot has, the more planning capabilities it has,
the more valuable of a companion it becomes. This requires that what we think of
today as separate categories, research, productivity, operating systems, devices, all
come together and evolve. So the context and intelligence of the web, your work
data and what you're doing in the moment on your device are presented together in
a single uniﬁed experience centered around you, informed by your preferences and
permissions. But it's a lot more than that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21

Page 3 of 16Yusuf MehdiWe think there's also an opportunity beyond work and life to have one experience
that works across your entire life. After all, you're a salesperson by the day, a
musician by the night, a manager and a parent, a shopper and a creator. And this
requires a real rethink, a user experience scaﬀolding that cuts across devices,
operating systems and applications. And that's what brings us here today. That's why
today, we're announcing Copilot, our vision for everyday AI companion for you.
Copilot is one. Yeah.
You're going to see a lot of it. Copilot is one experience that runs across multiple
surfaces, understands your context, brings the right skills to you when you need
them, it adapts to you. You no longer have to be the orchestrator of your apps,
operating systems and devices. We are building Copilot into all of our most used
products and experiences and allowing you to summon its power as a standalone
app as well, from Bing and Edge to Microsoft 365 and the newest version of
Windows. Today, we will show you how Copilot can make your life better. And we're
introducing exciting new surface devices that bring together these innovations and
innovation in silicon hardware and software all coming together. No matter the
context you're in, no matter whether you are at work, school, or home, no matter
your device, operating system or app, the Copilot is always going to be there to help
you.
It simpliﬁes the complexity we face today. You can see this in this picture built by
Bing Image Creator, in fact, powered by DALL-E 3. And it's exciting to see this kind --
it's kind of like your PC now, it's kind of becoming your CP. We believe Copilot will
fundamentally transform our relationship with technology and ushering a new era of
personal computing, the age of Copilots and an era that uplifts every person,
community, industry, and country. I started at Microsoft when our mission was to put
a PC in every home and every desk and today, we have a vision for a Copilot that can
empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Yusuf and the team to show you more. Thank you all
very, very much.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Thank you, Satya, and welcome, everyone. It's so great to be back here in New York
with you all. I love this tradition. Once a year, we come back and we talk about the
Windows that we all know and love, and some of those new surface devices that we
crave. And we will. But as Satya laid out, today is also a new day. We're starting a new
beginning in the phase of development of the PC. And in many ways, more
importantly, a new era, which we're empowered to be smarter, more productive,
more creative, and ultimately more connected to the people and the world around
us.
In this age of AI, which really kicked oﬀ for most of us in the past year, I always think
we just got to stop for a second and just sort of look at what has happened now and
what you can do now that you couldn't do even a year ago. Any of us can create
some of the most breathtaking images in the world just by using our words. We'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 16going to show you that. After a busy week where you've got so much going on, you
can now make sense of all those emails, the text messages, team's messages, even
your documents, just by saying, hey, what happened this week? Tell me what
happened.
And lastly, you can even take a photo of, let's say, a pair of shoes that you love and
you can go from picture to purchase with a camera snap. It's incredible. We really
live in an amazing time. And in this new era of AI, we at Microsoft are embarking on
the journey to reimagine everything that we build, software, services and devices to
put you at the center. There's an incredible team here today and they are excited to
share with you some of the ﬁrst steps in this direction. None are more important and
profound than what Satya just mentioned, the introduction of Copilot, your everyday
AI companion. I want to reintroduce you to AI Copilot. Let's take a look here.
Now as you can see, Copilot is going to have an energy and approachability. It
embodies our vision for AI to be in service of you. It's a handshake between you and
technology available when you need it and out of the way when you don't. It'll
anticipate your needs and increasingly it's going to understand your intent. Now we
plan to make Copilot seamlessly available across all of our apps and experiences
that you use most. Starting today with one of the most important Copilot will be
available on the Windows 11 desktop, and with a single click you can launch Copilot
and your AI companion is instantly available. It's informed by what you're doing on
your PC.
Copilot will also be available across the entire Microsoft 365 oﬀerings. Here, you see
in PowerPoint and Excel and in Teams with the power to harness all of your work data
and intelligence. And of course, we're going to have Copilot in Edge ready to help
you across your entire web experience and Copilot is built on top of Bing Chat, so
you can harness the full power of the internet.
Now it's not just an app or a chat window, it's woven throughout your entire
experience. It'll reveal itself with a right click or you can invoke it with your voice.
Now over the next 45 minutes, as Frank said, you got to buckle up because we're
going to show you a lot of new innovation and capabilities. First up, I'm excited to
share that Copilot will begin to rollout as part of a new Windows 11 release starting
on September 26. This release will have over 150 new features and I believe it's the
most ambitious update to Windows 11 since we ﬁrst released it. Let's take a look.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
What do you think? I'm so excited to use this release. One of the things you're going
to see, there's just so many features in here. We've really reimagined all of those
inbox apps that you're used to, photos, paint, they're all reimagined with AI. But what
really makes it come to life, of course, is Copilot and Windows. And here to tell you
more is one of the leaders of our Windows Engineering team, Carmen Zlateﬀ.
Welcome, Carmen.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21

Page 5 of 16Carmen Zlateﬀ
Thanks, Yusuf. I am so excited to be here. We have built an incredible new Windows
11 set of features that will begin rolling out on September 26th. Get the update and
you'll see the new beneﬁts of Windows 11. New ways to express your creativity,
increased security and accessibility and so much more. I'm honored to be here
representing an amazing team of product makers from Windows. And today, I'm
excited to talk about how Copilot in Windows 11 empowers you to take advantage of
all those features and capabilities in an easier and more powerful way. Because
Copilot is built into Windows, it has a view across your applications, the web and
even your devices. And with that understanding, it can help you get things done
more quickly and eﬃciently than ever before.
Think about all those little things you love in Windows, like copy and paste, that have
been saving people time for years. What if Copilot could take those things and make
them even better? Now you can copy paste and do. Let me show you what that
means. Here you see a long email, oh gosh, what a wall of text. I'm trying to ﬁgure
out the places around this venue that I can go visit while I'm here. I see those places
in this email, but I wonder how far these are from here. It doesn't say.
As soon as I copy the text, Copilot appears and oﬀers suggestions for what to do
next. I really just needed a more readable and I want to know how far they are. In
seconds, all of this information is neatly organized. And it even tells me how far away
each location is, doing that research for me. But I only want to see the options that
are less than a 10-minute walk away and it does that too, by translating from miles to
minutes. Did you see that? I said I wanted to walk, and it knew that telling me how
many minutes was a lot better than telling me how many miles. That was so easy.
And now I'm ready to send it back.
Next, we're excited to share a brand new feature coming to Windows, Ink Anywhere,
which means you can use your pen to ink in any text box anywhere in Windows 11.
Let me show you how the pen and the power of Copilot come together to complete
a task. Let's use a simple example about math equations. Have you ever tried to
write a complex math equation with your keyboard? I'll tell you it is not easy to do.
With Ink Anywhere and Copilot, you can write complex math equations into the text
ﬁeld and get an answer immediately. Pretty simple, huh?
But what if that math problem includes a graph? How can pen and Copilot help?
Since you can use your pen across apps like Snipping Tool, watch as you can use the
pen to snip a photo of the math problem, you see Copilot immediately start solving
just from that snip. And not only does Copilot solve the math problem, which feels
magical, but trust me it's real and powerful, but it explains how to solve it. And this
serves as a great learning moment for all those future equations you'll need to solve.
Next, let's talk about how Copilot works across your devices. We rely on our phones
for so many things, they're with us all the time and they're the bridge that connects
us to our world. Copilot on Windows has context from your phone, so it's easy to
ﬁnd the information I need from a text without spending time searching throughFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21

Divya Kumarhundreds of messages. I'll be back in New York in October and I'm trying to
remember when my ﬂights are. I know I have that info in my phone, so I just ask
Copilot, please ﬁnd my ﬂight info. And as you can see, Copilot has the ﬂight info
from my texts, from my texts on my phone in Windows.
I want to catch a play while I'm in New York on that trip. So I ask Copilot to write a
text to my husband with the list of plays that are happening. Copilot uses the
information about the dates of my ﬂight that it found on my phone. It also ﬁnds the
plays going on during those dates and that have available tickets and Copilot texts
that to him right from my PC. Now that really felt like an assistant.
Microsoft is where powerful AI experiences come together simply, securely, and
responsibly in the products you use most like Windows. And for nearly 40 years,
Windows has been the heart of how we collaborate, communicate, and create.
Bringing together people, information and ideas in a way that's more personal and
productive. And we aren't just infusing AI into the Windows 11 shell, we're infusing it
into our free inbox applications like Paint, Snipping Tool, Photos, Outlook, and more.
Our journey with AI and Windows has only just begun. Windows 11 is the home for
innovation and creativity, collaboration and communication, entertainment and
education. And now with Windows and CoPilot, it's your home for the best AI
experiences. Thank you.
{BIO 1823106 <GO>}
Thank you, Carmen. Now, we want to dig in a little bit deeper into some of the
innovation that we're going to bring to you in Bing Edge and in Microsoft 365 to let
you really harness the power of the internet with some of the new capabilities we've
just built and to really unlock a whole new way of working. First up, to tell you more
about the advancements that we're making in Bing and Edge, I'd like to introduce to
you one of the leaders of our Search and AI team, Divya Kumar. Welcome, Divya.
{BIO 15068418 <GO>}
Thanks, Yusuf. When we launched the new AI-powered Bing and Edge in February,
we wanted to solve for the fact that roughly half of over 10 billion daily searches go
unanswered. People prefer to get answers versus a page of links for many of their
questions. We've had over 1 billion chats to date and with our combined leadership
with ChatGPT, we've learned a lot about how people are using and beneﬁting from
these incredible tools. Today, I'm excited to introduce several incredible new
features coming to Bing and Edge. One of the most valuable and yet underserved
categories of search is shopping and I love shopping. With the introduction of AI
powered Bing, we made shopping easier. Soon we're taking that to the next level by
introducing your Copilot for shopping.
Let me give you an example. My nephew loves playing soccer and I want to get him
some new cleats. I'm not an expert. So Copilot in Microsoft shopping would guide
me to ﬁnd the best pair by asking smart questions like his skill level, which is not
something I would have thought to consider. Next, it asks me to choose the type of
ﬁeld he'll be playing on. I can even compare my options of top name brands fromFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 16thousands of online merchants. I can get summarized reviews, including the pros
and cons of the shoe and Copilot gets me to a recommendation. I can even ﬁnd the
best price in online promo codes.
You can see that at Edge, we have built-in coupons and cashback, making it
incredibly easy to save money when you shop. The shopping features in Microsoft
Edge delivered more than $4 billion in savings in the past year. I'll also be able to
use a photo or saved image as a starting point for my shopping. My nephew saw a
pair of cleats that he loves and sent me a picture. I can use that picture to quickly ﬁnd
something similar. A bit ﬂashier than what I picked, but regardless, Copilot for
shopping made it so easy for me to make a conﬁdent purchase. It's like having my
own personal shopper.
Now, let's talk about one of the most exciting capabilities of AI, creating images with
just words. Bing Image Creator was the ﬁrst to add AI image generation to chat,
making it easy for you to create any image you can dream up and people love it.
Soon, we'll be upgrading to the new DALL-E 3 model from OpenAI, making Image
Creator even more powerful. You can expect breathtaking images. Even the little
details like ﬁngers and eyes and shadows are going to be dramatically improved
over previous versions.
Let's say I want to create a gaming avatar, inspired by the awesome new Starﬁeld
game. With the latest DALL-E model, all I need to do is describe the image I want
and I get stunning options in no time and I can modify images directly in chat. The
combination of chat and image creation makes it incredibly easy to reﬁne images
until I get it just right. But it's not just the quality of the images that's improving.
We're also making it easier to identify images that have been created by AI with
content credentials. Now every image generated is marked as created by AI using
cryptographic methods for better transparency.
All right. Because I can't get over how amazing the new model is, let's take a quick
look at the side-by-side comparison of the new DALL-E 3 model to the previous
model. It's the same prompt. But because the model now understands the prompt
better and is more powerful, the diﬀerence is incredible. I really can't stop, so here
are a few more I created inspired by the things that I love. The breadth and quality of
content that you can generate with Image Creator is awesome. It can really create
anything you can dream up and it's entirely free for everyone.
Moving on. Another thing we've learned is that most of us tend to repeat many of
our searches for topics on a regular basis. We each have our interests or hobbies like
photography, sports, movies, travel, but modern search and chat rarely take recent
activity into consideration when generating a response. To help you get the answers
you care about faster, we're introducing personalized answers. This means your chat
history can inform your results. Here's an example. I'm looking for something to do
this weekend and you can see that Bing remembers earlier conversations I had
about sports and my Golden Retriever, it takes these earlier conversations into
consideration to infer that I may want sports-related or pet-friendly activities. WithFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 16Colette Stallbaumerjust a single prompt, Bing brings me personalized results from across the web that
matches my interests. Of course, you also have the option to turn it oﬀ.
Now, let's talk about one of the most powerful ways in which Bing and Edge are
leveraging AI to transform how people can get things done at work. We launched
Bing Chat Enterprise just two months ago and the response has been incredible.
Today, I am excited to announce a new suite of features coming to Bing Chat
Enterprise, which is now available in Edge mobile app. With Bing Chat Enterprise, I
can rest easy, knowing that my conﬁdential work data is protected.
Let's say I'm an architect headed to London to pitch a client. I just learned that my
client has updated the specs for the building and I need to redo our pricing and
some of the materials we plan to use. No problem. While waiting at the airport, I can
ask Bing on my phone to write me a few paragraphs to reﬂect these changes and in
no time, I've got a great starting point before I board the plane. Finally, now you can
also search with images and create images in Bing Chat Enterprise with multimodal
visual search and image creator.
Let me show you an example. I grabbed a power converter before I left for the
airport, but I'm not sure it's the kind that works in the UK. Fortunately, I can simply
take a picture of the one I packed and ask if this will work in London. Bing is going to
use GPT-4 and its image recognition capabilities to understand both the question
and how it relates to the image to get the answer. All right. Looks like I packed the
right one, so I can relax and enjoy the ﬂight across the pond. Copilot powered Bing
and Edge are transforming how people use the internet to search, learn, and create.
Now let's take a look at how we turbocharge your productivity and creativity with
Microsoft 365. Welcome, Colette.
Thanks, Divya. Time is our most precious resource and perhaps nowhere is Copilot
better poised to tame the complexity, eliminate the drudgery and help people
reclaim time than at work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is your AI assistant at work. After
months of learning alongside hundreds of customers like Visa, General Motors,
KPMG, and Lumen, I'm excited to share that Microsoft 365 Copilot will be generally
available for enterprise customers on November 1.
In March, we showed you how Copilot can unlock productivity and unleash creativity
in the apps millions of people use every day across work and life. Word, Excel,
PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. Copilot makes you more creative in Word, more
analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook and
more collaborative in Teams. Today, we're introducing a new hero experience in
Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft 365 Chat. You got a glimpse of M365 Chat in
March, but thanks to rapid advances over the past few months, today, we're taking it
to a whole new level, going far beyond simple questions and answers to solve your
most complex problems at work. Let's take a look.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21

Page 9 of 16(Audio-Video Presentation)
M365 Chat has a deep contextual understanding of you, your job, your priorities and
your organization. It's like having someone attend all your meetings, even the ones
you skip. Read all your emails, including the ones you missed, know what's in every
single ﬁle and recall it all at the speed of light. But seeing is believing, so let's jump
in.
Let's say you're a marketer at a national chain of home improvement store. You start
your day with Copilot, asking what's hot in your inbox today. It does some thinking
and gives you an overview of the most pressing items. Great, looks like the new store
opening could use your attention. Let's dive in deeper there. Copilot gets to work,
combing through all your recent emails, meetings, even the ones you didn't attend,
chats and ﬁles, to get you up to speed in moments.
Now, this is pretty sophisticated. It didn't just summarize a single document, it knew
what sources to pull from and what information to extract from each. Next up, you
need to do some market research. Let's say you want details on square footage and
proximity of competitors to your new location. Now, typically this would take a few
hours. Now, you can just put Copilot to work. It scours the web and within seconds it
ﬁnds everything you're looking for. Note that it includes references to all the sources,
so you can easily fact-check the results.
Okay. You're curious. How does this stack up against the other competitors, other
stores you opened in the past year? Copilot identiﬁes the relevant stores, crunches
the numbers and gives you an answer. You just saw a complex multi-step process
where Copilot understood your intent, cross-referenced information from the web
with your unique universe of data at work and connected the dots to give you just
what you needed. Next up, it's time to ﬁnalize the date and speaker for the grand
opening event. Now there's been a lot of back and forth on this topic and you
missed the last meeting where this might have come up in conversation, no
problem, Copilot's got you covered, getting you up to speed in seconds.
It looks like it was a pretty dynamic discussion and you're on the hook to make a ﬁnal
decision. To do that, you need to understand all the factors at play, including the
implications on your grand opening timeline. Copilot extracts the relevant details
and organizes them into a table. But you're still not seeing a clear answer, so you ask
Copilot to recommend the best date and speaker based on the constraints
discussed. It not only understands the constraints, it thinks through the options to
help you solve your problem, there you go. Now you have a clear recommendation
to share with the team. Pretty amazing, right?
Now you can move on to promoting the event. You start with the blog post. It needs
to share all the important details and get customers excited. You point Copilot to the
right ﬁles and ask it to pick the top ﬁve things and make them prominent. Note the
amount of detail in the prompt. Okay, here it goes. Give it a moment. Okay. Now
you've got a blog post. Now that probably felt like magic, but it's not. This is allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 16working code today. Just imagine doing this with your data. This store will be the ﬁrst
to unveil your new home improvement concierge service and you need a catchy
tagline. You ask Copilot to generate some options. Now, this is great for when you've
got a case of writer's block.
Okay. Now, you've got some solid choices. You'll notice this starts to feel a lot like a
conversation because it is. The more you work with Copilot in this iterative way, just
like you with a colleague, the more natural it becomes. This is what we mean when
we say Copilot really is a whole new way to work. Okay, back to the blog post. Now
you want to add a blurb about the new store manager and highlight their impressive
retail experience. Copilot pulls the information from LinkedIn and puts it in the blog
for you. And with that, you're nearly ready to publish.
Now the opening is just around the corner, and you've got to send an email to the
team to get them ready. Now, one of the amazing things about Copilot is you don't
need to worry about things like punctuation, spelling or being super structured in
your prompt. You can just give it a total brain dump, as you see here. And what you'll
ﬁnd is, the more context you give it, the better your results. Almost forgot, there was
a great quote in a store walkthrough video you saw that you want to include here,
but you don't remember where you last saw it or have time to search for it, let alone
ﬁnd the quote. Based on your quick description, Copilot ﬁnds the exact quote you're
thinking of, extracts what you wanted and plugs it into the blog post.
Okay. Now I'm excited to introduce one of my favorite new features in Outlook,
Sound Like Me. It's going to take this email from good to great. Let's hop over to
Outlook to reﬁne the email. So you like this draft, but it just doesn't sound like you.
Which sound like me and Outlook, Copilot can personalize any email to match your
unique style and tone of voice. It even gets the subtle details right, like how you sign
oﬀ your emails.
It's time to book your travel, so you can be at the grand opening. Now booking
travel can be a hassle. What if you could reserve the same ﬂight and hotel as your
coworkers using just your own words? Copilot can connect to all sorts of business
data. In this case, we're using a plugin to connect with your travel booking system. It
matches their itinerary and with that, you're all set. It's oﬀ to the grand opening.
We want to help everyone learn to work iteratively with AI and get the most out of
Copilot. Introducing Copilot Lab, a new experience that will help people build new
work habits for a new AI-powered era of productivity. Copilot Lab is a place to
experiment, to learn the art and science of prompting. You'll learn how to turn a
good prompt into a great one, share your favorite prompts with co-workers and get
inspired as we all learn to work in this new way together.

Brett OstrumCopilot what I have in mind for my fall event, again, this doesn't need to be formal or
even fully baked, just enough of an idea to get started. And it takes me to word and
my ﬁrst draft is already there. Now all I have to do is iterate and reﬁne the details.
Let's say I want to add another day to the plan. I just direct Copilot to do that here. I
can also easily make it more concise. Okay. This has all the information I want, but I
want it to come alive visually. My 13-year old daughter is a natural at design, but for
me it doesn't come as easily. With designer integration in Word, I can easily create
custom graphics right in my document. I ask Copilot to generate a banner and
customize it by selecting one of my photos. Okay, that header looks great.
Let me show you more. To do that, I'll pivot over to the Designer app. Designer helps
you quickly create stunning visuals using some incredible new features powered by
OpenAI's Dall-E 3. Let's say you want to erase an unwanted object in the
background, like these people right here. Just hover and click. Okay, I love this
image in the corner, but I wish the photographer would have shot more of the trees.
Now I can expand the image to ﬁll the frame, that's just what I wanted. You can even
add an entirely new object, it's as simple as using your imagination and your own
words. Maybe I have too many pumpkins here, so let's add some sunﬂowers. Terriﬁc.
Earlier you saw how easy it is to create images in Bing. Bing is great for generating
your ﬁrst image and soon, Designer integration in Bing will let you ﬁne-tune that
image without having to start from scratch. We want to help everyone unleash their
creative super powers. I'm excited to share Microsoft 365 Copilot is now in preview
with a select group of consumers and small businesses. Today, we've shown you how
Copilot is centered around you and your whole life. Soon, you won't be able to
imagine life without it.
With that, I'll turn it over to Yusuf.

Surface laptops to show you. We will start with the lightest, most portable Surface
Laptop Go 3. Take a look.
(Audio-Video Presentation)
This is Surface Laptop Go 3. It's an incredible device for online creators, college
students and young professionals who need to get work done from anywhere. It's
ultra-portable under 2.5 pounds, with a 12.4 inch touchscreen, and has premium
features like a ﬁngerprint power button and an absolutely incredible typing
experience. It comes in four stunning colors. It's 88% faster than the original, with all-
day battery life to power productivity, creativity and entertainment from early
morning classes to the last episode streamed at night. Now, there are so many
awesome experiences that come to life on this laptop, but we wanted to show you
one of our favorites.
I'm excited to have Nicholas from our team join us to show how easy it is to get
creative on Surface Laptop Go.

Thanks, Brett. I've been having a great time in New York this week. On my ﬁrst night, I
went to see a DJ, and I want to make a video of highlights from the set to share with
my friends. But if you're anything like me, making a video like that can take a lot of
time. I recorded the video and it's already on my laptop in the Photos app, thanks to
iCloud Photos integration, one of my favorite Windows 11 features. But here's where I
need some help. I don't really know how to turn a long DJ set into 30 seconds and
thankfully, I don't need to, because I have Clipchamp. This is our all-in-one easy-to-
use video editing app, and with the new auto-compose feature, it's really easy to use.
All I need to do, select my video, drag and drop it into the app and get started. I can
select as many ﬁlters as I like, really making sure that they ﬁt the content of my video.
And now, let me take a minute to explain what's happening here. AI models are
reviewing my video and selecting the very best moments of the set to highlight for
me. It's using generative AI to ﬁll in the background while singing to the audio and
building transitions. And now as you can see, all of this happens in less than a minute
on my Laptop Go. All I have to do now is select my link and I'm all set.
So here's my video from the set. Something that probably would have taken me
hours to create without Clipchamp and I didn't have to watch 20 how to do videos.
And with one quick step, I can post my video directly to social channels like TikTok,
YouTube, and Instagram. How cool is that?
Thank you, Nicholas. Surface Laptop Go is the lightest, most portable laptop laptop.
Now, I want to show you the most powerful one. Take a look at Surface Laptop
Studio 2.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21

This is Surface Laptop Studio 2, the most powerful Surface we have ever built.
Unmatched productivity, versatility and creativity, all in a single laptop. The original
Surface laptop studio was the most performant device we had ever shipped and this
one is twice as fast. With an Intel 13th Gen i7 H class processor, and NVIDIA GeForce
RTX 4050 and 4060 GPUs, for designers, engineers, or 3D artists who need
professional workloads, we also oﬀer NVIDIA's RTX 2000. All that to say, this device
powers graphics, intensive workloads, with ease.
With NVIDIA's DLSS 3.5, you get sharper textures, smoother gameplay and more
realistic lighting, and the HDR boost for increased peak brightness, our 14.4-inch
screen looks absolutely amazing. It sounds great, too, with spatial audio from Dolby
Atmos on our powerful Omnisonic speakers. And whether you are a gamer, a
designer, or a developer, we designed Surface Laptop Studio for you. Now not only
does it have a great GPU and CPU, but there's one more processor that I want to tell
you about. It's the ﬁrst Intel NPU on Windows, bringing you Windows Studio FX.
Now let me tell you why that's important. Surface Pro 9 5G set the AI benchmark and
now we extend that to Laptop Studio 2. This is Windows as a platform, scaling AI
silicon experiences across the entire ecosystem. Now, we're also excited to tell you
about the Haptic touchpad on Laptop Studio. It is out of this world. It has precision,
comfort, and the perfect feeling click across the entire touchpad. And best of all, it
was designed with inclusivity in mind. We are proud to announce that it is the most
inclusive touchpad on any laptop today.
Solomon, from our inclusive design team, is here to share more.
Thank you, Brett. I was born without ﬁngers on my left hand and that has caused me
to use my right hand for double duty my entire life and it's wearing out. I'm
developing issues that most folks get later in life, arthritis, repetitive stress injuries
and a weaker grip. To rest my right hand, I need to move activities to the left.
Mousing is a struggle. Touchpads don't respond to my left hand. As I move my hand
across the touchpad, the cursor does not. This is a barrier. As a mobile professional, I
can't carry an entire ergonomic setup with me everywhere I go. It forces me and
others dealing with similar disabilities to just work through the pain.
But for the ﬁrst time ever, this new Precision haptic touchpad makes it possible for
people like me to use a laptop in the way that is most natural to us. I toggle on
Adaptive Touch and all of a sudden it responds to my hand. I can even resize the
right-click region to turn the touchpad into a large two-button mouse. I cried the ﬁrst
time I got to use this, because as a product maker, it showed me the amazing things
we can do when we include the disability community. And as a member of that
community, it was amazing to see myself reﬂected in the products that we make.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21

Adrienne BrewbakerNow the adaptive touchpad features are only the latest advancement in accessibility
we've made in the last year. Our adaptive pen grips also make it easier for people to
physically interact with their devices. Voice access provides a touchless experience.
The Microsoft adaptive accessories and Copilot reduced the number of clicks and
keystrokes necessary to complete a task. We are empowering people to use their
devices in ways we never could before. Thank you.
Thank you, Solomon. Now that was incredible. We love that Surface Laptop Studio is
providing everyone with more ways to work, learn and create. To share more, I would
like to welcome Adrienne to the stage.
Thanks, Brett. There's really no other laptop out there where power and versatility
come together quite like this. Let's see what that means using Adobe Photoshop and
their new generative AI tools. So ﬁrst, I'm going to move the screen down here into
studio mode. Pull up this photo I took. This is Obi-Wan, he's my dog nephew. I'm
going to zoom in here, I can interact naturally with touch and I'll pick up my slim pen,
which is always stored and charging under the keyboard. Now I want to make a few
changes here. I'll remove some of these buildings, clean it up a bit. Just like that,
they're gone.
Now I took this photo on my phone in portrait and I want to get it into landscape.
And using Adobe's tools, I can just select the image and kick oﬀ generative ﬁll. So
what's happening here is Adobe Fireﬂy generative AI is essentially going to infer
what this picture would have looked like if it were taken in landscape. Think about it
like cropping an image, but in reverse. It's super powerful, something that would
have taken me hours before now takes seconds. So again, this is what we started
with and this is what we did in just a few seconds with no keyboard, touchpad or
mouse on the new Laptop Studio.
Now let's switch gears a bit and think about the performance of this device. Surface
Laptop Studio is an incredible tool for creators. We're achieving up to two times
more graphics performance than the MacBook Pro M2 Max. But let me make that
real for you in the life of a 3D designer. I have a model open here in Blender, it's a
popular open source 3D creation app. And I have a MacBook Pro M2 Max here next
to my Surface. We're going to do a bit of a side-by-side comparison of a real-life
rendering workﬂow.
So I'm going to kick it oﬀ here right now. I'm rendering the same exact model on
both devices, it's from a short ﬁlm by Blender Studio. It's an animated image, so it's
super demanding on the GPUs. The speed in which it's rendering here on the laptop
studio is going to really show oﬀ. There we go. It's going to really show oﬀ the power
of the device. And when combined with the versatility of a touchscreen, pen, and
three modes, it truly is the ultimate device for creators. It looks like the Laptop Studio
has ﬁnished here and the Mac is still going.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-09-21

Yusuf MehdiPretty fast, 37 seconds for the Surface Studio to ﬁnish. What can we do while we wait
for the Mac?
Do you want to run a 7 billion parameter model locally?
Let's do it.
All right. So let's check this out. This is the Llama 2 LLM running locally on Laptop
Studio. It's a generative language model and it's trained on 2 trillion tokens that you
can chat with. It's pretty awesome. So if you're a dev, you're going to want to run
large language models like this locally and to process these AI models, you need
these powerful GPUs. As you can see, it's running seamlessly on Laptop Studio.
Awesome. It looks like Surface Laptop Studio 2 twice as fast as the MacBook Pro M2
Max.
Pretty amazing.
Thank you, Adrienne. We, the team, and I are pumped about these devices. They're
both available October 3. Pre-order starts today. We can't wait to see what you can
do with Copilot, Windows 11 and Microsoft 365 on Surface. Thank you. Now, Yusuf.
