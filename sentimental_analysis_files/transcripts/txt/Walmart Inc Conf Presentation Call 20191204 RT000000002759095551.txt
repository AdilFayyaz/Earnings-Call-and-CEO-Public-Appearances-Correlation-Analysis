{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Good morning, everyone. My name is Karen Short, and I'm the staples and hardline
retail analyst at Barclays. We're very pleased to introduce Doug McMillon, President
and CEO of Walmart, at our Eat, Sleep, Play Conference. Welcome.
Before we begin, you can see Walmart's full safe harbor on their website. And before
I actually get into the real introduction, I would like to say that the reason that I'm
holding this coat up is because I bought it at Walmart, and my husband's sisters liked
it so much that they immediately, after Thanksgiving, went on the website and
bought three of the same coat. So, now we're basically quadruplets.
So, while Doug needs no introduction, I'm sure everyone in this room appreciates
that Doug has worked at Walmart for almost 30 years, starting as a teenager
unloading trucks, for what I'm sure is a lot less than $15 an hour. He served in senior
leadership roles in all of Walmart's business segments, was President and CEO of
Sam's Club from 2005 to 2009, President and CEO of Walmart International from
2009 to 2014. Doug became President and CEO of Walmart in 2014. To say the least,
he's a culture carrier, and under his leadership, Walmart has meaningfully evolved in
a very positive way from many perspectives, not just ﬁnancials.
But before that, Doug was way ahead of his time. So, I would like to read a quote
from a letter he wrote in 1994. Retailing always changes. That change is driven by the
customer and fueled by ingenuity. Retailers come and go. The technology exists.
Information superhighway, virtual reality, 3D television, cable TV system. Our
customer wants to be able to shop conveniently, save money and trust the company
that gets their money, shopping primarily for convenience. This will be done
electronically and interactively. Home delivery will have to play a part. It's easy.
Electronic retailing can tailor an assortment to a particular individual. Information is
key. This could potentially be our most important asset. This quote was from 1994.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Doug McMillonSo, I mean, needless to say, it was unbelievably prophetic and well ahead of its time
in predicting the future of retail.
So, with that, I actually would like to ask you, where would you say retail is today
versus where you thought it would be and then what predictions that you have today
if we're looking at the next 25 years?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Good luck with that, 20, 25 years from now. Well, what happened there is that
we had just started to think about what we could become on the Internet, and the
company had chosen a person to go lead it. And I was wanting to be part of it, and I
sent that to the Chief Merchant at Walmart and said, can I go join that team. And he
said, that's a really great note, go get back to work, like you have a responsibility
right now and you need to learn the core business. And that was a great decision,
and I did. But we, Walmart, missed an opportunity to become what we're now trying
to become. And I own that and we own that, and now we're trying to catch up and
become what ultimately, we can become and serve customers in these incredible
ways.
I think the next 25 years, we'll have the same themes. The three themes that are there
are value, ease of use and fun. And there is a bit of a Maslow's hierarchy of needs. I
mean, there are a lot of people around the world, including here in the U.S., that
have to save money. They're living on a budget. But if they can save money and have
it be an easy, delightful experience, that's what they'll choose. And if you could do
that and make it fun, because the items are fun or the experience is fun in some way,
then you've got it all. And on our platform, I think we can deliver value for sure. But
the world's about more than price now. And so, we've got to be able to do some of
these other things. And so, for the next 25 years, we'll be working, I think, on
basically those same three themes.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
That's helpful. And I mentioned culture at the beginning. A strong culture, I would
say, is an attribute that frequently gets missed from a competitive perspective. As an
outsider looking in, I would say you have dramatically changed the culture at
Walmart. So, maybe just talk a little bit about that.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I do think it's really important. What we went through as a leadership team a few
years ago was this recognition that a lot of change was needed, and we asked
ourselves very literally how are we going to lead through that change and what do
our people need to hear from us as we embark on this. And we decided to focus on
what wasn't going to change ﬁrst, and we have the beneﬁt of being founded by an
incredible individual and a group of people, starting with Sam Walton. And Sam had
incredible characteristics that led Walmart to be what it is today, and those
characteristics are timeless, and we still want to embody many of those.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 17Karen Short
Doug McMillonAnd what we decided to do was to say to our team, we have a purpose and the
purpose is we save people money and help them live a better life. And it came out
of Sam's mouth shortly before he passed away in 1992 when the President came
down to present him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And we keep replaying
that to say this is the purpose, it's timeless, this is what we're trying to do, but it's
broad enough to work on more than just price. This idea of helping people live a
better life is a really broad canvas to paint on.
And then, the other thing that's going to be consistent was we have four timeless
values as a company, and we restated those for everyone, anchored them and said
we want to have behaviors that align to those four values. Now that you know what's
going to be the same, our purpose and our values, everything else is open to
change. If customers don't want stores, we won't have stores. Our job is to meet
their wants and needs in whatever way that those should be met.
Now, fast-forward to today, I think we're even more convinced now that there's a
great role for stores to play and that the assets that we have are an advantage and
can help us win with the customer in the future. But we're not married too much. And
so, culturally, we have tried to create more of a tolerance for failure, more risk-taking,
more speed, higher expectations. Sam Walton had incredibly high expectations. We
can own that in today's world and embody that. And so, those are some of the
characteristics that we're trying to dial up as it relates to cultural change.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Maybe since you brought up Sam, I think he had 10 rules for business basically, and
rule number 10 was swim upstream. So, maybe talk a little bit about that one,
because there's many examples since at least you've become CEO of swimming
upstream.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Love that list of principles and that one in particular, and Sam did it. I mean, he
went into self-distribution of nonfood early. He went into self-distribution of food, he
and David Glass later on. They did proﬁt sharing. They did satellite communication.
They did Retail Link. They did all these things that were unique and people said, in
some cases, were the wrong things to do. There was a time when David was leading
the company that people were writing stories about Walmart being dead. They can't
grow internationally, they've become dependent on low-margin food, Sam's passed
away, Walmart's over. We love those kinds of stories. That's great billboard material.
And today, we -- I think we can do an even better job of swimming upstream, being
counterintuitive. But there's magic in being diﬀerent, like being -- strategy is about
choice and it's about being diﬀerent, making diﬀerent choices. And it wasn't very
long ago, people said the idea of Walmart delivering groceries all the way into the
refrigerator is crazy and that's never going to happen and nobody is going to want it
and they'll be afraid to use that service. And now, we're live in Kansas City, Pittsburgh
and Vero Beach. And I was delivering orders with our associates in Kansas City the
other day, and we haven't had any customers stop once they start. Some of themFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Page 4 of 17Karen Short
Doug McMillonhave bought a refrigerator to put in the garage, so we're not in their house, but
nobody stopped.
Why? Because it's easy, like we just take care of it for you. We have a great
assortment at a great price, and anything you don't enjoy about shopping. And
probably our words will even change in the future, we may not even say shopping
because Walmart starts to look more like a service than a merchant. We'll still be
merchants, but you just have to think about this oﬀer, the customer value proposition
in a diﬀerent way. So, I think we'll have problems with that. We'll have problems with
the Walmart Health initiative in Georgia. We'll learn from some of those things, but
swimming upstream is still part of who we are.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
That's helpful. I guess maybe just since you're talking about strategy, if you think
about where Walmart is today strategically versus where you wanted to be, say, a
couple of years ago, how would you characterize it and maybe where are you a little
bit behind and where are you ahead?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. We've made progress, but I would have thought we would have been further
along, in ecommerce in particular. Adding these brands, building this assortment,
getting all the details right related to it have just taken some time. Real improvement
in terms of the assortment, of the oﬀer, of delivery. Even as we speak this quarter, our
ability to manage ecommerce delivery is much better than it was, but we're not
satisﬁed with that progress and would like to see more.
Probably positively surprised about how grocery pickup has gone. Five years ago,
we were doing the grocery delivery business in U.K. We took our Board of Directors
actually to visit Asda, the very ﬁrst Board meeting that we had when I was in this job,
and the point I've taken them to the U.K. was to show them grocery pickup and
delivery. And in the U.K., they went from stores to stores plus delivery more than 15
years ago, maybe 20 years ago now, and they skipped pickup. And you've probably
noticed when you've been in the U.K., even the QSR oﬀer doesn't include pickups
sometimes, there's no drive-throughs. In America, we'd like drive-through for
everything, right? But that's not the case there.
So, we made a choice when we came back. We needed to learn how to do eﬃcient
pick in the store. We took Asda system as our ﬁrst system back here in the U.S. to
start learning how. I think Denver and Northern California are the ﬁrst few places that
we went. But our choice was let's see how much demand there is for pickup before
we think about delivery, because we like the economics of pickup better, we like
store visits better than not, and America drives through, so let's give this a shot. And
we thought it would be good, but it's been incredibly good and customers really
love it, moms with car seats in particular. And now that we've learned how to pick
more eﬃciently and we continue to -- that unlocks the ability to do delivery, which
leads to other things, including the InHome service.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Doug McMillon{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Maybe -- actually on that note then, can you talk kind of about the healthy tension
between bricks-and-mortar and ecommerce, I guess, in the context of Innovator's
Dilemma that you've referenced, I think, in the past?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Years ago, the company sent a few of us to Harvard for a couple weeks. The
course I went through was Leading Change and Organizational Renewal, and Clay
Christensen was one of our speakers. And I have read Innovator's Dilemma, and
then he came in and had a session with us that really brought it to life, and I could
see it playing out in Walmart. And I was responsible for books and movies and music
and categories like that as a General Merchandise Manager in Walmart in 2000,
2001 and 2002, and could see this tension within the company and what people
were thinking about the future of ecommerce and the internet and wanted to ﬁnd a
way to grow this futuristic business and marry it with the core business that we were
building at the same time. So, really got focused on those sets of lessons from
Dr.Christensen.
So, now you fast-forward to today, we're further along and it's less of an issue within -
- inside the company than it was a few years ago. But this human behavior does kick
in to say, hey, I run a big business and it makes money and I've got investments that I
can make that will make that even stronger. And you want to take some investments
and you want to put them into a business that's nascent right now, that loses money
and do that for how long and how much do you want to invest and lose to try and do
that and how long will that take to pay back. And so, there's -- I mean, I was a food
buyer for our discount stores. When we started Supercenters, we had the exact same
tension. I bought Coca-Cola and snacks, and we had another Coca-Cola and snack
buyer for our Supercenters that sat upstairs. We both negotiated with Coke and
other people over pricing, and you could feel this tension between the new start-up
that was a Supercenter and the established proﬁtable business. It's human behavior.
So, it results in great conﬂict and discussion, strategic choice, and I've really enjoyed
working with this team to try and set those priorities to get this right. Think about
how fast do you want to go, what do you want the shape of operating income to
look like while you grow with this idea that you could have Walmart transform to get
to the next generation of retail, which is not easy to do. And there are many stories of
retailers that didn't make the jump to the future and went away as a result, and I
don't want to have anything to do with that and neither does the rest of the
company.
So, we'll feel this tension for a long time and somehow this omnichannel thing within
the company will come together. We brought the supply chain team together. We
brought the customer team together. We brought the ﬁnance team together. We'll
eventually bring other pieces together, and then we'll be sitting here in the future
talking about some other tension point, where we're starting something new that has
a conﬂict with the old, and we'll have the same human behavior that we see today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Doug McMillon{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Maybe just -- and with respect to Walmart U.S., obviously with the leadership
changes, John has big shoes to ﬁll, and Greg has been a big part of the
transformation.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
You bet.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
So, maybe talk a little bit about that.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Sure. Greg's extraordinary, and it has been an honor and a blessing to work with him
for so many years now, and thankful that he came and joined the company. He went
to China and he put China on a stronger foundation for us. And then, he came and
did the same thing in the United States. And we've always known that he would end
up going home someday, and I'm excited about what he's going to go and do, and
we'll be eternally grateful.
John is a lifer, and he's done so many diﬀerent things within the company. He's over
30 -- over 25, almost 30 years with the company, worked in merchandising, worked
in operations, worked in sourcing, worked in Walmart U.S., moved to China doing
merchandising and marketing, a lot of years at Sam's Club. So, he's really well
positioned to know the detail of the business, our business model, a lot of
relationships with associates around the world, and he is incredibly open to the
future, thinks digitally, is embracing new ways of working and thinking, and we're
really excited about his leadership, and grateful to Greg.
And then, we backﬁlled John and Sam's Club with Kath McLay, and Kath's going to
be extraordinary. She came from Woolworths in Australia, the same place that Greg
came from coincidentally. So, now I've got an Australian, an Indian, a Brit. The
leadership team is a diverse leadership team with global expertise, and we're
excited about that.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Yeah. Actually, I guess I hadn't appreciated the global diversity as much, but that
obviously gives you an advantage. Maybe switching back to ecommerce for a
second, can you maybe rank order what the challenges have been in terms of
making ecommerce less unproﬁtable, I guess?

Doug McMillon
Karen ShortI think the ﬁrst thing is the assortment.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
We've got to build the right choices for our customers across categories, apparel,
home, hardlines in particular, get the right brands online. Second thing that comes
to mind is you've got to deliver on time, and we've now got fulﬁllment center
capability that's enabled us to make improvements there. We've been able to add
next-day as a capability for some items. So, I think those pieces are coming together.
We still have work to do on the app and the site in terms of the user experience, still
design improvements to be made there. And then also in our future, we've got two
apps that we're really driving, our grocery app and the walmart.com app. We've got
to resolve that in some way to tie the whole thing together. So, lots more to do to
make the whole omnichannel thing come to life, but we're closing in on it.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
So, why -- on the general merchandise side, why do you think that that has been
more challenging than you anticipated?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I personally underestimated how many items and brands we're talking about. I was a
store merchant for many years with people showing up, wanting to sell into Walmart
all the time. So, the thought to me that you could say yes to all of them and just give
them fulﬁllment center space is like it sounds really easy. I could just take it all, like
put it all in the ecommerce fulﬁllment center and we'll sell it all. It's not as simple.
There is some curation that needs to take place. In some cases, we didn't staﬀ with
people and human beings enough to be able to really get it done. There's work to
set-up the items, get them online, get them in-stock, and the whole thing is just --
take the last two years, we've added 7,500 brands. We've added a ton of SKUs. We
built a marketplace business that's growing. Those things just take time. Not
everything that's digital is easy and it's not all digital. It requires people and it
requires capital. And so, it just takes a while to build it. So, we're not pleased. We'd
like to go faster, and we're constantly looking for ways to do that.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Yeah. Maybe just switching to International for a second, back in 2017, you showed us
a slide that looked at the three buckets of assets, and there was the diversiﬁed
portfolio asset. I think some investors at the time might have thought that that might
have been an indication that there might have been a little more consolidation of the
portfolio. Can you maybe talk a little bit about those markets speciﬁcally, the
diversiﬁed portfolio?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Doug McMillon{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I think what we've learned is in a post ecommerce omnichannel age, we don't
have the people, the time, and in some cases, just the capital to transform every one
of these businesses. And if we can't transform it fast enough, we need to let
somebody else do it. And so, there is a prioritization of markets, and we've been
really clear about the priority markets that we want to be in for the future. And then,
we listed the rest of those markets in that meeting and went to work on the portfolio.
You'll know that we tried to merge our business with Sainsbury's in the U.K., and
unfortunately, the Competition Commission didn't approve that. We think they
should have.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Right.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
It would have been good for our consumers in the market, but they didn't. So, you
can see that -- whether it's the deal we did in Brazil where we sold down to the
minority or the action there in the U.K. that we are interested in having this portfolio
include fewer countries. But the assets that we have are valuable, and we're not just
going to give them away. So, we've got to ﬁnd strategic solutions to these things that
are fair, given the values of these businesses. But we'll keep looking for
opportunities to set them up for success.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
And then, I guess just in light of The Wall Street Journal article today regarding India,
nothing really new from my perspective. But maybe a little -- some color on how you
think the Flipkart acquisition is going relative to plan? I mean, I know what you've
said guidance-wise, but in light of that article.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Quite a few years on the ground in India now. We've had a cash-and-carry
business there. We had a JV in retail in the past. We have a sourcing relationship
there. So, we've gotten to know the country over many years and understand what
happens with regulation and politics and the various stakeholders that government
is striving to serve, including the (inaudible) and farmers. And we keep telling
everybody we want to make the country better, we want to invest. We want to help
build out the supply chain. We want to help remove -- reduce food waste. We want
to pay farmers more. We believe these platforms that Flipkart and PhonePe
represent can be really good for (inaudible) and support B2B, not B2C. So, glad we
made the investment, excited about it, see a ton of opportunity there across all those
areas that I just mentioned, and we expect there will be change and volatility, and
regulatory changes will be part of that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Doug McMillonWe're trying to make sure that we communicate with everybody what our intentions
are, so that we're welcomed and can become an even more important part of Indian
society. And we communicate with government leadership and others frequently to
try and make sure we're communicating clearly. Over time, we expect volatility.
There's volatility in every country, and India will be no exception. And in the end, we
have a great opportunity with Flipkart and the way that that ecosystem is being built
out and a really nice asset with PhonePe.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Maybe can you actually elaborate a little bit on the PhonePe ecosystem because, I
mean, there's a lot of diﬀerent components to it that are fairly complex?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Super interesting. There are diﬀerent types of payment platforms in the country, and
we use UPI underpinning, which enables the banks to participate in payment and
makes the platform a place where others can win, it's not just one player, but
everybody that participates in the ecosystem. We think that's favorably advantaged.
And the use cases are moving from being just payment-based to other use cases,
which creates more of a super app oﬀer in the market comparable to some of the
things that have happened in China.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
So, how does PhonePe's capabilities compare to some of the competitors with some
type of pay oﬀerings speciﬁcally in India?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. Well, there are diﬀerent types of platforms, and the UPI platform, as I
mentioned earlier, is more of the open form and that's why we like it. And then other
types of payments have chosen diﬀerent use cases to focus on, and so that's another
place where the diﬀerentiation comes up. And then the third place is the relationship
that exists between PhonePe and Flipkart. We're now starting to extend that more to
(inaudible) to help their customer experience improve and link the whole thing
together. So, that's work that's underway.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Okay. So, Walmart Health was unveiled in September. A second location, I think you
said January. Maybe can you talk a little bit about what your vision is for Walmart
Health broadly and some kind of color on how it's going so far with the ﬁrst
opening?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 17Karen Short
Doug McMillon
Karen ShortYeah. It feels like we have an opportunity to help the country and to build a stronger
business, and really encouraged by this ﬁrst opening. I was a little concerned with
the complexity of healthcare and opening our ﬁrst unit, and we knew it would be so
public and hard to imagine getting all of that right. But I think the team has just done
a terriﬁc job. I know you've been there. Some of the others in the room have been
there. But the experience for patients, for customers when they come in is really
great. They can get a suite of services. We do x-ray work. We do blood work, vision,
hearing, dentistry, which is hysterical to me because my dad was a dentist and I just
can't imagine being a dentist working at Walmart, but people are enjoying it. And
the medical doctor that works there, Dr.Mehta is enjoying his incentive structure and
the way that he can work with other healthcare professionals to really take care of a
patient when they come through the front door. We oﬀer mental health counseling
at an aﬀordable way.
So, that suite of preventative care, really, it's not focused on treating chronic
conditions or urgent care, it's more about access to quality, aﬀordable preventative
care at a great value. And combined with our pharmacy business and our optical
business, we got a foundation to put together and it helps customers save time, have
access. It helps us drive store traﬃc. There is a lot of work to be done to build the
systems and put the data in place in a way that helps us connect, like what dietary
choices a person's making with healthcare and letting customers be in the driver's
seat as to how that data gets used. A lot of work in front of us to be able to do that,
and it's very early days, but it is encouraging.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
And I think there is a view that there is no way that this could be run proﬁtably given
what some of the price points are. But I think that's not the case from my
understanding. So, maybe talk a little bit about what would draw a dentist or a
doctor to Walmart from an ecosystem perspective?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. The healthcare professionals that are there love the incentive structures, like
they're not being rewarded to send people to a specialty that might not need it,
they're being rewarded for caring for those patients. And so, we've got in the model
a really nice compensation plan for those who are involved, and we think an
appropriately aggressive depreciation schedule on the equipment, which is the
other thing that's on my mind. What we've got is you got people, you've got
expensive equipment, and you've got square footage. And we obviously know how
to manage square footage. What's new for us is managing all the pieces of
equipment that support a dentist, for example. So, we need to test this. We need to
learn is our model correct, does the return in that being what we've modeled it to
be? But so far so good.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
And how are you going about picking the locations? I mean, I think you've described
it as health desert basically, but -- so the next one is in Georgia. Maybe talk a little bitFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Doug McMillonabout the locations there.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. We'll open just a few more this next year, and we're trying to get an assortment
of experiences, the uniqueness by county or by location related to population,
general practitioner ratio, how insurance coverage works in that area, all those things
are being factored in. So, it won't be the same approach we had with Supercenters
where you just build out concentric circles around a distribution center. It'll be more
targeted than that. In early days, we want to get enough variety in our experiences to
be able to learn where it works, where it doesn't. And we don't think that we'll have
clinics as large as the one that we have in Dallas, Georgia in every location. We may
learn how to do diﬀerent sizes, and we need to put it in certain locations and not
every location.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Okay. And then when you think about the productivity loop, how would you describe
where Walmart is today with the productivity loop versus what you would have
expected when you started and how should we think about productivity loop
opportunities going forward?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. So, the simplistic Walmart productivity loop, where we lowered prices and
grew sales and leveraged costs and reinvested in price, that still holds. And as you
know, we've made price investments in the last few years to improve the value
oﬀering to the customer. In parallel, we've been working through how automation
can change the entire supply chain in the distribution centers, in our stores, and
we've been putting diﬀerent tools in place. So, our associates today have a
contemporary handheld with a set of applications on it that's more user-friendly,
saves them steps. We pay a lot of money with people walking back and forth across
Supercenters, and we want to reduce their steps as much as possible and put all the
data at their ﬁngertips, and we made progress on that. We've also put automation in
place in a pilot test phase in some distribution centers.
And then, in stores, I think, Karen, you've seen the automated ﬂoor cleaner with a
camera on it and a shelf scanner, where we're trying to do the checkouts fast and
delivering the bag. Basically, the Internet of Things is coming to life inside of retail
and there will be a combination of people and hardware and software that will make
that happen. And we're putting pieces of this system together now and learning
what works and what doesn't work. And basically, what happens with our associates
is, they had a list of tasks that ﬁt into their job, their job code, if you want to think of it
that way. And those tasks in some ways are now being done by automation. The
tasks that are remaining are being re-bundled into new jobs. And we've opened
around 200 academies around the country where we're training hundreds of
thousands of associates for their new role and helping them learn soft skills, how to
be a good coach, how to demonstrate empathy with a customer, but also the hard
skills to position them to do that new job code that we've created.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

store for pickup and delivery. And over time, I think you'll see the front-end ends up
with fewer cashiers, but still some cashiers and some of those folks are picking
grocery orders and maybe doing deliveries in the future. So, there will be changes
like those and others that happen to do the work that actually happens inside the
stores.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
So, actually on that note, how do you see the role of a Walmart associate evolving
going forward? I mean, in the context of -- you've reduced the number of employees
per store fairly dramatically over the last several years. How do you think about what
it will look like in the next couple?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
In the end, there's at least kind of three core functions. One is customer facing. We
use the word host to describe some of these jobs. You're a customer host. You may
be a customer host to the front-end, someday you may be a customer host as you're
delivering into the home, but you're forward-facing and related to people,
customers. Another one is the merchant job, and they're helping us decide how to
manage that inventory, drive in-stock, what to feature, how to grow sales in addition
to the support that they get with artiﬁcial intelligence and other things to know what
to feature, where to put products in the store. So, there's a merchant job. And then
there's another job that's related to fulﬁllment where you're basically turning the
store into a distribution center. And so, there's kind of those three categories that will
emerge over time as being themes.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
And actually on the note on the fulﬁllment angle, so grocery pickup, I think we could
all argue, has been much more successful than I think you would even have
expected. Can you talk a little bit about if there's any pattern on the demographic of
the pickup customer versus the delivery customer and -- versus InHome? I know
InHome is still early days.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. It is. I think it's unclear to me how the demographic will end up playing out
because I think many families are going to use multiple services. I think the way I'm
living, and you guys -- I bet a bunch of you're living the same way. I shop seamlessly.
I ﬁnd myself inside a Sam's Club, inside a Walmart, I use pickup, we use delivery. I
order online, have it shipped to my house, and I do that now at this point without
even really thinking about it. That's what seamless omnichannel looks like. So, I think
there will be a lot of American families that just use Walmart and they won't really
think of the channel. They'll just think of what they need at that particular moment. It
deﬁnitely happens in our house.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Karen ShortIn the end, I think delivery will end up being bigger than pickup, but pickup will be
really big and important and probably continue to grow for a long time. And then in-
store, we've seen in-store traﬃc continue to grow and be strong. And if we continue
improving the store experience and doing things like Walmart Health, improving the
fresh experience, creating additional services in the store, I think we can drive store
traﬃc into the future at the same time that we're building these other capabilities,
and that's the power of omnichannel, I suppose.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Actually, with respect to the stores, I know -- well, maybe you wouldn't say this, but I
would say from my observation, fresh was probably slower to get ﬁxed than you
would have liked. And when you -- you kind of reached the tipping point. You could
see it in the stores where suddenly fresh was working much better, and that was
when you started to get these mid-single-digit comps. And I think you've just
recently started testing Produce 2.0. So maybe talk a little bit about that and where
you see the quality of your fresh versus, say, your conventional competitors today
versus several years ago.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I think it's true in Sam's too, but in Walmart U.S. in particular, I'd give the team a
lot of credit for doing what's necessary to get us to this place. If they were here,
they'd say, oh, we still have a lot of upside, and I agree with that too. But the team
has gotten into the detail as it relates to sourcing, how we handle product all the way
through to supply chain. And then at that last step or steps in the process, I think we
were shorter on the number of hours we should have put into fresh to begin with.
And I think Greg and the team have resolved that. So, you're starting to see in-store
execution and presentation improve.
And Produce 2.0 is a diﬀerent set of ﬁxtures, a diﬀerent presentation. And when you
walk in the store, you can see the diﬀerence. It looks like a fresh market. There's a lot
of color. It's in your face. It feels aggressive from a merchandising point of view. And
I walked into my ﬁrst one in the El Paso market months ago and didn't realize I was
walking into a Produce 2.0 store. But when I walked through the door, it hit me that
this -- what has happened here in Produce, and then I was able to process and ﬁgure
out, oh, they've put Produce 2.0 here. It's got that kind of impact. We also have work
to do and the teams on it as it relates to our beef program and the quality of our
steaks and the consistency of that quality. And so, there's a lot of runway in front of
us to keep making fresh areas better. And it is -- I mean, it's harder than putting a
grocery item on the shelf. So, it takes experience and expertise and a system that
you have to put together.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Where would you say you are on the quality of fresh versus some of your larger
conventional --?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

We match up. I mean, I don't want to have our team get comfortable, but there are
multiple audiences that I'm talking to here, I'm sure, but we still -- we just have a lot
of upside, but we have a really competitive quality oﬀer and a great value in produce
today. I'm excited about that.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
I may turn it to the audience to see if there are any questions to start with. I had a
feeling there would be some.
Can you touch on just your thoughts of organic, vegan, all these diﬀerent diets that
are going forward and how Walmart can serve that customer? It seems just in my
markets that that's not where you go if you're on those types of diet.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. I think we have a lot of opportunity there. We made some progress. In some
cases, we had the items and they got lost in the assortment. In some cases, we
pulled items together and put a sign on it to help people ﬁnd it. So, it's grown. We
have a really great oﬀer in the areas you mentioned, plus things like gluten-free
today. I think we have an opportunity with the app and product location to do an
even better job of communicating to customers to help them navigate the
assortment to ﬁnd all the items they're looking for because they do still tend to get
lost. But if you look at the underlying numbers, you can see that we're taking
advantage of those growth opportunities as trends.
Doug, can I ask a question on -- I'm intrigued by the comment you made today and I
think on the earnings call that getting general merchandise right digitally requires a
longer tailed assortment than you might have assumed a couple of years ago. How
do you marry that comment or how do we marry that comment with what appears to
be a relatively limited next day assortment? And even as you grow that business, it
sounds like it'll continue to be relatively limited assortment. Is there like an obvious
tension in those two views or is there a nuance that we're kind of missing in
between?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
I don't think of it as tension, I just think of it as time. And I think what you should
expect from us is just incremental improvement all the time on SKU count, on the
number of items available next day. The mirroring that's happening in the fulﬁllment
centers is underway. So, we won't wake up one day and we've gone from X number
of items to 2 times. It'll just be a little bit of progress all the time.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04

Karen ShortThe same-day Supercenter opportunity for us is a place where we can lean in. And
the pickup plus delivery, we have this membership oﬀer now to get more frequent
deliveries. That's going to be important to us. And we're learning how to pick more
items within the Supercenter across general merchandise. So, it's not just a food and
consumable oﬀer, but it's the same-day Supercenter oﬀer, so that you can get almost
all the items from the Supercenter very quickly. So that will help us reach immediate
demand with a great assortment of items, while at the same time we're building out
more next-day items and a broader ecommerce assortment, which will be a
combination of 1P and 3P.
Our marketplace opportunity is still there, it's grown, and we're not particularly great
at taking care of sellers today. We've got tools. They need to be improved and more
tools that need to be added and more services that need to be added. So, I think
that's another opportunity for us to serve the customer. We have a habit score that
we measure from customers, asking them if we have what they're looking for, and
our habit score has continued to improve incrementally, and I think that trend will
continue, which will help us with the mix too.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
Any other questions in the room? Maybe thinking about -- I don't know, so what's on.
Maybe thinking about the fourth wall at the Supercenter. I know at a prior
conference, that was an area of discussion as an opportunity to really serve all the
needs of your shoppers. Maybe how do you see things ﬁve years from now, how do
you think that fourth wall will look?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Yeah. It's going to be really fun to watch and probably won't be limited to fourth wall.
Somehow, we'll ﬁgure out how to expand even beyond that. A few months ago, the
CEO of a supplier company called me and said, Doug, I've got a great idea for your
vestibule space upfront on the fourth wall and here's the size of the prize, and I can
help you deliver it. I just need you to get your team to say yes to this. It made a lot of
sense. I got excited. I ran over to the U.S. team and said, hey, this person called and
they've got this idea. They looked at me and said, yeah, yeah, that's about the 15th
best idea we've got.
Look at the things that we can do that are now in front of us to create more services.
We've got veterinary services, non-surgical vet services in dozens of stores now. And
including in Dallas, Georgia, you may have seen it where we've got Walmart Health.
We can not only help you as a human being, but we can also help you with your pet,
because it relates to health. So, there are many opportunities for us in that space,
ﬁnancial services, beauty, a long list of things that we can do. The time where people
might have been worried that our boxes were too big has long passed. I mean, the
Supercenter footprint and positioning gives us a great opportunity to expand
services and help the economics of the model.

Doug McMillonAnd maybe for a last question. You have a long to-do list, obviously for Walmart, but
when you do eventually decide to step down, are you able to kind of picture what
your legacy will be?
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Are you in a hurry for that to happen.
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
No.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
(inaudible) thinking about that very much. Do you know something that I don't
know?
{BIO 7215781 <GO>}
You're going to make me blush.
{BIO 3063017 <GO>}
Me too. I think it's important for us all to have an end in mind in whatever it is that
we're doing, parenting or business or whatever it is. What is that you want when this
thing is all said and done to have happened or people to say. And the two things
that have kind of come to mind repetitively are, ﬁrst of all, positioning, are we in the
right businesses? And that relates to countries, product categories, services. You can
catch waves and I want us to be positioned to be able to catch waves and not be in
some things that don't have momentum.
And then the second thing, which is more important, I think, is related to your
question about culture. It's about adaptability, openness to change. You can be in
front of a group of Walmart associates around the world and you could say to them,
other than our purpose and values, the only thing that's constant at Walmart is, and
they will be back to you, change. And once they say that, you can then say, okay, let's
talk about what's going to go change next. When you have that kind of culture
where people will lean into, and I hear it all the time from our store associates, they'll
say things like you know, you changed this process from this to this, and in the
beginning, I didn't like it. It's hard to change as human beings. But in the end, it was
really good, but please ﬁx this one aspect. And they don't go with you. And Sam
created that and our other leaders over the years have helped foster it.
And so, I'd like to help strengthen that to the point where I know when I walk out of
Sam's oﬃce the last day that that team is positioned to win after I'm gone. And that's
cultural, that's way of working, it's that kind of stuﬀ.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-04
