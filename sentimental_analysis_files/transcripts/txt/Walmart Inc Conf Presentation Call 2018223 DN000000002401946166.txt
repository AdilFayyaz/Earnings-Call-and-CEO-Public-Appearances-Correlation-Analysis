you expect to have a lasting impact?
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you so much for having me today. Thank you, CohnReznick for
partnering on this, and thank you -- and for hosting it and thank you, Bloomberg for
hosting it. Also I'm delighted to be a part of this panel. I think it's a very timely and
very topical what we are discussing today in terms of consumer trends. If you go to
the slide deck as you can see, you mentioned the key word about what are the key
trends. We've got a key right there. As we look out at the landscape and think about
the key trends, the consumer space today is shifting at such a rapid pace. We've
never seen the pace of change so accelerated. Let's go through some of the key
trends and we will touch on some of the themes of each.
Number one is about demographics, with the shift to millennials really changing the
spending behavior of consumers. It's going be very interesting to see the evolution
of these millennials, and especially as they age, they do become even more like their
babyboomer parents, having kids, buying homes, requires some of those mindsets,
but also the way they're inﬂuenced and the way their spending patterns evolve is
diﬀerent, and we will talk more about that.
Number two, we're seeing omni-channel. It's changing consumer priorities and
shopping patterns. One of the most interesting elements of holiday season 2017 was
the fact that there was a more integrated perspective with bricks and mortar and
digital being more integrated today than we've ever seen before. Companies know
how to manage it better, the sales associates know how to work with it better,
consumers know how to manage it better. And I think the shift toward physical and
digital, not either/or but both, continues into the future.
Number three, looking at new technologies, driving traﬃc and certainly oﬀering
enhanced shopping experiences, whether it's buy online, pickup in store, whether
it's ship from store, whether it's technologies like Magic Mirror, we're now seeing
technology impact traﬃc patterns and traﬃc ﬂows. The data that companies have
available to them, in order to manage consumer shopping patterns, and know how
to appeal to consumers, know how to communicate with them, certainly is allowing
shopping experiences to be more meaningful, because today instead of the
customer going to the store, the store is coming to the customer also.
And speaking of using that word experiences, consumers are demanding
experiences and services over goods. When you think about the growth rate of
experiences and services, as compared to goods, we've seen an compound annual
growth rate in excess of 4% for service growth, as compared to just under 4% for
goods growth. And what we're seeing is that brands today aren't just selling goods,
but they're also selling their experience -- the experiences.
What does the brand mean? I've always believed that a brand has to say what it does
and do what it says, it matters. And lastly personalization and globalization are keyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 3 of 20drivers in the landscape. And what we mean by that is there's always an individual
identiﬁcation factor that's helping to change that consumer -- the consumer
landscape. Today you can go to an American Eagle, and all of a sudden have
patches monogrammed on your denim jeans, and its your jeans. It's not any one
else's, it's yours. And this personalization factor creates uniqueness, and also allows
consumers to have their own items that are just relative to them.
Globalization works makes -- the world's big and small for everyone, because today
what's trending in Australia, can become popular in the UK and then can also matter
in Columbus, Ohio and other places throughout the United States. The world
happens to the big and small at the same time, and when I think of what makes
companies great and what are the skill sets that they need to have today that diﬀers
from the past, number one, is about product innovation. If you don't have newness in
product and you're not able to innovate, then you're not going to have a repeat
customer.
Number two was about speed. And speed in developing product, and speed in
delivering product. That development and delivery helps you maintain your market
share and also increase it. And then data, the data to learn about what to produce,
what consumers prefer and not just having data for the sake of having data, but how
do you learn from it, what knowledge does it give you to make a retailer and to make
a brand bigger.
So those are some of the key trends. And just following up on that, take a look at the
demographic shifts. Millennials are impacting retail spending. You're seeing a
millennial generation today that is larger than the baby boomers and watch out
because Gen Z is coming, and they're also going to have more inﬂuence. We're
seeing buying power today and into the future where the millennials are going to
have greater buying power than their parent. And part of the reason for that is they
are going to be the generation that inherits the most wealth.
They are going to be inheriting the most wealth from babyboomer parents. And
when you think about savvy, frankly think about what the millennials and how they
grow up. They are the ﬁrst generation to go up -- to grow up that are consumer
savvy. They text instead of face-to-face phone calls, and face-to-face meetings. They
basically learn about brands and learn about trends through social media. Bloggers
today are the new celebrities and basically the new arbiters of what matters.
In the past it may have been TV, it may have been newspaper, magazines and radios,
but there is a new way to reach generations. And you know what, Gen Z has even a
newer way Instagram and Snapchat can make brands, can make product categories
grow or shrink. The inﬂuencers out there, like I mentioned about the bloggers. I
know many C level. Executives at many retail establishments, that now talk to
bloggers on a daily basis in order to see what's trending. That compares to what
babyboomers -- what their inﬂuencer were, which typically has been traditional
advertising.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 20Stephen Wyss
Dana TelseyAnd then distribution channels. For millennials there isn't one channel, there is all
channels. And I think you're seeing that with Gen Z also. With babyboomers it was
traditionally in store. They had to make a set time, had to create a destination and
basically use a part of what may have been discretionary time in order to spend it on
purchase patterns. And we're seeing the shopping experiences today diﬀer.
Babyboomers required customer service. It was do it for me. When you think of
millennials, millennials are interactive. They want convenience and they want to be
connected. And so therefore what we see is access versus ownership. Take a look at
how the economy is changing.
We are seeing productivity growth require automation, given the fact that the
average annual growth rate of the US labor force is less than US population. So non-
traditional work like becoming an Uber driver isn't considered work. Hotel
occupancy rates are at or near their all time highs, yet there is an average decline in
room rates. The reason why Airbnb, the access of Airbnb, the access of Uber and the
sharing economy is where the millennials, that's how they live, and that's how they
experience life.
Unlike babyboomers, who are all about ownership. It was a right of passage,
certainly a right of evolution to own homes, to buy cars, to buy luxury goods. And
the world is evolving, today where today what certainly is valued is time, time and
experience. When you think about what we seeing in the omni-channel world, -- I am
sorry did you have a question?
I did, actually Dana, wanted to interject real quickly because that's a lot of really
great information. Yeah, to your point there was an interesting article on
Bloomberg.com yesterday, called the death of clothing, and that highlighted the
change in consumer spending habits, with consumer spending on apparel at just 3%
of their total expenditures, compared to 18% on experiences. And I guess in going
through the items that you noted, wanted to get your opinion or thoughts on, how
do apparel, speciﬁcally retailers and consumer companies better compete with
experiences?
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}
So couple of things. I read that article, and I think one of the interesting things that
we have been also talking about is, it used to be that women for the most part,
bought apparel for four reasons, to wear to work; to wear on the weekends; to wear
to the gym; and wear to a party. And today there is only two reasons. Wearing to a
party, because work, -- and work weekend and gym are all integrated. How do you
make an apparel an experience that's part of what we mentioned with American
Eagle, make it special and personal. Are you going to make a fashion show? Are you
going to have a sales associate be able to interact with you personally?
Everyone -- no longer are words used in order to communicate, pictures are. So how
are you as a sales associate going to deliver pictures to the consumer to make them
come to your store. Create that experience of a must-have now, with limited quantity,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Having designers there makes you feel like wow, this is customized for me. And that
was very good article. I read it yesterday.
It was. That so good if you're an apparel manufacturer or retailer.
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}
Got to be diﬀerent. When you think on page 4, about omni-channel it is the key to
customer engagement. 90% of returns are occurring in store, 70% of online sales
touch a physical store. Companies are learning faster, how to become omni-channel
retailers. And I think as more retailers begin to report their results, we're going to
hear about the advancements that they've made in omni-channel initiatives. And the
retailers and the landlords are partnering together with new technologies in order to
enhance shopping patterns and traﬃc patterns.
Take a look at for example Sephora, and the Beauty Bag where consumers can view
their saved shopping lists, their buying history and has workshops that can teach
you. Teaching matters. When you think about other changes that have gone on in
our industry, I don't anyone will forget, where they were on June 16, when it was
announced that Amazon buys Whole Foods. It shocked the grocery industry and
shocked the retail industry. And I think the reason why they wanted to be able to
expand in urban markets. They wanted to be able to have access to more food
vendors. They wanted the supply chain and quicker delivery capabilities, and that is
what the stores allow you to do.
It's a network. So I think what this acquisition does, it shows that physical needs
digital and digital needs physical. And I think we're going to be on the precipice of
more acquisitions of big buying small and digital companies and physical
companies partnering together. And when you think about the technology that's a
part of it, I mean look at the in-store technology with wireless now. Magic Mirrors
where interactive mirrors allow consumers to see outﬁts. They share their looks via
our social media, take a look at logistics with RFID, that's been a topic of
conversation for years. And ﬁnally, now is becoming meaningful to optimize the
accuracy of inventory and help to manage margins.
And most important is big data, which allows consumer -- which allows companies to
understand their customers in order to better match products to demand, and as a
result helps drive sales and manage margins to rise higher. You were mentioning
experiences and they are important. Three diﬀerent categories of experiences on
page number -- slide 11, on experiential retailers, whether it's services like Drybar and
getting your hair washed and blown, whether it's Restoration Hardware, you can go
to pick out furniture. And also if you've been to the Restoration Hardware in Chicago,
you can also -- it's hard to get a reservation, go to one of the best restaurants in the
city.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Page 6 of 20Stephen Wyss

Stephen Wyss
Dana TelseyAnd when you speak about entertainment, whether it's an activity, whether it's an
experience, it is growing in terms of consumer wallet share. Take a look at
Punchbowl, so Punchbowl Social, Topgolf and what is going to movie theater now,
wine, dine and recline. You have to check out those, iPic movies theaters where it's a
ﬁrst-class experience of being able to eat great food, see a movie in a terriﬁc
environment where there is nearly 2 million members that become a part of iPic, and
it becomes part of a social experience. And so iPic which just went public the other
week, I think there is -- we're going to see more iPic movie theaters and it's attracting
more consumers given the experience that it oﬀers.
It's part of that entertainment experience, it's aspirational and it's social, all at the
same time and it is truly diﬀerentiated.
Think about ﬁtness, health and wellness matters and whether it's SoulCycle, whether
it's GoodLife Fitness or Pure Barre, now people are getting to know each other and
meeting each other basically through health and wellness. It's certainly increasing
traﬃc to other retailers, and that's why you're seeing it in diﬀerent locations too. So
experiential like Drybar, entertainment like iPic, ﬁtness like SoulCycle, that's where
we see consumers gravitating. And what this all means for the future of retail? I think
it means personalization, localization and customization. It's about ization.
One day we will have 3D printing with virtual dressing rooms. But right now, speed
matters to get instant gratiﬁcation. You have a global reach where the ﬂow of
information, spans the globe and if there is a cross broader knowledge of brands
and service and experience are married together. And married together in
experiences like the iPic theater, in services like Drybar, and I think brands matter
where, when and how matter, and we're at the beginning of a change in how
consumers are allocating their dollars.
That's some really great stuﬀ, Dana.
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}
Thank you.
A couple of questions. What I found really interesting, on the technology side, how
do you see the appetite for spending on all of this wonderful technology by retail
and consumer companies that are already facing challenging times of declining
revenues, in many instances, and tighter margins. Is there a willingness to make
signiﬁcant capital investment in these areas?
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 20Stephen Wyss
Dana Telsey
Stephen Wyss
Dana TelseyI think the allocation of CapEx dollars has shifted. It used to be that for many
companies CapEx allocated to technology was around 10% or under of their CapEx
budget. And what it is today? Today it can be around 40% of their CapEx budgets.
So I think technology is integral. I think store bases are being reﬁned to the most
productive units. And I think the willingness to learn how do use technology is
greater than ever before. So whether it's conversational commerce, mobile
applications, focused automation, we're only at the beginning of where technology
is taking us.
And how do you think this evolve model that we're looking out to 2020, that focuses
on experience and technology, how do we see it impacting prices for consumers
and eventually margins of the companies? Do you see -- is there an indication that
consumers are more willing to pay higher prices for these better experiences and
interaction with technology?
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}
I think we have seen part of that shift. I think we've seen that shift, when you think
about experiences, and what consumers are willing to pay for, they are paying for
personalization, they're paying for community engagement. We are not seeing the
same amount of spend as you mentioned earlier in apparel. What you are seeing
that spend being on is you're seeing it on areas that, for example, can be
aspirational, experiential, social and what's an aﬀordable luxury, that's what becomes
meaningful. That's why when I mentioned earlier, what the iPic theaters are doing, or
what we're seeing with SoulCycle, those are where we're seeing consumers allocate
time and allocate their dollars.
Excellent. And one last question I had for you Dana, from your perspective, what do
you think has the advantage? You've have noted a bunch of companies on the
technology slide, Kohl's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Walmart, large companies.
And then in the next slide, really a lot of these I think coming, smaller companies,
iPic's a great example. Who has the advantage in the evolving marketplace, and who
is going to perform better, if you had to place a bet? Is it the nimble, smaller,
innovative companies, or the larger companies that have much more capital to
spend and invest?
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}
Nimble companies always can move faster. What's going to happen is, I think you're
going to see a consolidating market in some instances, whilst Walmart bought
Jet.com, why did you see PVH go buy digital companies also. We are now seeing a
melting of the two. Smaller matters, they can teach the larger companies, but
certainly we're seeing those nimble companies be able to take share.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Michael HalenExcellent, thank you so much, Dana.
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}
Thank you.
With that I'd like to transition over to Michael and discuss the M&A market, and
speciﬁcally on the CPG side, what's been going on in a really interesting segment
which is packaged foods.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Thanks, Stephen, and thanks Dana. That was great. You are a tough act to follow.
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
You got it. So with the CPG arena, speciﬁcally packaged foods, which is one of the
areas that I cover here at Bloomberg, packaged food stocks have been hot. The
Supercomposite Packaged Food Index has been on ﬁre and it's really been boosted
by M&A over the last ﬁve years or so. 2017 was another strong year. There was 369
deals worth 42.5 billion. It's not quite the record setting year, we had back in 2015
with that Kraft-Heinz deal and a bunch of others, but 42.5 billion really is nothing to
sneeze at.
And Michael, I notice that's up over 50% from 2016, despite declining sales across
the industry. What are some of the factors that you think are driving that increase?
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah. Sales is a big one. So there's been a big shift, similar to retail, as Dana outlined,
there's been a huge shift in the eating habits in the last decade. So sales in most
center of the grocery store categories have been in decline. Customers don't want
processed foods any more or to the degree that they once did. They're seeking
cleaner labels, millennials especially want fresh organic produce and healthy
proteins. We're seeing them shop at the outer rim of the store and avoid the center
of the store completely.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Stephen Wyss
David DiFuscoSo a lot of these old growth companies the sales are declining. They're searching for
growth and they're really being forced to acquire brands to get into the healthier for
you category in a meaningful way. And a big part of that is that Gen X and millennials
kind of distrust of these big food companies, right. So M&A picked up, demand for
organic Campbell Soup in a can was weak. So they bought Paciﬁc, they are maker of
organic soup and bone broth in aseptic cartons. General Mills, so their, kind of their
store brands declined. So they acquired Annie's to help boost sales and organic
growth potential over coming years.
We've also seen a big shift towards snacking and convenience. A lot of these snack
brands have been hot. People want to eat on the go. So that's been a big trend for
M&A and also to push organic growth in the packaged food sector.
Yeah, the key is seemingly to be on healthy, fresh and new, is what consumers want.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah, without a doubt. And we think that those motivations are going to contribute
to a strong ﬁrst half for CPG M&A. So tax cuts and low borrowing costs, they're going
to continue to motivate buyers and sellers following a strong year of deals, as
mentioned. So rising interest rates interestingly enough may force acquirers to
speed up their timeline. So some companies maybe feel the pressure to act now
before the cost of capital moves even higher as the year moves on. And also falling
equity values may motivate potential sellers as we've seen volatility come back to the
market over the last couple weeks. This could cause -- could motivate some sellers
that maybe want to cash in before valuations move even further to the downside.
Michael, you mentioned tax cuts. And I think it's a good time perhaps for our tax
expert, David to chime in. David how do you see this new tax legislation impacting
M&A decisions from debt versus equity structuring, overall lower tax rates, big
picture wise what you think it's going to do to the M&A market?
Well I loved Michael's teasing the audience with tax, because we know that's what
they're waiting to hear about. But if I had to sum up everything I'm going to talk
about later in one word, it's going to be modeling. So when I was speaking in 2017,
the word I was saying was confusion and opaque because we really didn't know how
to value all these tax attributes that are such an important component of any M&A
deal. And now we have all this information and we're seeing this ﬂood of deals, due
diligence structuring, or what's keeping me up at night is along with burning this
new tax codes. But there's certainly going to be an increased tension between
buyers and sellers, because of these new depreciation rules.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Michael Halen
Stephen WyssSo you are going to be able to recover a lot of the tax cost of your assets very
quickly, and there's always been that struggle between selling stock versus buying
assets, it's just going to get enhanced.
But the modeling part of it is going -- there is lot of limitations in this new tax code.
So we're seeing interest deductions being limited, we're loss reductions being
limited. The international side is I think favorable and fair, and they got rid of some
annoying parts of M&A. They're small, but important. For example, they repealed the
technical terminations of partnerships. So when you're acquiring a partnership, you
have to go through this tremendous compliance burden, everyone had to do.
Like reduced M&A.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
I'm excited. And so here is Amazon again. In addition to taking advantage of lower
rates in 2017 later in the year, I think some of the M&A was motivated by the Amazon
Whole Foods merger. So in addition to all of the beneﬁts Dana outlined, there was
also another one. We kind of viewed it as an attack on packaged food manufacturer
margins. This gives them more scale and more negotiating power. So it kind of
almost makes them not quite to that level, but the Walmart of online, right where
Walmart can really pressure their suppliers in terms of price points.
So what we've seen now is some of the food manufacturers feeling this pressure to
gain scale, so they can protect their margins against Amazon and Walmart. We saw a
couple of very historically conservative companies, McCormick and Campbell Soup
paid very steep multiples and really stretched their leverage ratios to purchase RB
Foods and Snyder's-Lance respectively. So Campbell's bought Snyder's at almost 20
times EBITDA just months after acquiring Paciﬁc Foods. Their leverage ratio's almost
at 5 times right now. And McCormick, they paid 7 times sales and 19.6 times adjusted
EBITDA for RB. And listen, it's a great asset. They really wanted to get into hot sauce
which is a very high margin business. RB was run very lean, it's got very impressive
EBIT margins. It ﬁts the portfolio. It allows them to get into hot sauce in a more
meaningful way immediately versus try to grow that Zatarain's brand over the course
of the years.
But this company has typically been under a turn of leverage and their leverage
jumped to 4 times EBITDA after this deal. So we think this Amazon threat is really
going to continue to motivate bigger transactions in the near future.
I think it's interesting in looking at the Amazon threat, in package foods, and when
you look at it from the strategic perspective, it seems -- it's greatly impacting the
value of brands, and saving them for strategics. How is Amazon interact or I guess
play in the space of private label? Where you're seeing the private label?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)

Michael Halen
David DiFusco{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah, so we think that motivated the deal as well, right. Whole Foods has some great
private label brands and Amazon controls their "shelf space" right. When you search
something they can put their private labels up on top, and like every other retailer
they love private label, because the margins are much higher, and it also causes --
gives them a reason, gives people an attachment to a certain store, right. As
customers like Up & Up brand, toilet paper or paper towels, they're going to go to
Target because that's the only place that they can get them. And kind of the same
thing with Amazon. This is a quick and easy way to get into private label with brands
that a lot of people know and really love. So yeah, I think that was also a big piece of
that, Amazon and Whole Foods, yeah.
You see the eﬀect in supermarket and retail, and the emphasis that seems to be --
being placed on developing better product label options and really investing in
private label certainly from the supermarket perspective, but even across the board
and looking at fashion apparel, looking at retailers that want to have their own
brands exclusivity. So I think the ripple eﬀect from Amazon throughout is pretty
interesting.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah, it's deﬁnitely caused some waves in packaged food here in the last six months.
But -- as they've been doing in retail for years now. So just quickly some of the
companies that we watch and cover that are interested in and potentially could do a
pretty good-sized deal in the ﬁrst half year are Kraft Heinz, Conagra, Hormel &
Pinnacle are all names that we view as on the hunt. So Kraft Heinz, according to our
colleague, Ken Shea is looking for a transformational deal. And they have deep
pockets of Berkshire and 3G that help make it happen. Conagra, a name we have
has been busy, and they're going to continue to be. They purchased a lot of
snacking and healthier for you brands as they completely transform their portfolio to
more hot on the trend -- on-trend brand. And they still have $1 billion tax asset
burning a hole in their pocket. So we expect them to continue to be aggressive.
They're also seeking larger synergistic deals if they can ﬁnd one. Once again, it
could help them against the Walmarts and the Amazons of the world. Hormel is
under-leveraged and they brag about a nice pipeline of global multicultural and
healthy protein based brands. So companies that can maybe help them boost scale
in their core businesses. And ﬁnally Pinnacle Foods, who's done a great job of
transforming under-managed iconic brands has more than 2 billion of capacity to
make a deal in the Health and Wellness category.
Michael I loved that you're talking about tax again. And when you're talking about
deferred tax asset, that's why we saw such an interesting earnings season, becauseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 12 of 20Stephen Wyss

Stephen Wyss
Michael Halencompanies with deferred tax assets were taking these massive hits because the
corporate rate's going down, that assets worth a lot less to them. On the exact
opposite side, companies that had massive -- not losses, which generally allows the
deferred tax assets, but instead had a lot of depreciation in their physical plan had a
deferred tax liability. Well, that's not going to be as expensive to them. And some of
those companies took those earning beneﬁts and translated them into bonuses for
their employees. Whether that's sustainable we will see. Nobody really knows. I think
if you are really cynical it's just a one-time political play but the bottom line is
corporate tax rate has gone down and companies are going to do something with
that diﬀerential. Whether they put it into other M&A, or whether they give it to their
employees or whether they return it to their shareholders, obviously nobody knows.
Point, David.
{BIO 18797919 <GO>}
Yeah, that would be part of -- it's kind of been a PR spin with a lot of companies
talking about how they're -- what good they're going to do with the cash. But we
think a lot of them are going to continue to return cash to shareholders. With that,
the second half kind of remains a question mark in our view. So rising interest rates
could become prohibitive. We've seen a lot of these deals be accretive in year one
or early in year two. As interest rates rise, that may not be the case. You can see on
the chart to the right here, median US packaged food net debt to adjusted EBITDA
has now surpassed the peak of '08-'09. So some balance sheets are stretched. And
there are fewer strategic buyers out there looking for a big transformational deal.
McCormick and Campbell Soup, who we already mentioned are going to be limited
to smaller bolt-on deals to their recent M&A activity.
J. M. Schmucker as I said that they will limit themselves to smaller deals as their pet
food business continues to struggle. If you remember they acquired big hot pet
brands a few years back, in dry food, dry dog and cat food, has really struggled
mightily over the two years since. Ken Shea expects General Mills, Tyson and
Hershey and Kellogg to seek smaller deals due to their historical conservatism
and/or the need to integrate recent purchases.
So when you mention pet and Smuckers struggle on the dry food the other side of
that has been signiﬁcant growth in alternatives and new, fresh, organic, pet and there
seems to be a lot of popularity there, how do you guys see that as a category going
forward? And do you expect it to continue to grow and attract more interest from
more diﬃcult consumer product companies in terms of potential M&A? What are
your thoughts?

David DiFuscoYeah, we're going to see more premiumization. So you have seen Smucker kind of
improve that segment results over the last quarter to by debuting Natural Balance, a
premium pet food, because people like to consider their pets their children, right?
So they don't want to serve their kid's artiﬁcial ﬂavors or packaged foods. People
view the same way as for their pets, right? So we continue to see premiumization as
the best route for a lot of these companies, but also remember we're -- what are we,
nine years into a recovery and the economy is doing well. Consumers are feeling
kind of bullish. So maybe they have more money to buy premium pet food, right? So
if the economy turns, maybe that -- it could really kind of shift back towards a little bit
of dry pet and dog foods.
(inaudible) I think it's almost in a psychological way, treating your pets better is an
experience that makes you feel better. So from the experience side, you see
willingness to spend premiums to make yourself feel better, which I think is pretty
interesting trend. And so thank you on that, Michael. Speaking of interesting trends I
have seen many times the word tax comes up. David gets very excited and we'd like
to turn the discussion over to David to talk about the impact and the tax legislation,
as we all know, changes have some complex and confusing components, but
perhaps David, you could start with a brief overview of the key changes.
Great, thank you, Steve. So if I was going to summarize the Tax Cut and Jobs Act,
we're looking at lower statutory rates and we're also looking at lower eﬀective rates
or cash tax outlay. Now whether that's all going to go into premium pet food, I'm not
sure, Michael but we can only hope. So one of the -- I mentioned some of the
positives with regard to the rates. But we're seeing a pass through taxation, a new
deduction there. I mentioned depreciation, international, then negatives, I
mentioned a few of them, but the one you got the Tri-state region up in arms was
limitation of the state income tax deductions, and that's being limited to $10,000. It
really is going to change the way the individuals calculate their itemized deductions,
and whether people do or not going to -- remain to be seen and what the impact of
that is on real estate, on charitable deductions, all that, it's going to be really, really
interesting. I mean, I think people are going to be talking about taxes for the next 12
to 15 months, and nothing gets me more excited than people talking about taxes.
I think to your point, David, when looking at the potential impact of that alone, in
what are considered to be blue states, I mean those on the East Coast or West Coast,
perhaps we could see consumer spending habits in those particular geographic
areas change as a result of this. So this could have -- and it's too far to look out for
the crystal ball, but that discretionary spending in certain areas of the country may
shift, and companies may need to pay attention to that and look after that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Page 14 of 20Stephen WyssI agree. The tax rate changes for the corporation, look at that 21%. Now I used to tell
my students all the time, it was really painful to have one of the highest corporate tax
rates in the world. Now I don't have to complain about that anymore. The individual
rates have gone down tremendously as well. We -- looks like we are missing the
table, but I can ﬁll in the highlights on it. We have the old 25% rate coming down to
20%. The old 28% rate coming down to 24%. Those are real, real changes. And at the
top we have the 39.6% rate. Not only is the rate coming down to 37, but it's a much
higher bracket. So you really get into that at over $500,000 for a single and
$600,000 for married family jointly.
The pass-through deduction, I really think is huge for the consumer industry.
Because initially, it's predecessor, which was Section 199 was a manufacturing
deduction. But this is so much broader than that. And you don't really necessarily
need to manufacture anymore, which we know a lot of our clients in the space don't.
So what we're seeing is, this is a corollary in my mind to the cut in the corporate tax
rate. Now we are trying to get to a -- we're allowing this pass-through deduction and
in essence, you could eliminate 20% of your income if this is where your income is
coming, from a pass-through business. 80% of that 37% gets you all the way down to
29.6. Not exactly the 21%, but a nice giveaway. And in essence what we're saying is
non-corporate owners of pass-through businesses are going to be allowed a 20%
deduction of their qualiﬁed business income, with respect to that trader business in
the United States.
So 199 and all its predecessors were always very favorable towards US activity,
nothing's changed here, but the big diﬀerence is that income really doesn't include
the investment income or what they are calling speciﬁed service trader businesses.
So a lot of businesses that are reputationally run and unfortunately, Steve that U and
I's accounts. We're not in there. Architects, engineers are, not exactly sure why they --
what led to that diﬀerence. Maybe we don't lobby well enough, right. But -- and the
deduction is being driven in essence limited by W2 wages, or a combination of W2
wages and qualiﬁed property, but with consumer companies having very large
payrolls, this could be something really exciting.
Now there is a planning opportunity there. To the extent, there are services
embedded in some of what the companies are doing and obviously, we don't have
all the explanations through the regulations of how this is going to work, we're
seeing some clients talk about separating their service and non-services businesses.
So they can take advantage of a deduction like this.
And I think it's a really interesting point, as Dana was talking about earlier in the
evolution of retail and consumer interaction and the greater importance placed on
services. So services along with a typical retail component. Certainly, to your point,
David, those companies that are -- whether it's SoulCycle or others in the space that
have both a service component as well as a sales and retail sales component, should
pay attention about how the structure stays going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

David DiFuscoRight. Well you remember me saying modeling. So here is something you have to
model. This is from pass-through businesses, which does not include corporations.
So do you want to take advantage of this through a pass-through, or do you want to
take advantage of a lower corporate tax rate to a corporation, a lot of decisions to be
made.
This is also tremendous for companies in the space that are going to have a lot of
PP&E, that they're going to put into play in 2018. So we have a bonus depreciation
and we also have this 179 deduction and they are starting to look a lot like each other
because in essence, you're getting a 100% deduction, the bonus depreciation, the
rate on that is changed over the years. We went from a 50% reaching now to 100%.
The 179 is in essence for smaller businesses, ones that are putting in place, investing
$3.5 million of spend. So a lot of ordering has to go into that. You want to take your
179 ﬁrst, and then worry about your bonus depreciation, we're certainly advising
clients in that area.
And I think this ties into what Dana was discussing earlier. We were talking about the
decision to invest in technology, decision to invest in new brick-and-mortar or
renovations to brick-and-mortar. David, do you see this as potential to spur
additional investment, given these new depreciation tax laws?
Well, Michael, would it not be amazing if we went back to brick-and-mortar after all
this, after everything Dana was telling us about online. And it could well be. I mean,
you have to be careful about it, the building itself is not going to qualify under this.
But and a building, if you've done right through cost aggregation is just a shell. And
then think of all the improvements that have to be put inside of it to really make it
work, especially for the savvy consumer of today and all that probably is going to be
deductible.
One of the issues become state tax, remember I'm talking about best state taxes
today, but this 179 deduction that we've talked about, not recovered by most of the
states where the bonus depreciation is. So even if you are getting your federal taxes
down, you still might have a state tax bill for all that. Again it's just going to have to
be some more modeling. There -- especially in states like New York, California with
fairly high corporate tax rates.
International has been -- seen -- probably, I think the greatest amount of changes.
And the big-ticket item was this mandatory income inclusion. It's ﬁnally happened.
We've talked for years and years and years, about how to get those billions and
billions of dollars of earnings that were oﬀshore back to the United States. We found
a way to do it. So really interesting tax rate, is -- if it's in the form of -- if the assetsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 16 of 20Stephen Wyss
David DiFuscofrom that deferred income were held in the form of cash or accounts receivable, the
rate is 15.5%. For other types of assets, it's down to 8%. This is a massive tax bill.
So fortunately they didn't make everyone have to pay it upfront. So coming real
soon, when you are ﬁling your ﬁrst return or extension for it, you have to make your
ﬁrst payment but you get to spread it out over eight years. I think that was very nice. I
have never seen anything like a eight year tax bill. But companies are really
scrambling now to ﬁgure out how much this is. These are numbers that they really
haven't had to crunch in the past and there are a lot of things that have to be
thought about.
There is two other provisions in, and I could spend the next six hours talking about
taxes, but I won't. But there's these concepts called GUILTY and BEAT, two acronyms
in the international tax paid.
I met with some government oﬃcers. They absolutely love these acronyms. So I'm
happy somebody is having fun with the tax code. But it is really was to attack all
those perceived and potentially real way that people are getting around paying the
US taxes. So we have talked so much over the last couple of years, your headline --
Bloomberg headlines were about companies that had all this IPO oﬀshore and then
were getting -- generating tremendous earnings from it in what were considered tax
havens.
So that's not really going to work anymore. It is -- it has to be taxed in the United
States now. There's always been this anti-deferral provision called subpart F. This is a
new part of it. That income is going to be taxable in the United States, but at a much
lower rate. So yeah, it really is a win for everyone. Finally, the money is going to
come back and companies are going to go good. It's at a lower rate. I used to put on
those books, Michael, that you got to see these massive deferred tax liabilities for
things that were going to come back or companies were saying no, no, we are never
going to take it back, we're permanently reinvested. Well, now they don't have to be
permanently invested. They can bring the money back and invest it in the United
States.
Do you see, David, from a big picture perspective, past the initial -- I guess shock
and implementation, how is it going to change the way consumer companies and
retail companies view international expansion? Do you think it will spur more
investment overseas or will it perhaps change it in the other direction?
If you can get your international rate down to 10.5%, why wouldn't you do that. So it
really is export friendly. So if we can -- if companies can do that, there is a big
compliance burden to it. There is a lot of calculations have to go in to place, but
that's what tax departments do. I think it will deﬁnitely spur some of that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

David DiFuscoI mentioned a couple of the limitations and I'll go through them fairly quickly. But
what we're seeing now is a limitation of those NOLs, and it's interesting, they got rid
of the corporate M&A, excuse me AMT, which was a mechanism for that in the past.
We don't have the corporate AMT anymore, but we have the same sort of limitation,
albeit it's even larger, because now you can only oﬀset 80% of your income where
before it was 90%, and I think this is another one of those things that maybe take
some of those headlines out of news, because a lot of companies now have to pay
taxes, because you are not allowed to oﬀset all your income with the losses, either
ones generated in the current year or carryovers. So -- and then for the individuals
there is a limitation and you can only use losses up to 500,000, married and ﬁling
joint in the year, 250,000 for single. If you limit it to that you are just creating a carry-
forward. What's interesting there carry-forwards used to be limited to 20-year
period, now they're indeﬁnite.
The UK had a similar system. I think, it's fair because, why -- if a company actually
generates a loss, why shouldn't it be able to use that loss regardless of what it is.
When we talk about M&A activity, but some of the guidance I'm looking out for there
was a provision in the code that limited the utilization of the losses, when you
acquired a company. Well the reason that was important is because eventually those
NOLs ran out under the carry-forward limitation provisions. Do they now, yes, they
soon will ﬁnd out. But that could make some of that M&A valuation a lot more
valuable.
Another limitation here is the business interest expense. So now I'm going to
contradict myself, Steve. I mean we know so many of these deals we did were
leveraged, and here's a limitation to that. That number it's interesting because it's
going to change. It's 30% of adjusted taxable income and that's now a new word in
our lexicon. And the deﬁnition of that word changes. So through 2021 it's earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, i.e., your EBITDA. So it's a fairly
robust number and then after that, it's earnings before just interest and taxes. So
much smaller number. So that 30% of a smaller number. Yeah, you are going to have
a limitation on interest expenses.
Now again the carry-forward becomes indeﬁnite. So we're not looking at limitations
on that. But so much of the deals we're looking at Steve, the modeling is net present
value. So when you're pushing some of these deductions way out in time obviously
their value goes very down.
You think it's going to have any impact on M&A world in terms of amount of debt,
amount of equity, how -- I guess how the potential investors or buyer look at the
balance sheet?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

David DiFuscoCertainly, it's just going to have to be layered into everything. We saw on the private
equity side, they've made a change to the carried interest rules. It wasn't nearly as
draconian as is everybody was worried about, and maybe it was because of this
interest deduction limitation. So it could be stiﬂing. It would be interesting to see a
world where debt isn't the primary driver in these deals, but with lower tax rates
companies should have more dry powder in the form of after tax earnings.
Good stuﬀ.
Then just wrapping up on a couple other items. So the 199 A, we saw is now
replacing that 199, which was domestic production. There's going to be new audit
assessment rules, which could be leveled at the partnership level for the ﬁrst time
ever. This is going to make sure the IRS doesn't have to go after the individual
partners. They can go after the partnership itself. R&D expenses are often important
to this industry, new bottling, new packaging, all of that can fall into R&D if you look
at it correctly and do the proper analysis, but there might be some capitalization that
has to go on in 2022. And that's it for taxes.
Yeah, I think the key takeaway there is modeling, I think in terms of needing to look
at your operating business and how tax is impacted diﬀerently in the future as well as
investments that you are making and potential acquisitions, the models have
changed, then you got to change the way you look at things.
Well we do have a Q&A question coming in, feel free everyone to join in and just
click in your question. So this question here , not surprisingly it's tax question.
That's all everyone wants to talk about.
Because it's pretty enlightening. So the question is on the personal tax eﬀect on
consumers, what do you see the material impact of the child tax spread increase
have on consumer spending, will tax saving show up in withholding savings or be tax
refunds at the end of the year?
Well, it is tax geek. I am not allowed to say anything about consumer spending
because I really don't know. But hopefully, right, I really believe there will be more
money in more people's pockets after this is all done with the exception of that Tri-FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

So it really depends on where you live. We're going to see low withholding rates. So
people should see almost immediately their after tax paychecks going up. With
regard to the child tax credit. Yeah, I have no reason to think that won't -- the
mechanism for that won't be the same in the form of a tax refund. But you can start
ﬁling your tax return now. So for individuals and you do it early in the year, you get
that tax refund upfront.
All right great. And we have time for one more, so I am going to be greedy and take
it. And it's for Dana. So I also cover restaurants and so millennials have really helped
that casual chains grow over the last few years. And part of that was that they were
seeking the experience over things as you mentioned Dana. But now with millennials
maybe coming of age and starting to move out of their parent's basements and
buying houses and starting families, how do you see that impacting near term
consumer spending?
{BIO 1491802 <GO>}
I think if anything, as millennials age and as they grow up, and basically have more
spending needs, it's whether spending needs from having families like you
mentioned, whether it's spending needs because of -- whether it's work
environment, but also travel. I mean what we're seeing with these experiences and
building the community, the lifeline that's out is diﬀerent than what it was in the past.
So it is services that do make the diﬀerence. So I think if anything, the fact that these
millennials have the dollars that they see work and the ability to be an expert is
diﬀerent than their parents do, as they are trying more things, I think that spending
power is there, and also as brands and companies essentially are focusing more on
the wants of these consumers and have more knowledge of what to create for them
there is a lot of optimism surrounding consumer spending. It's the brands that need
to innovate in order to capture their attention.
And that's why, as you mentioned the experiential element and a lot of it's
surrounding food. Food is the new luxury, health and wellness is the new luxury,
there is a lot of changes in spending patterns that are out there. So it's what we had
chatted about, whether it's the entertainment items, the ﬁtness items, they are new
priorities today.
