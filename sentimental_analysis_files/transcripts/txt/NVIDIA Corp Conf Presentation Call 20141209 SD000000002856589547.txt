{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Good morning, everybody. Welcome. My name is Ambrish for those who don't know
me. I cover semis for BMO. And we have Colette from NVIDIA, the CFO.
Colette, thanks for joining us.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
So the format is we're going to run -- I'm going to ask a bunch of questions and then
we will pause and we'll open it up to the audience.
So before I go into my prepared questions, Colette, you've been with NVIDIA for a
little over a year. So maybe we can start oﬀ by -- just give us a sense for -- NVIDIA is --
has been in a transformational phase for quite some time. Things seem to be
accelerating towards that direction so maybe you could share your perspective on
the underlying changes that the Company has been going through.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. I think when you look back at NVIDIA over the last three, four years, a lot of it
looked at -- was a chip company attached to the overall PCs. We saw this as a real
opportunity to really expand our oﬀerings and our oﬀerings in very key platforms
that we thought would be growth drivers for the overall future. One of those being
the overall PC platform and the overall gaming platform and really taking a hold of
we're not a general purpose chip for all PCs. We really think about the overallFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 10Ambrish Srivastavaecosystem of PC gaming where we believe we have a very, very strong hold, a very
strong presence around the world in terms of that PC gaming market and it's done
very well for us.
And what that entailed is us being very close to that end customer, the end gamers
around the world and how their experience has continued to be enhanced by the
overall GPU experience. In their mind that is their underlying console for their
gaming, that GPU that is incorporated within the PC.
Our second key transformation was really focusing also on taking what we had
learned from the overall PC and the design to move to the data center and the
cloud. Knowing that key important aspect of the cloud availability and providing an
accelerated GPU for the data center, as well as a virtualized GPU for the data center,
which we refer to as GRID.
Both of those movements have done very well for us as we've seen the continued
growth in terms of GRID; GRID for the enterprise as well as GRID from consumer and
consumer streaming gaming. And Tesla, the accelerated GPU in the data center,
both associated with high-performance computing, parallel applications. But also
very, very new industry in terms of machine learning, computer vision and the
expansion of how the GPU has been able to help in those areas as well.
Our third key platform is our focus in terms of the mobility. Pretty much the
connected device and really taking that presence of gaming as well that you see for
a PC and understanding that the experience will continue to grow to a lot of the
diﬀerent mobile platforms. You've seen many tablets coming out, cell phones and
other diﬀerent types of devices really geared towards a great user ability to gaming.
And also that visual computing which is so important.
Our last key presence and probably one of the most mobile types of platform being
automobiles. We have a great stronghold on many diﬀerent types of OEM
manufacturers in the automobile business. We have more than 6 million cars on the
road incorporating NVIDIA GPUs.
So it's been a great ride to really kind of watch this initial stages of the
transformation. As we've -- so far this ﬁscal year, we're in our -- just ﬁnished our Third
Quarter of our ﬁscal year 2015. Our top-line revenue growth of being over 15%. But
the key thing is also a focus in terms of proﬁtability. Our proﬁt growth, whether you
measure that by operating income, net income or diluted EPS is probably around
50% this year in terms of growth of our proﬁtability.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Good. Good introduction. Let me just switch to something I'm sure that's closer to
your heart, capital allocation. And also, if you don't mind starting oﬀ on sharing your
perspective as a CFO. NVIDIA has done a pretty decent job in returning capital to
shareholders and it started before you got there. But just help us understand howFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 10Colette Kress
Ambrish Srivastava
Colette Kressyou look at that and kind of some of the changes that you are trying to instill within
the organization.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. The Company restarted its overall capital return program probably about two
years ago and initiated overall dividend for the very ﬁrst time. And also started in
ﬁscal year 2014 with $1 billion of total capital return, as well as in ﬁscal year 2015
we're just rounding out the end of also returning yet another $1 billion.
About a year ago we executed convertible debt for the main purpose of capital
return. As we have talked about, a signiﬁcant amount of our free cash ﬂow is located
from international operations. So we did have a signiﬁcant amount of cash overseas
and we are ﬁnding the most prudent way to get that back into the US so that we
could return it to shareholders. We executed about $1.5 billion of debt and we
returned about $1 billion of that in ﬁscal year 2015. And we just announced now our
capital return program for ﬁscal year 2016. In ﬁscal year 2016 we'll return about $600
million. So the remaining amount of that overall debt that we acquired at that time to
return to shareholders.
So over the ﬁve-year period on average we're returning nearly the majority, almost
all, of our free cash ﬂow. When you think about how much of that is our US cash ﬂow
or US cash ﬂow presence, it's more than deﬁnitely 100%.
We look at capital return as just one of the pillars of the overall shareholder value;
really a concentration on the proﬁtability, the overall growth on the top line, which is
extremely important. But also balancing that with the dividend and the share
repurchases. So it's all together in a bundle.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Okay. And one of the questions we get from investors. And I'm sure you get it as
well. And we could transition into the whole patent litigation and the licensing issues.
So maybe share with us a broader framework of how you think about that because
there's many facets to it. There's the Intel cross-licensing agreement. Then there are
URLs out there trying to get customers to, A, pay for what they have been using, what
you claim is NVIDIA's IP. And then you're also trying to sign up customers for
licensing. So how should we think about that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So it's a good introduction that it is a holistic look at our overall IP strategy. So
about a year and a half, the Company came forth and indicated our business
strategy is to have an IP business.
Now, what is good or bad about an IP business is sometimes it takes an oﬀensive or
a litigation move to actually move forward on that. We've had the overall Intel license
that we signed in 2011 and that will come to an end in our First Quarter of ﬁscal yearFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 10Ambrish Srivastava
Colette Kress
Ambrish Srivastava2018. It will be the last quarter in which we will recognize revenue. And we can think
about where we want to go in terms of renewal on that or nonrenewal on that. It's
still up in the air. We don't have anything that we are prepared at this time to
announce.
But secondly, we had moved toward taking litigation actions against Samsung and
Qualcomm regarding their overall mobile platforms. We have more than 7,000
patents in the GPU space that are being leveraged both across many diﬀerent
platforms from the PC, the data center and the mobile.
We are moving towards a date with the ITC for them to make a decision, which is
about mid-June, mid to end of June, associated with that case. So an investigation
was started with the ITC. And we used the ITD because it is a very eﬃcient body in
order for us to reach some type of third-party agreement regarding infringement. As
possibly expected, Samsung has come back with litigation back to us and we
continue to review those pieces as well.
But we know that it is soon that we will get a form of a ruling associated from the ITC
and then we'll determine the next steps after that. But it's an important aspect after
many years of kind of discussions that weren't necessarily moving forward. And this
is where a third party may be necessarily to help us determine that true infringement
between the companies.
But on this side we also talk about that we have many diﬀerent other discussions
occurring with companies both reaching out to us, us reaching out to them in terms
of opportunities for IP licensing. Licensing forms of our core, core for Tegra or even
core in terms of GPU where they may want to take that and build their own types of
devices or own work, knowing that this is one of the top GPU platforms in the
industry.
So more to come in terms of that because there's a lot of diﬀerent moving parts right
now going on our IP strategy. And we're pleased in terms of the momentum that we
have moving at this time.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Okay. Just a clariﬁcation. The ITC ruling in June would be to determine whether
there was infringement or not.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Right. That is just the hearing and then we'll hear shortly after that whether or not --
how the courts have ruled in terms of that. But that's correct, it is only about
infringement. Valuation will come at a later time.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 10Colette KressOkay. Great. Thank you. Thanks for that.
And so maybe we can now move into the business and we can start with the GPU
and maybe focus on the PC related. Your market share gains accelerated and with
Maxwell came more share gains. So if we look at the roadmap and share gains within
PCs, not just in the way we used to think of PCs or the OEMs, what's the right way to
think about share gains? What's coming down the pipe?
And if you don't mind, also, one of the things that you started highlighting last year
was how big gaming has become as a piece of the business. I think a year ago it was
39% was PC OEMs and now that's down to 25%. So in the context of the PC side,
help us understand what's going on in the underlying business with how important
gaming has become.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So let me kind of break this down on our overall GPU business. Our GPU
business can be broken down into our GeForce business, which is our desktops and
notebooks for overall PC use, whether that be a mobile PC or just a regular PC. Then
our overall Tesla business, our GRID business and also our Quadro business.
What are we referring to in terms of our overall GeForce business? We break that
business down both by desktop and notebook. But we also tend to look at it by what
part of it is gaming and what part of it is actually non-gaming. We look at the overall
gaming market primarily associated with key ASP levels, that we do know their main
reason in terms of why they are purchasing that is for that overall gaming
experience.
Of our GeForce business now, gaming represents more than 75% of our business. So
not necessarily tied to the overall PC market. And it has extremely strong growth
rates. Just in this last quarter with the launch of the overall Maxwell architecture, our
overall gaming business grew more than 30% year over year versus what we had
seen.
Our Maxwell architecture is our 10th generation, which we started with some mid-
level GPUs a couple months ago and in September we launched the new Maxwell
architecture at the high end. Those have been tremendous feedback in terms of the
market and acceptance in terms of those. Tremendous reviews all around. And we
had about a half a quarter of overall Maxwell architecture in our Q3. So we're
looking at right now Q4, of a full quarter of Maxwell. And seeing those results. It's a
prime time in terms of all the season of new games that hit the market for the PCs, as
well as our new architecture.
You also spoke about our share gains and what we have seen in terms of the overall
discrete share on GPUs. We just received from Mercury about a month ago that our
share is now probably up over 70% of the overall discreet market. So maybe over the
last two quarters that has grown more than 5, 6 points, mainly due to the launch of
Maxwell. But we'll continue to see how this does in terms of going forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 10Ambrish Srivastava
Colette KressSo we're really pleased in terms of both the acceptance of Maxwell, the adoption of
the discreet GPUs, again for the overall gaming market and how important that is.
And as we go forward we'll continue to see gaming to be a very strong driver of our
overall platform.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Okay. So let me just go through the other two big pieces of the business and then
we'll open it up to questions. On the -- within the GPU, the Tesla and GRID. And I was
sharing with Colette GRID gaming was launched recently. And my 11-year-old son, I
had given him the Shield that we got at the analyst day and I told him, hey, look, you
can go to GRID online and you can download these games. And he said, dad, really?
I already know it. I'm been using it.
So in that context, maybe we can talk about GRID and how the -- initially the vision --
and I think the vision is the same, for users to use online gaming served by GPUs on
the server side. So help us understand where is GRID and what are you seeing in the
adoption.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Right. So really simply, our overall GRID platform is about a virtualized GPU. Where
normally your GPU that sits on your PC is a one-to-one relationship from the PC to
the user, what we created is a virtualized GPU that sits in an overall server
environment. So now we can have one GPU to many. And depending on the
diﬀerent workloads that are using that overall GPU, it depends on how many users
we can do.
So there's two main areas in terms of focus for that virtualized GPU. One in the
enterprise, which we talk about the overall VDI environment and that virtualized
desktop for high-end -- either users really needing a very well-streamed application
in the cloud with the key visualization that is necessary. So we're seeing a big uptake
in terms of people, in terms of trials and deployments on people getting a much
better user experience using that VDI environment with the virtualized GRID in the
background.
The new one that we just announced about a month ago was our overall streaming
gaming oﬀering that we oﬀer with our overall Shield Tablet. Our Shield Tablet is the
NVIDIA-branded tablet that incorporates our overall Tegra processors; really a tablet
geared for gamers. And the key thing that you get with that is the ability to stream
your games from your overall PC that you've purchased to a mobile environment.
What you ﬁnd with gamers or any enthusiast in terms of the sports or whatever they
may do, they want gaming everywhere. They want gaming on that PC. That want it
(inaudible) to that mobile environment. And we've really been able to serve that as
we've had a good understanding of the ecosystem and how they play the games,
which games are important to us. And so we're using the virtualized GPU
experience, our overall Shield, as well as what they have in terms of their PC and theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 10Ambrish Srivastava
Colette KressGPUs as well. So it's a very intriguing business and we're in the early stages. But
great reviews, great feedback from the customers in terms of that experience.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Okay. Then Tesla. You guys have built a pretty decent-sized business now, GPGPU.
Competition is there, obviously. Intel is competing and recently the PLD guys also
talk about competing in that space. So a couple of questions there. A, what are you
seeing and what are the drivers for that business, the diﬀerent segments? If you
could just highlight where you're seeing the most traction. And the second question,
some thinking on competitive dynamics on how does NVIDIA diﬀerentiate.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Correct. So Tesla is our accelerated GPU for the data center. We've grown quite
tremendously over the last several years in this business, primarily regarding the
HPC parallel computing that we talked about at the very beginning.
We recently announced, just last month, an expansion in the world of
supercomputers where the Department of Energy has announced using Tesla for the
two largest supercomputers that will probably be available for the next couple years.
Important to us in terms of that is always a multiple-bidding type of opportunity. But
really helping understand the importance of NVIDIA's technology in really
accelerating that aspect.
The other key part was the use of NVLink, which is our new bus between the overall
CPU and the GPU. And a much faster speed than what has been there. We
announced this with IBM Power Servers. So this is, again, a true test of very important
architectures with the IBM Power Servers, our NVLink and the overall NVIDIA GPU. So
that's one key area where, again, we see that continued expansion in many diﬀerent
growth opportunities.
However, the other key aspect that we talked about at the very beginning is really
what we're seeing in terms of machine learning or data analytics, I would say. A lot of
interest in terms of tagging identiﬁcation of data that's coming over the network,
whether that be an image, whether that be voice recognition or through videos. The
use of an overall GPU, accelerated GPU, is really outstanding in terms of the accuracy
that you can see. Not necessarily a discussion right now in terms of how much will
that cost and you see a lot of the overall competitive play really talk about a cheaper
type of option.
When you're really looking here, it's about providing a platform that gives them what
they need because the amount of time savings that there is, in terms of the accuracy
of that is so important. So we're seeing a lot of the internet service providers in key
areas of research, higher education, really focusing on machine learning and I think
we're just in the initial stages of how big that overall opportunity can be. But the last
two quarters that we've announced, both in Q3 and in Q2, we've announced record
quarters again for Tesla, really associated with these large projects that we're seeing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-09

Okay. In the interest of time. And I know you touched on the Tegra autos earlier on, I
just want to see if there are any questions from the audience.
Questions And Answers
Yes. China recently--.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Would you mind waiting for the mic?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. Thank you.
Yes. China recently allowed gaming consoles. How big of an issue can that be?
Because the test rate's really high in China, right--.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes.
For the PC gaming.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
We do have a very strong presence in China in the overall PC market. It is part of
their social system in terms of PC gaming. The consoles have been legalized in
China. What is unique with most government regulation, although there may have
not been legal aspects, there were still a signiﬁcant amount of consoles already in
the country that were brought in by other diﬀerent means. So we haven't really seen
any material eﬀect on our business at all from that overall legalization of those. As
the overall PC platform is very, very well established, the experience on a PC versus a
console, if you are a PC gamer you'd notice a signiﬁcant diﬀerence of going down to
a console in terms of that experience. So we're not necessarily seeing that.
So right now, yes, it may be overall legalized, which I just mean more gaming is
occurring. But the PC gaming market is still extremely strong. And we continue to
see the industry move up to a better and better or higher-priced GPU in terms of a
higher mix, in terms of what we're selling as they see that experience being
extremely important to them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-09

Other questions from the audience?
Okay, good. Then I have one which I'll ask back on Tegra.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay.
{BIO 4109276 <GO>}
Tegra, you have deemphasized the handset market because it's too competitive and
maybe not as proﬁtable. But if you could just highlight for us what are you seeing in
the auto side of the business. And you've set out a bookings number that you gave
with that and how are you tracking to that.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So when we think about the overall Tegra business, the overall goal was to really
think about where the opportunities which were best matched to the overall visual
computing capabilities of that GPU in an SOC environment. A handset can be and
we have had some very key wins with very top-end phones where that experience is
important. Also moving to some of the tablets, again, where the performance is
extremely important.
But our main focus is really focusing both on the gaming market in the mobile
aspect. That can be, as you've seen, quite a few unique tablets that are on the
market; the Nexus IV, our own Shield Tablet. You've seen the emergence of
Chromebooks, which again are a big part of those aspects.
The moving to the overall automobile market, which is interesting about this is it's
not necessarily just a focus on the virtualization as we are in that center console, as
well as in the dashboard for many of those high-end luxury vehicles. But it's also
about assisted driving or autonomous driving cars of the future. And this is a case
where you're using the ability of an overall GPU to help with algorithms that alert the
driver of the future on how best to drive the car or have the car drive itself. So now
the GPU in the car is being used in very, very advanced aspects. There's a lot of
diﬀerent microprocessors in a car; there's probably about 50 of them. But we're
really talking about a key module that we're doing to control many of the key
aspects of that car.
So we're very pleased with it. We set out to really drive a growth rate that was more
than just a small growth rate. We've shown in this last quarter that we've almost
doubled year over year and the ﬁrst two quarters of the year were also quite strong,
growing about 60% to 70% in those ﬁrst two quarters. So I'd say we're well on track.
We talk quite openly about our overall pipeline of deals in the future. And really,
that's about designs that we've already won for the car and we just know that those
cars just have to hit the road and the timing in terms of when they purchase that. SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-09
