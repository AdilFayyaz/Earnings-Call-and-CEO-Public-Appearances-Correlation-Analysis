Hi, everyone. My name is Sterling Auty; I am the software technology analyst here at
JPMorgan. Very happy to have with us Judson Althoﬀ, who is the President of
Microsoft Americas. I'm going to turn the microphone over to Judson, just an
introduction, a little bit of background. I am going to start in terms of a few
questions. And then I want to bring the audience questions in as quickly as possible.
So with that, Judson?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Hi. thanks, Sterling. So good morning, everybody. And thanks for spending the time
with us today. I am thrilled to be here. Just by way of introduction, I have been with
Microsoft just a little over a year now. I spent 14 years prior to that at Oracle and
several years at EMC. So I have been in the enterprise software space my entire
career.
I came to the Company because I am really thrilled about where we are headed as
an organization. I believe our future stands to be much brighter than even our
storied past. And we have got just a fantastic portfolio of intellectual property to
bring to bear in a set of markets across the IT industry that are booming from
devices, the cloud, big data and data analytics and social.
And we have assets that allow us to capitalize on value like no other company across
those markets. So thrilled to be here and excited to get through the session today.

Judson AlthoﬀAll right, sounds good. Maybe for a way of setting context, can you give us an
overview of how the North American sales organization is structured?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Sure, sure. So in North America, we run about a $25 billion business across 8000
folks. And structured really into four major categories. We have our consumer
business, we have a midmarket -- small-medium -- business segment, a large
corporate enterprise segment and a public sector organization.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
When you look across that structure, how do you evaluate the success? Is there key
metrics that you are really using to run that business?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, quite a few actually. We would have everything from what you would expect
from a ﬁnancial P&L outlook on each one of the businesses, as well as a fairly robust
scorecard that gives us leading indicators as to where our business is headed
around growth markets, like devices and services in the cloud and what our growth
penetration is relative to share. So we manage across three operating mechanisms
for each one of those businesses.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
So you and I were talking a little bit before, this is kind of the question that you
would expect. Okay, you have seen some management changes in terms of at the
CEO level. Has that led to any changes in terms of how you look at your business?
Then we will kind of ﬂip it around and ask your views around from a high level. But
any changes in terms of new management, in terms of the way that you are running
that business?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes, sure. So look, I guess the right way to start oﬀ is to say that we are all thrilled to
have Satya Nadella as our new CEO. We think he brings a tremendous amount of
credibility to our Company from the commercial and enterprise side, given that his
tenure with the Company has really been focused around our server products, our
cloud products, our applications in the cloud. And we are really excited about
everything he brings to bear for our commercial businesses as they have been really
the mainstay for growth and proﬁtability for the Company.
That stated, it is a big company, right? And to state that we have seen dramatic
change in the ﬁrst 100 days of a new CEO would, frankly, be a little lofty. But we are
very excited about the direction the Company is headed in. And we think Satya
brings great energy and background from the technology side.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20

I think everyone would agree. It would be diﬃcult to see a dramatic changeover
across such a large organization. But I think some investors really want to understand
what -- from the method of running the Company, what are some of the diﬀerences
that you see?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Sure. So I think it is important to talk a little bit about our consumer businesses and
our enterprise businesses. And how one sort of transcends to the other. Satya has
actually spoken pretty openly about this already in his initial days as CEO.
Now what we want to really create on the consumer side of our business is virally
consumable cloud services that sort of transcend into monetizable value in the
enterprise. So you will see us continue to invest in the consumer side of our
business. But with much more focus on consumption-oriented cloud services that
accrue towards commercial value in the enterprise. And they sort of create that
brand loyalty and customer loyalty and stickiness of the services long run, with a
focus again on growing our commercial businesses.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
I think last year, there was kind of the branding around the One Microsoft
reorganization. Is there anything in that context that really changed about how you
go to market?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. That is actually a really good topic to spend some time on, frankly, because I
have seen dramatic change even in the ﬁrst year that I have been here at the
Company. When I joined Microsoft, we had a lot of product silos. And in fact, when I
ﬁrst sat down with Satya's predecessor, Steve. And my boss, Kevin Turner who is our
COO, we talked a lot about the strength we had by product category.
But frankly, our limitations towards monetizing those with our customers and
bringing more customer value was sort of grounded in the fact that we had all of
these products silos and really not a huge eﬀort of stringing them together to create
better value.
So the One Microsoft eﬀort, frankly, is a journey. I would say we are well started on
that journey. Maybe we are now down to maybe like three or four Microsofts instead
of 22 Microsofts when I started from a product standpoint. But what it allows us to do
is really capitalize on better opportunity in the marketplace in a diﬀerentiated
capacity. And let me explain what I mean by that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20

Page 4 of 16Sterling Auty
Judson Althoﬀ
Sterling AutyThere are four major growth trends that we see that are really driving the IT industry
right now. First of all, the explosion of all of the heterogeneous device form factors
and manufacturers. Second, the here and now of the cloud, the explosion of cloud
services.
Third, the explosion of data. It has been exploding for decades, ever since I have
been in this industry. But we continue to see the hockey stick curve on data, as well
as how you actually get value out of that data through big data and analytics. Then
sort of the social fabric that sort of weaves all of those together.
If you looked at how we went to market even just a year ago, we would pursue
customers very much along those silos and we would say, well, let's try to dream up
a big data project together. Let's ﬁgure out how to enable your mobile device
strategy.
But frankly, that actually underpinned our value in each of those categories and
actually underrepresented the strength that we bring to bear, because our secular
competitors in each one of those markets would show up with the next bright, shiny
object and it sort of minimizes our ability to compete.
But when we show up as One Microsoft and we say instead of having a social media
project, because frankly, the world doesn't need just additional communications
channel. We all get enough email and text messages and voicemails. To just have a
siloed enterprise social project really, frankly, doesn't bring a lot of business value to
a company.
But when you weave social into a fabric of cloud services such that when someone is
in a CRM application and they are getting enterprise collaboration out of that
application while they are in that work stream, you actually do get tangible business
value out of that and value that is returned pretty quickly to the shareholders.
That diﬀerentiates Microsoft. We are one of the only companies in the industry that
has assets across all of those areas. So by going to get to market as One Microsoft
with a solutions approach, we have a much more compelling and diﬀerentiated
value proposition than we ever have had before.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
But when you look across those elements -- I completely agree in terms of that
integration. But there still has to be a starting point to the discussion.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Sure.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20

Page 5 of 16Judson Althoﬀ
Sterling Auty
Judson AlthoﬀSo where do you see, in terms of your customer set within your organization, where
is the most frequent starting point on that discussion to then take it through that
integrated approach?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. That's a good question. I would say that there is probably not a singular starting
point. Frankly, we actually try to coach our sales force not to have a singular starting
point and show up with a canned pitch. But rather be much more consultative in our
approach to understanding what job it is they are trying to accomplish.
It varies quite a bit by industry. In ﬁnancial services, healthcare, manufacturing, you
have -- if you just sort of talk about the cloud motion, for example, you have a
diﬀerent propensity to want to move to the cloud with diﬀerent speeds, depending
on those markets.
We would love to always help our customers make that journey to the cloud because
the eﬃciencies that it brings, the new collaboration capabilities that it brings and the
return to shareholder value that it brings. But at the same time, highly-regulated
industries don't have the propensity to want to move there, just because of all of the
complications around security and data privacy.
So look, it is a consultative approach to a starting point. And it typically -- one of
those four pillars will lead to the discussion. It just sort of depends on the industry
and the unique customer situation.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
So in terms of the situations that you've seen success in that sales approach, does it
kind of bypass the RFP process? Meaning you get away from that point-to-point
feature-to-feature competition?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. So that is a good point to spend some time on as well. I will give you a couple
examples. So we are working with a relatively large airline. And through the course
of their own inquiries and RFPs, we started the discussion around a device portfolio.
And they are like, well, listen, what we want is a set of devices for our ﬂight
attendants to be able to do transactions in the cabin. We also want a cockpit digital
pilot book rather than the big briefcases they carry around all the time.
So what was issued to us was actually a device RFP. And frankly, if we would've just
shown up with our bright, shiny objects versus everybody else's bright and shiny
objects, we probably would've lost the opportunity. But by actually sitting down with
a customer and having a much broader conversation about what are the experiencesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 16Sterling Auty
Judson Althoﬀ
Sterling Auty
Judson Althoﬀ
Sterling Autythat you really want the ﬂight attendants to be able to have? What is the customer
interaction that you want to be able to have?
Being able to provide connectivity real-time to backend systems and applications
such that when the ﬂight attendant walks down the aisle and says hi, Mr. Jones,
thanks for being such a valued customer of ours. Because of all the miles you have
ﬂown today, we are going to oﬀer you a complimentary meal upgrade; those are the
types of things that provide stickiness through to our customers' customers. And
also allow us to provide diﬀerentiated value.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
How do you -- given you've got such a broad product portfolio, how do you balance
that type of sales approach versus from a top-down, from top management down
looking at the diﬀerent businesses going, geez, we should be seeing more
opportunity and more growth out of this area versus that area? So how do you
balance that?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. It is a broad portfolio. And we are responsible from everything from phones and
Xboxes to enterprise software running in the cloud. And to try to educate a
salesforce on how to appropriately position all of those products at the right time for
the right customer is a diﬃcult thing.
So the go-to-market approach we had is one of continually readying our generalist
salesforce to have a broad understanding of the full portfolio, while backing them up
with subject matter experts around the product areas at specialty. So that we go to
market with more eﬀective intelligence around the product areas.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Listen, I am all for Xbox in the workplace. So if you see my boss wandering around, if
you could convince him, that would be wonderful.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. We hear that a lot. We want to replace the company foosball table with Xbox.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Exactly. Let's actually take a step up to the high level. When we think about IT
spending and the cyclical nature of it, from my aspect it felt like the US economy
stagnated during 2013.
What are you hearing from customers in terms of their spending appetite? Before we
get to what's the things that you see them putting in place, just -- do you see themFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 16Judson Althoﬀ
Sterling Auty
Judson Althoﬀmore eager to spend? And what types of projects? Or are they a little cautious. And
why?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
What is interesting, we're cautiously optimistic about the IT market right now. But it is
a tale of two entirely diﬀerent markets. On-premise software, the traditional server
market. And the traditional PC market: relatively stagnant; ﬂat to single-digit up and
down quarter by quarter. Cloud market: on ﬁre.
And that is actually representative of our numbers and our ﬁnancials. We're actually
relatively pleased, frankly, on how much we are growing in the traditional markets
right now, because we are growing in a ﬂat to up or down slightly market. We have
seen 7% worldwide overall growth in our software in commercial markets.
I would add, though, that developed countries such as the United States,
signiﬁcantly higher than that. So what that indicates is that we're taking share from
our traditional secular competitors.
Like we have grown 15% in databases year over year. Our nearest competitor is
growing low, low single digits. So it's indicating we're taking share in those markets.
The same could be said for Windows. We are seeing strong growth there, indicating
that Windows is still the most popular work environment for operating systems.
In the cloud, it is explosive growth, triple-digit growth. We have doubled our cloud
businesses across Oﬃce 365, our productivity software in the cloud.
We have doubled our CRM business. And we have doubled our Azure business in
infrastructure and platform as a services side. And on some fairly big numbers. Oﬃce
365 is now at a $2.5 billion run rate.
So the fundamentals are incredibly healthy. But again it is a tale of two very, very
diﬀerent markets.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
But are those markets connected? You think that explosive growth, especially like in
cloud, etc., has some pull-through eﬀect on some of the others?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
I do. I think it actually is representative of Microsoft's growth and the health in our
own balance sheet, because of the fact that when companies are making on-premise
investments today they are making them with the future in mind. They are making
them with the thought that they may eventually go to the cloud; they may eventually
roll out to hybrid environments and support both.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 16Sterling Auty
Judson Althoﬀ
Sterling Auty
Judson AlthoﬀSo having singular code lines that work in both environments is sort of table stake for
continued investments in the IT market. And we are, again, fairly uniquely
diﬀerentiated in that regard.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Let's talk a little bit about Oﬃce 365. And then I want to bring the audience
questions in. What is the way that you position this to enterprise, especially those
that obviously already have on-premise versions of the Exchange, Oﬃce, etc.? What
is the value proposition that you present to them?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. Again it depends on the customer situation. We are -- we've been trying to get
out of the practice of showing up with the canned pitch and more into the process of
understanding business value and really anchoring with line-of-business decision-
makers around productivity, uniﬁed communications. And social. And the cloud.
So when we show up to a traditional on-premise customer typically it's about
functionality. What kind of business value are they trying to harvest out those types
of applications? With a nudge to the cloud is the way I would call it, because we view
the cloud as being the future, not just for us. But also for our customers long term.
As I stated earlier, though, depending on the industry you run into diﬀerent
propensities to move faster. We feel like we have made investments both in the
ﬁnancial services realm and in healthcare, sort of the two hardest -- healthcare,
government. And ﬁnancial services, probably the three hardest markets to penetrate
in the cloud.
We feel like we have made substantial investments there to make it easier for those
customers to go to the cloud. But still there is a hesitancy around data privacy and
protection in those markets that keep them from moving forward with the same
velocity as you would in traditional commercial markets and smaller businesses.
So the conversation starts from the anchoring around the business value and the
functionality that they get from the applications, with the notion of getting greater
eﬃciencies and collaboration in the cloud.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
In terms of the points that you can really spark that discussion, how much of that is
coming around contract renewals versus other points that you can begin that
discussion?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 16Sterling Auty
Judson AlthoﬀYes. Contract renewals certainly provide a moment to have a customer conversation.
We try not to have that be the deﬁning moment, quite frankly, in terms of our
customer dialog.
Typically, the conversations about getting more value out of your productivity
environment come from thinking about the sort of work environment that our
customers have. You take the device market and what customers are trying to do
with tablets and phones and conference room systems; and you talk about
experiences that tie together the value of being in the cloud by being able to
annotate notes in the boardroom, take them on a road in the tablet, further annotate
them on your tablet. And have those same notes on your phone; and being able to
tie those to real business applications running into the cloud.
That is actually what tends to spark the interest in wanting to make the move, when
you show tangible value versus just a, hey, we're going to do the same thing you've
always done only it's going to be in the cloud. That tends not to resonate terribly
well with customers. So that is how the conversations have to evolve.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
All right, let me take -- we have one question here coming in from online, then I want
to take from the audience. The question coming from online says: what can really
move the bottom line for Microsoft going forward in your new product investments
over the near term, meaning over the next one and three years?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. So a couple of things. Probably the biggest thing for us this next coming year is
going to be on the data side. We have a great new product release with SQL Server
2014 that frankly will allow us to have a no-excuses database for the ﬁrst time in the
Company's history.
What I mean by that is that we can legitimately go to companies of all sizes and say:
SQL Server can be the only database you'll need as a company. We can scale from
our standard edition product that has a great value prop on the low end all the way
through the premium version of the product and handle the most complicated
enterprise workloads.
That, coupled with in-memory capabilities and Hadoop capabilities provide a really
unique value there that will allow us to take share from our competitors at a
signiﬁcant pace this coming year. We have already been on that path for the last
couple of years. But we see a much more aggressive approach towards doing that
the next ﬁscal year, which for us starts in July.
The second thing is the growth in the cloud around enterprise workloads with Azure.
We have seen explosive growth with Azure, nearly 200% on average worldwide. And
that has come across both traditional infrastructure as well as platform as a service.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20

A - Judson AlthoﬀAgain, we feel like we're fairly uniquely diﬀerentiated there because we are -- with
some great respect for Amazon's early investments and Google's entrenchment
from the consumer side -- we're really one of the only companies that has the ability
to provide classic infrastructure as well as ﬁrst-party fast applications and third-party
support for enterprise applications running in the cloud. You may have taken note of
the SAP announcement we made on Monday, as well as almost a year ago now an
announcement with Oracle: we can legitimately support the world's applications
running on Azure. So we expect that to be a huge growth area for us next year.
We will see continued growth at Oﬃce 365, again fastest growing product that we
have had in the Company's history. We expect that to continue. But that will be
joined with growth on Azure, growth on the datacenter services side. And also
strong growth in CRM. We are doubling our CRM business year-over-year. We
actually expect that to pick up pace, because we have got some great new releases
of that product line and we are taking share from competitors there as well. So
healthy, healthy cloud businesses.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
All right, great. Questions from the audience? Yes?
Questions And Answers
So just to follow on the Oﬃce 365. So it seems like your opportunity with customers
that are in the SMB and big market that maybe are not on Software Assurance or
Enterprise Agreement already, it seems like that's a huge opportunity.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
It is.
Can you help us -- can you sort of size that opportunity? Can you help us like how
many customers do you guys have in the Oﬃce franchise that are in that bucket or
help us to (multiple speakers)?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Do you want to repeat that?
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Exactly. For the beneﬁt of the webcast: can you help size and frame the opportunity
for Oﬃce 365 in that SMB and midmarket, where they may not be on Software
Assurance or an ELA?

Page 11 of 16Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

A - Judson Althoﬀ
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Judson AlthoﬀIt's actually the highest growth market that we see for Oﬃce 365. We have
tremendous penetration, actually, on the upper end of the enterprise right now.
More than 50% of our enterprise customers have already moved to Oﬃce 365.
Actually a higher percentage of the seats in the enterprise have been penetrated on
Oﬃce 365. So we expect to see good, healthy growth there.
But the explosive growth that we are expecting is to come from the SMB. And it's
basically due to the penetration that we see right now, which is relatively low -- which
kind of surprises us, frankly. You would think that small and medium businesses
would have a faster propensity to want to move to the cloud.
But what we found is that this is the base of customers that was on a very traditional
Windows XP platform that have recently migrated and upgraded. And now the
opportunity to go back and position Oﬃce 365 through syndication and through
volume partners, like a partnership we have announced earlier this year with
GoDaddy gives us huge upside and opportunity.
We have somewhere around 4 million users today. But that's, the way we view it,
somewhere around 7% or 8% of the addressable market right now. So a lot of upside
that we expect to gain this year through syndication partners.
Can you walk through the trade-oﬀ between on-premise deployment of Exchange
and Oﬃce and what is purchased there versus if you use a cloud oﬀering, what are
you forgoing on the on-premise side?
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
So the question is: can you compare or contrast or tell you -- what are you forgoing
in terms of the cloud deployment versus an on-premise in certain situations,
Exchange, etc.?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. Predominantly, it is datacenter investments, everything from servers and storage
to the folks that manage that on a continual basis and manage the upgrade cycles.
You get much faster time-to-market on more current releases; you have much less
infrastructure to manage; and you are far more nimble at going to the next great
features that come out with the product.
I meant for Microsoft.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Oh, what are we forgoing? Very little if any, very little.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20

(inaudible – audience question)
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Yes, can you elaborate on the idea of developing personal clouds that would help
the enterprise cloud opportunity?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes.
(inaudible – audience question)
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
And how does Nokia advance that opportunity?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Sure. Maybe we will start with Nokia and then get into the -- what we are calling the
snackable, more virally consumable consumer apps.
So Nokia. Look, we bought Nokia really for three main reasons. First of all, it gives us
a fantastic leapfrog in hardware design that would have otherwise taken us much
longer to get through organically.
Secondly, much greater supply chain capability and distribution capability. Nokia has
got capability of delivering relatively low-cost products to all corners of the earth on
a very proﬁtable basis. That again would have taken Microsoft years to get to at an
organic pace.
The third thing which really, I think, gets to the anchor point of your question is that it
gives us the ability, through being able to provide ﬁrst-party hardware on all form
factors from the phone to the tablet to the large conference room system and
everything in between, it gives us the ability to actually design software for all of
those form factors, to create a better user experience, whether that user be a
consumer or a commercial-based customer.
And that experience is what we're really after, quite frankly, whether it's on our ﬁrst-
party hardware or third-party OEM hardware or, frankly, even a competitor's
platform. What we are trying to do is create services that are sticky, that start from the
consumer level, that are largely freemium at the consumer level.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20

A - Sterling AutyIf you think of services like OneNote and OneDrive and Skype, we are investing in
creating better aﬃnity circles around those snackable applications such as they
accrue towards better commercial value.
In other words, if folks grow up understanding and using the power of our stylus and
inking through OneNote connectivity and synching through one drive in the cloud,
all tied together with a conferencing system in Skype that allows instantaneous
meetings and discussions, that's an experience that they grow up with in, in the
education environment and the consumer environments that they come to expect in
the enterprise. So that is a bit of how we see those services ﬂowing and transcending
and accruing into commercial value.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Maybe a follow-on to that, one of the questions we just got here online I think hits it,
which is: what has been the experience so far in terms of Oﬃce for the iPad? As you
think about that tablet form factor, is there an opportunity? What you think about the
expansion into other, outside of iOS, meaning Android, etc.?
And do you get a sense, when you look across all the diﬀerent tablets that are out
there, what percentage of them actually have the horsepower to run an Oﬃce suite?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
It's a very good question, because actually the end part of it has actually been one of
the big limiters on when and how and where we would deploy Oﬃce on a tablet. We
have seen fantastic response on Oﬃce for the iPad. It has been highly regarded as
the best app ever made for the iPad.
Customers love it, both on the consumer side as well as the commercial side. It's
actually helping to drive consumption of Oﬃce 365 for our enterprise customers.
Because of the way we license Oﬃce 365 basically allows you to have multiple
devices on a singular license. And so customers are actually getting more value and
consuming down the cloud services that we've sold to them by being able to both
run on a tablet form factor and a PC laptop form factor.
So tremendous success there. I can't really comment right now publicly about where
we might be headed in terms of supporting other platforms, other than to say that,
again, our strategy is to provide more virally consumable services that then accrue to
enterprise value.
And we look at it mostly from a share-of-eyeball play. In other words, in a device use
that has greater share of human beings' eyeballs will be the ones that we try to

A - Sterling AutyYou talked about SQL Server and the new plans for 2014. Can you just talk about
what growth rate (inaudible) in the SQL Server as of the last couple years. And how
you see that market going forward?
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
What has the growth rate been like over the last couple years in the SQL Server
business. And what kind of trajectory do you see?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. So it has been a steady increase in growth rate over the last couple of years. SQL
for several years now has had the unit share superiority versus Oracle and IBM.
However, last year we saw for the ﬁrst time ever in addition to unit share actually
revenue share gains, because the value customers are getting into the product in the
15% realm in terms of growth, which is pretty fantastic when you consider the growth
rate of the overall database market now being mid-single digits. So indicating pretty
fantastic share growth.
With the release of SQL 2014, the product we just announced about a month ago, we
actually see even further gains. Beyond the growth rates we have seen, we see the
ability to actually take share at a much higher rate because of the enterprise
workloads that we can support, that previously could only be run on either IBM or
Oracle's database in a UNIX environment. We believe we can migrate to SQL 2014.
And all but really eﬀectively mainframe workloads we can run on SQL 2014.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Question here.
(inaudible – audience question)
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
So I think we have announced it. There will be an announcement in a couple of
hours, actually. So yes, you will hear later today that we are going to be announcing
the next-generation Surface product.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Other questions? One of the questions that I had is: you look at the opportunity; you
mentioned mobility, etc., especially now that you have got Oﬃce available on other
form factors. Do you already have the infrastructure in place?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20

A - Judson AlthoﬀSo as I think about working remotely -- so I am here at the conference; I have all my
models in Excel back on a shared drive. Is the infrastructure there in place where
instead of a VPN or some other, that I can come through the cloud, synch, to have
that synching capability back and forth. And do it in a way that a regulated industry
like ﬁnancial services or healthcare actually require?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
That is a really good question. In fact, I live that a bit every day. It's funny; even on the
trip out here, you kind of start to expect things as services being consistently
available, things like Wi-Fi on airplanes. Where three years ago it was hit or miss, now
when you get on an airplane if there is no Wi-Fi, you get mad.
That was my experience yesterday. I was trapped on a tin can for ﬁve and a half
hours with no access.
But the good news is based on the environment this is the only computer I haul
around, is my Surface. Because it is a full functioning laptop; it is a tablet. I can use it
as a pen form factor tablet or I can use it as a laptop replacement.
And everything that I do synchs automatically to the cloud. I have local copies that
the instant I have any connectivity, they stream back up and resynchronize. And it is
all done through fairly intense security algorithms as well, given my level within the
Company.
So yes, we have tested that out through ﬁnancial services, regulatory concerns, as
well as healthcare regulatory concerns in the cloud that we manage is secure for
those purposes.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Okay. Then just last question that's coming from online. With the diﬀerent products, I
guess when you think about innovation and driving that cool factor, where do you
think in terms of product portfolio and where it's headed?
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Yes. Again, we are thrilled with where we are headed and we are thrilled with our
position in terms of intellectual property in this market right now. We feel like we've
got a fantastic collection of assets.
And we're not resting on our laurels. We put nearly $10 billion of R&D into the
portfolio on an annual basis.
So we see growth very much in the same areas that I articulated: in these
consumable, viral, freemium applications on the consumer side; and tons of growth
in really three areas on the commercial side. One on the front end of productivity,
from productivity through enterprise social and uniﬁed communications in that. And
CRM.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-05-20

A - Judson AlthoﬀWe see huge growth in platform as a service through what we will recognize in
Azure; and then huge growth on the data side with SQL 2014, and Power BI and the
analytics capabilities that we provide out to the common user every day.
So the good news is we see great growth in just about every major aspect of the
portfolio right now.
{BIO 2070271 <GO>}
Fantastic. Judson, thank you so much for joining us today.
{BIO 18004989 <GO>}
Thanks a lot, Sterling. Thank you, everybody.
