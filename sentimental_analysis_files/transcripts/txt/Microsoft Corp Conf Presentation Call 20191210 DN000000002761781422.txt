Good morning everyone. Thanks for being here. I'm Jen Lowe. I cover the US
Software Group at UBS. And with me I have Takeshi Numoto, who is the CVP of
Cloud Marketing at Microsoft, so thank you for being here with us today.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Thank you.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Maybe just before we jump in, it might be helpful to set the stage, if you could just
give us a quick overview of your role at Microsoft, and what falls under your purview?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
So basically, I'm responsible for worldwide go-to-market of -- directly responsible for
many of Microsoft cloud products including Azure, business applications including
Dynamics 365, our Power Platform that I think we get to talk about later today. As
well as all the developer tooling products like Visual Studio. And then those are sort
of products that I'm directly responsible for in terms of marketing responsibilities. I
also have sort of what I think of as horizontal responsibilities in terms of what we call
business planning, which is all about packaging, pricing and licensing, of sort of the
entirety of the Microsoft commercial product portfolio including Microsoft 65 or
Oﬃce 65 and Windows. As well as the what we call the global demand center, which
is basically our marketing operations for the commercial business at Microsoft. So
that's -- I have a sort of a direct product responsibility and then two horizontal
responsibilities.

Takeshi NumotoGreat. And maybe before we sort of dig into those areas of responsibility, just
starting at a high level, one of the biggest questions, I think, all year that people have
been trying to ﬁgure out is what's going on in the broader environment. We see
headlines that seem negative for the macro, but companies like Microsoft, maybe
even Microsoft in particular, seem to continue to do very, very well. So can you just
talk quickly about the demand trends you're seeing? When you meet with
customers, how are they feeling about their plans, just anything?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean of course, I don't think any company or any business can claim to be
immune from the macro trends. But at least in the market that we participate in,
we're still seeing really strong momentum. When you think about all the energy and
the conversation we get to have with customers, particularly as it relates to their
cloud journey, the energy is only intensifying. They are coming out at both from the
perspective of how do I save money and drive productivity also to how do I use the
cloud as a catalyst for transforming their businesses and moving their business
forward. So, both are generating lots of engagement with customers and driving a
lot more consumption in the cloud. And so, to me, we're not really seeing sort of a
dampening of the demand from -- in the markets that we participate in. And we see -
- feel like we're in the right sort of place at the right time from a secular growth trend
standpoint.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And maybe just to round that point out, one of the debates, I don't know if it's an
either or but maybe a relative weighting, is the pod oﬀers a lot of advantages.
There's strategic advantages in agility and being able to do new things you couldn't
do before. There's also things like cost savings, moving CapEx to OpEx, that kind of
decision. Are the conversations equally weighted between those strategic and
forward thinking versus trying to drive down costs? Is there one that maybe is more
dominant than the other or any shifting?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Not really. I think it's sort of -- it's really, equally weighted. When you think about lots
of migration discussions, a lot of customers then start their cloud journey thinking
about migration as a way to save cost, to drive productivity, maybe increase agility.
And if there because of the rich history we have with things like Windows Server and
SQL Server, we basically get to provide a big economic advantage, we're basically 5x
cheaper for example, versus AWS in a lot of these migration scenarios. So that is A
set of entry points and some customers start there. And then there is another set of
customers that starts far more on the, yeah, I really want to innovate, change my
business processes, get into our new business processes or our new -- innovating
new applications and how do I do that using cloud native technologies.
And often times, a lot of the conversations that start in the migration sort of lead to
these, what I think of as the innovation agenda too. And the cost of some customers,
sort of plan for both at the same time and do it much more of a strategic partnershipFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10

Jennifer Swanson Lowewith Microsoft that basically says, hey, I really want a cloud journey partner that I'd
partner deeply with both on migration and innovation side and that's continuing to
drive much larger top down deals.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Great. And maybe just following up on that, I mean Azure has been a star performer
for Microsoft for a number of years now. We're seeing the scale get bigger and
bigger and bigger, but we're still -- growth rate's still hovering around 60%, which is
pretty fantastic. From your perspective, just to start, where are we in terms of Azure
adoption? Are we still early, mid-cycle, late? How far along are we? How much more
could there potentially be to go?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
In terms of sort of the journey to the cloud, I still believe we're in early innings and
have lots of opportunities ahead. The -- even if you just think about the other
opportunities and pipelines, we see -- we just continue to see tremendous amount of
growth. And I think you've seen Amy talk about increasing number of large deals we
get to do and that trend doesn't seem to be declining. So I think we're still early.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And maybe just to focus on the large deal point since that was something Amy did
call out speciﬁcally on the last earnings call. When we were doing our diligence on
the space a couple of years ago, we would hear AWS is getting these big
megadeals. Microsoft is getting there, but in some cases, you didn't even want those
megadeals because of the composition of services. If you look at the deals you're
doing now, these big deals, how do those tend to -- what are they? I mean are they
still pretty compute and storage heavy? Are you starting to see more premium
services in those types of deals? And maybe contrasting it to a couple of years ago
where maybe those deals weren't proﬁtable or viewed as, as proﬁtable as you would
like or potentially proﬁtable, do those start to look diﬀerent or you look at those
diﬀerently in a way that just as you drive down costs and increase the portfolio?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I mean, from a proﬁtability standpoint, I think in Q1, our commercial cloud Microsoft
overall, Microsoft cloud commercial gross margin, I think was at what 66%, 4 point
improvement year-over-year, in large part driven by improvement in Azure. So that's
an area we continue to improve in, particularly as we scale up and can start realizing
some of the eﬃciencies from the infra investments we've already made. And for us
that's sort of ongoing, sort of subject of focus for us and something we'll continue to
plug-in at. But we are seeing far larger deals and that I think is also in line with what
the larger market trends are, as customers look to use cloud in a much more
aggressive way.

Jennifer Swanson LoweAnd maybe within that -- like a year ago or maybe 18 months ago, Satya used to talk
about premium services growing signiﬁcantly better over -- as an Azure overall.
Presumably, that's continued.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yeah, I mean, when you think about the overall revenue mix, it is true that sort of the
compute and storage network sort of your, what you would think of as the more
infrastructure pieces are a big chunk of it. But from a growth rate standpoint,
premium services, whether it be data services, AI, IoT, analytics, security, those are
certainly outgrowing the core from a growth rate perspective by a signiﬁcant
amount.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And maybe just drilling into that, because premium services does encompass a lot,
AI has been a huge focus, but we've also seen data points suggesting momentum
around databases in the cloud in diﬀerent ﬂavors. Security has obviously been a big
focus. Are there any areas in particular that seem to be resonating with customers or
performing a lot better than maybe they were 12 months ago? Just any additional
detail would be interesting.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well, certainly data services continue to accelerate, whether it be -- and when you
think about some of the documented third party benchmark data, whether you look
at multitudes of giga on published data as an example, whether both on database
side or relational database side and also on the analytics side with the data
warehouse, we are seeing us being able to deliver substantial price performance
beneﬁts to our customers and that's translating into more customer leads, more
engagements and therefore more consumption, that's one area. And so we've
actually had additional announcement that build on this momentum. At Ignite, we
announced a new service called Azure Synapse, which really Synapse Analytics
which basically is taking the next step in data warehouse to be able to handle both
unstructured and the structured data with a very comprehensive workbench that --
it's getting great customer feedback.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And so we at UBS IT on stage earlier or yesterday, and one of this VMware [ph]
obviously have said publicly where we've got a big commitment to Microsoft. And
one of the things that they had a very strong point of view on was, as we start to
move our applications over to the cloud, they were very negative on the concept of
lift and shift and said, lift and shift doesn't work. You have to bring it over. You have
to refactor. Otherwise, you're going to have the same issues. As the provider of
Azure, how are you seeing companies successfully make that transition as they move
their own applications over? Is it a lot of lift and shift? Are you seeing new workload
development? Are they consuming more of those premium services as they rebuildFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 14Takeshi Numoto
Jennifer Swanson Lowe
Takeshi Numoto
Jennifer Swanson Lowetheir own applications? It just -- this seems like a big focus. So how are you seeing
that play out from your perspective?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yeah, I think customers really want to plan out their IT estate overall and I think that
has multiple pieces. There are applications that you just want to migrate, lift and shift
and just get driving eﬃciency infrastructure and getting out of some of the
nightmares or headaches that you may have had on-prem. That is one element of it.
And then there also the aspect of, hey, how do I develop, modernize my IT
infrastructure, develop new applications and that comes into the picture as well. So I
don't think it's one of the other, at most times customers think about being able to
take advantage on both sides.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And one of the other points they made was that learning that skill set around
refactoring applications and modernizing and bringing them over, they said the ﬁrst
few were painful. But now that we -- obviously, they have an incentive to say that
they've learned a lot and it's going really well, but I think it is. They said once they
got the ﬁrst few, it got a lot easier, and they could start bringing more over, go faster,
they've got the muscles built up. If you -- again going back to where we are in that
adoption curve, do you -- as you look at your customers, how many of them do you
think are kind of hitting that, they've got the muscles, and now it's just executing
versus still that learning phase of how do we even do this in the ﬁrst place?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well, I think every customer's journey is somewhat unique, particularly it's also a
function of, we think, oftentimes in cohorts like when did that a given customer start
their cloud journey and some customers are well into their end of the year. And so
they've gotten quite deep and some customers are still in early years. And so I think
that comes to the results in diﬀerent prospects for diﬀerent customers. But what we
are seeing though is this notion of, I now have acquired some cloud skills and I
actually want to extend that inclusive of ability to manage my own on-prem or
environments and other places. And that's why we've gotten so much interest in
some of the hybrid and multi-cloud investments we have announced at Ignite
around what we call Azure Arc, which is sort of a collection of technologies where if
you've learned to manage and set policies on resources in Azure, you can on board,
your own on-premise resources or resources in other cloud and sort of bring it under
the control plane from Azure, so you can manage it and set policies against it in a
consistent way. And that's gotten a lot of interest, partially because we have enough
customer base now that actually are skilled up enough in Azure, and being able to
want to extend that skill set to manage other environments.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And that's a good segue because that was one of the things I do want to talk about,
was in particular Azure Arc. And we've seen Google announced Anthos as well. IFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10

Page 6 of 14Takeshi Numoto
Jennifer Swanson Lowe
Takeshi Numotomean just to start and to put context around it, how would you sort of compare and
contrast what you're looking to do with -- or maybe not compare and contrast. So
let's talk about -- I don't want to put you on the spot to talk too much about Anthos,
but I'm sure you're very familiar with it. But I think people are trying to understand, is
this like Anthos? Is this something diﬀerent? How would you sort of describe Arc and
how it ﬁts into the multi-cloud strategy?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think the way you're even asking the question is quite indicative, it's like for some of
the other players I think the -- their approach to hybrids often equated with one
product. So AWS hybrid is often equated with Outposts or for Google hybrid is
equated with one oﬀering called Anthos. And for us, hybrid has always been a huge
diﬀerentiator and we think about it very holistically from identity to management,
security to even database technologies, developer tools. So it's a much more
comprehensive thing and it's not one thing. Arc is only one of the things we sort of
do in terms of being able to set, manage resources and services in a consistent way.
But, I think sort of the overall posture and the aperture is very, very diﬀerent.
And for AWS, my perception is they're very focused on managing their own
resources. So Outposts is a piece of hardware you have to buy from AWS and what
else you can use out there's, you can't run AWS services on customer's existing
hardware. And it always has to be connected and controlled by AWS. So it doesn't
support things like if you have a regulatory environment or governance issues and
you want to run things in a disconnected phase, you can't do that. So it's a very sort
of focused approach on essentially AWS resources. And for Google, I see it as being
very much focused on containers whereas customers not everything runs in
containers, customers need to run virtual machines too, they need to manage
servers too. And so our approach is more comprehensive -- reﬂecting sort of the
years of investment we made in this space.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And I guess one of the questions people always try and ﬁgure out is, so we're -- we
came from this old generation of technology, which is basically predicated on, once
people are on my platform, I never want them to leave. And so now we've moved to
this world of, people can leave. I want to convince them to stay. But I guess as you
think about building business models, what gets you comfortable with the idea that
once they come and -- they'll stay and sort of making things like Arc work in a way
that you don't run the risk of getting into a price war or any of these other -- what
makes people stay? What do you think as the areas of stickiness?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Actually for us this openness is a key portion of how we want to continue to attract
customers and trust our platform. And so, even in our support for containers in Arc,
we support not just one container, we support many containers, whereas Anthos for
example requires you use just GKE. And so like for us, we think of our ability to beFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Jennifer Swanson Lowe
Takeshi Numoto
Jennifer Swanson Loweable to be broad and very open-tented is actually a huge customer value
proposition, and one that enables us to attract more customers.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Great. So maybe just sort of extending to the other side of the hybrid world, looking
at the on-prem business, I think one of the things that has continued to surprise
positively is the ongoing strength of the traditional licensing business because
everyone just assumed it's either or we're seeing both, which is fantastic. But I'd be
curious to get your perspective, why are people still buying on-prem licenses? And is
there a point at which it becomes incompatible to continue to see the growth you
are seeing in Azure and still grow the on-prem business?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well, for us, one of the things that have been a very helpful construct both for our
business and for our customers is this notion of an Azure Hybrid Beneﬁt. The fact that
you can buy licenses that excessively have optionality and option value for being
able to essentially consume services in the cloud at a discounted rate. Basically
essentially has helped us encouraged customers to continue to renew our software
licenses and also pave the way for them to use Azure in a very natural and linear way.
And so that's worked really great for us as a way to basically keep both balancing
growing on both sides.
And the other factor on the service business is an increase in premium mix. We
talked about premium mix both in the services sense, but we're seeing in the
software sense as well. So instead of Windows Server standard increasingly
customers by Windows Server data center because they're using more virtualization
technologies and running more virtualized machines in the same node and that
essentially drives premium mix up and we see the same thing on SQL server where
the SQL server enterprise edition mix is going up and that's also helping on the
revenue side as well.
And then on the sort of the server -- server software license revenue side, there are
two set of temporal impact too in the sense that we've had end of service in the
support for SQL server 2008, that happened earlier in the year and that sort of
prompted, a set of purchases that may not be durable. And then we've also -- this I
think Q1 is the last quarter in which we had GitHub on-prem acquisitions, GitHub on-
prem revenue sort of recounted towards at the software license and this is the last
quarter in which it's not in the baseline. Moving forward, it will be, so it will normalize
a little bit.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. And maybe just to double-click on the hybrid use beneﬁts, as customers look
to take advantage of that program or look at that as a way to get comfortable buying
today and then have a vision for the future, what's sort of the horizon on that? I mean
are people buying with the view that, hey, maybe in ﬁve years as we move to theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10

Jennifer Swanson Lowecloud, but I want that ﬂexibility? Or is it a bit more immediate or spectrum? I'd just
be curious and to see it.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Again, I think this whole sort of -- the beneﬁts actually quite durable in the sense that
if you want to run Windows Server or SQL server, the way to pay for that IP even in
the cloud is to continue to renew your software assurance and that's kind of the
balance we've struck. So, we think of the hybrid beneﬁt sort of impact as being quite
durable over time.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay, okay. Maybe switching to another part of the business, another reporting unit.
So Power Platform is something that falls under your purview, and there's a lot of
diﬀerent pieces there. There's been a lot of new announcements there. But maybe at
a high level, what is the Power Platform? Because I know it encompasses a lot, but
maybe just to start there, why is it sort of carved out as its own distinct entity?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Great. So Powerful Platform comprises of products like Power BI, Power Automate,
per virtual bot, we just released recently and Power Apps. And these are all products
are characterized by what we would call a deep support for eﬀectively Power users
and citizen developers. When you think about the application needs of the world, we
believe in the next ﬁve years, more applications will be created, than perhaps in the
last 40 years. And when you think about tech companies, actually more developers
being hired outside of tech companies than in tech companies. The need to grow
application to support diﬀerent business processes and front-line issues is just only
going to explode.
And so then the scarce resource that non-tech companies do hire in terms of
professional developer capacity you have to be really leveraged. And Power Apps,
Powerful Platform is unique in the sense that it enables sort of Power users to
develop their own applications, subject matter expertise closest to the business
process, closest to the business issues to develop applications that really addresses
their needs, while also basically leveraging the scarce professional developer
capacity every organization you have and the two work in tandem, and that's one of
the key diﬀerentiations of Power Platform as being kind of the so-called no code, low
code product platform, but also has -- is built in a way that's very synergistic with all
the deep professional developer capabilities Microsoft provides with Azure.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And one of -- I think one of the attractive aspects of the Power Platform is it seems
pretty easy to use, pretty end user-centric. I go to Build and I see a demo, and I think
I could do it. I probably couldn't but I at least pretend I could. But -- so it is very much
designed to appeal to the user, but the user may or may not be the ultimateFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10

Takeshi Numotodecision-maker on whether this is something to be purchased. So can you just -- who
do you sell to in the organization? Is it -- it's -- well, who is the buyer?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well, before we talking about the buyer, I think it's actually really important to talk
about how we earn usage. And so one of the ﬁrst things that that makes -- gives --
maximizes our opportunity for end users to become familiar with our Power Platform
products is that many of those capabilities are seeded with Oﬃce 65. So every --
Oﬃce 65 comes with some basic capabilities of a Power App or of a Power
Automate, then people can start automating basic tasks within their Oﬃce 65
environment or do basically create a simpler applications using SharePoint as an
example. And so that really get customers and end users going and sort of inducted
in how you use these, very easy to use capabilities to start building applications. And
then that essentially then allows us to sort of then say to whether it's central IT and
say, hey, there is a wealth of usage, that's happening. Would you like to essentially
create more business applications and last mile applications using this in a way that's
highly manageable by IT, that's one central IT sales motion, and that -- it's successful
in many places.
And then there are other cases where we go talk to the line of businesses and then
say okay well, you're really trying to help with a given front-line or sort of subject
matter expertise problem and here's how you can help and we have a collection of
both what we think of as departmental sales as well as our centralized IT sales. And
both are sort of synergistic with each other basically.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And I think there was a data point out there that there's 2.5 million users on Power
Platform currently. And if I understand it, a lot of it sort of happens -- I mean the
purchase decision is, as we talked about, sort of made at a certain level of the
organization, and then people sort of organically come to it and build. What are sort
of the points that sort of get that ﬂywheel going? Is it people just discovering the
product? Is it someone sort of providing that education and getting people familiar
with it, what the value is? How do people sort of build that excitement and get the
programs going and drive that adoption?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well, I guess like there are multiple entry points. But for example if you sort of, if I
recall the history of Power BI as an example, that Power BI was the ﬁrst Power
Platform product. That really built its momentum based on lots of customers trying to
service for on the web for free and we've built -- had a very strong community, that
essentially software perpetuated. The product excitement, I think they can do in
building dashboards and sharing that. And so that was one way that where it really
took oﬀ. And the fact that we also created an oﬀering with oﬃce 65 and E5 that
included Power BI also sort of essentially tried to create end user excitement with the
sales motion that was a little bit in the traditional Oﬃce 65 sales motion piece.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 14Jennifer Swanson Lowe
Takeshi Numoto
Jennifer Swanson LoweAnd then when you think about newer Power Platform products like Power Automate
or Power Apps, a lot of that is coming from organic usage ﬁrst and foremost from
within oﬃce 65 tenants where customers start using eﬀectively the limited versions
of Power Automate and Power Apps, that comes with an Oﬃce 65 subscription. And
then that we get the usage going into more sophisticated scenarios that then gives
us an opportunity to upsell to a fuller versions of the product.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. And since you touched on it, so you have the Automate capabilities. You've
got some of the technologies around virtual agents that you rolled out. Would seem
a little bit more sophisticated than Power -- I mean not the Power BI actually but a
little bit more AI-ey. And I guess where do you -- because there's companies that
build their whole practices around automating that functionality. You guys have
made it sort of easy to consume. Where do you see Microsoft's role within markets
like RPA? Do you want to be the market? Do you see areas that make the most sense
and areas that pure plays can innovate? How does that kind of come together?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
I think we are -- we tend to go after very horizontal broad markets, and there is
always room for diﬀerent players to add value on top or do more targeted solutions
for given industries or given business processes and that's kind of existed forever in
diﬀerent markets when you even think about the history of Oﬃce. And so I don't
think it's any diﬀerent there. The one of the key advantages that we bring to the table
versus the sort of the traditional low-code -- no-code, low-code kind of tooling, is
that, with them, you start with something and then you want something really
sophisticated, you kind of hit a brick wall, you have to redo the app all over again
using a diﬀerent set of tech.
Power platform is built natively on all the underlying capabilities of Azure. So if you
want to go beyond what Power App platform products can do, you have a very
synergistic path to basically dip into sort of unlimited ﬂexibility that Azure provides to
extend those abilities without redoing your applications all over again. And this is
what I talked about earlier in -- is there is an important element of creating that
synergy with between basically the citizen developer, the power user that is
essentially the subject matter expertise using application and solve their problem,
being able to work closely and synergistically with professional developers who can
essentially deliver Azure based solutions in APIs that can be consumed by Power
Apps or Power Platform products in general.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And I still have a bunch, but I know we've already got a couple of
questions from the audience. So maybe I'll ask one more, and then if people want to
send it in, I'll look at these, too. Maybe just around Dynamics. I guess, I assume -- so I
think just going back to the history of Great Plains in Microsoft way back and the
history of Microsoft in the application space.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10

You can ask Satya about that.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
I'm sure it's for you. But maybe just to sort of look at where you are today, because it
is -- the story in the last 18 to 24 months feels to be very diﬀerent than the traditional
story of Microsoft in applications. So if we look at where you are today, where do you
see the natural ﬁt for Microsoft? Because you clearly partner with SAP and have
strong relationships in the enterprise space with SAP running on Azure. Traditionally,
it's been more middle-market oriented, but you also do see some large
organizations using Microsoft. So where's the natural home for Dynamics? Where are
you really looking to win with that product?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well I mean only Microsoft is a business larger than a $1 billion, growing well over
40%, get somehow sort of talked about as a needing to ﬁnd a place, it's already a
large business, a SaaS business growing 41% year-over-year. It's pretty substantial
and we're really excited about it. It is worth noting that the journey we've gone, when
you think about dynamics of old Great Plains, Solomon, Navision, Axapta sort of --
and then we also had a homegrown, Microsoft homegrown CRM product. But we're -
- all the assumptions are very much on-prem. And so starting with Dynamics 65, we
sort of put ourselves on our journey of making all of our capabilities natively cloud
based, natively Azure based, cloud applications and also unifying the application.
So that we actually have a suite of SaaS oﬀerings that worked well together that can
manage diﬀerent business processes, whether it'd be marketing or sales or
commerce or operations and ﬁnance and made it such that you can consume just
the pieces you want, but also can extend it. So you can actually get the full picture as
you expand the business processes covered by the SaaS application. So that whole
strategy and shift I think has really been catalytic and driving much more accelerated
growth.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. Great. So we have a couple from the audience, so I'll hit on those. And again, if
there's others, feel free to send them in. And one is around where we are on the
CapEx buildout for Azure. There was a huge wave of CapEx invested a couple of
years ago. It seems to have been a bit more run rate. I think people have gotten data
points from diﬀerent suppliers that things may be -- hyperscalers may be buying less.
Obviously, you guys seem to feel pretty good about what you're seeing. But maybe
you could talk a little bit about how -- and this might fall -- so this falls a little bit
outside of what you focus on, too. But I -- how you think about the process of the
CapEx buildout with Azure, any sort of change in how that looks, what you're
investing in. To the extent that, that falls in areas that you look at, I'd be -- there's
some interest.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10

Well, from a CapEx standpoint, we want to continue to be very, very close and driven
by customer signal. And so we continue to put eﬀorts into basically shorten things,
shorten our supplying team just as an example, so that we can be as sort of just in
time so to speak, in terms of delivering additional capacity as humanly possible. But
our goals are to really make sure that we're essentially serving customer needs and
how do we actually stay just in ahead of it enough so, but not too far ahead and
having that agility is what we continuously work on.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And maybe just to round it out, I mean I think the message is it's not a
change in sort of how the company is investing into Azure or any sort of signal that
there's a change in demand. I think it seems like it's more of a change in how tightly
you manage and what the lead times are, and yes.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yeah. It's been an ongoing improvement and how we can actually make it as, to
manage it as closely as possible. But at least in my role I'm certainly not feeling
constrained to serve customer needs.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. Great. And then the other question is around SAP. And SAP had talked about
making a very big commitment to Microsoft, and so that's sort of out there. But
maybe -- and I'll kind of broaden the question out a little bit. But ﬁrst is, what are you
seeing in terms of moving to SAP workloads to Azure and then maybe broadening it
out just Tier 1 workloads in general? What are you starting to see in terms of those
moving over to Azure?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
So we're certainly have a deep partnership with SAP in the Embrace project that we
announced recently, they're certainly leading with Azure as the preferred cloud as
they help customers basically set their journey from on-prem SAP to SAP HANA on
Azure in the cloud. And so that's sort of a tremendous opportunity for us and one
that we see lots of both existing growth as well as future growth opportunities. And
as it relates to Tier 1 workloads, SAP is just one of the examples where we're
increasingly getting these Tier 1 workloads that drive a signiﬁcant consumption and
that's also highly correlated with the increase in number of large deals. When you
have a big enterprise deal that's large, oftentimes that is catalyzed by a Tier 1
workload and our strategic alignment with the customer. And so those all go hand in
hand.

Takeshi NumotoAnd maybe a related one to that, SAP is one example, but we've seen Microsoft
partner with a lot of software vendors. Adobe is one. We have ServiceNow
presenting next. They're one. How are those relationships coming about? Are those
companies approaching Microsoft and say -- looking at ways to potentially reinvent
how their infrastructure is operating? Or is Microsoft going out and advocating for
these companies to work more closely with Microsoft? Maybe it's a mix? But I'd just
be curious because it -- there seems to be a bunch of them now.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yeah. So it's certainly a mixture of both. But one of the things that it's important to
note is, in conferences like this in a -- in press people also there is oftentimes, a very
sort of narrow comparison that people want to do between AWS versus Azure or
Google, GCP versus Azure, but in many cases, customers need when they think
about their journey to the cloud, they need a lot more than infrastructure. And the
fact that Microsoft gets to have a conversation broadly from M65 to Dynamics 65 to
Azure in a collection of capabilities, we can deliver comprehensively, puts us in a
very diﬀerent dialog with the customer. And then that also provides for a lots of
opportunities for ISVs to participate in that dialog, both from an Azure utilization of
Azure in delivery of their service but also integration with things like Oﬃce 65 and
the user experience that they can deliver in the day to day work of 200 million plus
monthly active users of Oﬃce 65.
And so those collection essentially enables us to have a conversation with ISV
partners that says, while not only do you have an opportunity to align with us from a,
what cloud would you use to deliver your service. But you can have a -- more
comprehensive dialog of how would you integrate with teams, how would you
integrate with oﬃce 65, how would you integrate with directory in a way that
eﬀectively furthers your value to your customers. And that's -- and then we have
programs like programmatic approach to support co-sell with ISV partners that's also
another part of the facility, how it's easier to -- for these ISVs to get this also lined in
their joint sales motions with Microsoft.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
And that's a good segue because we've got another question. And that was
somebody asking about Teams. And I can't believe I didn't think about it. But yes, I
mean obviously, Teams has been an area that Satya is pretty focused and talks about
quite a bit. So can you just give us a quick update on Teams, the momentum you're
seeing, maybe some of the partnerships? Because there has been a bunch that we
see.
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Yeah. We recently announced updated DAU numbers I think from 20 million and we
continue to see loss momentum. And we also announced a set of new capabilities in
Ignite to Internet is something that we continue to invest signiﬁcantly in both in R&D
and go to market.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-10

Okay. And actually just on that, because if I -- just having gone to a lot of industry
events over the last six months, Salesforce talks that Teams integration. Workday,
there's a lot of excitement around Teams integration. Is that a particular push? Or is
that -- like I mean we talked about sort of broadly where there's sort of push versus
pull in the partnership, but it feels like that one in particular has been very visible. So
is that a fair observation that a lot of these companies that even don't partner with
Microsoft in other ways seem to really be ﬁnding a lot -- is that customer-led? Or is
that sort of part of Microsoft's broader push to evangelize Teams as part of the
platform?
{BIO 21693553 <GO>}
Well, we think of Teams, as a great place for people to come together and
collaborate and have business process be infused into the way we people work
together. So it is natural for me ISVs to want to integrate with Teams because then
one of the I think in the text world the economical, there has been a sort of
economical separation of structured business processes and adhoc work world of
collaboration and communication and Teams basically gives u a harnessed for the
two to come together. And so that does give us a lot of opportunity to invite ISVs to
participate.
{BIO 6926228 <GO>}
Okay. Great. Okay. Great, well, I think that's basically our time, so we will wrap it up
there. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.
