It's a great pleasure to invite all of you back. I hope everybody enjoyed their
breakfast. I certainly did. And it's my privilege to invite you and welcome you to our
shareholder meeting. I'm, of course, Eric Schmidt, the Executive Chairman. You know
me.
Everybody should have registered. If you haven't, please go ahead and get your
badge so we know who you are. There is an agenda that includes on the back rules
of procedure for the meeting, which we will, of course, be following.
I want to make sure everybody knows we've got a couple of folks here. I'm just going
to describe them, starting with John Doerr, one of our longest-serving board
members, my personal friend for many decades and a fantastic venture capitalist;
John Hennessy, among other things, a brilliant computer scientist and former
president, I guess just recently stepped down at Stanford and remaining at Stanford
as a computer scientist and also on our board. And of course, we have Larry Page.
It's hard to describe the contribution that Larry Page has made to the world. Let's just
say that he is one of the most extraordinary human beings alive today. And I'll stopFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

Page 2 of 38David C. Drummondthere. I can go on. But I don't -- he hates this. So I want to be respectful and just say
let's start with that as our threshold.
You're going to hear from Ruth Porat, myself and David Drummond and -- who are
part of the management.
We also have Maura Stanley. She's a representative of Computershare. Maura, I
didn't see where she was. Oh, there she is. I'm sorry, would you raise your hand
there? There -- she's right over here on the right. And she is our Inspector of
Elections. So make sure the numbers add. That was a problem at another awards
show.
And Andrew Cotton and Matthew Taggart, representatives of Ernst & Young. Where
are Matt -- where are those 2? Over here. Okay. Sitting in the opposite corner. And
they are our independent accountants. And they've done this forever and of course
do a great job.
What we normally do here is we have sort of the formal procedural part of the
meeting. And then we have -- what'll happen is I'll do a short sort of update of where
we are and go right to your questions.
David Drummond, my colleague for 20 years, I think, close to 20 years, will now run
the proper part of the meeting. I think you all know he's the Senior Vice President,
Corporate Development, Chief Legal Oﬃcer and Secretary of everything. Okay,
David. Thank you.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
All right. Thank you, Eric. Well thanks, everyone. Welcome to the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders as well as the annual opportunity for Eric and myself to wear a tie on
the Google premises. So we're really glad to have you here.
So a quick note about logistics. As stated in the rules of procedure that you probably
-- should have received, stockholders should not address the meeting until you're
recognized. We -- as Eric said, we have a question-and-answer period. So you can
ask your questions after we've ﬁnished the formal business. So when we get to the
Q&A period, if you'd like to ask a question, we have -- we usually have mics. I don't
see them, maybe they'll be there in the Q&A period, where you can step up to the
mic and ask your question. Once you've been recognized, when you are recognized,
please identify yourself and your status as either a stockholder or a representative of
a stockholder. And then you can ask your question.
I've received the aﬃdavits of mailing from Computershare and Broadridge, which
state that the notice of the meeting was duly given. All stockholders of Class A
and/or Class B common stock as of the close of business on April 19, 2017, are
entitled to vote at this meeting.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 3 of 38I've also been advised by the Inspector of Elections that holders of our outstanding
Class A and Class B common stock representing at least a majority of the voting
power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock which are entitled to
vote is represented in person or by proxy at today's meeting. And I apologize for the
longest sentence in the history of mankind that I just read. Therefore, a quorum is
present today and the meeting is duly constituted and the business of the meeting
can proceed.
So the ﬁrst item of business, as always, is election of directors. We have 12 directors
to be elected at the meeting today. Those directors will hold oﬃce until the 2018
Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Board of Directors has nominated the
following: Larry Page; Sergey Brin; Eric Schmidt; John Doerr; Roger Ferguson; Diane
Greene; John Hennessy; Ann Mather; Alan Mulally; Paul Otellini; Ram Shriram; and
Shirley Tilghman.
Now our bylaws require that stockholders provide advanced notice of their intent to
nominate persons as directors. We didn't receive any such notice. So accordingly, I
declare the nominations for directors closed.
Now the next matter being submitted to our stockholders is the ratiﬁcation of the
appointment by the board of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public
accounting ﬁrm. And our board has recommended that our stockholders ratify the
appointment of Ernst & Young as our public accounting ﬁrm for the 2017 ﬁscal year.
The next matter that we've submitted to stockholders is the approval of an
amendment to our 2012 stock plan to increase the number -- the maximum number
of shares of our Class C capital stock that can be issued under the plan by 15 million
shares of Class C capital stock. Our board has also recommended that our
stockholders approve this amendment to the 2012 stock plan. All of that's described
in detail in our proxy statement.
Now the next matter being submitted, on an advisory basis, is the approval of the
compensation awarded to Alphabet's named executive oﬃcers. Our executive
compensation program and the compensation paid to our named executive oﬃcers
is described in full on Pages 38 to 48 of our proxy statement.
Now our compensation programs are overseen by the Leadership, Development
and Compensation Committee of the board. And they reﬂect our philosophy to pay
all of our employees, including our named executive oﬃcers, in ways that support
our primary business objectives and mission. Our Board of Directors has
recommended that our stockholders approve the compensation awarded to our
named executive oﬃcers.
The next matter being submitted to the stockholders is an advisory vote again to
determine the frequency of the future stockholder vote regarding compensation
awarded to the named executive oﬃcers. So how often we're going to have the
advisory vote that we just -- I just discussed. Now our Board of Directors hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 4 of 38Ivy Jackrecommended that our stockholders vote for a frequency of every three years for the
stockholder advisory vote on compensation awarded to named executive oﬃcers.
Okay. So now the next 7 items are all stockholder proposals.
Our Board of Directors has unanimously recommended that our stockholders vote
against all 7 stockholder proposals that will be presented. You have the arguments
for in our proxy statement as well as the company's response to each of the
proposals.
So let's start with the ﬁrst one. It's being brought by John Chevedden, James
McRitchie, Myra K. Young and the Northstar Asset Management Funded Pension Plan
as the co-lead ﬁlers, as well as Boston Common Asset Management as a co-ﬁler. Ms.
Ivy Jack, who is representing Northstar Asset Management, will be presenting the
proposal. There she is. Ms. Jack, you'll have a total of 3 minutes to make a statement
about the proposal. And I'll advise you when your time's up. Go ahead.
{BIO 21633041 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Ivy Jack from Northstar Asset Management in Boston,
the beneﬁcial owner of over $7.2 million of Alphabet common stock.
Fellow shareholders, I am here to represent resolution #6, a good governance
proposal about equal voting rights. When shareholders of common stock do not
have an equal right to weigh in on signiﬁcant governance matters, we subject
ourselves to greater ﬁnancial risk. When Alphabet went public, shareholders already
lacked opportunities to give substantive input into matters of policy.
Alphabet's voting structure is heavily weighed to favor insiders, given that Class B
shares are granted 10x the voting rights of Class A shares. Matters were made worse
when Class B insiders voted in a brand new class of stock with 0 voting rights. The
fact that this was approved is particularly remarkable because our calculations show
that only 15% of Class A outside shares that voted approved of establishing Class C
capital stock.
How is this possible? Well this measure passed because Mr. Brin and Mr. Page, who
currently own only 11% of the outstanding shares of the company, together have 51%
of the voting power. While we can ignore this reality when proﬁts are up, this voting
structure constitutes a considerable risk to governance and shareholder value. Our
company's own 10-K identiﬁes this risk when it states that the concentration of our
stock ownership limits our stockholders' ability to inﬂuence corporate matters and
that the Class C structure could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey's current
relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors to
determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.
In other words, it continues to be impossible for outside shareholders to have any
meaningful input on company decisions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 38David C. Drummond
Meredith R. BentonFurthermore, the 10-K notes that, as a result of this concentrated control, company
management may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneﬁcial. Since
Class C shares have no voting rights. And given the importance of voting at annual
meetings, Class A shares are the only way for outside shareholders to have a say in
company matters.
We are very concerned about the governance risks that come from relying upon
merely 2 or 3 people's vision and ability to reduce threats to the company long term
without broad input. The founders brought this company into fruition and led it into
proﬁtability. But the company's decision to oﬀer common shares of the company on
public exchanges makes Alphabet a public company. And brings with it a
responsibility to shareholders to practice good governance.
Shareholders, we urge you to vote for proxy item #6.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thank you very much, Ms. Jack. The -- thank you.
The second stockholder proposal is being brought by Walden Asset Management as
the lead ﬁler. They're joined by The Benedictine Sisters of Baltimore, The
Benedictine Sisters of Pan de Vida and other organizations as co-ﬁlers. We have
today Ms. Meredith Benton, who will be presenting the proposal. Ms. Benton, you
have 3 minutes.
Thank you. My name is Meredith Benton. I'm here representing Walden Asset
Management, the primary sponsor of Proposal 7, seeking information on how
Alphabet directly and indirectly works to eﬀect legislation and public policy. Walden
owns over 160,000 shares of Alphabet. On behalf of Walden and approximately 20
co-ﬁlers, I am pleased to move this resolution.
On their behalf, let me start by thanking Alphabet for its steadfast leadership on
climate change, both by reducing its greenhouse emissions, greenhouse gas
emissions. But also by speaking out to support the Paris Accord and committing to
continuing leadership on climate. It is a part of Alphabet's lobbying for positive
public policy solutions. And it matters a great deal. Thank you.
We understand that corporate lobbying can be a positive force and that
transparency is an important part of this. This request for transparency on lobbying
has been made to hundreds of companies over the last six years. Lobbying is big for
Alphabet. We know that in the last ﬁve years, Alphabet spent over $83 million in
federal lobbying and has been one of the top 5 companies lobbying. While
Alphabet discloses a summary of their direct federal lobbying on their website with
links to reports they provide to the Senate, these Senate quarterly reports are very
diﬃcult for investors to navigate. Alphabet also does not disclose meaningful details
on dues and grants provided to the over 40 trade groups and advocacyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 38David C. Drummond
Ivy Jackorganizations it is a part of, nor how it evaluates whether these lobbying
organizations are vetted to be consistent with Alphabet's priorities and values. In
order to better understand Alphabet's role in trying to eﬀect legislation and
regulation through trade association, additional disclosure is needed for investors.
Once again, we want to congratulate Alphabet for the company's public decision
several years ago to withdraw from ALEC, a known climate-denying group actively
working to combat renewable energy standards. Alphabet acted on its stated values
when it withdrew from ALEC, an action we enthusiastically commend.
However, there are other trade associations whose actions conﬂict with Alphabet's
values. For example, Alphabet is an active member of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, a group which has spent over $1.2 billion on lobbying since 1998. This
group has been an active force opposing climate change solutions, including suing
the EPA to block the EPA's Clean Power Plan to address climate change. Clearly, this
creates an outright conﬂict with our stated environmental position. Apple was so
oﬀended by the Chamber's policies and actions that they withdrew membership. We
urge Alphabet to seek out challenging the Chamber's actions against climate
policies and to lobby inside the Chamber with other companies to change the
Chamber's policies.
Another item of concern to investors is the Financial CHOICE Act, which will soon be
before the House for a vote. This seeks to eliminate the ﬁling of shareholder
resolutions, an important tool for investor communication and trust-building within
the ﬁnancial markets. We urge Alphabet to speak up for the rights of investors to ﬁle
resolutions.
One ﬁnal point. For several years, investors have written letters to top management
and ﬁled resolutions on lobbying disclosure and transparency issues, seeking
opportunity simply to meet and talk. But the letter and calls have gone unanswered.
The ﬁlers of this resolution are perplexed. Alphabet doesn't have a bad Investor
Relations record in general. So why doesn't the company agree to meet or talk on
the phone with investors who want a hearing and to seek a middle ground? Thank
you.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thank you very much, Ms. Benton.
The third stockholder proposal is being brought by Clean Yield Asset Management
as the lead ﬁler on behalf of John Fedor-Cunningham and David Fedor-Cunningham
and the Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica as the co-ﬁler. Ms. Ivy Jack is
back to present this proposal.
{BIO 21633041 <GO>}
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Board of Directors and my fellow shareholders. My
name is Ivy Jack. And I have been asked to read the following statement by the ﬁlersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 38David C. Drummondof this proposal, Clean Yield Asset Management.
Our proposal, #8 on the proxy ballot, calls on Alphabet to fully disclose the extent of
its political spending. Speciﬁcally, Alphabet has refused calls to disclose what it
contributes to so-called dark money nonproﬁts such as trade associations and 501c
[ph] 4 [ph]s. These are entities that can receive payments from corporations but do
not have to disclose the source of those contributions. Since 2012, dark money
groups spent more than $670 million to inﬂuence electoral outcomes.
We've been trying to have this conversation with Alphabet for three years and are
surprised and disappointed at management's continuing unwillingness to dialogue
with us on this matter. At the 2014 shareholder meeting, responding to another
shareholder raising questions about political spending, Mr. Schmidt pledged to
come back with "some ideas." It's been three years without any ideas. In those three
years, the amount of dark money spent in American elections rose by nearly $200
million. Also, in those three years, we have seen an erosion of faith in this country's
democratic institutions. The 2 trends are not unrelated.
We'd like to know why it's okay for Alphabet to secretly contribute the company's
money to groups that spend it however they wish, even in ways that may conﬂict with
the company's stated values. Nearly 1/5 of the S&P 500 either restrict their payments
to 501c [ph] 4 [ph] groups and trade associations or disclose them.
Alphabet showed real spine when it quit the American Legislative Exchange Council,
an organization that consistently ﬁghts legislation designed to curb climate change.
But it still has an expensive political footprint supporting about 140 trade
associations and other nonproﬁts across the political spectrum. The reputation risks
are not hypothetical, as Alphabet has come under heavy criticism in the media for its
aggressive lobbying of the European Commission.
Google users trade away a great deal of privacy for the privilege of using the world's
most sophisticated and powerful search engine. This transparency should be a 2-way
street. As a company with this extraordinary power over its users' personal
information, Alphabet has a special obligation to be fully transparent about its policy
aims and relationships which aﬀect so many aspects of our lives and relationships to
this company.
Fellow shareholders, cast your vote in favor of Proposal #7 (sic Proposal #8) to
encourage management to stop hiding its political contributions and rise to the best
practices of its peers.

behalf of a client, Eleanor Shorter. And Proxy Impact as a co-ﬁler on behalf of CBFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 8 of 38Natasha L. LambWealth Generation LLC. Ms. Natasha Lamb, there you are, you'll be presenting the
proposal. You have 3 minutes.
{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Page, members of the board and
fellow shareholders. My name is Natasha Lamb. And I'm here to move Proposal #9,
ﬁled on behalf of Arjuna Capital's client and co-ﬁled by Baldwin Brothers and Proxy
Impact. Speciﬁcally, we are asking the board to publish a report on gender pay
equity. This is the second year that we have submitted this proposal.
The median income for women working full time in the United States is reported to
be 79% of that of her male counterparts. And forecasts indicate that women will not
reach pay parity until 2059. Of note, the gap for African-American and Latina women
is wider at 60% and 55%, respectively.
Gender pay disparity is not only one of the biggest social justice issues of our time; it
poses a risk to companies' performance, brand and investor returns. This issue is
particularly salient to the technology industry, which struggles to attract, retain and
move women into positions of leadership. A 2016 Glassdoor study ﬁnds an
unexplained 5.9% gender pay gap in the information technology industry after
statistical controls such as job title and seniority, noting, "Many tech jobs top the list
for the largest gender pay gaps."
And while Alphabet has not reported its company-wide pay gap, PayScale reports
the company has a mean pay gap of 13%, over $13,000; and Glassdoor has reported
a $25,000 gap at the senior engineering level. I will note, however, that investors
should not be reliant on third-party analysis. The onus is on our company to disclose.
Of further note, Alphabet is now the subject of an investigation by the Department
of Labor alleging extreme gender pay disparity.
Research indicates gender-diverse teams are more productive, innovative and drive
better results. So clearly, a failure to attract and retain qualiﬁed female employees is
detrimental to Alphabet's ability to innovate and compete. Alphabet has disclosed
that 31% of our company's workforce is female, yet only 24% of our management
team is female. Our company is best served by a proactive approach to address the
structural biases, including pay inequities, that prevent women from moving into
positions of leadership.
So given the material business risks gender and equity presents, investors expect
transparent, honest disclosures and quantitative goals. Employees expect a new
level of structural support that addresses root causes and empowers fair negotiation,
promotion and, ultimately, equal pay. Implementing the proposal would represent a
proactive step toward closing the gender pay gap. We believe the company would
beneﬁt from taking a leadership position on this issue along with technology peers,
including Intel, Apple, Expedia, Adobe, Amazon, Microsoft, GoDaddy and eBay, as
research indicates attracting and retaining diverse teams yield strong ﬁnancial
performance beneﬁts.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

{BIO 21633041 <GO>}
Thank you. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholders Services agrees, stating, "A vote
for this resolution is warranted, as Alphabet lags its peers in addressing gender pay
disparity. By not addressing the issue at the same level as its peers, Alphabet is put
at a competitive disadvantage in the recruitment of candidates and the retention of
employees." Thank you.

Thanks very much.
The ﬁfth proposal is being brought by the National Center for Public Policy Research
as the lead ﬁler. Mr. Justin Danhof is here. Hi, Justin. And he'll be presenting the
proposal. Three minutes.
Thanks. Good to see you again, David. The tie looks good. I feel underdressed now.
But we're not here for fashion.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Thank you. Hi. we're trying.
As David said, I'm Justin Danhof with the National Center for Public Policy Research.
And I rise today to move Proposal 10. Our proposal requests that the board issue a
report analyzing the company's charitable activities. The report should list the
rationale and beneﬁts to society at large produced through the company's charitable
contributions. It should be noted that the report would not change any of the
company's policies, goals or values or place them in the hands of shareholders. It
would simply explain whether management believes that its donations have lived up
to the company's goals and values.
The company donates to numerous organizations. Some of these organizations may
end up using funds provided by the company in unintended and unwanted ways.
Donations to controversial groups, particularly political ones, may also eventually
result in harm to Alphabet's reputation.
For example, the company has donated to the Center for American Progress, known
as CAP. CAP is an extreme political group that has been accused of anti-Semitism. InFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 38David C. Drummond
Unidentiﬁed Participant2010, under the direction of John Podesta, who would go on to become chairman of
Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, CAP actually wrote the blueprint for the
Obama administration's expansion of executive power. Even The New York Times
towards the end of Mr. Obama's presidency said that he expanded the executive
branch power so much, more than we had ever seen in modern times, that it would
change the presidency for decades to come.
Well we all know presidents change. And now with President Trump in oﬃce,
Alphabet has actually lodged complaints about the very same use of executive
power that was designed and endorsed because of the company's decision to fund
CAP. That's hypocritical.
The company has also donated to the Clinton Foundation, which has been under FBI
investigation. Media reports strongly imply that parts of the Clinton Foundation may
have operated as a pay-for-play scheme whereby individuals and corporations may
have sought preferential treatment from government actors in exchange for
donations to the foundation. Such speculation is further fueled by the closing of
some of the Clinton Foundation operations following her unsuccessful bid for the
White House.
While liberals in the room may cheer donations to CAP and the Clinton Foundation
just as conservatives may bemoan them, there is no question that donations to
highly politicized organizations are controversial. The report requested by our
proposal would increase transparency and accountability and may also help the
company avoid unnecessary issues. Please join me in supporting Proposal 10. Thank
you.

The sixth proposal is being brought by Holy Land Principles, Inc. as the lead ﬁler and
Azzad Asset Management as the co-ﬁler. Mr. Declan Keogh is here to present. Mr.
Keogh?
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and fellow Google shareholders. My name is Declan
Keogh. I am here to request that Google adopt the Holy Land Principle resolution.
These principles require that companies that do business in Israel and in Palestine
have fair employment policies and procedures. Google must have a workforce in
Israel that reﬂects the ethnic diversity in Israel. In Israel, diversity means diversity of
religious aﬃliation. It does not mean skin color. Having a diverse workforce means a
workforce that includes Christians and Muslims, who make up more than 20% of the
Israeli population. The government of Israel requires that everyone carry an identity
card that is color-coded to their religion. It is very easy for anyone to see which
religion a person has.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 38David C. Drummond
Natasha L. LambAmerican people expect American companies that do business overseas to have
employee policies that reﬂect American values. This includes equal opportunity,
equal pay and no favored group. Google's board has recommended that we
stockholders vote against this resolution because they say Google already has an
equal opportunity policy in place in Israel. If that is true, then we would like to see
the numbers. If Israel is very -- sorry. In Israel, it is very easy for Google to count how
many of its employees are Jewish, how many are Christian and how many are
Muslim.
I grew up in Ireland during the Irish troubles which were caused by the
discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland. The Holy Land Principles are
based on the MacBride Principles, which require companies that did business in
Northern Ireland to be fair in their hiring policies. I know ﬁrsthand what
discrimination can do to a nation.
By deﬁnition, Israel is an apartheid state where Christians and Muslims are subjected
to institutionalized discrimination. Google must oppose Israel's apartheid laws and
take whatever steps it can to provide a safe and fair work environment for all of its
employees. Apartheid is glaringly obvious in Israel's illegal settlements in Palestine.
To employ Jewish Israelis that live in illegal settlements and not to employ Christians
and Muslim Palestinians that live in Palestine is a ﬂagrantly discriminatory practice.
Google's credibility in the Arab world is at risk. Without a veriﬁable policy that
provides proof of their fair employment, Google will be seen to have its own
unoﬃcial version of Donald Trump's Muslim ban. In the words of Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, apartheid is both intrinsically evil and morally reprehensible. Please
remember, Google's motto is "Don't be evil." Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Keogh.
So our ﬁnal stockholder proposal is being brought also by Arjuna Capital on behalf
of its clients, Susanna L. Hoﬀs and Matthew Joseph Roach. Ms. Lamb is back to
present this proposal.
{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Good morning. Again, my name is Natasha Lamb. And I'm here to move proposal
#12 on behalf of Arjuna Capital's clients asking the board to publish a report on
public policy issues associated with managing fake news and associated hate
speech, including the impact on a democratic process, free speech and a cohesive
society. To be clear, we are talking about content posted and disseminated with the
intent to mislead, not the mainstream media which the President refers to as fake
news.
Of note, research has shown that fake news has aﬀected elections in the U.K., France
and the U.S.. And Pew conﬁrms broad misperception caused by fake news, noting
64% of U.S. adults say fabricated news stories cause a great deal of confusion aboutFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 12 of 38David C. Drummondthe basic facts of current issues and events. That confusion cuts across political lines.
And there's a study that just came out this morning that shows that the same
number, 64% of Americans, now trust content on the Internet less than they did one
year ago.
Fake news is not about spin or conﬁrmation bias. It's about fabrication. And when
fabrication is disseminated so easily at scale, the way we have seen through
Google's AdSense platform, it represents a threat to our democracy. Google has
faced sharp criticism for providing a ﬁnancial mechanism supporting fabricated
content on the Internet, as fake news promoters hack their way to visibility and
revenue through strategically gaming ad buys and algorithms.
Hate speech is a related concern. A number of major advertisers have suspended
advertising on Google platforms for fear of being associated with objectionable
content. And one prominent Wall Street ﬁrm estimates Google lost $750 million in
advertising revenue for this very reason.
Alphabet is highly vulnerable for its apparent mismanagement of the issue. And
while our company has recently announced some steps to deal with these problems,
they are too little and too late. Indeed, Alphabet's challenge is how to address fake
news and hate speech without curbing freedom of expression for billions of users.
And a lack of self-regulation could invite government regulation.
So investors seek assurance that fake news, fabricated content and hate speech is
being handled responsibly over time. We do not expect it will be solved through a
simple algorithm tweak or better user education, although those are important
pieces of a larger puzzle. Fake news is a complex issue that needs to be managed
systematically. And investors expect transparency and accountability so we may
understand the full scope of the issue. We expect annual reporting on public policy
risk, impacts on free speech and analysis on how fake news is impacting a
cornerstone of our democracy and informed electorate. Thank you.

So that concludes the proposals and the formal business for the meeting. So most
stockholders have voted in advance of the meeting via proxy. But we do want to give
folks an opportunity who have not voted or those who want to change votes the
opportunity to do that at the meeting. So if -- you don't need to do anything if you

are still out there. If you do have one, please hold up your hand. It looks like we got
everybody. There's one more -- 2 more.
All right. So let's get to the results. I've been advised by the Inspector of Elections
that the nominees for election to the Board of Directors have been duly elected. I've
also been advised that a majority of the shares of our Class A and Class B common
stock entitled to vote and are present at the meeting in person or by proxy have
voted in favor of the ratiﬁcation of an appointment of Ernst & Young to act as our
independent registered public accounting ﬁrm for 2017; as well as the approval of an
amendment to our 2012 stock plan; the approval of compensation awarded to our
named executive oﬃcers; and the proposal that every three years, we have a
stockholder advisory vote on compensation awarded to our named executive
oﬃcers. So therefore, each of these proposals has been approved by our
stockholders.
I've also been advised by the Inspector of Elections that a majority of the shares of
the Class A and Class B common stock entitled to vote and are present here in
person or by proxy have voted against the stockholder proposal on -- regarding
equal voting; the stockholder proposal regarding a lobbying report; the proposal
regarding a political contributions report; the proposal regarding a report on gender
pay; the proposal regarding a charitable contributions report; the proposal
regarding the implementation of Holy Land Principles; and ﬁnally, the stockholder
proposal regarding a report on fake news. So therefore, each of those proposals has
not been approved by our stockholders.
As soon as possible after the meeting, we will complete the ﬁnal vote tabulations,
incorporating everything we received today. And will provide a ﬁnal vote tally of
those results on our Investor Relations website. We also will be ﬁling those with the
SEC.
So that ends the oﬃcial business of the meeting. And I declare the formal portion of
the meeting adjourned. Eric will now come up and make a few remarks. And then
we'll go to Q&A. Eric?

Let's have a video. Thank you, David, very much.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 14 of 38I love that video because I think it shows you where your company is headed. And
where we're headed is to help people live their lives. I don't know that, that was the
original idea that Larry and Sergey had when they founded the company. But it now
informs and drives everything that we think about. And that's what I want to talk to
you about for a few minutes and review a little bit of the things that have happened
in what has been an exceptional year for the corporation.
We had this sort of notion that we would give people the answers that they needed
whenever they wanted. But we then added this notion of trying to address the life
challenges of literally billions of people. And you see this in everything we do. And
what's happened is that the company has become this sort of source of optimism in
an otherwise diﬃcult world or challenging world, at least as I perceive it, because it's
a natural consequence of wanting to help people and help people make their lives
better.
When I think about my own beliefs, for example, I believe very strongly that science
and critical thinking matter, right, that it's important that we state those principles
right up front. And that it is possible today, because of the technologies I'm going to
highlight, to invent things that will substantially change the world for the better,
right? Not in small ways but in extraordinary ways. And I think that they are very
much coming. It's sort of deﬁned as limitless imagination because of a technological
opportunity.
And we're in an era of almost limitless communications and information, which is a
huge change for all of us in our lifetimes. And I think, as a result, we can solve some
very, very profound problems. And there's no industry in the world that is as brutally
competitive and brutally dynamic as the technological industry globally. And we're
in the middle of this. And we're -- we win some and we lose some, right. But the
important point is that, that competition, sort of the raw capitalistic competition,
along with the innovation, is driving these platforms, these inventions, these things
which solve people's problems and, of course, ultimately deliver shareholder value.
To me, the most undertold story is the story of the genesis of Alphabet. We've
deliberately focused on the companies rather than Alphabet. And I wanted to spend
at least a minute telling you about Alphabet. I felt so strongly about this that in the
new version of How Google Works, we added a whole chapter on How Alphabet
Works, right, available for $9.99 from your favorite online bookstore using Google
Play.
The -- in August, it's two years since we adopted Alphabet. And to me, the genesis of
Alphabet is a meeting that Larry and Sergey and I had about a decade ago where
we ﬂew -- technically, I ﬂew them, shocking, to Omaha. And we visited with Warren
Buﬀett. And I remember sitting on, I think, the 14th ﬂoor and being struck by the
extraordinary success of his model with one ﬂoor, right, that he had ﬁgured out a
problem that had bedeviled all of us in our industry for years, which was how to
establish scalability, right? And he had a particular formula, which was the
independence of the companies, strong CEOs, independent operation and strong
branding of those corporations.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 15 of 38So 2 to three years ago, when it was clear that the company's ambitions were well
beyond the traditional deﬁnition of Google, we kept going back and back and back
to this sort of principle that you need genuine autonomy. And Larry would say over
and over again, let's think about how do we solve this in a structural way. All of these
things that companies do are -- they're sort of half solutions. But there is one solution
that we know works well in capitalism, which is boards, shareholders, CEOs and
independent. And you see that in capitalism today.
So what's interesting is that with this idea, right, formed a decade ago, we started
with Alphabet. And we began the process of creating these corporations. And this
structure, I think, is at the beginning. And I am convinced that the structure that Larry
and Sergey adopted, right, as the sort of next structure of the company that they
founded, where a small team has helped architect, in particular Ruth and David
working with them, has really built a sort of corporation scaling mechanism that
we've never seen in the world. So my bet is that the traditional lessons of business
organization will, in fact, result in success at Alphabet over time and to the beneﬁt of
all of us.
And there are reasons why this structure is likely to work. And it starts with the fact
that we're trying -- that we're focused on ﬁnding solutions to big problems with the
applications of science and technology, right? Again, it goes back to that fact that
science matters and that facts matter and that technology matters and that this
structure that I'll highlight is helping the entrepreneurs that we've either promoted
or brought in to create these corporations with the kind of global impact that
Google had in its early years. And we're beginning to see that. It's tantalizing to me.
But in order to make that happen, we had to have a strong leader and a strong
structure for Google. And indeed, that person is Sundar. And I think -- we don't need
to go on and on about how successful Google as a corporation has been over the
last year under his leadership. But let me give you some examples of things that
we've recently announced.
You saw a lot of innovation at I/O. The Assistant, the ability to do it across devices
and services and ways that you do it. A product called Google Lens, which is a new
way for the computers to sort of see what's going on, again, with your permission,
that you can then use to understand things going on around you. When you use
Google Home, right, this interesting little device, you're using a supercomputer of
analysis and knowledge around -- about the world around you. And this is version 1.
Imagine what version 2 will be and version 3 will be as we get more and more
capable of making your lives more powerful.
So all sorts of new hardware devices. We are very excited about all the Pixel products
that we announced. And we have more than 2 billion monthly active devices at
Android, right? So it gives you a sense of the scale and touch and reach that Google
now has with Android.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 16 of 38On the machine learning side. And when Sundar came in, he took the older phrase,
my phrase, mobile ﬁrst. And he said the new phrase is AI ﬁrst. He said let's use
machine learning and intelligence to make our systems smarter throughout. And
over and over again he said, let's be the world's leader in the most emerging
technology in computer science in 50 years, speaking as a computer scientist who's
been doing it for about 50 years. It's that important.
We recently announced something called AutoML. One of the problems with
machine learning is that it's a very complicated thing to understand. It's hard for me
to even understand it. And I have a PhD in this area. But by building tools that
generate neural networks automatically, the sort of more traditional person, the
more traditional person just trying to solve a problem can ﬁnd these models
generated for them automatically. This requires invention and investment in
computation and algorithms at a scale that's hard to describe. But this is where your
shareholder investment in capital and those data centers is allowing us to literally
have neural networks design other neural networks.
This autogeneration is a core part of a strategy that we talk about internally called
learning to learn. How do you learn how to think, or can the computer help you in --
at the scale we're doing it?
In translation, we used neural machine translation and had a huge improvement in
entire sentences rather than just in phrases. We're working with Stanford to use
TensorFlow, which is the underlying open source platform for this, runs on all the
interesting hardware, including our competitors', to detect skin cancer as well as or
better than dermatologists. So again, in the future, when you go to the
dermatologist, your dermatologist will have something to make sure that they're
giving you the right diagnosis that might be slightly better than he or she.
If you take a look at YouTube, more than 1 billion hours of watch time per day. We
launched YouTube TV for the people who don't have traditional television service
but they have an Internet. They can now watch the majority of television programs on
top of their Internet connection. It's the next step in over-the-top. It's interesting, we
used machine learning, there we are again, AI ﬁrst, thanks to Sundar, to automatically
caption over 1 billion videos in 10 languages, making them accessible to the more
than 300 million people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Again, think about it from
their perspective, how we changed their lives. I could not be prouder of the impact
that we've had on that.
Think about Google Photos, my current obsession, uploading all my pictures and
videos of my life. We have more than 500 million users of Google Photos now. And
we're uploading more than 1 billion photos per day. And I predict that number will
only go up.
In cloud, we've decided to make a major investment in cloud. Cloud is important to
us for many, many reasons, both strategically as well as business and competitive
and so forth in that marketplace. But for example, we hired an incredible computerFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 17 of 38scientist named Fei-Fei Li to lead our AI machine learning for cloud. That will be one
of our great diﬀerentiators. We're doing all sorts of interesting APIs. We've designed
these hardware accelerators. They're called Cloud TPUs. Think of it as a specialized
computer that can do this computation incredibly fast. And when I say incredibly fast,
I mean much, much faster than the fastest computers that have been available today.
Let's have a -- so just to ﬁnish on Google. Google has had an extraordinary year
since we met. And I think a lot of that has to do with the coalescing around the
missions that I've just described. And I'm sure that it will continue to do well.
Let's switch. Let me show you a video about Loon. We've talked about Loon before.
This is a very good example, right? Thank you very much. This is a very good
example of Googlers who just saw a problem, saw a technological solution and saw
a way to make some progress on something that will aﬀect a lot of us. Loon is now
operational and running well in those areas. And it's a good example of how nobody
else could solve the problem and this new technology could do so. We are, of
course, as a result, getting a great deal of learning as we learn how to ﬂy around Peru
in terms of balloon-to-balloon communication and those sorts of things that will
continue.
Let me mention -- I'll mention a few more. And then we'll go ahead to questions.
Waymo. Waymo graduated from X in December. We have one of the cars outside.
It's a rare event for people in California to see these cars for various boring legal
reasons. And so I encourage you to take a look at it. We did this huge partnership
with Fiat Chrysler. We've got another 500 Paciﬁca minivans for a total of 600. And
we are -- we've done more than 3 million miles of fully autonomous driving as of
May. We have this incredibly entertaining program called the Early Rider Program in
Phoenix, where we picked a set of families and we provide them essentially
automatic driving to watch how families actually use cars, right, on the theory that we
should do some beta testing with actual families in Arizona. And we'll see how that
goes. So far, they're doing well. And we've done a big partnership with Lyft as our
next (inaudible). Much more to come in the next relatively short period of time.
Verily, our life science business. We're doing a baseline study of human health. It's
important to remember that we're all the same as a medical matter. And the baseline
study of how people's health, both sort of locally as well as with a disease and so
forth and so on, varies over time. We're doing that with Stanford and Duke, to map
the health of 10,000 individuals to, again, build the data to begin to do the machine
learning, to do the kind of prediction that's now possible. Again, there's that AI ﬁrst
principle.
We're doing something with Nikon around retinal images of diabetes, related eye
disease, diabetic retinopathy. It's a disease that aﬀects a lot of people in the
developing world. Literally many, many millions of people go blind because of this.
We think we can detect it just like that. Wow, that's amazing.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 18 of 38With Sanoﬁ, we've announced -- diabetes, of course, can be a huge problem
globally, not just in the U.S.. But around the world. For example, 51% of the people in
China are thought to be prediabetic at this point. So we've got a national, global
health problem. There's a big opportunity to solve problems and build a business
there.
With GSK, we announced a joint venture called Galvani to help develop
bioelectronic medicine, where we use electronic detection of certain kinds of things
that are going on to, again, detect early kinds of diseases in your body. They will do
well, in my opinion.
Nest has, of course, just announced. Nest Cam IQ, which is a piece of software with
Nest Aware that can apply facial recognition that can help you understand if there's
someone unwelcome in your home. Probably a pretty good and useful technique for
all of us.
Over and over again, Calico, Sidewalk Labs, the ﬁber projects are all basically
working on this core principle of excelling technical innovation.
If you think of Alphabet as innovation through business organization, an important
bet which I think will ultimately serve as a marker for the next 100 years in how
corporations at scale should operate, you're also going to see the innovation in each
of the corporations. You have invested, in my view, in a truly revolutionary company
in the form of Alphabet. If I go back to the 2013 Founders' Letter, Larry and Sergey
wrote that incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance over time because
change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary.
We have taken the position that with this structure and with this kind of innovation,
we can bring revolutionary beneﬁts to billions of people globally. I am so proud to
be in front of you to represent the many people and companies that are part of the
Alphabet, who I can tell you are all committed to this broad mission. Our goal
remains the same: serve billions of people and help them live better.
I have been privileged to be here as part of this 16 years. The company is 18 years
old. We're tackling the most important and hardest problems, the most impossible
problems that you can imagine, to have the greatest impact on the greatest number
of people. I want to thank you all for your support to make the impossible possible.
And thank you very much.
We have a good amount of time. And I always look forward to your comments,
questions, thoughts. And it is my privilege to -- let's see, we have Ruth Porat, who I
think everybody knows, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer; David I've
already introduced; and Kent Walker, who's the General Counsel and many other
functions, including all of PR and policy in Google. So I think between the 4 of us we
can probably answer questions or comments.

Alzheimer's all have the property that it looks like machine learning could make
healthcare progress there. And those diseases, in particular Alzheimer's, is a $1

{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
Let me take that one. Welcome back, John. Obviously, the topic is a very important
one. We take the issue of human sex traﬃcking very seriously, as we do the abuse of
our systems with child sexual abuse imagery. We've taken a variety of steps to try
and combat this problem throughout society. We've invested in and funded a
number of groups that are working on the problem. We've hired people at Google
to work on the question of human rights advocacy. And our engineers have actually
worked with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other
groups around the world to develop tools and technologies to identify and help
them combat and get to the root of some of these rings that are at the issue of this.
Now when you raise the question of Section 230, we think that the Congress, when it
formed 230, was actually striking a blow in favor of the ability of good samaritan
review by Internet platforms. You don't want to create liability for review of platforms.
And we think Congress got that balance right. We continue to think it's a robust
platform for the kind of innovative stuﬀ we've been able to do on top of our

My name is Eric Sprague [ph]. I'm a shareholder from the Sacramento area. And I'm
wondering about your plans in the online travel space for the next few years. I think
Oliver Heckmann at the Skift Forums had said that you don't plan on becoming an
online travel agency in the near future. But as you enter spaces directly, it would
aﬀect some of your biggest customers like the PriceLine Group, where I'm also a
shareholder. And also, as you enter new spaces, it's a balance of organizing
information. But there was a recent Reuters story about the -- what might be an
upcoming ﬁne from the EU in the shopping space. So I was wondering, like with
spaces like travel, as you think about entering them more directly, how you calibrate
all these factors.

A - Kent WalkerSo as you allude to the question of some of the antitrust investigations that are going
on, let me take that one. I think our general policy has been to try and look for areas
where we can deliver the most beneﬁt to the most number of consumers around the
world. We try and provide streamlined experiences that are faster and more
comprehensive. Travel is one area, where Google Flight Search has delivered
phenomenal value to consumers. We continue to look for opportunities to do that.
And we think that we are in an extraordinarily competitive market with a number of
large and small platforms in the U.S. and around the world. And that we've actually
been remarkably successful over the last decade reducing consumer prices,
improving the quality of oﬀerings and improving consumer choice. So that's been a
dramatic improvement in social welfare. So we think that's been a very good thing.
So do you see yourselves getting involved more directly like with the Google Trips
app and those types of tools?

Hi. Good morning. I'm still Justin Danhof, still from the National Center. I'd be remiss
if I didn't say your tie looks very nice, too, Mr. Schmidt. I had a quick question about
the company's diversity and inclusiveness initiatives. When the company takes public
policy positions, does it consider all of its employees? What I mean by that is when,
for example, the company publicly opposed President Trump's position on
immigration, right? The company opposed the President's decision to withdraw from
the Paris Accord quite publicly. The company also recently opposed decency
legislation in the State of Texas.
While the executive suite likely consists largely of more -- of the liberal elite mindset,
surely the company employs a few conservatives who would rightfully view all of
these actions as oﬀending their worldview and their public policy positions. So when
you take these publicly -- these very public positions, are you concerned that
conservative employees here or libertarian-minded employees here at Alphabet and
Google, that they don't feel that this is an inclusive environment for their opinions
because they know that the hierarchy doesn't share their values?
{BIO 1451572 <GO>}
I would start with my answer, which is we start from the principles of science at
Google and at Alphabet.

with our employees in the way we are able to provide employee beneﬁt programs,

David?
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Yes, I would just say that these positions that we're taking are not -- these are not
partisan positions. We're not in the middle of the political fray. These have to do with
principles that we've long held at the company. And we've got folks of various
political stripes who believe in those principles. And so I think what you see is not
our attempt to jump on the scales for one political party or another. But to express
things that are very deeply -- very important to the company, whether it's free
expression or whether it's the openness of -- we have lots of folks at Google from all
over the world. And we took a stand to protect them. Many of them were personally
aﬀected by what was going on with that policy that I think you referred to. And so I
think our employees were very strongly behind taking these positions because they
reﬂect a principle, not partisanship.
I just want to sure you don't redline the fact I work in the D.C. conservative circles.
And your applications for your public policy teams, many conservatives in D.C.
would never even consider applying to this company because they wouldn't feel
welcome. I just know that as...

freedom of expression, diversity, inclusiveness and science-based thinking. You'll
also ﬁnd that all of the other companies in our industry agree with us.

citizens of China with our services. It's a complex area and it's one we continue to
explore.
{BIO 1451572 <GO>}
And I was in China this past week as part of our AlphaGo tournament where we had
a joint program around man versus machine in the Go game, which was successful, I
think, on all parts. And we also did a great deal of education around AI in China. It
was very impressive.

No problem. No oﬀense taken. I just wanted to ask. My name is Tony Lavia [ph] and
I'm a stockholder. I wanted to ask about the area of augmented reality. I didn't hear
very much, if anything, about that. And I wondered, it seems to be a fairly promising
area with a lot of people competing. So number one, what is the strategy for making
products in that area? What do you see, maybe some of the high running ones that
we might see that aren't just going to be Pokémon games? And two, how will you
compete against, say, Apple, who controls both the platform and the software, which
Google does not do. So far?

So our augmented reality area is part of the virtual reality area. And going back to
Eric's opening comments, I think one of the very fascinating elements of innovation
at Google, now Alphabet, started with what we call the 20% time. And the ﬁrst virtual
reality eﬀort came out of that in cardboard. And that has grown into our virtual
reality/augmented reality eﬀort. We're really excited about the direction it's taking.
You're absolutely right; it's not just about games. We think there's a broader set of

So now go chase down Berkshire. A few years ago, several years ago, an interesting
question was asked. And I thought it had an interesting answer. And the question
was, if Google were a person, in terms of development, what grade would that
person be in? And the answer, I believe, that came from one of the founders was the
third grade. And I thought, that's a pretty precocious 8-year-old. So as you're
beginning to enter your third decade as a public company, I would ask that same
question again. If Alphabet were a person, what grade would we or would that
person be in?
{BIO 1451572 <GO>}
This is a Ruth question.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
I would say we maybe are now in fourth grade.
{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
Exactly.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
But we're still very, very early. And that's what so extraordinary. I mean, when you
look at Google, I'm often asked what's my biggest surprise coming here, having now
been here two years. And the answer is how early we still are. Eric talked a lot about
machine learning and the importance of it. You saw in the video what the Assistant
will be doing for us, opening up ways of query that we didn't have before and the
opportunity to provide more eﬀective responses, to use recommendation engines
with YouTube, to help us as we're moving into the cloud and the opportunity there,
all that we're doing with hardware, all that we're doing with YouTube subscriptions
suggest that Google has quite a long runway ahead of it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

Well save some money for college. Thank you. Yes, sir?
My name is George Beyon [ph], Beyon Capital Partners Private Equity. And my
question is, with the new administration oﬀering to repatriate capital back to the U.S.,
what's Google or Alphabet's stance on that, since they have $50 billion plus in
capital? And -- well, I have another one.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So one of the key questions, I think, when we look at cash is what's the most eﬀective
use of that cash for shareholders. And as we look at it, we go back to our core
principles from day 1, which is we have been and remain committed to long-term
growth. And the most exciting opportunity, really building oﬀ of the prior question, is
all of the areas in which we can invest. And so we're ﬁrst looking at the organic
investment opportunities.
We also have a great history of acquisitions, things like YouTube or DoubleClick,
Maps, where we've really done things which at the time seemed crazy but have
worked out quite well for everyone. And so that is another area where we're
considering uses of cash.
And when we look at the overall potential requirements, we then ask the question,
what else might be available with cash? And we were pleased to have been able to
start doing the modest share repurchase program. But when we look at globally that
cash, it doesn't change the overall arching objective, which is investing in the
business, investing in the growth opportunities, whether that's organic or through
acquisition, to enable us to continue driving the types of growth that you've seen.
There's too many opportunities out there. And so where it actually is has not been
really the constraint. It's really what's the opportunity set.
And would Google ever consider 1 share of Google for 1 share of Apple, since Apple
does have $250 billion of capital that could be repatriated?

Hi, Natasha Lamb with Arjuna Capital. The company has paid lip service to the
gender pay gap, says that it's not an issue. But it's been unwilling to give a
quantitative disclosure, to give that number that so many of Google's and Alphabet's
peers have given. The company has also been unwilling to dialogue with us since
last year when we had begun what we thought was a productive dialogue. So the
company has gone quiet, despite the fact that last year's vote on this proposal from
non-insider -- from the non-insider voting block was 48%, which I think is pretty
remarkable for outside shareholders from a voting standpoint.
So one, I would ask that we continue the dialogue. And two, I'm curious if Google is
willing to join its peers in providing those transparent quantitative disclosures? And
if this is not an issue, if the issue is moot and women are paid 100% of what men are
paid, then can you say 100%? Because what investors are looking for are those
transparent quantitative numbers that we've seen your peers give as well. Thank you.
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
As you probably have seen, we're currently in litigation with the Department of
Labor over some issues related to this. We feel very strongly that gender pay equity
is an important principle at Google. We run internal surveys on a regular basis. And
we do believe we pay equally across genders throughout the company. So we're
continuing to make progress on that. We've said that publicly. So that is in itself a
form of disclosure of where we think we are. But we're always happy to talk more.
And we'd be happy to chat after the meeting to continue that dialogue.
{BIO 18796096 <GO>}
Thank you. And I appreciate that. I mean, last year certainly you weren't under
investigation by the Department of Labor and our dialogue went quiet. So I would
appreciate that continued conversation. Thank you.

One of our traditions is we produce the actual expert when a hard question is asked.

Good morning. I'm Prasad. Today I'm a Vice President in our people operations
organization. And one of the functions that I have responsibility for is compensation.
Pay equity is one of our most important tenets that we look into when we think about
compensation. And all of our pay practices are designed such that no demographic
information is ever taken into account. It's all about skills and capabilities. But in
addition to that, we also go through rigorous analysis every year to make sure that
we are living up to the principles that we hold very dear. And last year, around this
time, we published externally that our aggregate analysis showed that there is no
gender pay gap.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

went into in-depth analysis of 52 diﬀerent jobs at Google. We went into really, really
gory detail out there and found that for every one of those, again, we did not see any
gender pay gap, which Eileen Naughton, who heads up people operations, recently
published in a blog post externally as well. So we feel that we are really committed
to this and absolutely conﬁdent in our processes. Thank you.

Okay. Thank you, Prasad. Let's see. Continuing to add my -- correct for my error. Yes,
sir?
I'm Dan Gluesenkamp. I'm the Executive Director of the California Native Plant
Society. I'm a shareholder. And you might recognize CNPS, the Native Plant Society.
We've designed the native plant pallet for the landscaping that's coming in here for
the pollinator your gardens. That was one of our local chapter projects. We've got 35
chapters covering California and Baja California. And I just want to talk a little bit
about kind of the great repository of information that is untapped in California, this
biodiversity hotspot. We also have a super bloom. The plants and animals that have
evolved in California, if you can imagine the Alphabet evolution going on for 1 billion
years instead of a decade or so, the information that is coded in there, the ability to
survive various challenges is absolutely priceless. And as we move toward an era
where we can lasso asteroids and drop the price of gold, as we can do anything, the
one thing that we will not be able to do is to develop the information that codes the
genes that those things hold that provide engineering feedstock for what we will
need to do on this planet in the future.
And I want to thank you guys. I want to thank Google for all of the tools that have
been developed that have helped conservationists to try and save some of those
species. It's a globally signiﬁcant biodiversity hotspot. We're really blessed here. The
mapping applications you've built, the Google Earth outreach to put it into the
hands of people have really transformed our ability to, ﬁrst, ﬁgure out what we have.
And then to ﬁgure out how everything is connected.
What I want to ask is, I want to encourage Alphabet to look at this as an incredible
resource, a great opportunity, both a business opportunity to capture the most
valuable information on the planet, extremely inaccessible, coded in a language that
we are only just learning how to read. And yet they're free for the taking, with many
people excited to work on it, being paid low wages. For the price of one stabilizing
spoon, we could probably map the entire ﬂora. And I know that individuals in the
leadership, Eric, Diane, are very interested in saving this stuﬀ, individually, personally
committed. It would be revolutionary if the organization took advantage of this
opportunity that is left lying on the table and actually focused on it in a way to
develop speciﬁc tools to help us understand what biodiversity we have, to try andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

we don't accidentally bulldoze something that has a cure for something in the future.
And get some really positive press for it and potentially start a revolution that bumps
us out of this slow evolution we're facing. So...
{BIO 1451572 <GO>}
So thank you. We've actually had, over the last decade, a number of projects to
provide underlying tools to such research projects. These are generally known as the
code for life projects, because we need to understand the biodiversity, not just at the
plant level. But at sort of nature's level. And it advances science in really fundamental
ways. We've not made the vertical tools that you're describing. But I think it's a good
idea, for both us and also for private philanthropists.

drawbacks and consequences of creating such a powerful and omnipresent
corporation?
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
So there's been a lot of talk about sort of the rise of tech platforms generally. We
think it's actually, on balance, been a remarkable opportunity for people to have
access to information that they never would have had access to before, typically for
free, in many of the services and projects that we provide. And it's opened up new
opportunities for competitive marketplaces at the same time, empowering not just
consumers. But small businesses to be able to come on and sell their goods and
services around the world. So that, on balance, has been a really powerful and
positive development.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

My name is Andrei Crandall. I'm a junior at Berkeley High School and a shareholder.
In your annual report, you stated that 80% of your proﬁts come from advertising. You
also said that a risk to this company is online blocks -- blocking software. What do
you plan -- how do you plan on combating this issue?
{BIO 15242895 <GO>}
So we recently announced an eﬀort to use Google Chrome to address some of the
concerns that many consumers have about annoying ads, targeting a small number
of ads that are disruptive to the consumer experience, that are leading some people
to actually using broader kinds of ad-blocking software. We think that's a very
positive development. We're working together with partners across the publishing
industry, the advertising industry. Because it's not a problem that any given company
can solve on its own. It really is making sure that the ecosystem is moving in a
positive direction so that the online browsing experience for consumers is better and
they don't see a need for online blocking software.

good. Quickly, yes, ma'am?
It's Meredith Benton. I want to speak in support of the request around increased
transparency around the gender data. But beyond that, racial, ethnic and religious.
Google works in so many diﬀerent parts of the world where we know there's
entrenched discrimination. And the ability of this company to address those
problems through its data and through its desire to make the world a better place, to
report back to the community at large over what initiatives it's taking internally make
a diﬀerence, how they've made a diﬀerence, what hasn't worked, it's just the

Thank you. Yes, sir?
Hi, my name is Scott Chapman [ph]. Thank you very much for all the great work
you're doing. I have a ﬁnancial question to elaborate a little bit more on capital
allocation, Ruth. Earlier, Eric, you alluded to your meeting -- inﬂuential meeting with
Warren Buﬀett and Berkshire Hathaway. One of the things that Buﬀett does so
ingeniously is come up with the right incentive systems for all of the autonomous
units to incent them to allocate capital, excess capital back to headquarters so he
can reinvest that. When you have cash ﬂow generators and cash users within the
organization, can you share with us a little bit about how -- what you've brought to
the table here in your way of thinking about doing a similar parallel type of thing
with capital allocation, allocating costs of capital to the divisions and how they are
incented to bring back capital and how you prioritize that capital at headquarters?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
I think one of the many beneﬁts of the move to the Alphabet structure was that we
got focused within Google, as Eric described. And then across this portfolio of other
bet companies. And what we've done is really push expenses down to the business
level. So business leaders have a much greater sense of -- much greater visibility
about all the resources that they're using within any particular eﬀort. And quoting
also from Eric's book where he says anchor everything in data and the rest will
follow, that's what we're doing. And it's provided a level of transparency about how
much is being used, what does it look like over a multiyear period. And we've been
working tightly with our leaders on how do you stack rank the opportunity so you
can identify where are there places where maybe we've overinvested, should scale
back, in order to put more weight behind some of the big new opportunities.
But it really -- it starts with data. We announced, as some of you may have seen
within the last year, that we moved from what was called non-GAAP reporting to
GAAP. And I think that it was really profound internally. We heard a lot of positive
feedback from investors. But the beauty of it internally is we're giving great leaders
more visibility about how they're using resources and so they can stack rank where
they want to apply those resources.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThat's true across Alphabet. What's been really extraordinary with this move as well
is the opportunity to work so closely with the founders, looking at how much is
needed within each one of the other bets, how do we shape it so that we set it up to
be as nimble and potent as possible, with very much a philosophy that over-
resourcing can be as counterproductive as under-resourcing.
So it's a lot of iterative work. It's diﬀerent type of businesses than in the Berkshire
family of companies. And it really goes very much to what are -- who's the leader,
what's the mission, what's the scale of opportunity and what are the milestones
along the way to achieve it and how do we make sure we're giving them that runway.
And so it has been, I think, a very productive process.

{BIO 1952796 <GO>}
I would just chime in to say, unlike Berkshire Hathaway, we're mostly dealing with
start-ups and tech start-ups. And so we're trying to replicate that experience for the
great -- the talented technical people and great businesspeople that we're
recruiting. And an important part of that is setting up sort of incentive programs that
-- where people get, if they perform in the other bet, they do very well, as opposed
to being sort of attached to the overall Google or Alphabet compensation plan. So I
think we're trying to replicate that start-up feel as a way to really get the kind of
innovation and great business creation that you see out in the world here in the

Right now it's very diﬃcult to apply for like Google and all these things, like the

hanging around. So what is the best way to connect to the company so that the

Thank you for that question. We're always looking for the most amazing talent, right?
Like all the innovations that Eric and Ruth and Kent and David have talked about
would not come alive if it were not for the people that we have out here. As you
know, we have been recognized as the #1 Best Place to Work in the U.S. for seven
years in a row. That wouldn't happen if we didn't place this kind of a commitment on
ﬁnding and developing and retaining our talent. We get 3 million applications every
year and we hire a few thousand people. So we are more selective than pretty much
any educational institution you can think of. And that does provide its own
challenges. On the one hand, we are blessed that we are such a popular
organization that everyone wants to work. But it does make it diﬃcult for us to go
back and talk to everyone about their applications. Rest assured, though, that with
our people, our machine learning technology, all of that, we're always looking for
who are the best people that should be part of this organization. So we're
committed to that.
Personally I faced a problem with one of the recruiter, like they're just quiet and
they're not updating. So I was just lucky to get that call. But actually it was not well

Actually, I think it's maybe 1/4 of a ﬂoor, a couple -- a few oﬃces. We're actually --
Ruth and I visited the headquarters several months ago in Omaha. And we realized
that our Alphabet staﬀ was actually much, much smaller than Berkshire Hathaway's.
{BIO 1451572 <GO>}
By the way, this is not a goal. Yes. Okay. We have -- sir, it looks like you have the
honor of the -- oh, we have -- would you like one more question?
Mine will be quick.
{BIO 1451572 <GO>}
Okay. So we'll have -- I'm sorry. Did we have somebody on the last -- yes. So we'll
have you, you. And then you'll have a quick question. Yes, sir?
Barry Wood, Washington, D.C. Following from the last question and from Mr.
Chapman's questions about what you said, Mr. Schmidt, about scalability from the
Warren Buﬀett model. Yes. There's only a few people in that. But this is -- Berkshire is
a very diversiﬁed, almost 100 diﬀerent companies spread all over the planet, mostly
in the U.S. You're operating here from one -- essentially one big campus. I don't
understand what you really mean by scalability. I don't think most people who are
not shareholders understand the diﬀerence between the 2 types of shares, or what
Alphabet is vis-Ã -vis the company. And also the question of, aren't you just one big
company with several divisions?
{BIO 1451572 <GO>}
Well again, I can assure you, in the spirit of a quick answer, that we created Alphabet
because we needed at least 26 letters, right. And that each of those letters in the
form of corporations will really be quite independent. And that's my core message, is
that they'll have clear, distinct, diﬀerent ownership, leadership, possibility for partial
investment. We've already done that with Verily. Diﬀerent kinds of incentive
programs, diﬀerent kind of compensation programs, diﬀerent branding, diﬀerent
cost structures. Ruth and David have architected that so that scalability is possible. I
believe that, that will be what Alphabet will look like in 5 or 10 years. That is my
opinion.
Let's see. We have a -- yes, ma'am? Come on up.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-07

A - Eric E. SchmidtMy name is Marion Lowe [ph] from Salinas, California. And it's about Alphabet, the
name Alphabet. Many are wondering why Google to Alphabet. Well I read about it,
how the board chose and why and how it did and it was the most refreshing
enlightenment. Anyway, there are many reasons. But I chose this one, which is
pertinent to my nephew and me. And it's coined Alpha-Bet. Alpha means investment
returned above benchmark. And that's what I like about it. Thank you.
{BIO 1451572 <GO>}
Thank you very much. Thank you for asking your question. Ruth, would you like to
comment?

us any color, are auditors carrying any items on their unadjusted error schedule. And
anything signiﬁcant with that?
