{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
Very happy to have from NVIDIA Colette Kress, the CFO. Welcome, Colette.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you. Thank you very much.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
So I thought maybe a good place to start oﬀ, there's lots of moving pieces to the
NVIDIA story, all in a good direction. So I thought maybe as you look out to next year
maybe you can from a very high level talk about the diﬀerent moving pieces.
Gaming has been a big driver for you but you also have some other areas. We did a
bus tour to talk about the assisted driving, autonomous driving obviously a hot area
as well. So maybe you could just touch on them and then we'll drill down.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That sounds great. To brief everybody in terms of where we are in our overall
strategy and how we approach the market, we essentially take the best-of-breed
technology that we build for visual computing and segment that to four diﬀerent key
markets.
The ﬁrst market to talk about would be gaming. Gaming is our largest part of our
business. It represents more than 50% of our overall revenue and it's grown quite
nicely in the ﬁrst part of this year.
So after three quarters our gaming business is actually growing about 42% year on
year, largely inﬂuenced by the excitement about PC gaming, the production value ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 12the new games that are coming out, the underlying technology and just the entire
social platform surrounding about PC gaming. We've been really, really pleased with
the adoption of our platform, the full ecosystem surrounding gaming that we have
spent a lot of time working to produce a better and better gaming experience for
them. That's one of our key markets.
Our second key market is Pro visualization. So potentially taking what we do from
gaming in terms of graphics and applying it to the key workloads that you have in
the enterprise, workload such as design, what you have in terms of CAD drawing,
building or any other type of prototyping that you may want to do. NVIDIA has
established itself as a leadership position in terms of those enterprise graphics as
well.
The business is really focused on the key applications in the market that use design,
drawing and the rendering needs and we continue to see this as an opportunity for
us to go forward to transform how prototyping and how building and design will
occur in the future, connecting the overall libraries of the prototyping of materials
and that industry such that you can see it just in time in terms of as you are building
those overall products. That business is usually connected to our overall GDP
enterprise type of growth that you see worldwide but again it's a very still healthy
leadership position that we have in that business.
Our third key market is data center. We've talked about a lot of exciting things in the
last month and a half regarding data center and you can really break down our data
center business into three key areas. Both our work in terms of high-performance
computing, supercomputing 2015 was just last month.
A lot of interest in terms of the role of acceleration in supercomputers as we go
forward. A lot of discussion regarding Moore's Law when and should it come to an
end, how are we going to increase the throughput. So necessary for these very large
computers going forward.
Acceleration has become a key component. More than 100 of the top 500
supercomputers in the world now carry out acceleration and 70% of them and use
GPUs. So we continue to lead out of the overall industry in terms of acceleration with
the use of overall GPUs in this space.
Additionally we have seen an emergence of a new disruptive type of technology
associated with artiﬁcial intelligence. So you see hyperscale providers, Internet
service providers trying to produce a key set of applications and use such that they
have trained the overall application to recognize your needs, your wants and provide
new things to you. That overall training environment has been so key in the use of a
GPU to speed up the time, to actually train the overall underlying applications
through that overall server experience. So we have many web service providers all
across the world that you would recognize using artiﬁcial intelligence in that training
environment with GPUs to expand those.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Blayne CurtisWe've also announced a new set of cars that will be able to take that training
environment, also use it in terms of a production environment in true inference of
that same type of work processing images, processing video, processing voice
recognition, voice processing in all types and the use of a GPU in the right form
factor, the right energy eﬃciency has been our concentration working with these
providers. So those are two of our key areas.
The third part of data center is what we do for the cloud. What we've enabled is a
virtualized GPU in the cloud experience allowing that future cloud computing and
the applications that reside back in the data center to be streamed down for any
visual needs and graphic intensive applications to the desktop. So essentially a one
to many type of experience.
This is our GRID platform and you can see our GRID platform both in enterprise use
in terms of expanding the overall collaboration of the global workforce but also what
you see in terms of streaming gaming as we go forward. If you go up to many of the
key public service providers right now you can get the use of a GPU both for the
streaming applications but also you see quite a bit of machine learning also being
used in that streaming environment.
Then lastly automotive. We tend to talk about automotive business our fourth market
right after our data center understanding because it really is the combination of both
our key graphics understanding and taking our graphics capability for gaming and
leveraging that within the center console as well as the future digital clusters that you
see in many of the high-end to midrange cars. We have a unique oﬀering, oﬀering
the best types of graphics, pretty much removing any dial button or any part in terms
of the cars as we go forward but also our focus has been on a center compute for
the overall car as we go forward.
As we are hearing more and more about autonomous driving as we go forward,
autonomous driving and self driving cars, that underlying compute is essentially just
a data center problem very similar to the problems we face already today with many
of the key industries. Putting together an ability to train the overall computer, to
recognize all the things outside of the car, process the information coming in from
what we have from cameras, sensor, lidar, radar into a central computer to serve the
needs of that self driving car is what our key focus is. So those are our four markets.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
There's a lot going on. Maybe just starting on the PC market, gaming, you talked
about the growth rate and you broke the gaming versus OEM out at Analyst Day,
you've updated it for several quarters since. We have a good picture of what the
growth rate has been.
Can you talk about what is really driving this? And if you can talk about what the right
long-term growth rate is?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-09

Page 4 of 12Colette Kress
Blayne Curtis
Colette KressAnd it's interesting at Computex you go to some of these PTAMs and they are
struggling, half their business is gaming laptops now as well. So how big is laptops
as part of the overall gaming pie for you today which I think people would
traditionally think about as a graphics card and maybe some hard-core gamers, how
has that developed over the last couple of years?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So let me break down, when we think about our overall gaming results and our
gaming market it is both an adding card market that you see today where people
are not necessarily purchasing an end-to-end PC to take part in the overall gaming.
They have a PC.
They are updating their experience in gaming by just producing a better GPU for the
games that they want to play. That's been fueling a good percentage of our overall
growth.
You highlighted a key interesting piece which was also notebooks. Gamers they want
to game everywhere. They want to not only be with their PCs but take that to friends
to be in a mobile space and they need a solid GPU for those experience.
So OEM manufacturers working with us have also did models that are truly just for
gaming and are marketed for that gaming population. It has been growing quite
well. In several quarters past it was nearly doubling as a size of the business but it's
still coming from a very small base.
They see this as a focus because so much of the interest regarding those notebooks.
But it got a ways to go to keep up with the overall size of the adding card market in
terms that we have for the data center. Excuse me that we have for all the gamers.
Other pieces that we have there, any type of device where gaming is going to be
we're going to make sure that we're focused on that. Whether that be a tablet. And
we have key devices for that as well, as well as the streaming part of cloud you're
going to see that in terms of our overall gaming results.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
When you look at the discrete card market and driving that customer to buy the next
generation more powerful, can you talk about whether it's moving in terms of the
DirectX upgrades or physics processors, there's been a lot going on in terms of the
gaming which now looks like movies almost in terms of their production value.
What's the right way to think about the cadence of upgrades and has that changed?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
When you think about why we have surrounded this overall industry we've
surrounded it because we see a full ecosystem around the gaming platform that hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 12Blayne Curtis
Colette Kresscontinued to evolve. Those production value of games, our work has been
continuous with software developers in those games to make them more realistic.
When a gamer receives or goes out and purchase an add-in card that experience
comes to life the minute they plug it in, the minute they open up the back of their
computer and start that overall game. We continue to have a relationship with the
underlying gamer, providing them new drivers, new upgrades for all the new games
that are coming out.
We also have a good understanding of what types of games inﬂuence them. They
can improve their experience with the exact same game with just a better GPU.
We have a set of what we call GameWorks which are key designs focused on some
of the harder parts of graphics whether that be ﬁre, hair, smoke, water, very key
things that you see in some of these high-end games that really come to life in work
that we have done exclusively with those game developers to put into place. These
are the things that inﬂuence our gamers to continue to come back to our platform
and allow us to continue to have that leadership share in the overall gaming market.
The rate of upgrades, it's a little hard to determine. I am sure there are absolutely the
enthusiast types of gamers that are coming back every single time but we have put
out a new architecture and new platform.
But it's still a little bit early to see how fast that movement in terms of a refresh cycle
is doing. But we have had tremendous success with our current architecture.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
I do want to ask you, it's not necessarily applications are broader than gaming but VR
is almost an add-on to this gaming experience and I feel you've been going to CES
for now three or four years with not much to look at, maybe drones but now VR is
actually going to have something else to focus on. Still early days. I'm just curious
your thoughts and how does this play into getting your gaming base to upgrade
their capabilities?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. It's a good question. I think the next exciting evolution in PC gaming is
absolutely virtual reality. We're at the forefront in terms of those new games, the new
devices that will enable that VR experience.
Virtual reality is now becoming an experience based on the underlying technology a
great experience. Really is solving some of the really hard problems of the latency in
order to put you into an encapsulated position so that you can have a great
experience has been very key.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 12Blayne Curtis
Colette Kress
Blayne CurtisNow there are many diﬀerent types and forms of VR that you'll probably see coming
out in 2016. But the key ones that we're concentrated on are those that would be
needing a set of glasses with a very, very high-end PC. The high-end PC enables the
keyframe rate that is necessary for a great overall position.
So our work with Oculus as well as also HTC, their recommendations that they're
coming out regarding what type of PC would best enable their hardware that is
coming out is probably one of our top three GPUs that we currently sell from an
overall retail value price. That is a great opportunity for us.
We are probably assured that some have already started that movement and getting
into the excitement of these upcoming releases in 2016. But it is a great opportunity
for us for the upsell and the refresh.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
It's obviously hard to forecast how big this market could be or the trajectory and I'm
not going to put you on the spot with it. But in terms of those requirements for that
generation obviously they're going to have future generations that probably even up
the ante. But in terms of your installed base today, if you were going to buy that
Oculus Rift how much of your installed base could actually even support that today
obviously in rough terms?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, I think upgrading our installed base is a key part of our focus. With our strong
growth rate today we still have a ways to go in terms of upgrading our installed base
and that will be something that we can see. You're correct.
I can't make any predictions in the next year or how many units, what kind of
upgrades we'll see. I think it's just too early to tell in terms of what supply will be
available. But it is the beginning of I think continuous both content for the VR and
improving the VR experience as we go forward.
It even has the capability of moving beyond gaming as we can see it in many use
cases and prototyping and diﬀerent scenarios in the enterprise as well. So we look
forward to that but it's still a little bit early to tell in terms of how big it will get.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
And I do want to change gears, obviously a lot to talk about here. Auto is probably
easier to handicap you know your wins, you know how big the platforms could be,
maybe timing could move around.
Today the bulk of your revenue is consoles dash applications. Obviously the interest
is in the autonomous applications. Can you talk about how to think about the rampsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-09

Page 7 of 12Colette Kress
Blayne Curtis
Colette Kressof those wins and then talk maybe competitively where you see the opportunities to
gain some more share?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. Currently our business on automotive right now is about $80 million a quarter.
It has also risen about 80% growth over this last year on average.
We'll continue to see growth in this platform. We have 8 million cars on the road
today that have the infotainment systems backed by NVIDIA. And we probably have
a pipeline of more than 25 million more cars that need to hit the road.
So it's safe to say yes, we do see growth. Exactly when and quarter by quarter it's not
a perfect crystal ball in terms of there. But yes, we do have some strong growth for
our automotive business that we can count on.
When we think about our work in terms of autonomous driving and the platform we
seeded our platform with more than 50 diﬀerent OEM manufacturers, researchers
and startups around the world. And the interest was quite high on this platform of
that central compute for autonomous driving. You will hear us talk more about
automotive at CES outside of the virtual reality.
We'll also have a great presentation and talks about our next steps in terms of
automotive in terms of there. But it has seeded that development platform with them
and we continue to work with them on what you will probably see next is just
development services with those individual providers.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
And when you look at your console business, your in-dash business, you had Tesla
put a big screen out and then a lot of people have chased it. When you look at the
performance requirements now they're talking about driving digital dash and it
seems when you go in a car with that it seems to make sense that that's what you
should have. Can you talk about that 8 million going to 25 million, is that based
business you have say of 8 million a quarter do you still see suﬃcient growth over a
longer horizon for that before you start to layer in the autonomous driving?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, I think it will continue to evolve. Our position is really being the best end
graphics that will be necessary for these digital clusters as we go forward. In
Frankfurt at the International Car Show the next piece is essentially a virtual
dashboard. No buttons, nothing. And key companies demonstrating what they see
as their future concept cars.
So we'll continue to stay in the high-end parts of those overall graphics. But what
we're able to beneﬁt right now when we think about those additional cars andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-09

Colette Kressdesign wins is landing at a really luxury lines in the really high-end cars, they are able
to take that same platform and now move it into many of their mainstreams.
And we're beneﬁting from that, maybe even keeping up with competition that they
know that this is a very key selling point the overall technology within the car and
that digital displays are being very well received. So you will see us go into more and
more models as that expands as well is probably that next gen of what infotainment
systems will be going forward.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
We had -- I just had Xonex on stage and there's many semi companies that are
pursuing ADAS or driver assisted, it's one of the only real growing areas in semis for
many. Your solution would be more programmable in terms of being a GPU base
versus maybe a PLD or even on ASSP, maybe you could see a Mobileye it's just ﬁxed
algorithms.
Could you talk about how this. And there's also diﬀerent types. You can have a
Google Plus driving car that may not be what a major OEM deploys. There is still a
lot of moving pieces in terms of --
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
That's correct.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
What is self driving, is it assisted driving. I think Dan talked about one platform where
it will just turn oﬀ after 45 miles an hour. There's obviously illegal and notiﬁcations as
well.
How does the GPU ﬁt in? Is it going to be the early stage and then as it moves to
volume or do you think it maybe moves to a more ﬁxed solution or do you see these
OEMs actually dynamically changing and learning and which would beneﬁt you?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, I think it's correct to assume there's a lot of diﬀerent semiconductor companies
inside of the car. There's probably more than 50 diﬀerent microprocessors, whether
they be single function, two function type service things going on and a lot of focus
on ADAS.
But our focus is the center compute for all of those diﬀerent types of needs and
technology to assist ADAS but really talking about the underlying supercomputer
inside of the car, not necessarily focused on a single function or focused on
eliminating any of those. Those are also going to be necessary car.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-12-09

Page 9 of 12Blayne Curtis
Colette Kress
Blayne CurtisOur strategy is really providing the underlying platform that all of these things can
coexist such that if you remove the driver who do you replace the driver with? That
supercomputer would be that key point. So I think it's a diﬀerent angle than many of
our other peers that we have seen and our approach is really focused on the overall
platform there.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
I did want to ask you, we talked about the growth businesses. You mentioned the
data center and the workstation business also being directed. So obviously it was a
more muted year for everybody this year.
Can you talk about why maybe those businesses were ﬂat or down respectively? And
as you look into next year what type of visibility do you have for those returning to
parity?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes, our enterprise business focused on Pro visualization. If we recall in the ﬁrst part
of the calendar year quite a bit of volatility in terms of macro conditions particularly
around the FX rates. It inﬂuenced in terms of a lot of the channel, the overall
thoughts in terms of pricing worldwide where we saw many diﬀerent changes in
terms of when they would purchase the overall capital that they needed to both
refresh and expand some of that.
So that did take some of the growth out of the overall business as we saw in the ﬁrst
part of the year. We've seen a lot more stabilization of the FX rates, not necessarily a
change to them but the stabilization did produce a little bit better results than we
had thought in our Q3 as well. And we'll stay focused on this but again it is still a
question in terms of will it get back in terms of growth and when that will be.
I can't make any predictions right now going forward into the next year because we
generally just look out one quarter. But that's where we see it's been about ﬂattish or
down a little bit but we'll stay focused on it.
Our data center business, a very strong pipeline of a lot of key areas that we have
seen. Our results both a year ago and early in this year has been inﬂuenced by very
large projects.
The large projects are here. There's the next new large project next year.
It gets to be a little bit lumpy in terms of how that can look. We are conﬁdent that the
data center business will continue to add in terms of strong growth as we go
forward. But these large projects have probably produced a little bit of lumpiness
right now.

Colette Kress
Blayne CurtisI did want to ask you on the gross margins as you look into next year lots of moving
pieces as well. PC OEM was a drag but now it's very small. Gaming is growing and
should deliver a good gross margin.
Can you talk about the moving pieces? Maybe autos, volume could mean lower
margins but I think you're adding a lot of value, over time that could be accretive as
well. Can you talk about the moving pieces?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So we talked about our four markets. We refer to them as our four growth
markets and strategic markets as we go forward. So far year to date in ﬁscal year
2016 our overall revenue growth of approximately 5% so far.
If we just look at our growth markets they are growing more than 25% so far year to
date, even though the overall Company is growing 5%. We still had a piece in the PC
OEM business and the Tegra OEM business. As those become more commodity-
based with not necessarily grow-ish aspects we haven't seen that particularly
growing.
But as you are correct it has become a relatively small part of our business now and
in this last quarter represented less than 10% of our business. We'll continue to watch
it. We'll continue to compete in that business with the right economics for the PC
OEM.
But you will see us concentrate on our four key markets because I think those have
tremendous TAM opportunities in front of us and also have great leadership position
that we have in those four diﬀerent ones. I can't make any predictions in terms of the
next year. We really look about one quarter out.
But again these are great TAM, very exciting markets. Whether that be artiﬁcial
intelligence, virtual reality, or autonomous driving there are many three key
disruptive markets that you see being talked about. And we have an underlying
platform that's able to enable all three of those.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
This is my last question. So we're asking everybody actually what they see as the
disruptive trends and I think you just answered it. As you look into next year you're
actually involved in many disruptive trends.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}

Q - Blayne CurtisI did want to leave a little time for questions in the audience. There's a couple more
minutes if anybody had any.
Questions And Answers
Do you think that accelerated headsets you can have in accelerated GPU in addition
to the PC or the gaming console or whatever device would be?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay, I didn't hear the ﬁrst part of that.
{BIO 15302785 <GO>}
Would you put a GPU in the headset physically?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
You know, it's still early in terms of how to solve the VR, is the overall performance
better if it was actually in the glasses. Right now in the near future I see the glasses
with the overall PC as probably the key focus and I'm sure they'll continue to
improve the overall technology as the VR becomes more of a desire of the gamers.
I just wanted to ask having like two supercomputers in the car, if I take my
supercomputer which will get stronger over time and I have years. So I personally
feel that you only need one and this one I have with me all the time. So why do you
have two powerful chips in a car?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay. So I think you are referencing in our platform that we put together for DRIVE
PX it actually enables two overall SOCs that have incorporated right now. The
question is is two only enough or will it actually get you need even more. Given all
the functionality that we will need to occur, all the parallel processing and the dual
support for it being within the car and the need for possible fail over capabilities the
performance actually may get stronger. Not just one, two, there could be multiple in
terms of that underlying computer that generates a self driving car.
Removing the human from the car is a pretty big task of the amount of compute
capability the human being has and the years and years of driving that we have. So I
think you look at it more as that's a very hard amount of thing to replicate. Not
necessarily replicated with one simple little microprocessor, that's a signiﬁcant
supercomputer that's probably necessary.
