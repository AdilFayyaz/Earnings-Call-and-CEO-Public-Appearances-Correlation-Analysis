{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Excellent. Well. Good morning, everybody. Welcome back. I'm Brad Zelnick,
Software Analyst and Equity Research here at CrÃ©dit Suisse. And we are truly
delighted to be joined by Rajesh Jha of Microsoft. He is the enterprise -- excuse me,
Executive VP. I see E and I get confused sometimes. Executive VP of Microsoft's
Experiences and Devices Group.
The format of this presentation is a ﬁreside chat. And I think we've -- in the scope of
Microsoft, we've got a lot of things to talk about today. But maybe just for
introductions sake, maybe we could start with a brief bit of background. Rajesh,
you've been with Microsoft now since the early days, since 1990.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Thanks for dating me, Brad. Okay.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
You're welcome. But I think it's important to recognize the perspective that you have
over time. And again, now is leading up Experiences and Devices that includes
Oﬃce, Devices, Windows client, new experiences and technology and enterprise
mobility management. I mean these are things we touch every day. These are part of
all of our lives.
Can you give us a sense of your journey over the years? I don't want to say all those
years. But you clearly have seen a lot of Microsoft in that time.

Page 2 of 12Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Rajesh JhaYes, sure. I mean, it's been a privilege to be on this journey. I came to Microsoft
straight out of school and have worked with now all the 3 CEOs, Bill and then Steve
and, more recently, with Satya. And my experience mostly has been on the
enterprise side, though, I have also worked in consumer products. And I would say,
the most formative years have been in the last 10, perhaps even 15, where we started
on this vision of productivity in the cloud. Even though the Oﬃce 365 journey, of
which I was in a very early member, started about 10 years ago, Bill had really pushed
us to think about productivity in the cloud. We had a project called (mad docs) about
15, 16 years ago. And some interesting technology came out of that. We didn't take it
to market. So I've been on the cloud and what does productivity really mean in the
world of the cloud for the last 10 or 15 years. And so today, I -- beyond just Oﬃce 365
and productivity and collaboration, I have Surface and I have Windows client, I have
management, security and compliance. So really thinking about the modern
workplace for our customers.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Excellent background. And maybe to speak more about the cloud tailwind. Over the
last 5 or so years, the company has undergone a signiﬁcant shift. And it's proven to
be a signiﬁcant tailwind for Microsoft as a whole. And Microsoft's really embraced a
more collaborative relationship with competitors and open source of like, things that,
I don't know, a decade plus ago we may never have imagined.
Can you talk about how your group speciﬁcally has evolved during that time? And
what that means for connecting with customers and sales functions, all the way down
to your engineering and product teams.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
No. It's a great question. I mean, I do think that the cloud has enabled us to really
rethink the way we build products. From an end user perspective, if you go back ﬁve
years ago, we were very application focused. We used to think about mail and
calendar and oﬃce and collaboration and real-time communications. Today, we start
with a very strong sense of the user at the center.
All of us live in a world surrounded by devices, surrounded by applications, working
in multiple platforms. And so we started the user at the center. And then we have this
notion called the Microsoft Graph that encapsulates the users' goals, their projects,
who they work with, the documents they work on, the devices that they use. And so
we start with that as a core. And then we build our applications, whether it be Oﬃce
or Teams or video with stream, we make them work cross-platform.
Then ﬁnally, for the Enterprise, we think about management, security, compliance
and identity and knowledge management. So that's the vision, starts with the user at
the center. And it goes from there. Whereas in the past, it really was around
application silos.
So if people ask me what are we doing, how does this help users, it helps because
no matter what application you're on, no matter what device you're on, weFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 12Q - Brad Alan Zelnickunderstand your context, we can be intelligent on your behalf. So that's deﬁnitely the
user-centricity.
The cloud has also helped us to be much more customer-centric in the pre-cloud
world when we had packaged software. We used to build stuﬀ for multiple years,
hand it to customers. And too often, the customers would, because our products are
mission-critical, they would take multiple years to deploy it. And so the feedback
signal for customers would often be years and years after we initially built a product.
Now we get to co-develop with our customers. So when we build new security
capabilities or new knowledge management, we have this Project Cortex that we
talked about last month, which is how do you lock/unlock the enterprise intellectual
property and connect people to people and projects and skills. We are co-
developing that with customers.
And now my product team today takes full accountability, not only to build stuﬀ,
ground in the customer needs. But how do we help customers be successful in
deploying it.
So I run a team called a Fast Track team. That's part of the Oﬃce and the Microsoft
365 team. These are engineers who work with customers. We fund it to help our
customers get to deploy. But deployment isn't enough. So we work with our
counterparts in sales to do -- to help customers successfully deploy this value
through customer success managers. So the entire life cycle, ideation, deployment,
adoption feedback.
Now it's meant changing our sales, too, where our sales force now has to be much
more outcome-driven, much more about the business value and less about
licensing. We are -- our sales force is increasingly starting to think about role-based
productivity. They're starting to think about industry relevance.
And on the partnership front, our customers are going to use multiple vendors,
multiple solutions. And you've seen us work with Apple and Google when we build
our applications on their platform. And of course, I think you've seen the recent
announcement from Salesforce and Adobe on how our clouds connect where it
makes sense. And we have a rich API through the Microsoft Graph that allows other
ISVs to connect to it and add value to customers. So yes, it's been quite the journey. I
mean, the cloud has really accelerated the rate at which we're able to deliver value
and see our customers realize that value than in the business model, the delivery
model of the past age.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
A quick follow-up in terms of the development process and development team. It
would seem that the cloud and other factors have served to compress the
development life cycle today, where things are so much more iterative and having a -
- so much more of a collaborative design and iterative process. I mean, this is a very
diﬀerent model than maybe 5 or 10 years ago.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

I completely agree.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
It's obviously in the end for the beneﬁt of your customers. But just in terms of how
you run the organization and think about engineering, how does that change the
world and the way that you go about it?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
That's a great question, Brad. I mean, culturally, it was a big transformation. When
innovation has a long lead cycle, what you end up having is lots of functional depth
because in -- what I mean by that is you have a product management arm and an
engineering arm and a consulting arm and a sales arm and a support arm because
there's such discrete life cycles in the value delivery chain.
But when you're in a faster pace, these start to compress. So my customers today on
the cloud, they don't care if their issue is a product issue or was it a support delivery
issue or was it a misconﬁguration during deployment. They are buying a service from
us. And so that forces us internally to be much more cross-functional in how we work
and work in a much tighter loop. Whereas in the past, the collaboration between the
diﬀerent functions was really not a core scenario, now it is the core scenario.
My engineers are on-call now. My engineers talk to customers far, far more than ever
before because they must. And actually, to be perfectly honest, they won't have it
any other way now. It was a big shock in the beginning. But I think any time you
make the innovations cycle 10x faster, every process that we have, every process that
any organization has, has to be completely rethought. And we've gone at least 10x
faster in terms of the innovation, if not, on that order of magnitude.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Excellent. Can we dive into some of the products?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes, sure thing. Yes, of course.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
So earlier this year at your Build conference, Satya talked about Microsoft 365 as the
world's productivity cloud. Why are we hearing so much about Microsoft 365 lately?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Our vision with Microsoft 365 is to really have an integrated service that powers a
modern workplace, that powers modern education, that powers a small business,
nonproﬁt. And we want to bring the same vision to consumers we always have. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Page 5 of 12let me just talk a little bit about what our investment pillars are for Microsoft 365,
maybe that will help concretize it.
So ﬁrst, of course, is the delivery of productivity and collaboration services, whether
it be Oﬃce or the newer services like Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Stream. So that's
where the users work together to generate together, to collaborate together, to
communicate together. Another investment pillar for us is how do we take these
systems of engagement, which is Oﬃce and Teams. And how do we help people
automate their business process, connect to their business process. How do we take
systems of records and connect them to this systems of engagement?
So we have a lot of thrust on automation and business process connectivity with
Microsoft Teams and Power Apps. Then from an enterprise perspective, it's about
securing, complying with the regulations, managing your real estate, managing your
data, identity. So that's kind of the investment pillar for us.
But in the end of the day, as the digital transformation is just picking up speed. But
it's still early days, the most important database for most organizations to this graph
of people, their skills, where they work on, the project. How do you connect people
to these relevant business process? How do we get them in the context with their
colleagues who have the right skills? How do we connect them to the relevant
projects? The knowledge management is another core thrust for us. So that is
Microsoft 365.
Now to be honest, about 2, three years ago, what it was, was a licensing construct. It
allowed our customers to buy Oﬃce 365, management and security and Windows
10 as one construct instead of 3 products. Here you had 1 licensing construct. But
now, today, it is an integrated product and increasingly so.
If I'm an end user and I'll launch the Edge browser and I do a search on the browser.
I should -- the search of my enterprise knowledge, the search of my documents,
search with the Internet, should all be the same search well, the same natural
language interface, should work across all of that data.
Today, from a security perspective, the signals that come out from my endpoint, the
signals that come out from my IoT, the signals that came out from my applications,
our identity are integrated. No longer do we have 3 threat protection stories, we
have 1 Microsoft 365 threat protection. It's integrated from an admin perspective, no
longer do you have to go administer the diﬀerent apps and diﬀerent workloads. It's a
Microsoft 365, you go to admin microsoft.com. It's a one way to administer itself.
So Microsoft 365 is really an integrated product or service that underlies the dial
tone for modern work, from communication collaboration to automation, business
process, connectivity, knowledge management and, of course, security
management.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

A - Rajesh JhaNow ﬁnancially, of course, as you would expect, customers who buy into our vision
of Microsoft 365 tend to use more of our services. They tend to have higher revenue
per user, they churn less. And what we oﬀer to our customers is integration, best-of-
breed. But also integrated well together.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
It sounds like a tremendous value proposition for your customer. If we look at the
trends in terms of who's adopting Microsoft 365, what would we notice by industry,
by vertical, by customer size, what have you? And what from what you shared with us
and what was once a licensing construct or go-to-market bundle to today, which is
so much more integrated, what's maybe at the tip of the spear, speciﬁc to that
demographic, driving the value prop for them and the catalyst to adopt?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. Today, as you know, with Oﬃce 365, we have a lot of customers in the Enterprise
are on Oﬃce 365. So many of those customers take a look at that service and then
we have opportunity now to have them take our management or security or
Windows 10 commercial integration points. And so customers like Goodyear, they
were Oﬃce 365 customers. They are now choosing to be a Microsoft 365 customer.
So that's one path that I see our customers
(technical diﬃculty)
Microsoft 365.
But there are customers who today are using Microsoft 365. The one thing I may not
have talked about enough on Microsoft 365 is Oﬃce traditionally has been about
information workers, the people like us. But with Microsoft 365, we are bringing
productivity and collaboration to who we call ﬁrst-line worker.
There are 2 billion people on the planet who are often the ﬁrst to touch a patient, to
touch somebody on a retail ﬂoor or be on manufacturing. And they work with
knowledge better than knowledge shifts or how to do a process, how to
communicate with colleagues. And so we also see customers broadening their
coverage with Microsoft 365 beyond information workers.
So for example, Air France is using that for the ﬁrst-line workers in the transportation
industry. We have Marks & Spencer using Microsoft 365 to get the retail employees
connected with the information workers. And they're connected with each other as
they use Microsoft Teams, which is a conﬁgurable app that brings all the modules
together as a means to go do that.
And so that's another path we see. So Oﬃce to Microsoft 365. We see broadening of
the coverage of the employees that are covered with Microsoft 365. Then we still
have customers continue to move at a healthy clip from on-prem to the cloud
directly into Microsoft 365, from older versions of Oﬃce or Windows.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Page 7 of 12Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Rajesh JhaWe are excited about the Microsoft 365 beyond just the enterprise, the SMB value
proposition where you give them integrated security, integrated collaboration,
productivity is as compelling. And traditionally, with Oﬃce, we haven't had that much
share in emerging markets. But we are excited about what we can do with Microsoft
365 in emerging markets too because Microsoft 365 has great set of applications in
mobile devices. And so there are economies that are mobile-ﬁrst, mobile-only. And
we get to with Microsoft 365 extending to them as well.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
You talked about some of the innovation that's driving this integrated solution
already. But I had in my notes to ask you more about how this is driving the
combined value proposition. One of the topics, I mean, I have written down was AI
and Microsoft Graph to ask you about. But the other was just edge computing. Can
you maybe talk about how that is part of the overall design construct and how you
guys are thinking about Edge as it relates to the overall proposition for the oﬀering?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. Sure. I mean, ﬁrst, let me just talk about the AI part. I'd like -- we go back to what
I was saying, which is we are now user-centered. While user-centered, we are no
longer about applications. So we are able to compute or deliver AI for you, centered
on you, your calendar, your tasks, your projects, your documents. Then diﬀerent
applications will manifest that diﬀerently.
So for example, in Word, if I'm in the health care industry, the spellcheck or the
grammar check or the critiques know the vocabulary, they know the acronyms, they
know the project names in your organization based on the purpose of the graph. So
it is giving you AI, contextual to you, your job, your industry, your speciﬁc company.
And so today, if you take a look at PowerPoint, the ability for it to recommend so
many of the decks that we create so much of the presentations we create are often --
we have some original ideas. We want to take some ideas from some relevant decks,
we want to bring it all together. The AI helps you, suggests, "Hi. if you -- we see the
slide you're working on. And we recommend what are the documents and your
purpose that you have access to may be relevant that you take slides from." And we
measure our success in AI not based on how many ideas we gave to users, how
many times did they choose to keep our ideas. And that relentlessly gets better and
better.
And in Microsoft Teams, for example, if we were in a meeting, automatic
transcription and translation. When Satya does a townhall, we have AI that's able to
split the video into bite-size chunks. So when somebody is searching for a given
topic, they don't get an hour-long video. They get the speciﬁc snippet that is relevant
to their search terms.
I talked about security and compliance. I think, our unique value proposition on
security and compliance, one of the pillars, is the fact that we have 6.5 trillion, 7
trillion signals coming every single day in the graph. Then we have AI that actually
really is trying to think about threat and protection on those signals. So AI permeatesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Q - Brad Alan Zelnickin the Project Cortex and knowledge management is all about applying AI to these
signals.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Got it.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
So that permeates everything. To your point, Brad, on Edge, the Edge computing. I
think we architected that way, both on the Azure Cloud and M365, where we will run
compute on the client where necessary. So our models can run on a client when you
disconnect it or run the service, where it makes sense to overlay your enterprise
models on top of your personal models.
And Oﬃce, Oﬃce has the ability to both be served from the cloud directly in the
browser. But also run as a native application, whether it be on your Windows PC or
your Mac or your iOS or your Android devices. So we'll take compute right where
ever we get it.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Got it. If I can dig into Oﬃce 365 Commercial. At this point, it's a material portion of
the total Oﬃce Commercial installed base, over 65% at the end of ﬁscal '19. But seat
growth is still very strong at 21% year-on-year, at least the most recent quarter. How
should we think about the installed base of O365 Commercial going forward? And
how do you focus on migrating those that are still on-premise versus adding new
seats and balance those 2 growth drivers?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. I don't think it's a balance as much as an and. I talked about the seat growth, the
seat growth continues to come. I feel our growth opportunity here in terms of going
beyond information worker in existing customers. Information workers, connecting
them to the ﬁrst-line workers, connecting the ﬁrst-line workers to themselves and to
the information worker to the business process. That is a driver of future growth in
seats and existing customers.
Then with small businesses, I think we have an opportunity to reach our share in
small business. And we have a lot of room to grow there. I talked about emerging
markets and our ability to have these productivity and collaboration experiences in
the mobile devices. We see that as another growth opportunity.
Then in terms of the customers that are still on-prem or moving to the cloud. We
continue to have enterprise-grade security and compliance features for them. And
we continue to add those. And you've seen recently Bank of Canada has moved
over, as a recent example, as a couple of the capabilities they were looking for is
now available in the cloud.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 12A - Rajesh JhaGot it. Just to switch topics to cybersecurity. Recently, we've just been hearing so
much about security from Microsoft. Obviously, a huge area of opportunity in a large
and expanding market. And in fact, in the last earnings call, Satya talked about
Sentinel and Microsoft Defender, Threat Protection and over 100,000 organizations
using Azure AD Premium. And I recall hearing that Microsoft spends over $1 billion a
year on security-related R&D, which is, for context, is more than 2x a signiﬁcant
security company, like a Palo Alto Networks, which is amazing. How does Microsoft
think about security today across what is a very competitive landscape?
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
Yes. It's a good question, Brad. So let me just start by telling you what we see as the
customer context today. First, I feel there's -- today, I was just talking to a customer
prior to this meeting. And they were telling me they have over 150 security solutions.
And that's not atypical, where if you have these many solutions, it doesn't make you
more secure. You have 150 diﬀerent applications telling you about incidents and
alerts and threats. I mean who's going to stitch it together? Which one is important,
what do you really look at? And so the fragmentation of the signals, the
fragmentation of the diﬀerent lenses doesn't make you more secure, even as the
need continues to grow.
The intellectual property creation, which is really what's happening with the digital
transformation, whether it be code or data, whether it be documents, whether it be
business processes. That is what needs to be protected. It's too fragmented to be
protected today.
Most of the -- I think that one of the statistics I remember was 80% of the content
that exists in the organization today is not even classiﬁed. So you don't even know
what the risk proﬁle is on those things. We're in the early days of this transformation.
The other thing that we see is where the rate of change is incredibly fast right now in
our organization. But still the early days where the traditional perimeter is
disappearing, the network perimeter. People bring their own devices, there's IoT
proliferation. The data generation, code generation of an organization continues to
grow.
Then the -- you take a look at the talent that is available with our customers. So
actually reason why these signals do drive security, there's a huge shortage of
people who can do security incident management, who can do this kind of analysis.
So our vision with security, I would say, ﬁrst, we want to make sure we build best-of-
breed. They're well-known categories, whether it be endpoint management, whether
it be (STEM), whether it be identity. We want to be best-of-breed in these core
categories. But we also want to be deeply integrated because you go back to the
fragmentation. It's not just enough to be best-of-breed. We want to be best-of-breed
and integrated.
Second thing is we want to build security close to the data, close to the applications.
But we want to also extend that to the fact that there is heterogeneity in a customer'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Q - Brad Alan Zelnick

A - Rajesh Jhaenvironment. So for example, data leakage protection is built in the core workﬂows
in Oﬃce. But we allow connectors to bring in non-Oﬃce data to apply the same
policy for data leakage protection. The same thing we do on threat protection. So
built-in. But extensible.
The third thing, which I feel is like, I was saying earlier, we have 6.5 trillion signals
every single day from identity, from endpoints, from applications that we can run
cloud-scale AI on. And so again, with connectors, we can have customers bring their
other signals into this graph that we can reason over.
And ﬁnally, we are not going to solve it all, our customers are going to have multiple
solutions. So we have something called the Intelligent Security Graph, where we
allow customers to plug their other signals in, others ISVs. We have over 50 partners
today that enter oﬀ with the Security Graph.
So we are taking a holistic look at security. But I would say, security is just one
dimension. There's security, then there's compliance. And by compliance, I mean
privacy, I mean insider threat risk management. 80% of big breaches tend to be
insider risk, insider threats rather than outside in. And so how do you classify data,
how do you then protect it, how do you overlay the right policies. So security and
compliance. And of course, identity is a core plane that enables these things.
And ﬁnally, management and security have to integrate, too. Because if you get
signals from the securities, the security signals tell you about some exposure across
a vast range of the devices, the enterprise, the management plane should be able to
take those signals and how to remediate those things. So we have an expansive
view.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Rajesh, a half hour goes by pretty quickly when having an interesting conversation. I

Maybe 10 years ago, the atomic unit of productivity was what we, as individuals,
could go do. Not true anymore. The atomic unit of product right now is group. None
of us do anything meaningful just by ourselves. We do this in the context of working
with others. So the Microsoft Teams -- our vision with Teams is like a meta operatingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2019-12-03

Page 11 of 12Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Rajesh Jhasystem is (ﬁsh). It's something that is centered on a group and the applications come
to the group, the right applications come to the group.
Today, the way we compute is we -- whether on your phone or your tablet or your
desktop, you pick an application, you're trying to get your job done there then you
collaborate from within the application. You jump from applications to applications.
The Teams' vision is you go to the group that you're trying to do a project on,
whether the group is -- an org group, whether it's a project group. And then the right
application should come into the group. So Teams, we think of that as the shell that
brings in chat, that brings in meetings that brings in telephony, that brings in Oﬃce,
that brings in third-party applications, that brings in business process. Because if you
take a look at the UI for Teams, you can extend, just like the browser-over-the-tab
metaphor, you can bring external applications, the right applications for the right
group. And that also carries over to the mobile device.
The mobile device, today, an IT can conﬁgure what module -- say, if I'm a ﬁrst-line
worker in Marks & Spencer, perhaps the application that show up in Teams, that shell
-- if Teams is a shell, I have chat, I have my scheduling module, I have the module
that will take a look at my task list. But I don't need to see the meetings module. The
Teams is like a shell that brings productivity oriented at a group.
Our vision with Teams is it's as applicable to information worker as to ﬁrst-line
worker. It is about productivity. But it's also connecting to business process. And we
are very committed to making Teams a powerful platform that allows third-party
applications to connect in, just as we've connected Oﬃce into Teams.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Very helpful perspective with just a little bit of time left. We are ﬁnancial analysts at
the end of the day or at least I am. Wanted to ask a question about margins, Oﬃce
365 margins in particular. We've heard you talk about O365 margin moving towards
steady state with moderating improvement once the business hits low-70s gross
margin percentage. Where are we in that journey? And can you talk about the
diﬀerences in margin structure that serve O365 versus a more typical born-in-the-
cloud SaaS oﬀering.
{BIO 20129196 <GO>}
First of all, I'll just say O365 is born-in-the-cloud SaaS oﬀering. But I have a couple of
thoughts on that. First, if you take a look at the scale of O365. I think last quarter,
Amy and Satya talked about us having more than 200 million active users. Now if
you take 200 million active users, a service that has that many users. And you ﬁnd a
sliver, which is even in our service, the 200 million, you pick some service with 2
million users, its margin proﬁle is going to be diﬀerent than the margin proﬁle of
something like mail or documents where the storage, there's a real cost of the
storage. So O365 or M365 is such a broad set of services across so many users, that

A - Rajesh JhaWith that, I feel very -- I feel we are hard at work on the engineering side, with our
Azure colleagues to continue to drive the COGS down and increase the margin. But
there's counter pressure. Our customers are using more and more of our workloads.
AI is a resource-intensive investment. But we are ready to make that investment to
give value back to our customers.
Now as you know, E5, our premium oﬀering for customers where we have security
and compliance in the phone system, we're going to continue to add new value into
that with analytics and knowledge management and Project Cortex, that increases
the ARPU and gives us higher margins.
So there's a lot of things at play here. Some workloads have a diﬀerent COGS proﬁle
than others. We continue the engineering work. AI and consumption is a counter
pressure. Then we have premium oﬀerings that continue to increase the margins.
