Hi. So we're going to go ahead and get started. My name is Sharon Zackﬁa and I'm
pleased to have with us today from Starbucks Scott Maw, CFO. And JoAnn
DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations.
With more than 20,000 worldwide locations, Starbucks remains very much a growth
story with annual unit volumes now at all-time highs in the US even as development
has reaccelerated and the company has posted 17 straight quarters of 5% or better
comp gains.
Starbucks' international prospects are robust from over 6,000 locations today with
China now Starbucks' second largest market outside of the US in store count. And
the company remains fairly early in optimizing its acquisitions of Teavana, La
Boulange and Evolution Fresh.
Before turning the podium over to Scott, I'm required to tell you we have a complete
list of research disclosures and potential conﬂicts of interest on our website,
williamblair.com.

Thanks, Sharon. And good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us as we talk
a little bit about the Starbucks growth story this afternoon. First thing to point you to
is just forward-looking statements. You can look at this on our website as well. And
before I really dig into the growth drivers, just a little bit of historical perspective on
Starbucks' performance. So as you can see, over the past several years we've had
double digit revenue growth, we're on track for 10% plus this year. And that's really a
long term target that we try to stick to. We're going to talk a little bit about the
building blocks around that revenue growth.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-11
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 2 of 10Operating margin has consistently expanded over the past few years and I would
point out particularly in FY12 we did see operating margin expansion despite a
signiﬁcant amount of coﬀee cost headwinds and we'll talk about that a little bit. And
as we think about coﬀee pricing, obviously where coﬀee prices are today, we believe
we have the ability to continue to earn through coﬀee price headwinds and we'll dig
into that a little bit more.
Global comp sales growth, Sharon mentioned this. But we target mid-single digits.
You can see we've been between 6% and 8% over the last few years and earnings
per share growth, again, in the high teens to low 20s and we anticipate a similar
number this year. And getting to that speciﬁcally. So for FY2014 we expect EPS
growth in the neighborhood of 20% to 22%. Long term EPS growth we target at 15%
to 20%. Long term revenue growth at over 10%, ROIC north of 20%. And we've done
a number of things over the last few years, if you took a look at our balance sheet
and cash ﬂow statement, you would see a signiﬁcant reduction in working capital
and a signiﬁcant contribution to operating cash ﬂows for our working capital
improvement. And total shareholder return, three consecutive years north of 30%. So
very much a growth focused story for Starbucks.
You might ask yourself the question, Starbucks had $15 billion in revenues last year,
will have over $16 billion in revenue this year, how do we keep the growth going?
How is double digit growth and that kind of margin expansion and earnings growth
possible? And the answer really is on this page. So in addition to all the eﬀorts that
happen every day, with our partners in the store, with what we do with coﬀee which
is the foundation of everything we do, we have many layers of growth drivers. And
I'm going to talk to some level of detail about each of these today. I won't read them
now because we're going to go through them individually. But it's really these
eﬀorts. And again, the daily eﬀorts of our partners in the stores, that drive that
continued growth story and continue to drive the types of returns that we've all
enjoyed.
So with that, I'll start with new store growth. We have 1,500 new stores targeted for
this year. About half of those will be in China/Asia-Paciﬁc. A signiﬁcant number of
those speciﬁcally in China and we're going to talk about China at some length. We
have about 600 stores targeted in our Americas segment and 150 stores targeted in
EMEA. Most of those EMEA stores are in the license store format. And we believe
right now, we're talking about store growth. But we believe right now we're as
conﬁdent as we've ever been about these new store growth numbers. There may be
a chance for us to lean in a little bit given some of the new formats and the success
that we've seen with those. But as we grow new stores, we just want you to make
sure that you understand the level of discipline and investment we have in process
and analysis behind these stores.
So whether it's in the UK or in China or US or Canada, we take every store and we
bump it up against a pro forma that meets all of our hurdle returns, has speciﬁc
revenue and expense targets. And we look at that store every year to make sure it's
marching along those return expectations. And we look at those stores and the
distribution and we look at the stores that are over performing, what we call theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-11
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 3 of 10greentail. And we try to understand what are the characteristics that those stores
have? Is it geography? What happens with drive-throughs? What's the contribution
in China by city, by vintage year? Do we see any deceleration or acceleration city by
city, year by year? We pull that apart and spend more time than we ever have
discussing and analyzing that store performance. And we also look at what we call
the redtail. And there's not a lot of underperforming stores. But obviously in the
normal distribution there are some stores that are meeting or just beating their
hurdle. We look at those stores and try to understand are there things for us to learn
there either in format or execution or staﬃng or how we open? And so we're
constantly looking at this as we ramp the store growth to make sure that we learn
from some of the bumps that we've had in the past and we take those learnings and
infuse it into how we build new store growth. So we feel very conﬁdent both in our
store growth and on our controls around the proﬁtability of those stores as we
expand.
So let's talk a little bit about -- oops, I'm a slide ahead, sorry. No. We're good. Let's
talk a little bit about China. And I didn't really know where to put China in this
presentation because it really draws on all those growth drivers. So I picked the new
store segment. But I could have picked digital opportunities, I could have picked
beverage innovation. Because really in China we're ﬁring on all cylinders. And you
can see some of the ROI numbers, you can see the growth numbers we're seeing in
cap, very reﬂective of what we're seeing in China. We're at over 1,100 stores today
and we'll be at over 1,500 stores by the end or around 1,500 stores by the end of
next year.
It's a very dynamic market. It's a market where we continue to see traction around
the Starbucks experience. And there are a number of things that are helping
demographically and environmentally for Starbucks in China. Obviously there's a
growing middle class in China. There's growing income within that middle class and
I think importantly, something that's relatively transparent to us. But perhaps not to
you all is we're seeing a growing adoption of a coﬀee experience and a coﬀee
culture. So moving more towards that daily routine, we're seeing increased
frequency. Moving a little bit less away from an occasion. Although that's still very
much the China market, it's not reﬂective of the way it operates in the US. But we are
seeing an adoption of the coﬀee culture and all of those environmental factors are
deﬁnite new tailwinds for us.
But when we think about China, we think about that market very broadly and we
think about it kind of carefully. So despite the fact we have signiﬁcant store growth,
we've been in China for 15 years. We're making signiﬁcant investments in
infrastructure in China and signiﬁcant investments in our partners. Last week Howard
and some of the leadership team spent most of the week in China and kind of --
there were several highlights of that event. But one of them was they invited 1,200
China store partners and their families to a China open partner family forum, which is
kind of a mouthful. But basically they came, they met the senior leaders of the
company, they got a chance to ask questions, they got a chance to interact with each
other. And it was a big hit. And those are the types of investments we want to make
as we grow China at the right level and at the right pace. So that level of investment,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-11
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 4 of 10that level of infrastructure, that level of discipline, as well as investment in partners
and building that coﬀee culture is absolutely critical.
We also have locally relevant products. So that includes things like chestnut
macchiato. We have a Green Tea Red Bean Frappuccino, we'll show a picture of that
in a minute. Local, relevant foods, things like our mood cakes for the Mid-Autumn
Festival, all of those things targeted at the China market and locally relevant. The
other thing that's important in China as in many of our markets, we also have speciﬁc
and locally relevant inspired design within the stores.
So speaking of store design, stepping back and going a little bit more broadly. So
we're really focused as we design Starbucks stores and as we ramp up a bit the store
growth in making sure that we stay unique, that we make sure we stay consistent with
the coﬀee forward Starbucks experience. And you can see that in some of the
pictures here. So designs are locally relevant by country. We have stores in places
where others really can't get into. We have a store on a train in Switzerland, we have
a ski-up store. Here in the United States we have a number, an increasing number of
drive-through stores that we're building. We see about a 25% lift as we build drive-
throughs. Those are just a few examples of where we see opportunity.
And when we think about unit growth opportunity, an alternative format, you can see
in the upper middle picture there, we're building a number of stores that are
eﬀectively container stores. So there are a couple of railroad containers or boxes
placed on top of each other and they're drive-up only. There's no place to sit. You
can walk up to it. We're capturing traﬃc and in some of these stores, we have a
couple dozen of these stores now, in some of them they're actually already
approaching the unit volumes that we're seeing in the average Starbucks store that's
a full cafe. And they're going in industrial areas, in commuter areas, in places where
we can't take down a full footprint. But we know there's signiﬁcant traﬃc. There's one
down by Boeing Field in Seattle, it's a completely industrial neighborhood. There's
no other retail anywhere around. But there's a high amount of oﬃce and worker
traﬃc that we're able to pick up and intercept and that store's been open for a few
years and it's doing great. So that's one place we know we can lead in. Smaller
format stores. So we have a number of kind of walkthrough only stores in New York
that are on commuter routes. Again, we try to do that right and get the Starbucks
experience as right as we can. But customers want that experience and we see the
opportunity to open more of those stores as we move forward.
The other thing I would point out is we've opened two stores recently in partnership
with Disney. So one in California, one in Florida. These are big stores, they're really
landmark stores for us. And while they're integrated and very consistent with the
Disney theme, they are very coﬀee forward stores. So they're technology forward,
coﬀee forward stores. They're beautiful stores. Quite stunning actually. The volumes
are signiﬁcant. And so, again, even in partnership with a place like Disney, we're able
to keep the Starbucks experience relevant and keep coﬀee at the front of the store.
Moving onto beverage innovation. So we get one to two points a quarter and one to
two points over the course of the year over the last few years from beverageFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-11
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 10innovation. This includes things in the past like our Refreshers beverage which has
been a hit in the afternoon for us. It includes things around some of our seasonal
oﬀerings. So we've had pumpkin spice latte out in the market for 10 years now. We
get signiﬁcant comp growth from pumpkin spice latte every year, it's a big winner for
us and with our customers. It includes things like innovation along the macchiato
platform, vanilla macchiato is an example. And I think importantly and increasingly it
includes innovation in our core coﬀee capability. So you can see, you now see on the
picture here, Starbucks Reserve which we're putting in more stores, Clover, which is a
high quality single serve brew coﬀee experience in the store. We're putting than in
more stores.
So across all our innovation platforms we've had a signiﬁcant pipeline. It's coming
forward with drinks like Fizio which you can see in the bottom right which is a
handcrafted, high quality, made-in-front-of-you soda that you'll be able to get in
Starbucks stores aimed at a diﬀerent day part for us. We introduced Teavana Oprah
Chai in the last month or so and I talked about the Green Tea Red Bean Frappuccino
in Asia Pac. So all of those things are examples of where we've seen signiﬁcant lift
and signiﬁcant innovation. And someone asked me earlier today, is the pipeline
more full or less full than it was a year ago when we came to the conference. And I
think it's equally as full. If anything, it's more full. We have signiﬁcant innovation on
the docket. These are a few examples of things that are coming out now. We'll talk
about food. But we're going to continue with the momentum that we have there.
It's not easy. But, I'm going to talk about this a bit later, what I would say about
Starbucks is, innovation is a core competency for us. Again, it's been one to two
points of comp growth for a long time. That takes a lot of work and a lot of eﬀort. But
I think we're really good at it. We're really good at innovating, we're really good at
understanding what our customers want. And we're really good about quick
development and execution of relevant products.
Moving onto food. So food is a signiﬁcant opportunity for us and I think most of you
know this. We only attach food on about a third of transactions, that makes up about
20% of our revenue in our US business. And we've been very focused recently on
the La Boulange bakery rollout. But as the slide says, I think it's important to note that
we've gotten one to two points of contribution in the US business from food for the
past several years. So that was pre La Boulange and it was in day parts like lunch
where we had bistro boxes, up level Panini. We did take -- we went all natural with
our ingredients in our bakery platform even before La Boulange. And so those
improvements drove signiﬁcant food comps and drove signiﬁcant growth. But in the
last quarter, food was the largest contributor to comps in the US and La Boulange
was the largest contributor to food comps. So as La Boulange is rolled out, it's rolled
out in about, had been rolled out in about half the stores and about half the bakery
platform, when we got to the Second Quarter we got to 75% of the stores and it
kicked over to the most signiﬁcant comp growth and we expect that to continue as
we move forward.
And when you think about La Boulange, the way we think about is, we believe that
we're an absolute leader in coﬀee quality and we continue to try to take thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-11
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 10advantage from the supply chain, the way we source coﬀee, roast it, the variety we
oﬀer, the care we take in preparing it. It's really that same level of pride that we
believe a La Boulange launch gives us in food. High quality ingredients, artisan
crafted recipes in sandwiches. And we're starting to see that in the comp results in
the stores.
We did see speciﬁcally in croissants and chocolate croissants that sales have
doubled since the launch of La Boulange in those products. We launched a breakfast
sandwich platform in March that was inspired by La Boulange which means the
recipes, the way it was presented, everything was heavily inﬂuenced by La Boulange.
And we saw 50% increase in sales in that platform once we launched it. So we know
we have a winner and we know it's consistent with what we're trying to do in the
stores.
Moving on. So I touched brieﬂy on lunch. But let's talk about it a little bit more. So
I've talked a fair bit about comp growth and one of thing things that we've done is
we've decomposed our comp growth across two hour increments of the day. So
5:00 to 7:00, 7:00 to 9:00, 9:00 to 11:00, etc. And we've looked at one and two-year
comps speciﬁcally by those two-hour increments. And the good news is, in every
two-hour increment across the portfolio, we've seen comp growth. But the growth is
most signiﬁcant, highest, it spikes, around the 11:00 to 1:00 period and the 1:00 to
3:00 period. So around lunch and early afternoon. And this is all pre any La
Boulange inspired or up leveled lunch program. It goes back to some things I
mentioned around Bistro boxes and paninis. It goes back to things like Refreshers.
And the thing that we're quite excited about is we're already becoming much more
relevant in lunch, we're already seeing a signiﬁcantly outsized comp growth in lunch
and we haven't even gotten to the rollout of the up level lunch program. We haven't
launched Fizio, we haven't really launched Teavana iced teas fully. We're done that
somewhat. But there's more to come. So there's a lot of products and innovation and
marketing and passion that's going to go into that lunch day part. And even before
all of that, we're seeing outsized comp growth and showing that Starbucks is
relevant around lunchtime.
Beyond that, we've talked a fair bit recently about the evenings program. So we've
tested this in a couple of dozen stores over the last several years. So this has been a
long test for us. We're now ready to roll the evening program, we'll be rolling it out
over the next few years and ultimately getting up to as many as 1,000 stores. And
there might be more opportunity. But that's our target now. And the evenings
program is somewhat about beer and wine. And certainly we're going to have locally
sourced and relevant beers and wines in Starbucks stores. But what we ﬁnd in the
stores that we've tested is the ticket is quite diverse. And so there's beer and wine
sales in there, sure. But we've actually seen a lift in coﬀee beverage sales because
people come in in small groups, half the people order coﬀee. The food platform that
we've targeted with kind of a small bites plate you can see there has seen signiﬁcant
lift. So there's a broad diversity in that ticket across food, coﬀee and beer and wine.
So we're pretty excited about that and we're moving forward.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-11
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 10Let's talk about tea a little bit. So I think the ﬁrst thing I would say is, tea is a huge
market, second most consumed beverage in the world after water. It's a bigger
market than coﬀee and it's growing faster than coﬀee. And with the Teavana brand
what we know is we have a brand that resonates with premium tea drinkers. And as
we've started to roll it out in our Starbucks stores with Teavana Oprah Chai and some
of the other Teavana products, we're encouraged by the early results. And what we
also know is that tea in total in Starbucks stores is about 9% of our revenue. I was
mentioning to someone earlier, I kind of have two feelings about 9%. First of all, our
US revenues are a big number and so 9% of that number is a huge amount of sales
for tea. So tea is a relevant product in Starbucks. People come in for Chai tea lattes,
they come in for iced teas in the afternoon. We sell a lot of tea. But I also know, given
how close tea is to our coﬀee oﬀering. And we know that if we get the right quality
and relevancy of oﬀer there, tea can be much more than 9%. So we know there's
opportunity there.
So when we think about the tea opportunity, it breaks down in several ways and I'll
kind of give it to you a little bit chronologically how we see it. So ﬁrst and foremost in
Starbucks stores. So taking the Teavana learnings, the products, the recipes, all the
great things that Teavana has built over the year with their mall based business and
introducing that to our thousands and thousands of Starbucks stores across the US,
is going to be a great lift, both for the Teavana at their end and I think for tea within
Starbucks stores. So that's going on right now.
Then second, we have four tea bars across the US. So this is a concept that has a tea
forward oﬀering. You can get all sorts of tea, bubble tea, iced tea, hot tea, it has a
food oﬀering, it has our wall of tea. Which if you've been in a Teavana mall store, has
dozens of diﬀerent teas that you can select from. It's got tea merchandise which,
again, the Teavana mall store merchandise is really top notch. And we're testing and
learning to see what might be from a tea bar based concept that we might be able
to learn from and roll nationally over time. So those tea bars, there's one in Chicago,
there's one in New York, one in Seattle. And one in L.A. and we're learning a lot
about all aspects of it. How we brew tea, how quickly we brew tea. What the right
food pairing and mix is. And we'll continue to learn from that.
Then mall based stores. So we'll continue to add some mall based stores, we'll
continue to learn from the merchandising expertise, continuing to learn from the
sourcing and recipe expertise from Teavana. Then down the line there could be an
opportunity in CPG as we move further through time. So that's the tea opportunity.
Moving on. So let's talk about mobile, digital and loyalty. I think the ﬁrst thing we can
say with conﬁdence is we have a position in this space that is unequaled by others,
particularly in mobile payments. We know we're the number one mobile payment
app out there. We don't know who number two is. But we know we have a signiﬁcant
portion of the total share. And the real power in these assets is how they work
together. So we've got a really top notch loyalty program in My Starbucks Rewards.
We have 8 million active members, it's growing rapidly. It's a loyalty program that
drives increased frequency from our customers. If you're a loyalty member you know
it's fair. If you come a lot you get a lot of rewards. It allows us to collect informationFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-11
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 10about our customers so that we can oﬀer them one to one marketing, digital
marketing that's relevant to them, that provides them the right kind of oﬀers, the
right kind of updates of what's coming to the stores. And we're in the early days of
building out that capability and that direct marketing capability and learnings.
Then we have the card program, which a third of all payments are on some form of
card. 14% on the mobile app. And the gift card program for Starbucks is signiﬁcant.
So when we saw a bit of slowdown in the holiday timeframe, the gift card business
really helped us sort of pick that up. Starbucks is relevant in a relatively low
denomination of gift card and we're making it easier through e-gift and we continue
to see loads and gifts growing over time.
And ﬁnally mobile. So the app is we think is the easiest way to pay. Customers think
it's the easiest way to pay and it's really what gives us the conﬁdence to test into an
express order and pay concept. So that's something we'll be piloting in a market this
fall. So you can, with your Starbucks app, if I can ﬁnd my phone here, order in
advance. You can conﬁrm an order that you've done recently or a standard order,
you can modify it, walk into the store and pick it up. Now what I will say, it's easy for
me to say that. But the test market is really to iron out probably a dozen diﬀerent
things that we have to ﬁgure out. What's the customer experience? What's the wait
time? What's the impact for people that have to stay in line? How do partners
execute on it? What's the impact on the drive-through? All those questions we have
hypotheses on. We're going to test this very signiﬁcantly, learn from that. And then in
the back half of next year we'll roll it nationally.
What we know is, given the ease of payment with that mobile app, we don't have to -
- other people that are putting in express order and pay, they have to grapple a little
bit with the pay piece of that, we've got that solved. But there are a lot of other
things that we have to learn and we think it will help with throughput, we think it will
help with customer service, giving them diﬀerent options whether it's the drive-
through, walkup, or order in advance to interact with Starbucks. So we're excited
about that.
We've taken it down the aisle so we have ﬁve million stars registered down the aisle.
If you buy a bag of coﬀee, there's a sticker on it. You can peel lit oﬀ and enter in your
stars and now get loyalty in a couple of diﬀerent channels. And we've seen a nice lift
as a result in CPG in that. And I talked about the digital marketing which is very much
early days. That's digital.
So let's talk a little bit about CPG speciﬁcally. And you can see here it's a pretty
powerful portfolio of brands. So we have packaged coﬀee which has been a big --
we have a big market share in that. It's been a market share that we've held but
obviously the category has been shrinking as single serve grows. We're fortunate to
have a strong partnership with Green Mountain and that's allowed us to grow our
share in K-Cups so we continue to work with them to bring more innovation, more
SKUs, more capability to produce and get into additional doors around K-Cups. So
that's a big growth opportunity for us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-11
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 10And you can see in the upper, I guess it would be your upper left corner, ready to
drink. So around our partnership with Pepsi, things like Frappuccino, canned
Refreshers. And those businesses are all growing quite well. But if you look at the
CPG business, the thing to remember is it's our second largest business. So this is a
big business within Starbucks and it interacts in a very cohesive way with the stores.
So the reason we're successful with packaged coﬀee, the reason we're successful
with Refreshers in CPG is because of the success of those products in the store. So
that's the leverage that we drive. CPG is growing at 10%. Chance for that to
accelerate a bit maybe in the second half of the year as we lap some pricing that we
took last year. And the two biggest growth drivers for CPG as you look forward are
around single serve, primarily K-Cup. But some things that we're working on around
Via as well. Then second would be international opportunities. So if you look at for
example ready to drink in Korea and Japan, those are big businesses for us. They're
nice, proﬁtable ready to drink businesses.
They have three big aspects. Number one, Starbucks brand, which obviously we can
bring to any partnership. The second thing that they have is locally relevant recipes
and we've gotten good at that with our stores and with RTD in places like Japan and
Korea. And they have the right distribution partner. And so we're looking in markets
like China for that right distribution partner. We're in active discussions on that if you
will or research on that. And when we get that right we think there's an unlock there
for CPG RTD as well.
Okay. So let's talk a bit about coﬀee. So coﬀee prices have been volatile if you didn't
know that. And this chart really shows on the gray line what's happened with the C
price. Then if you look at the green line, it's really our all-in coﬀee costs in our P&L.
So it includes a diﬀerential for quality, it includes the curve as you buy out further, But
you can see there that because we have a long position, our coﬀee prices lags a bit
where the market is. And what we've done is, if you go back to the last coﬀee price
spike, we were a bit shorter, quite a bit shorter than we are now. We were probably
about six months price protected. So as those coﬀee prices moved, we had some
ability to wait that out. But ultimately we had to buy and you can see what happened
a little bit to our coﬀee costs.
Now if you go to the right. And I mentioned this earlier, we had about 200 million of
aggregation in our P&L in 2012 from coﬀee prices and we actually delivered slightly
above our guidance to the street. So there's a lot of things, a lot of levers within our
P&L that we can use to oﬀset, both on the growth side and on the cost side. So just
keep that in mind. Coﬀee is about 10% of our total costs, So it's meaningful. But just
to keep it in perspective, it's 10%. And what we've done this year as we headed into
that price increase is we had about 15 months priced. So over the last four months or
so as coﬀee has been up above $1.50, $1.75, $2.00, we haven't priced a lot of coﬀee.
We've done some. But it's been pretty limited as we wait to see what happens with
the Brazil harvest this summer. So we'll continue to watch that. If prices come down,
they were at $1.70 today, if they continue to come down, then we'll look at buying
and pricing out more of next year's coﬀee costs. We have all of this year, almost all of
this year priced and about 40% of next year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-11

Page 10 of 10Capital allocation, I'm running out of time a bit, the only thing I would say is, over the
last couple of years, given some of the uncertainty around the Kraft litigation, we did
not return as much capital to shareholders around buybacks as we anticipate this
year. So no committals. But one of the things that we've done is, what we're targeting
is oﬀsetting the dilutive impact around our stock based compensation program. So
our equity programs go well down into our store base. Our partners in our stores get
stock in Starbucks. And we're targeting repurchases that oﬀset that antidilutive
impact. Now that will be impacted by timing and stock price and cash availability. So
that isn't a guarantee. But that's certainly something that we're targeting. Then we
may selectively go beyond that. So you can see just by the run rate, we're at half a
billion through six months and it's been just over a billion the last two years. So we're
on a run rate to return a little bit more capital to shareholders as a result.
In closing, I'd just remind that coﬀee and our partners are our foundation and we
continue to make investments in coﬀee forward things like Clover, Reserves and
other things. We have multiple layers of growth opportunities and innovation is a
core competency for Starbucks. The pipeline is full. Strong EPS and revenue growth,
good cash ﬂow, balance sheet and additional working capital opportunities. And
we're well positioned for both short term and long term growth. And that's it.
