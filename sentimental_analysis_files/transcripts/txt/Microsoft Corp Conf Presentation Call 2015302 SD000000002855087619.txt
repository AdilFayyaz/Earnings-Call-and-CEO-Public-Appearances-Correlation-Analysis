Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the biggest technology media and telecoms
conference in the industry. We are very excited to be getting going this morning. My
name is Andy Kearns. I help run the global tech banking group here at Morgan
Stanley.
Just some quick stats on the conference itself. We are up 25% year over year to an
all-time high number of 1,300 investors who have registered and will be attending
this event from all over the world. More than 250 companies will be presenting. And
we've got very high representation at the CEO and CFO level with over 120 CEOs,
140 CFOs.
So kicking things oﬀ here, we've got a very strong market backdrop coming oﬀ of,
I'd say, a very positive for the most part -- positive earnings season. The NASDAQ hit
5,000 this morning, as I understand it. So we are back to where we were last -- in
March of 2000. In a much better place, by the way.
Morgan Stanley announced a couple of acquisitions this morning. We advise three
scale on a $16.7 billion sale to NXP Semiconductor. And we advise Mavenir on a $557
million sale to Mitel Networks. So lots of kind of good, positive dynamics in place
here.
So I'm going to kick things oﬀ with -- we've got Keith Weiss, who runs Americas
research for us in the software area. And he's here with Qi Launch from Microsoft.
Over to you, Keith.

Page 2 of 15Qi LuExcellent. Thank you, Andy. So we are very pleased to have with us this morning
kicking oﬀ the conference, Dr. Qi Lu, who is the Executive Vice President of Microsoft
Applications and Services Group. Before we get going, we have to read some safe
harbors. Please note that all important disclosures including personal holdings,
disclosures. And Morgan Stanley disclosures appear on the Morgan Stanley public
website at www.MorganStanley.com\researchdisclosures or at the registrations desk
and (inaudible).
Before we begin, Qi may make some forward-looking statements during this
presentation. And you should refer to Microsoft's SEC ﬁlings for the risk factors
related to their business and whether you are here in person or listening on the
Web.
All right. So with that out of the way, thank you very much for joining us again. You
were nice enough to join us last year and came this year as well. There have
deﬁnitely been a lot of changes at Microsoft over the past year or so. There's been
leadership changes and new strategic vision, restructuring that was put into place.
Can you, from your perspective -- from a leadership perspective -- can you describe
what has changed for you? What is it like working at the new Microsoft now?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
First of all, thanks very much, Keith, for having me. And it's always great to have the
opportunity to speak at this conference.
Just to elaborate my thinking on this, to come to the Silicon Valley Bay Area is pretty
awesome -- almost every other week. A lot of my friends are telling me, hey, what's
going on with the Renaissance Center [ph] with Microsoft? I think that's perhaps the
way to think about it. There is a new beginning, truly a sense of this is a new era.
Obviously, we have a new leadership team, we have a new CEO. But more
importantly, let me share with you how I think about what's new and why it is driving
so much energy and the positive progress at Microsoft.
First is clarity on positions and strategy. The new leaders, new leadership team,
makes it very, very clear: let's go back to our Company's roots. Let's double down;
let's focus. Our core D&A is productivity. So we made it very, very clear Microsoft is a
productivity Company. And we are going to do so by doing also platforms. So it's a
productivity Company and a platform Company. One of these being productivity for
this new cloud ﬁrst [ph] mobile portfolio -- that's very, very important.
The second piece of your question is from a leadership standpoint, what we've been
focusing on across the Company is these three things in combination. One is driving
clarity. Clarity on position on strategy is (inaudible) because with clarity you bring a
lot more energy. Group clarity is number one. Number two is alignment. We need to
align all our diﬀerent business lines towards new positions, new strategies for our
Company. And thirdly is intensity. The pace of all the programs is super-duper
important. So that's number two.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 15Keith WeissNumber three is focusing on delivering performance. Particularly from a business
standpoint, there's a few things that we share with the larger investment community
at what cost. One is our commercial cloud business is going through a very, very
rapid pace of growth. Growing for six consecutive quarters, growing at the triple
digits. And this is kind of continuing. And on pace to exceed our cloud commercial
business for $5.5 billion in annualized revenues. That's very, very important. The
second -- while even for oﬃce consumer businesses, oﬃce, home. And the personal
subscriptions is reaching 9.2 million subscribers. And we are growing quarter over
quarter sequentially at the 30% pace. And the pace is accelerating. That's very, very
exciting to see. And our annuity business is very strong; that's an indication of our
customers have strong conﬁdence in our future innovation agenda because that's
why they buy annuities.
And another one to call out is our search business is going through also very, very
healthy growth. We are growing year over year at the 23%. As we stated earlier from
our CFO, we are going to reach proﬁtability in the next ﬁscal year. In fact, we --
internally, we have been seeing the strong, positive trends. And the recent
proﬁtability is due to energizing events for the Bing team. The team is executing
very, very strongly internally (inaudible). When we celebrate proﬁtability, we are
going to have a party, it's going to be a potluck party. We are going to maintain the
strong discipline on controlled cost and while growing revenues.
To add those up, these are strong performance. But the last thing I want to call out is
building future (inaudible). Our mental model is it's about delivering economic
performance using today's earning engine. At the same time, we have to recharge
battery to the earning engine. The earning engine is like a battery: if you drive a lot
of performance, you have to recharge them. And at the same time, building new
earnings engines; that's super, super important.
And as for focus on user and the usages. Because in cloud-based businesses, the
consumption -- it's per user, per subscription. So how do we build a new muscle
from R&D, from go-to-market, from sales in our ﬁeld in many ways -- they used to sell
licenses -- now selling cloud. But how do we drive usage, adoption, consumption?
That's about building future (inaudible). So the combination of these four, I will
repeat -- the new positioning of the Company focusing on productivity, platforms.
The second is across Company driving clarity, alignments. And the intensity and
delivery of performance and building future strength on driving use and usage. As
the combination of these four, that's why you see the positive buzz as people at the
Company, outside the Company -- that's a genuine very positive trend for the
Company.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Maybe to dig into the cloud services or the productivity side versus the platform
side, when I talk to investors about the devices and services strategy, I think investors
have a very positive view on cloud services. And we use an abundance (inaudible)
cloud services, although perhaps a more pessimistic view of the prospects on the
devices side, particularly in mobile. Why is it so critical that Microsoft has a play in
mobile, that they have a mobile operating system themselves versus leveragingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02

Keith Weiss
Qi Lusome of the other platforms that are already existing out there with your cloud
services?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
Keith, this is very good question. I believe actually we speak about this particular
topic even last year. So there are a couple of dimensions I will share our thoughts.
One is, our belief is our industry is in a phase -- at the phase whereby vertical
integrations -- meaning that innovation across the boundary of hardware, software,
operating systems, application of services can unlock a lot of end-user value and
economic value. And there's many, many examples where this (inaudible) Microsoft
can also point to by -- companies by driving integration across these boundaries. We
see opportunities for Microsoft to be the main principle in Windows operating
systems, in our ﬁrst-party devices and driving end-point innovation using our
services.
I'll give you one example. I see some people using Surface Pro 3. And that's one
example of if you want to have the best inking experiences (inaudible) -- if you want
to ink, to annotate, to capture, Surface Pro 3 across the board is by far the best
experience. And that's just one of the many, many examples we are thinking driving
innovations. And that's why we remain strong in principle using -- building our
mobile devices, building our mobile businesses.
At the same time, it's also important for me to point out this -- we are also making
our services available on other mobile platforms. Particularly for my group, we have
been investing substantial engineering resources, product energy. So that we can
deliver leading productivity expenses on our OS and on Android. For example, on
our OS devices, our mobile downloads already exceeds 80 million user downloads
and the numbers keep growing. And we recently announced that we have our Oﬃce
for Android tablets available, I believe, in January. Internally, we have quite a bit of
investing R&D resources so that we can keep the pace of innovation but deliver our
leading productivity services across all diﬀerent mobile platforms, at the same time
inside of Microsoft driving end-to-end innovation so that we can have the best, most
complete experiences on Microsoft's own operating system in the Microsoft ﬁrst-
party devices.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Maybe shifting gears a little bit, to drill down on Oﬃce 365, can you talk to us
about how Oﬃce 365 has been tracking relative to you guys' internal expectations
on both the enterprise side and the consumer side of the equation? Then I want to
drill down a little bit on Enterprise.
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
So in terms of driving Oﬃce 365 growth relative to our own expectations, we see
very, very positive trends. On the commercial side, our focus, Keith, is driving
adoption and the consumption. Because the game in cloud is diﬀerent. It's less
about selling licenses; it's about getting customers to migrate quickly and driveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 15Keith Weissusages and the consumption. And the speciﬁc focus is in the product and R&D side
is making adoption a permanent part of the overall experience.
In the past, when we sold products, we used to have end-user experiences and IT
experiences. We think in the future these barriers should not exist. There should just
be one holistic experience; when end user adopts Oﬃce 365, the consumption
adoption experience is all built in. So a lot of focus on driving usage and adoption.
And on the consumer side, we also need to do the same thing. But at the same time
driving mobile end-point experiences so that product innovations can drive more
usage adoption. Some of the product innovation was cutting us both across
commercial side and the consumer side. One is Sway [ph]. Sway is a new operating
product -- operating services -- essentially new (inaudible). You don't have ﬁle
formats per se. It lives in the cloud. But it's a fantastic experiences. We have a mobile
app. And we also have the Web experience as well. It enables you to author a
document using very simple capability -- you can use camera, you can use ink, you
can use voice, you can use all sorts of media. But the beauty is once you author it, it
renders appropriate whether it's on a phone or a tablet or a large screen. The layout
engine will automatically ﬁgure out what's the best way to showcase the document.
That's one of the key innovations we tried to do.
Another innovation we should mentioned last year, Keith, I believe we talked about
here is that the new product called Adell [ph]. And it's built on a new infrastructure
called an Oﬃce Graph. If you think about; Oﬃce Graph is the ﬁrst version of
(inaudible). In a working environment whereby you can have a graph that has
representation of people, documents, messages, work activities, events -- all those
things are connected. And Adell is a product for the ﬁrst time -- the document and
the people -- the usages gets connected. And you can discover all the documents
diﬀerent people are using it. For example, (inaudible) a lot of people browse my
clusters. Essentially, the document I am reviewing -- the trending documents people
are sending to me with conﬁdentiality, all these things being taking care of, people
will see what kind of documents I am looking at. In (inaudible) that's huge because in
the past you don't know what's going on -- what's trending -- what's important.
Diﬀerent teams -- that's the type of innovation that's really driving more adoption
inside of commercial products and also across consumer products as well.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
With the consumer Oﬃce 365, the pricing of Oﬃce 365 pretty evident how Microsoft
garners more value over the lifetime value of the product. The $100 per year versus
the average person buying $250 once every ﬁve years. It's a little less clear on the
enterprise. So while we see really good adoption in terms of CIOs looking to adopt
Oﬃce 365, our most recent CIO survey showed 26% of CIOs using Oﬃce 365 today.
Another 26% expecting to use it over the next two years. So great adoption trend.
Can you talk just a little bit on how Microsoft plans to increase the lifetime value of
those customers in terms of as an Oﬃce 365 subscriber versus having a licensed
tied up in your enterprise agreement?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Qi Lu{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
Yes. This is, Keith, one of the key questions, both from product innovations and
certainly from long-term value creation standpoint. There's a couple of things to
emphasize here. One is the same service -- moving from on-premise service to the
cloud would increase lifetime value by severalfold for fundamental reasons. One is,
once it's (inaudible) services we immediately see the customer interactions. So the
pace of innovation will be very diﬀerent. In the past, when we deploy a new version
of our software, adoption is always a long tail. Typically, any new version, only about
25% of individuals adopt the new version. So a lot of customers stay on older
versions. So you don't get the beneﬁt of the new features. So in cloud services,
immediately you get the beneﬁt of new features. The value is increasing -- end-user
value is increasing; that's number one.
Number two, interactivity enables us to build digital models, as I mentioned earlier.
Using digital representation of people, documents, messages, events, work activities,
you can build those graphs. Those graphs give us intelligence which services or
which features generate would more productivity for our users. So that further drives
the pace of innovation to deliver more value to our customers.
We can think about the fundamental -- one of the fundamental trends of delivering
value is by driving more fast-paced innovation for end users. So their productivity
gets lifted; that's number one. Number two is adjacent areas. Our mental model is --
the past three decades [ph], today's productivity by and large using PC as endpoints
as a device, using ﬁle folder documents as the main form of delivering productivity.
When moving to cloud, the end point -- the computing edge moving to mobile
devices and delivery can cover all diﬀerent people.
So therefore the envelope of productivity will expand. Today, for our productivity
services, we have 1.1 billion users. And we believe we can reach about 2 billion
professionals in about three years because a new generation of productivity
experience will be available on mobile devices. And we can reach a larger customer
base. So enable us to expand; that's another area for value growth.
And a further area for value growth is the natural adjacencies. Of course, a couple of
things. One is we've been focusing on adding more and more services for
compliance for security. So when things move into the cloud, there's lots and lots of
value. But protecting those data, that is critical for enterprise is very important,
particularly in the (inaudible) NSA areas. There's lots of concerns about moving data
in the cloud or moving services to the cloud. How do you protect those? So by
beeﬁng up more and more product oﬀerings on those enables us, again, to add --
create more values in our growth initiatives.
As I said, inside of Microsoft there is also cross-sell (inaudible) opportunities. For
example, last quarter we reached (inaudible) about mobile -- enterprise mobility
services, EMS product. That's one of the many examples we can use Oﬃce 365 to
integrate other Microsoft services to create more value. So a combination with all
those -- (inaudible) how we think about driving more value productivity for end usersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Keith Weiss
Qi Lu-- look at the natural adjacency, look at the boundary synergy opportunities inside of
Microsoft, overall collectively grow our enterprise values by focusing innovation to
using Oﬃce 365.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. Maybe stepping oﬀ of one of those adjacencies, the newly renamed Cipher
[ph] businesses. That's been one of your -- the fastest areas -- fast product-growing
areas for you guys. Can you talk to us about what's resonating with customers within
that Cipher business oﬀering? How are they using it today? How does that expand
over the next couple of years? And how does Cipher consumer play into that?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
That's a great question. The way I think -- we think about it is Cipher business
represents a huge growth opportunity. As of today, Keith, it is already a multi-billion-
dollar business. But the leading scenarios for enterprise customers, we see tons and
tons of opportunity to remove pressure and create more value. By and large, today's
meeting expenses are full of friction, based on our surveys. But on average, a
meeting takes about 14 minutes to get started because there's all sorts of issues --
people calling in, the connection wasn't good. Sometimes people forgot to mute
and keep talking. And then you have to remind them to please unmute. In all those,
it turns out there's a lot of opportunities to really use technology innovation to
remove friction. So that's one aspect.
The second aspect is we are building a tiered technological foundation -- a shared
infrastructure that over time all the future communications, particularly audio-video
conference communications, all become smart in the sense that today, let's say you
and I have a phone call or a video call. We talk about planning a trip to Las Vegas.
The software doesn't know you are going to Las Vegas; it can give you
recommendation orders. In the future, you can envision all the future communication
all become smart because we are building a full stack. So all communication going
through -- we understood what's being talked about. And providing additional
services -- additional tools made the conversations a lot more intelligent and easier
to use. So we see fantastic opportunity to lift the quality of the experiences in full
productivity for meeting scenarios.
Furtherly, is aﬃnity between Skype for Business and Skype. We are building a uniﬁed
stack. So the future, Skype and Skype for Business has become a uniform, essentially
coherent set of experiences both for consumers and enterprise customers. Today,
we are already supporting interop. If you are a Skype user and if you are a Skype for
Business user, you can interop. In the future, the experience will be the same.
Because this is very important. We see the future trends -- each individual, they are
not going to separate things -- this is the thing that I use for work, this is the thing I
use for life. You are going to use the service that really works for you. So it's an
opportunity for us to use -- to leverage the Skype brand.
The global user base -- Skype has huge global user base. And they also have very,
very large mobile presence. In all of the Skype products is called GroupMe; that'sFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 15Keith Weiss
Qi Luone of the most popular products in the United States for college students. So by
merging these two with uniform product oﬀering and single technology stacks
consistently experience, we believe there's fantastic new opportunities to drive a lot
more growth in the case of platform businesses.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So if we take those two answers together, in terms of getting higher lifetime value
from the customers without moving to these adjacencies, it sounds like we are going
to be bundling larger deals for customers and bundling more services into what you
are trying to sell customers from a productivity application standpoint. At the same
time, more and more of those bundles are going toward subscription days oﬀerings.
Is it wrong to think that over time your whole group is going to become 100%
subscription revenues in terms of what you are oﬀering to your customers?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
This is a great question. So economically, model-wise, Keith, our thinking is our
baseline economics is going to be per-user subscription. The transformation will take
time. Exactly how many years, we have to let things play out. But we see this business
model is very compelling for a variety of diﬀerent reasons. One is it frees up our
innovation opportunity. Because in the future, we can innovate also the client
experience; it doesn't matter which client wants to use it. And as long as you are
connecting to the Microsoft cloud services, connecting to our computing
intelligence, we get the economics because fundamentally it's a per-user
subscription. So the migration path will be lots more. But we can envision a team of
innovation. For certain people, if you want to you can stay on Win 32 -- all local apps
are using the traditional experiences. For younger generation, you are going to
move to fantastic new experiences. But everybody will be able to collaborate
seamlessly because the economic model enables us to do that. Because in the past,
if we are charging for clients, they really have to migrate to the cloud. The per-user
subscription enables a very, very smooth transition for our customers to migrate to
the cloud -- that's very, very appealing.
At the same time, we also think there's opportunity for us to add more value by
driving diﬀerent category innovations. For example, in the case of Microsoft
productivity cloud, one of the things which is interesting -- most people didn't think
search is fundamental to productivity tools. It would be very hard for me personally
to imagine we can be productive as a professional without having access to certain
services. But today, it's kind of bifurcated. You go to Google or Bing for consumer
search experiences, then you go to your enterprise search to look for your internal
Internet information or external information.
Why do you have to do that? Because we think there's fantastic opportunity for us to
build a future generation of search experiences. If you are a professional, if you are a
marketing person working for a pharmaceutical company, you just go to (inaudible)
Bing -- whatever you type in, all the information is right there. Then search
economics is part of that. Even though it's not necessary per user subscription, it's
monetizing based on your intent. As we all know, the search economics, it's a very,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 15Keith Weiss
Qi Luvery potent value extraction engine. So we believe there's fantastic opportunities to
focus our baseline, which is per-user subscription. We can add more and more value
propositions to make that (inaudible) strong. And all the rich clients that move to the
cloud move to the mobile (inaudible). At the same time, there's opportunity for us to
augment that model so that collectively we can capture the most amount of
economics by doing this.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. And this is a good segue into the search business. I want to make sure we get
to that side of your focus. How should we be thinking about ongoing investments in
the online business on a going-forward business? Like you were talking about, Satya
has talked about a path for proﬁtability -- promising proﬁtability from being in FY16.
How are you weighing sort of need for that promise of proﬁtability with the
opportunity that you see out there to kind of extend what Bing is doing today and
what search is doing today?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
This is a great question. Our thinking is the following. So while we believe -- the way
we model everything and do everything is we build work/life experiences. Essentially
every experience is always about work and life experience. Our fundamental thesis
assumption, we believe in the future the friction is so low, people are going to pick
the services that work for them across work and life. You are not going to choose, for
work I'm going to do this, for life I'm going to do this. So therefore, every product
group are all work/life products.
Mail -- we used to have separate mail stacks Hotmail.com and exchange Outlook;
now it's a single stack. It's Outlook.com, Exchange on the cloud and Outlook client.
It's one stack. OneDrive -- used to have OneDrive consumer, OneDrive for Business
SharePoint; now it's one stack. Skype -- you used to have Skype for Business, it's all
single stack. Bing -- Bing the future, Bing for Business, it's all single stack. Essentially,
our consumer (inaudible) doesn't have to think about it's just a natural extension of
the same workload, the same experience, the same stack technology. These are
work/life experiences. That's number one.
Number two, our fundamental focus, our priority, is focus on work because that's --
we believe the Microsoft brand, our market footprint gives us the permission -- and it
gives us the ability to diﬀerentiate and increase separation because we have more
user data, more usages. More innovation opportunity to create group separation
between Microsoft's oﬀerings and our competitors. So we are going to win on work
scenarios ﬁrst. And our belief is once we are winning work scenarios for all
professional, for all students, our future is going to be very bright because they will
use -- these same users will use our services in their life occasions as well. So that's
how we think about reasoning everything, how we invest. So it's work/life -- each
workload is always going to be about work/life experiences, our priorities on work
scenarios. And our belief is over time, these users will use more and more of our
services for their work -- for their life scenarios.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02

Got it. In terms of the necessity and seeing success in mobile, can you talk about the
synergies between the search business and having a presence in mobile? And how
important is Windows 10 adoption going to be in kind of taking that online business
into the mobile environment?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
This is very, very important, at least to what I mentioned earlier. Our industry,
particularly for mobile, is really you can see it's a phase whereby vertical integration
across device -- operating system services can drive a lot of innovation. And Cortana
is one such example. Cortana is -- in many ways, you can think about it's an extension
of Bing. It's built on the Bing engine, all the natural interactions. But we deeply
integrate it into Windows Phone so that you can do commanding, you can do
discovery, you can get recommendations. There's a lot of opportunity. By the way,
Bing also supports Siri. So Apple Siri, Apple (inaudible) life -- the back end, the back
(inaudible) supported by Bing as well.
So that's just one of the important examples of driving the end-to-end innovations.
Using the search technology -- search services go much, much deeper. Because on a
phone, experience is still at the early stage. So there's a lot of opportunity to build
the next-generation experiences and capture economics. That's number one.
Number two, Keith, your question about Windows 10 options, that's very, very
important. Because Windows 10, you can think about, is really a gigantic milestone to
revitalize our Windows franchise, particularly for modern devices, for mobile phone
(inaudible) in particular. So our internal alignment is super, super strong across
diﬀerent divisions.
And we -- based on all the early evidence we are seeing, we are going to drive a lot
of what we call the smart search -- the next-generation Bing search, as part of --
integrates very, very seamlessly with Windows 10 devices, particularly for mobile
phone (inaudible), whether it's tablets or phones. There's a lot of opportunity for us
to drive adoption usage and certain economic growth for Microsoft.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Got it. I wanted to touch on the Yahoo relationship as well. In the press, we are
perhaps seeing Mercer Meyer [ph] expressing some frustration about the search
partnership in the past, the progress of shared gain versus Google. Do you believe
the Yahoo partnership is going to remain durable to you guys over the next several
years? What challenges remain in making sure that Yahoo relationship is beneﬁcial
for both sides of the equation? That everyone is a sort of happy participant in the
partnership going forward?

scenarios between the two companies, particularly product innovation synergies and
those economic synergies. We've been very committed to doing but we can on the
Microsoft side to work with the Yahoo team to drive more overall growth and better
innovation across the two endpoints -- the same platforms -- the same Bing
platforms. You can think about the Bing.com for instance and Yahoo.com search, for
instance.
There's all sorts of (inaudible) going oﬀ. And this is closer to the ﬁve-year
anniversary. And there is opportunity to take another look to see what will look like
next phase. I remain positive there's plenty other opportunity for the two companies.
So we look at what fundamentally is important for us and ﬁnd ways to continue the
collaboration for the two companies.

Questions And Answers
(inaudible – audience question)
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
So we'll break that up into two questions. So the ﬁrst part of the question is the
coopetition and the degree to which Microsoft is working more closely with partners
in, say, like the ﬁle share. One drive is competitive with Dropbox. And you guys
signed partnership agreements with. How do you guys think about the pluses and
minuses, perhaps potential revenue loss because you are better enabling partners
like a Box or a Dropbox versus the opportunities of working with these guys? Then
we'll go into the second part of the question.

Yes. So this is a great question. Thank you for that question. So here is how we think
about this. We are the largest providers-players in the productivity space. And we are
migrating to the cloud by going to mobile world. And along that journey, there will
be coopetition instances all over the place. And we work each case by case. You
mentioned Dropbox. Certainly we have been working with the Dropbox team. And
we really love the partnership; we are going to continue with the partnership.
But as I meet with Drew and his team, we have been super clear. We are going to
collaborate on here, collaborate on the experience whereby makes our combined
customers better. Meaning that for those users who choose Dropbox over OneDrive
and also use Microsoft Oﬃce productivity software, for those customers, they willFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02

A - Keith Weisshave better experiences. But we will also be clear, we are going to compete. We are
going to compete -- on OneDrive, we are going to oﬀer as compelling services as
we can to drive more adoption and more customers. So we will be super clear on
these.
The principle for me and my team is, are we getting more users and more usage?
That's number one. Number two, overall, our combined customers -- are they getting
a better experience or not? And if these are the two, then we will look at the trade-
oﬀ. Sometimes the trade-oﬀ is complete positive when we do it. Sometimes the
trade-oﬀ is more nuanced -- we have to negotiate (inaudible) it. But coopetition
deals case by case. The principle is we are going to do a lot of those with many,
many players; that's the simple reality. But if the net is, allow Microsoft Oﬃce to grow
its user base, grow usages, ultimately over time will be a net win for our core
businesses. That's what how we think about it.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
And the second part of the question was on acquisition strategy. Is that over the past
few years we've seen a couple of small acquisitions like Revolution Analytic, or Tom
mentioned Sunrise, which I think is a calendaring app. How is Microsoft thinking
about the buy versus build decision today? Is it more likely that you are going to be
buying more functionality? And what's the potential for a larger acquisition out there
with your functionality maybe heading into some of those adjacencies?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
So the common principle we use is always ﬁrst declare what we want. Once we
declare what we want then you always analyze the three options -- buy versus build
versus (inaudible) each case is going through it like this -- the case of some examples
I mentioned -- these acquisitions -- what we want is great products, that's number
one.
Number two, great talent. Talent in many ways also weighs quite heavily because as
we transform Microsoft one of the key things we drive is internally driving cultural
change, driving a diﬀerent product (inaudible) focusing on user/usage. Focused on
customer orientation, focusing on designing mobile point screen experiences.
Sometimes those transformations can be accelerated by bringing talent outside of
Microsoft into Microsoft. So it's a combination of building -- acquiring great product,
great talent. And in the case of a company with really -- excited about the
opportunity because everything I can see -- I come to Silicon Valley, as I said, almost
every other week. Clearly, it's the best mobile mail client that is out there. Once we
rebrand as Outlook brand, the momentum is unbelievable. It's the opposite
(inaudible) teams, every 10,000 downloads, you ring the bell and the bell just keeps
ringing. There's opportunity truly for us to do software acquisitions to accelerate our
growth for our core businesses.

Any additional questions from the audience?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02

Q - Unidentiﬁed ParticipantThank you for the presentation. At the time when Microsoft bought Nokia's mobile
business -- mobile (inaudible) business, they weren't going to talk about Microsoft
being interested in the mapping asset of Nokia. Can I just ask given what you are
saying regarding platforms and the rest of it, what would be the industrial logic of
Microsoft owning a mapping asset in house, please?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
This is a great question. So here is how we think about it. Mapping assets as a
product is quite strategic for us. So we think about this as it's not just a navigation
service to guide you from A to B. It's really the geospatial namespace to enable
many, many other product innovations and the business synergies in that space.
That's the most.
Number two, if you look at it historically the economics that's needed to support the
mapping assets, there are several possibilities. One is the search economics. For
Google, it's somewhat of a no-brainer. About 20% to 25% (inaudible) have local
intent. As part of searches, we show a map screen because in such case it just adds
ﬁxed cost. For Google in particular, it kind of even makes more sense because if you
are leading in business whereby ﬁxed cost is a higher margin, the cost is low, it just
adds more ﬁxed cost to it.
So for Microsoft, it's a little bit of a challenge because Bing volume isn't nearly as big
as Google's search volume. So founding the map assets is economically a little bit
more challenging from a pure search perspective for Microsoft.
The other is you can found it by mobile devices. It turns out mapping becomes a
must-have service for your phone. But the way the Apple economics works is they
will pay $1.50 -- whatever the (inaudible) material. If you have enough phone volume,
you can fund that as well. So Microsoft, we have a combination of search volume and
phone volume to fund it. So on an ongoing basis the key is to drive more innovation
particularly for us to focus more on using geospatial namespace is for productivity.
You can easily imagine all sorts of interesting possibilities. If you are a professional
you are going to speak with particular important customers. Either you get to the
place -- you do not know the campus map, you may not get to the right building in a
quickly way. So in really all those future scenarios, Microsoft will have the best
experiences for professional for enterprise applications. We see there's lots of
opportunity for us to drive more value, drive more innovation.

Can you comment on Azure and Oﬃce 365 prospects in China?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-03-02

Very, very good question. China is very special, very diﬀerent because of the special
rules the Chinese government established for multi-national companies to play in
the cloud. So Microsoft is actually the ﬁrst multi-national company in China to have a
public cloud oﬀering, which is what we call (inaudible). Essentially we worked with a
partner (inaudible) -- essentially in China, we cannot be the direct operator; you have
to be operated by a Chinese company. And we build technology -- we train our
partners to operate the cloud. In Oﬃce, it applies the same. This is huge, huge
growth opportunity for Microsoft because we see tremendous early adoption in the
growth patterns for Chinese customers. And when I was visiting China I talked to our
Chinese customers all the time. There's a lot of early adopters using Oﬃce 365,
using Azure to build their new -- their future-generation product services. Particularly
China also has a growing class of China-based multi-national companies. They are
China based. But their Company is in the United States. Microsoft in particular
provides a very, very strong value proposition in the services for these customers.
This is one of the few areas we feel very good that we made early investments and
we kind of bit the bullet. It's very complicated. You have to do so many one-oﬀ
engineering work just to get that going. But once it's set up, the opportunity is
generally there.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Just one last follow-up on that, China has been an area that you've had issues with
suppliers to before and actually being able to monetize the use of your product. Do
you think this push towards the cloud is going to help you guys combat some of that
piracy and in general monetize the usage of Microsoft in China?
{BIO 21085704 <GO>}
Absolutely. Because in service, we have the provision of services. It's very hard for
you to apply the normal piracy gains. Obviously there is always some potential
possibility there (inaudible) cases. By and large, we feel very good about our ability
to monetize once we move to the cloud services.

you very much for joining us today. You've been great.
