All right. Well. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for making it through the
third day of the annual technology conference. Very excited to have the ﬁnal keynote
of the event, Kevin Turner, Chief Operating Oﬃcer for Microsoft. And the way this
session is going to work is Kevin is going to have a few slides to sort of level set for
us. And then we're going to go over here, have some Q&A and then open it up for
the audience as well. So with that, I would like to welcome Kevin Turner, Chief
Operating Oﬃcer of Microsoft, to the stage. Thank you, Kevin.
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity. And really excited about the
opportunity to be able to talk to you a little bit about what Microsoft has going on,
speciﬁcally our transformation to a productivity and platform company in a mobile
ﬁrst and cloud ﬁrst world.
As you've been in technology and in this industry a long time, you'd have to say it's a
very exciting time to be in this business. The pace of change, the rapid ﬂow of
technology, the innovation, the speed at which things are happening have never
been as high and as escalated as they are today. That's both exciting, exhilarating, a
lot of hard work going into it. But I would also say the same about Microsoft. There is
a lot of change, speed and agility and opportunity that we are seeing as a company.
And we are under a lot of change and transformation. And I'll talk about that
transformation today and give you a little color and insight into how we see that
world and the way that that world is evolving for us from a business perspective.
To level set, the Company, Microsoft, is 39 years old. Our 40th anniversary, as many
of you may know, is next year. The ﬁrst 39 years of our company, we had one of the
greatest business models of all time built around certainly the Windows Client
operating system and the PC operating system and catching that wave of innovation
certainly was very good to the Company. Then followed suit with the OﬃceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04

Page 2 of 15productivity suite and all of the workloads associated with that. That was our second
big franchise. Then our foray into the enterprise and really coming out with Windows
server and building out and building and extending that into SQL and other
enterprise products and solutions.
But primarily that business model was attach, attach our software to as many sockets
as we can. And it was license focused. And the beautiful thing about the old world
business model was that, hey, as a customer bought our software, we got paid 100%
of it upfront and we got paid regardless whether they used it or not. And the ability
to transition from that business model candidly is where we are today.
So just to ground everybody, this was our past. If you look at our future, it's really
about becoming a cloud OS, a devices operating system, having ﬁrst party hardware
to light up those experiences. And really being the company that can uniquely
provide for dual users this idea of digital work and digital life experiences. And
doing all of that really helps transform our company from a PC OS, an oﬃce
productivity suite and Windows server company, to really being a productivity and
platform company as the world has evolved into mobile ﬁrst and cloud ﬁrst.
I think Satya has summed it up and said it extremely well when he said our company
is going to reinvent productivity to empower every person and every organization on
the planet to do more and achieve more. And so that is our North Star as an
organization for those dual users, both in life and at work, regardless of the device.
So when you think about one of the big opportunities we have with being a platform
and productivity company, is that our opportunity, our uniqueness, is really about our
ability to reinvent productivity. And to reinvent productivity, it simply means that we
are going to provide the tools that end-users need again to achieve more and do
more. And we're going to do that across mobile. And so that any device can become
your device regardless of the operating system; social, the ability to connect and
bring multiple data sources and multiple device types together so that you can
create unique business value; intelligent systems backed up by machine learning.
And really allowing us to get to predictive analytics and predictive intent so that we
can anticipate and help people prioritize what is important in their life; and natural,
that natural user interface, new frontiers of technology again enabled by machine
learning. But new ways for speech, voice, video, data, inking. And gestures and on
and on is a very unique position that we see as all unique opportunities in a cross-
platform way to be able to reinvent productivity. And we are very excited again to
bring that experience across dual users, both in work and in life.
Now, the company Microsoft is under a lot of change. And we've certainly had a fair
amount of change with a new CEO, new strategy, new transformation, productivity
and platform company. But we are also taking some very bold decisions and taking
some very important steps. The Nokia synergies and streamlining and eﬃciencies
and strategic alignment, getting into that particular piece of ﬁrst party hardware was
important for us to get a footprint in the mobile space. Modernizing our engineering
organization so that we can be faster and have more speed and agility andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 15quickness and responsiveness to the marketplace. That is all supported and backed
up by some massive organizational changes that we have done.
We now have one operating systems group, one cloud group, one applications
group, one hardware and devices group, one marketing organization. Those are not
trivial changes in our company that for 39 years lived and worked and thrived,
candidly, in these product silos. And you will see as we talk about some of our
forward-looking product solutions and services that come to market, you will see
some of the themes that we've had in the past go away. And very naturally go away
because of our modernizing of our engineering organization.
Creating ﬁrst party hardware has been important for us. So important that the best
two-in-one device for productivity on the planet is a Surface Pro 3 today. And we
want to get into that space, in the ﬁrst party hardware space, not to create all the
hardware; that's not our intent. Our intent is to lead the innovation curve and push
our OEMs and others to innovate faster.
We love great third-party hardware and partnerships. In fact, one of the big changes
we have made as an organization is we made some very signiﬁcant strategic third-
party partnerships. When you think about the likes of Salesforce and IBM and
Dropbox, Oracle, Cisco and on and on and on, our company today has completely
changed how we see the importance of third-party partnerships. And yes, we're
going to compete with all of those folks head-up. But we are able to have
coopetition, a new word that we are continuing to learn exactly what it means and
how we are able to create swim lane clarity around.
IBM as an example, we will compete with them on notes for sure. But we have
embraced DB2 and WebSphere and we run those seamlessly onto the Azure
platform. That's an important step for us. We are doing a lot with IBM now as it
relates to our dynamics platform and portfolio. Salesforce, again extending the
Oﬃce platform, getting into great partnerships with them to be able to light up CRM
in a unique way. And yet I will compete with them on CRM directly. And the list goes
on. But you get the sense and the ﬂavor of the fact that the tone at the top for
Microsoft is we will embrace and extend the platform in these very strategic areas.
And we are really putting, again, the agreements along with the words.
Zero royalty on 9-inch and below devices. The very week, ladies and gentlemen, that
we announced this change in Shenzhen where roughly 80% to 85% of the world's
consumer electronics is created, we saw 36 design wins in addition over week over
week when we made the single change. And we've seen that momentum continue
to accelerate.
And you are seeing a whole new level of innovation in the marketplace running
Windows today. You're seeing $200 laptops, you are seeing $99 Windows tablets
embracing and extending the ecosystem by lighting up some of these new business
model scenarios, allowing us to monetize the lifetime of that customer throughFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15services and diﬀerent add-ons that we are able to be able to incorporate with that
solution.
Oﬃce and .net going cross-platform, very important for us again to embrace and
extend. And I'm excited about those changes, being able to run on iOS and Android
as well as our own platform.
And the cloud investments and competitiveness. This is one of the things that we
have been doing for multiple years. And we have a substantial lead against the
competition in this space relative to our regional data centers. And I'll talk some
about that in a moment. But that has been very strategic for us, helping our
customers move from CapEx to OpEx and being able to embrace and extend this
cloud services world.
And we're working extremely hard on simplifying our licensing to more of a
subscription-based model in most cases and making it very elegant for our
enterprise customers and for other customers to be able to embrace and extend our
product portfolio and solutions.
But the reality is we've got more to do. This isn't -- we are not declaring victory
around these things. We are simply taking the bold actions that we need to take
head-on and as a senior leadership team working together in a very collaborative
and teamwork-oriented way to solve these really hard business decisions and
business model opportunities that we have. And that really feels good. That's
brought a real breath of fresh air and energy to the Company and one that I know -- I
speak on behalf of a lot of employees -- we are very excited about. And oh, by the
way, it's manifested itself in the marketplace with great momentum.
Our commercial cloud revenue grew triple digits, 128%, driven by Oﬃce 365 Azure
and CRM Online for the ﬁfth consecutive quarter. And we are seeing strong
momentum around those products and solutions. 80% now of the Fortune 500 have
embraced the Microsoft cloud. And again, that number continues to accelerate and
go up.
One major Azure service or feature is released every three days. So we are moving
from a three-year product cycle to a three-day product cycle, which is extremely
invigorating for both our customer base and our employee base and engineering
base to be able to embrace these new user scenarios and opportunities for our
customers.
At the same time, as much progress as we are making around the cloud in both the
private, public. And hybrid cloud environment, we are seeing great uptake of our on-
premises product like SQL Server, System Center and Windows server. And I believe
the strategic reason behind that is because we are able to do these massive
hyperscale 1 million square foot data center cloud environments. We are taking the
learning from that space and incorporating that into our on premise products. A
great example of that is our SQL Server platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 15SQL is now the TPC benchmark leader in two diﬀerent categories. And it's 30 times
faster than the previous version. It has in-memory technology built into it. And it's a
third the price of our competitors. So that's why you see us making so much
progress on the on-premise products is because of incorporating that functionality
and ﬂexibility. System Center now supports Android and iOS devices in addition to
our own. And being able to have that end-to-end management solution has been
very strategic with our customers.
And Surface Pro 3 is just a home run for us from a device perspective. It is the best
two-in-one device out there. We've made the top gift for a lot of diﬀerent surveys
that have gone on for this holiday season around the world, including beating out
some of our competitive products in that particular space, something we couldn't do
a year ago, two years ago. But it is an incredible device, particularly if you want to
replace having to carry around two devices instead of one.
The opportunity that we have going forward is to continue to leverage the
unparalleled platform that we have. If you think about Microsoft Azure and Windows
server and the opportunity we have there, the way I like to think about this is you
really have about 2.5 companies in all of technology from a multinational standpoint
that have hyperscale cloud. Google certainly has a hyperscale cloud. And I count
Amazon as a half. And the reason I count them as a half is they are not completely
global at this point and they don't have the functionality and redundancy. And when
you think about those two competitors, we have 19 regional data centers across the
world. That is six times more than one of them and two times more than the other.
And so the ability for us to bring market-leading cloud technologies to our
customers exists because we have hyperscale cloud. So the beautiful thing about
that is we didn't come at it from an enterprise perspective down into this particular
space. We came at it from our giant consumer services that we have. We have 400
million people using Hotmail.com which became outlook.com. We have 300 million
people using Skype. And if you look at our services in the cloud, it's allowed us to
participate in this commodity price storage and compute environment and upgrade
those customers to our value added services. In fact, 60% of the customers we've
got on Azure use our value added services. And that number only continues to grow
as we add more and more value added services.
The other thing that's unique about our particular cloud in addition to hyperscale is
the fact that we are the only multinational technology company that gives you public
hybrid and private cloud options and do it in a sincere way. We have those so that
we can help customers build that cloud on their terms. When you think about that
opportunity coupled with the fact that we are also an open cloud, we host IBM, we
host SAP, we host Oracle, we host some Linux, you can develop in the language of
your choice -- .net, Java, C++ on our cloud -- is an incredible opportunity for us to
open that up. So we actually make it very easy for enterprise customers speciﬁcally
to on-ramp and onboard our commercial cloud. And this, coupled with hyperscale,
coupled with our three diﬀerent types of clouds, is something no other company can
oﬀer a customer today.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 15Now, the other thing that I would tell you, particularly in the private cloud space, is
our Hyper-V product for virtualization is on ﬁre. And I'm sure most of you look at the
share numbers. Each and every quarter we go up. Each and every quarter our
biggest competitor in that space goes down. And we are growing at over twice their
rate today. Why? Have a better product, because I'm building out these Hyper scale
multi-million square foot data centers. And I am a third the price. And so when you
are able to get better technology at a third the price and have a compelling value
proposition, customers truly want to do business with you.
The other thing that's very important to customers today is data protection, privacy
and security. And I'm proud to tell you that Microsoft has taken the high road in this
particular space. We have done all the things around creating security pillars and
building it into the data. We don't snoop your email. We don't sell your data. And
this is very important. We were the ﬁrst company on the planet to get the EU model
clause compliance. We work around the world. We are the only multinational
technology company today to have a cloud inside China, a business cloud which is
very important for us. And so you are seeing us scale that data and the cloud
infrastructure that we have. And do so in a very responsible and intentional way.
Built-in security, privacy by design, continuous compliance, having complete
transparency in our services and operations is a very important element of our
Microsoft cloud for the business.
Now, before I close, I thought it would be helpful to talk about Windows. Windows
seems to be on the mind a lot of folks today. Certainly that's a big important
franchise for us as a company. I will tell you this, it's now the third biggest entity
within our company behind the Oﬃce franchise and our enterprise franchise.
The thing I want to tell you about on Windows 10 is in the Windows 10 timeframe,
which we plan to talk about the end-user consumer experiences in the early spring,
we will have a developer preview and be able to talk to that in-depth in the early
summer timeframe. And then by next late summer and early fall, we will be able to
bring out this particular OS. That's the current plan of record.
Now, the thing that I want to tell you about Windows 10 is that it's very unique from
any operating system we've ever built and any operating system that exists today.
We have actually taken those four OSs across our embedded operating system,
which is basically for our Internet of Things and all embedded devices, our mobile
operating system for our phones and phablets and tablets, as well as our laptop and
desktop operating system and our Xbox operating system and build that single
kernel across all of those entities. And the beautiful thing about that is it allows you
to have one platform for drivers and apps.
Now, what does that mean to an enterprise customer? It really means that you are
able to build an application now and have it run across that entire spectrum of
devices tailored to the individual device with minimal touch and changes. So now
you can write that application, have it actually run across Internet of Things, have it
run across your mobile devices, have it run across your laptop and your desktops.
And your TV with Xbox. And you have a common kernel within that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Q - Philip WinslowWe have one developer API now. We have one interface to silicon with Windows 10.
And so that gives us the capability of having one store, which also gives us the
capability of having one experience tailored to every device.
So as you see, this opportunity that we have for Windows 10 is huge by leveraging
the entire ecosystem. We are delivering on this promise with this OS. Today, we
currently have in technical preview the enterprise version. And we are getting great
feedback and Terry and his team are taking that feedback and making real-time
enhancements and improvements based on the number of people that we have
using it in enterprises today.
Windows 10 will be the best enterprise release we've ever done. All of the things that
companies love about Windows 7 will be included. In addition to that, it will have
some incredible features and functionalities around security, privacy, data protection.
It will be thinner, lighter. If you want your UI to look like a Desktop and look like
Windows 7, you can do that elegantly and seamlessly. If you have a touch device, we
can light up the touch experience for you or not. And on and on and on. There are
many, many changes that we put into this particular OS to make it the best one we've
ever done. And our goal is to have Windows 10 run across billions of devices. And
being able to tap into that entire ecosystem from Internet of Things all the way up, as
I said, to the TV is an important element and an important opportunity for us.
So the one experience on every device for everything in your life is the promise that
we are delivering on Windows 10. So we are very excited about where that can go
and the way that we're going to get there. And again, it's going to be a very good
opportunity for us to reinvigorate the entire Windows ecosystem around that.
With that, I'd really say a couple of things. One, the Microsoft momentum is building.
It's building across the cloud. It's building across our key devices that we've done in
ﬁrst party to be able to lead the ecosystem in innovation. The Microsoft Company is
reinvigorated with energy, enthusiasm around productivity and platform in this
mobile ﬁrst and cloud ﬁrst world. And we see the opportunities that we have as
extremely high and extremely opportunistic going forward, greater than anything
we've done in the past. We think it's there for us to be able to get across those dual
users in the marketplace.
With that, I'll pause. And I think we're going to open it up for some questions. And
take the dialogue where you want to take it.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Fantastic. I'll start with some questions before opening up to everyone in the
audience. But what you described is really a very interesting call it year and a half at
Microsoft. You're the new CFO. Obviously, you have a new CEO, Satya Nadella.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04

Page 8 of 15A - Kevin Turner
Q - Philip WinslowI'm wondering if you can talk about kind of what you just ended on here to the
degree, the momentum that you talked about in the business. What are the
leadership changes and you're obviously still COO. What has changed from a
leadership perspective? How is that trickling down into the workforce?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
You know, I think -- look. We have embraced a lot of change. And I think certainly, at
the top, it's wonderful to see a reinvigorated energy around really getting focused
around productivity and platform. And Satya has really crystallized and galvanized
that view for the entire organization. And I think that's a really exciting place for us.
We see that across dual users as truly our unique position in the marketplace to be
able to deliver that.
The engineering organizational changes I talked about that have also landed with
our senior leadership team have changed our company. We are faster; we are more
agile; we are listening to customers better than we ever have. And I think that's
wonderful to see.
The third area I would touch on of these strategic partnerships that we've done
across IBM, Salesforce, Dropbox, Oracle, Cisco -- it's wonderful to see us extending
the platform with these what would generally be very competitive environments and
being able to ﬁnd the right balance between cooperation and competition. And
that's why I used the word coopetition, because we really see that as the future of
the computing platform. And I think that's really customer friendly from that
approach. It allows customers to really vote by what they buy and to have that
freedom of choice and innovation wins in that space.
The last thing I would say is I think there's been a really healthy renewed sense of
ﬁnancial rigor and discipline, particularly around areas that we may have invested in
in the past that didn't make money.
I would tell you there's a real sense of get-healthy plans, getting those things to
proﬁtability or taking other actions that is very refreshing for us as an organization.
And I think culturally I would tell you that there's a real excitement. There's a real
buzz. There's a real energy. And look, nothing breeds acceptance like success. So
we've got to continue to perform and take care of our customers and take care of
our partners in the marketplace. And I think that momentum will only continue to
accelerate.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
And one of the things I thought was very interesting is you ticked oﬀ a lot of those
very meaningful changes that you've made in a very short amount of time. One that
really struck me and I know talking to investors was viewed as very un-Microsoft like,
or kind of against maybe historical dogma was when you actually moved some of
the oﬃce productivity applications to iOS. By the way, I've got them on my phone
and I love them, use them all the time. And many people in the audience have talked
about it at this conference, about using them across multiple devices. What was theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04

Page 9 of 15A - Kevin Turner
Q - Philip Winslow
A - Kevin Turnerstrategy behind it? What made you make that jump. And how does this feed into the
Oﬃce 365 strategy?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
First and foremost, I am thrilled with the changes of bringing it out cross-platform
and something I've been a big advocate for as well. And it allows us to extend that
Oﬃce franchise and bring our services in a new contemporary way to a lot of
platforms that we didn't get the opportunity potentially to participate in. And we
made some business model changes with that, making it free on the iPhone and
diﬀerent things. And you're seeing us work aggressively to make sure that we've got
a great experience across Android and iOS as well as the Windows platform. And so
it gives us the ability to bring in a lot of other services like OneDrive and Yammer
and SharePoint Online. And it opens up a whole new opportunity for us to monetize
the lifetime of that customer in a diﬀerent way than we potentially didn't have in the
past. So we've seen great uptake, 35 million downloads on Apple alone. And that's
great. So we think that there's momentum there. We're going to continue to do that
and make strategic choices around that. And we're also still going to run great on
the Windows platform and continue to bring it along there too. So I think it's a very
smart contemporary way for us to approach that.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Staying with Oﬃce 365 for a moment, because that seems like such a huge
opportunity for you guys. You have talked about the ability to monetize more
frequently, broaden the user base on this. But maybe step through from your
perspective just how you think about it, both for the consumer and particularly at an
enterprise angle, how you bring this to market and what is the opportunity for
Microsoft?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
A lot of our enterprise customers today have an enterprise agreement with us. And
so the transition, the beautiful thing about Oﬃce 365 is it allows us to take an
enterprise customer today and move them very elegantly and seamlessly over to
Oﬃce 365. The power in that says that we're going to keep them current. The
second thing is it gives us the ability to -- we're going to keep them safe and secure
because we're going to patch it for them. So they're going to get to take advantage
of the latest and greatest innovation, we're going to keep them safe and secure. And
it allows them to take advantage of a whole new frontier of computing. And there's
four diﬀerent SKUs for Oﬃce so everyone doesn't have to have one ﬂavor for
everybody. You can actually have four diﬀerent variations depending upon your
depth and breadth that you want to use the product.
So customers, the response of customers have been fantastic around that product.
And it's been very well embraced by the marketplace. And it's a big dog. It's
growing and it pulls and a lot of other opportunities that we have.
So look, across our cloud businesses. And I think you all know the numbers. But
previously we announced the fact that that was more than -- across our commercialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04

Q - Philip Winslow
A - Kevin Turnercloud was more than a $4.4 billion run rate business for us. And it's growing, as you
can see, in the triple digit ranges.
Oﬃce as a franchise, though, is $20 billion. So we still have plenty of opportunity and
upside to move across Oﬃce, Azure and CRM Online. We think about what we call
our core commercial cloud services, we still have plenty of opportunity to move
more and more customers to the cloud.
In the consumer space, again, with our home subscription service and Oﬃce 365 for
Home, we've signed up over 7 million customers. The growth rates on that have also
been very positive for us. Again, it allows us to monetize the lifetime of that
customer, to keep them current, to keep them safe, keep them secure. And it builds
greater product satisfaction over the long-term. So it's upside on both sides. But it's
deﬁnitely a business model change for us. And one that we are very pleased with the
progress and the receptivity of customers, both enterprise and consumer.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
You've got one user set here in Team Winslow at home. So you've got one
subscriber.
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
That's great.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
I'm very happy with the software. Let's talk about the commercial cloud for a bit and
focus on Azure. It's really been fascinating to watch the evolution of Azure, frankly
some platform of service, adding infrastructure, becoming more open, embracing
once again some maybe nontraditional Microsoft areas. Like you just mentioned
Linux and IBM. Let's talk about the momentum there. What are you guys seeing?
What do you think has been the key diﬀerentiator that has built that momentum?
And what are the key milestones that you're looking at going forward?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Look. I think the Azure platform is really important for us. And I think one of the big
declarations that Satya made was, look, everything that we have internally is going to
run on Azure. And the ability to make that migration and move has allowed us to
truly get a cloud, both infrastructure as a service and platform as a service, that will
scale.
We as a company started out with a platform as a service and grew into infrastructure
as a service. Most companies -- most competitors are starting out as infrastructure as
a service trying to become a platform as a service. So we actually have a unique
value proposition there to be able to on-ramp and bring people to the future. And
the future is really about being able to take advantage of an elastic cloud. You can't
take advantage of an elastic cloud until you get the platform as a service. So it's been
very strategic for us in how we both go to market and moving existing infrastructure.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04

A - Kevin TurnerAnd in how we actually are able to help people rewrite applications to take
advantage of the cloud. That's been very important and strategic for us.
The openness to the platform has really allowed us to go in and have conversations.
When you talk about a customer who runs SAP on DB2 or SAP on Oracle databases,
it's a very simple transition for us to be able say let us host those for you in Azure and
let us lead the way and be able to take that. That's been fascinating, candidly, on
being able to get customer uptake and interest around that because they are very
excited about that opportunity. And that helps us bridge, in my view, it opens up new
share of wallet opportunities that we've never had before. And we're just in the
beginning of that because these partnerships, most of them are fairly new. But the
customers I talk to and the customers I visit, which are regularly, they are very excited
and there's a lot of anticipation and opportunity around that and we hope to harness
it.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
I've got enough questions here to ﬁll another 45 minutes. But I'll pause for a minute
because I did promise to let some questions from our audience and we will start up
front.
I want to get your thoughts on pricing relative to Windows 10. You've already
opened the door sort of zero growth rates on 9-inch devices. When you think about
a uniﬁed platform, does Windows 10 kind of go down this path of a loss leader in
trying to keep people within your ecosystem and then upsell everything else on top
of that? How are you thinking about that as you go down this path?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
We haven't announced the Windows 10 pricing framework yet. The one thing I can
tell you that we've not had any conversations on is Windows 10 being a loss leader
for us.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
I hope you don't start losing money on Windows. (multiple speakers)
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
That's not in any conversations that we've had. The thing about it is we've got to
monetize it diﬀerently. And there are services involved. There are additional
opportunities for us to bring additional services to the product and do it in a creative
way. And through the course of the summer and spring, we will be announcing what
that business model looks like. At the same time, it's wonderful to see these 9-inch
and below devices explode because that was an area, candidly, that was blocked out
and I had no share of what was getting built. But it is a very fascinating transition for
us. And ﬁnding new ways to monetize the lifetime of that customer on those
devices? Again, I would tell you we are learning, we are growing and we're smarter
and wiser every day. And we still have some more learning and growing to do in thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04

early part of 2015.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
And your point on the 9-inch devices, you've seen some amazing devices come out.
Just on Black Friday, I was looking at some of those. And (multiple speakers)
potential oﬀ of those --
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
It was shocking. The $199 laptop that HP put out was amazing.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
It was awesome.
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
The HP Stream was what it was. But it's an amazing device.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
It's amazing how quickly you've seen innovation there.
So other questions from the audience? Otherwise I'll keep ﬁring away.
Can you talk a little bit about balance sheet optimization and how front and center
that is in terms of your priorities? The balance sheet optimization like changing with
the capital structure, maybe raising debt and returning more capital back to
shareholders.
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
We continue to, as a leadership team and with our board, look for a very balanced
review. Now, you have -- we're pretty proud of the fact that last year we returned 28%
more. In the First Quarter, we returned 19% more than the year before. And those
are, again, numbers that we are very proud of as an organization. We continue to
look at that from a long-term perspective with our board. And we have a new board
in place. And that's something we constantly review and they constantly review. And
it is something that our company is going to continue to take the right approach for
both short-term and long-term perspectives and create long-term shareholder value.
That's what we are about.

{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
The what?
The momentum that is growing Microsoft, I'm just wondering what kind of situation
this momentum may be slowing down.
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Momentum?
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Where it might be slowing down.
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Momentum? Look. I think most of the momentum that we see in the new product
solutions and services, we are not doing that many large exchange implementations
today. We're doing a lot more Oﬃce 365 migrations. So you are seeing -- when you
take a look at Windows Server 2003, the opportunity we have is moving those
customers to the cloud. And so you are seeing there are some trade-oﬀs there. So it
would be mostly at the expense of moving some of the cloud workloads, taking
some of the traditional on-premise workloads away. That said, products like SQL and
System Center continue to accelerate in their own right. So that would be the true
trade-oﬀs I would say from a momentum perspective. And then certainly from a
macroeconomic standpoint, China and Russia both are very diﬃcult in their own
rights today for multinational technology companies. So momentum-wise, those
would not be areas where I don't think -- I think most companies would say the
same, that aren't as good as they were, at least previously.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Actually, I have a question. You brought up an interesting point on Windows Server
2003 and hitting end of life. That's actually been a big topic. There are a lot of new
conversations here actually from a hardware perspective around the conference.
What do you think that means coming up here for Microsoft and sort of for the
industry? Because there's obviously a lot of focus on XP end of life in the PC world.
What does this mean in the server world?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Sure. I know that we've got great relationships going on with a lot of our partners like
HP and Dell and others. And we are charting the accounts and doing the mapping
and going after those as aggressively as we can. At the same time, we want to
migrate as many of those as we can to the cloud.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-12-04

Q - Philip WinslowFor Microsoft, the majority of our enterprise customers are on an enterprise
agreement today from an annuity perspective. And that's something that is very
accretive to us, being able to move or port someone and get somebody up. So it's
not that big for us inside ﬁnancially as much as it is strategically getting them on a
current modern platform, which we feel very good about. So there's going to be
certainly some opportunities there. But I think our partners are going to see a nice lift
there as we are able to get through these accounts, penetrate them and convert as
many as we can.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
Got it. We have a couple of minutes left. So I'm going to ask a question sort of fast
forwarding 12 months (inaudible) you or Satya or Amy 12 months from now will
hopefully be up on stage Chris and so one of three coming back and saying, okay,
these are the milestones that we hit over the next 12 months. Because you've done
so much over the past 12, what are your key focus points going forward that you
really want to hit?
{BIO 5265779 <GO>}
Look, we want to accelerate our leadership position around productivity and
platform. And those -- in this mobile ﬁrst cloud ﬁrst world, those are the big markers
and true North Stars that we are driving the Company towards. That means we want
more people on deployed and consumed on the products itself. Oﬃce 365, Azure,
CRM Online, those are gigantic focus and momentum behind those areas. And
those are the ones we're going to get behind and drive hard. And I don't think -- I
think as a company we have been very consistent in talking about that. We want to
continue to improve our position in mobile. We want to continue to see Surface Pro
3 do well. We want to have a great launch with Windows 10. Those are very important
for us. And we've got a lot of other solutions, a lot of other products and scenarios.
But I would tell you making sure that those franchises that I just mentioned all are
healthy and vibrant would be very important for us.
{BIO 6300579 <GO>}
We've hit zero on the clock. And I just want to say you guys have made such great
progress in such a short amount of time. I'm really excited see what you guys do the
next couple of months, the next couple of years. (multiple speakers)
