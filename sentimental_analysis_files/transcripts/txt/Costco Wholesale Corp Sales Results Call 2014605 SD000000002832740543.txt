Good morning. And thank you for calling Costco Wholesale Corporation. I am David
Sherwood, Director of Finance and Investor Relations and this morning I will review
with you our sales results for the four-week retail month of May which started on
Monday, May 5 and ended on Sunday, June 1.
For comparable sales results this four-week period is compared to the same four-
week period last year, speciﬁcally Monday, May 6 through Sunday, June 2. May
included 27 selling days in both years due to Memorial Day for our US operations
and the Victoria Day holiday in Canada.

Page 2 of 3Now with regard to sales. As reported in today's press release, net sales for the
month of May came in at $8.78 billion for the four weeks ended June 1, up 8%
compared to the $8.13 billion reported for the same period last year. For the 39
weeks ended June 1, the Company reported net sales of $81.99 billion, an increase of
6% from the $77.13 billion reported in a similar period last year.
Comparable sales results for the four-week and 39-week periods were as follows: in
the US the four weeks was a plus 6, the 39 weeks plus 4; international four weeks
plus 4, 39 weeks plus 2; total Company the four weeks was a plus 6, the 39 weeks
was a plus 4.
Comparable sales for the four-week and 39 week periods, excluding impacts from
gasoline price movement and foreign-exchange, were as follows: in the US the four
weeks was a plus 6, 39 weeks plus 5; international the four weeks was a plus 7, 39
weeks plus 7; total Company the four weeks plus 6, 39 weeks plus 6.
In May gasoline pricing was relatively ﬂat, it was very slightly inﬂationary while
foreign-exchange continued to be a detriment to comps but to a lesser extent than
we've seen in recent months. For the 39-week period both gasoline and foreign-
exchange had a negative impact to sales.
In terms of regional and merchandising categories the general highlights for the
month of May were as follows: on a regional and country basis the US regions with
the strongest results were the Southeast, Midwest and the Bay Area. On an
international basis in local currencies we saw the strongest results in Taiwan, Mexico,
Canada and Korea.
Moving on to our merchandise highlights the following comparable sales results by
category exclude the negative impacts of foreign-exchange. Food and sundries
comparable sales for the month were in the mid-single-digit range. Within food and
sundries the departments with the strongest results were cooler, deli, candy and
liquor.
Comp sales results for hard lines were up low-single-digit year over year. Better
performing departments were automotive, lawn and garden. And (auto). These
results were largely oﬀset by soft sales in electronics and hardware. Consumer
electronics comp sales were a negative low-single-digit for the month.
Soft lines experienced positive comp sales results in the low-double-digit range.
Better performing departments within soft lines included small appliances, apparel
and housewares. Fresh foods experienced positive comp results in the high-single-
digit range for the month. Meat, produce and deli all experienced strong results.
Fresh foods continues to see inﬂation in the mid-single-digit range, the majority of
which is coming from the protein category.
Within ancillary businesses gasoline, hearing aid and optical produced the best
comp sales increases. Gasoline comp sales were up high-single-digits year over year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2014-06-05

Page 3 of 3The average selling price per gallon was 0.5% higher at $3.77 this year compared to
$3.68 last year. Overall gasoline price inﬂation had a very slight positive impact on
May sales.
Weakening foreign currencies year over year relative to the us dollar resulted in a
detriment to our reported May sales of a little less than minus 1%, (inaudible)
international comps for the four-week period came in at plus 7% in local currency but
resulted in a reported comp of plus 4% when converted to the US dollar.
The average transaction was up slightly more than plus 1% year over year which
includes the negative impact of about minus 75 basis points from the combined
eﬀect of foreign-exchange and gasoline inﬂation. Comparable traﬃc frequency was
up a little under plus 4.5%.
Cannibalization for the month of May had a negative impact to total Company
comparable sales of a little over minus 0.5%. Looking ahead the ﬁve-week June sales
month will include 34 selling days for both years reﬂecting observance of the
Independence Day holiday in the US and Canada Day in Canada.
