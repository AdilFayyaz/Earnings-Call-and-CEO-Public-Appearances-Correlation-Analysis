Monday, October 7 and ended on Sunday, November 3. For comparable sales
results, this 4-week period is compared to the same 4-week period last year,
speciﬁcally Monday, October 8 through Sunday, November 4. October included 28
selling days for both years.

international, 4 weeks plus 7%, 9 weeks plus 6%; total Company, 4 weeks plus 6%, 9

In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights for the
month of October were as follows. On a regional and country basis, the US regions
with the strongest results were the southeast, midwest and Texas. On an international
basis, in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Canada, Mexico and Taiwan.
Moving to our merchandise highlights, the following comparable sales results by
category exclude the negative impact of foreign exchange. Food and sundries
comparable sales for the month were in the mid-single-digit range. Within food and
sundries, the departments with the strongest results were candy, frozen foods, deli
and liquor. We experienced a very low level of inﬂation during October for food and
sundries compared to last year. Comp sales results for hardlines were ﬂat for the
month. Better-performing departments were garden, toys and seasonal and oﬃce,
oﬀset by somewhat negative comps in consumer electronics. Softlines experienced
positive comp sales results in the low-double-digit range. Better-performing
departments within softlines included small appliances, jewelry, apparel and
domestics. Fresh foods experienced positive comp sales in the high-single-digit
range for the month. Produce and meat experienced the strongest results. Fresh
foods experienced low single-digit inﬂation for the month compared to last year.
Within the ancillary businesses, hearing aid, optical and pharmacy produced the
best comp sales increases. Gasoline comp sales were down mid to high single digits
year over year. The average selling price per gallon was down 11% at $3.38 this year,
compared to $3.80 last year. Overall gasoline price deﬂation had a negative impact
of a little more than minus 1.25% on October comp sales.
Weakening foreign currencies year over year relative to the US dollar resulted in a
detriment to our reported October comp sales of a little more than minus 1.25%.
Total international comps for the 4-week period came in at plus 7% in local
currencies but resulted in a reported comp of plus 3% when converted to the US
dollar.
The average transaction was down about minus 2.5% year over year, which includes
the (minus 2.5 plus %) combined negative impact from foreign exchange and
gasoline price deﬂation. Comparable traﬃc frequency was up about 6%.
Cannibalization for the month of October had a negative impact to total company
comparable sales of about minus 0.75%.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-11-07
