Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Ross Seymore, the Semiconductor Analyst here at
Deutsche Bank in the U.S. We're very honored to have NVIDIA with us for the next
presentation slot at the AutoTech 2021 Conference. Today from the company we
have the Vice President and General Manager of the Automotive business at NVIDIA,
Ali Kani joining us. We also have Stewart Stecker from Investor Relations. So we're
going to turn it over to Stewart to read a brief forward-looking statement comments
and then we're going to go to Ali for some slides, and then we'll wrap it up with Q&A
after that. I have a list of questions and then if you have any questions, please feel
free to email me those, and I will ask them. It's ross.seymore@db.com.
So without any further ado, why don't I pass it over to Stewart to read the forward-
looking statement. Stewart?
{BIO 17308457 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Ross. And thanks for having us. As a reminder, this presentation
contains forward-looking statements. And investors are advised to read our reports
ﬁled with the SEC for information related to risks and uncertainties facing our
business. Over to you, Ali.
Excellent. I'm not able to see the slides that are being shared. No, now I can see
them. Okay. Hey, everyone. I'm going to quickly talk about our DRIVE platform. So
we always talk about NVIDIA's entire strategy is to be an end-to-end provider for
automotive solutions. So this means from the computer in the car to the data
collection apparatus, to be able to take data into a car properly calibrated and
synchronize the data, sending up to the cloud where we then build AI models. We
build models for perception, for mapping, planning and control. And then we build
a platform where we help simulate that vehicle. And so we have a DRIVE SimFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 2 of 11platform that runs on constellation based on Omniverse, and we use that platform to
accelerate the end-to-end ﬂow of AV development.
We believe that most important diﬀerentiator for any company in AV because it's so
challenging to develop a safe AV experience is a company that has a really eﬃcient
development ﬂow that helps them very easily ﬁnd the issue, root cause the issue, ﬁx
the issue, test the issue and then be able to okay it in the car. And the faster you can
do that, the more successful of an AV company you'll be, and you'll see that NVIDIA
is unique and that we're investing in every part of that ﬂow.
Let's jump to the next slide. At the center of that strategy in our platform is Hyperion
8. And the way I think about this is that Hyperion 8 is, essentially we think of it as like
the ATX form factor of PCs, but it's the form factor for automotive. And so it's a
computer architecture, it's the sensor set, it's the software platform that runs in the
car. We have this drive works middleware software that is fully integrated into our
cloud. We call it DGX infrastructure that runs on MagLev in software that we have.
And so how do you take all that data that comes from the car and in an automated
way, label it and curate it, train our models and simulate it. Everything is connected
to this Hyperion platform architecture. And so when we have customers, if they are
aligned to that Hyperion architecture, we can help them across all of the stack and
we design our platform, so it's easy to go from one generation to the next. So you
could have an architecture based on Xavier computer, you can remove that Xavier
computer and slide in a form factor compatible Orin computer into your vehicle and
we design our software such that it's API compatible. So it's really easy to transition
from generation to generation and leverage your investment, not just across your
cars at one generation but across generations. Hyperion is central to that strategy
and we always talk about it because we can help our customers accelerate to time to
market as long as we sort of aligned to our Hyperion architecture.
Next slide. Okay. So as to the developing AV at the core, you need simulation and
you need real world driving. And simulation ends up being ground truth for our AV
development. And so -- and some types of data that we need is just so hard to ﬁnd in
the real world. It's really hard to come across, let's say, something like road debris,
because there is like millions a diﬀerence of kind of debris that you might ﬁnd on the
road, if you're actually driving, trying to get that data yourself, you never going to be
able to ﬁnd it.
And so we have to use synthetic data generation to build that kind of data and that
data actually is then perfectly labeled and photorealistic, and we built it on
Omniverse. And so at this GTC, we announced having the ability to build that
synthetic data generation platform, we call it, Omniverse Data Replicator for DRIVE
Sim. But the reason why we build it is we need to do it for AV development
ourselves. And so then when we have partners and they align to our Hyperion
architecture, we actually have synthetic data for them that they can immediately take
and it helps them build models that can handle those hard to ﬁnd scenarios in the
real world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-09

Page 3 of 11We just sort of give that for our partners. It accelerates their development and we
kind of appreciate those problems because we're dealing with them ourselves as
we're building this end-to-end platform. And so this Omniverse Replicator is
something very exciting that we're building for our ecosystem in our customer base,
such that we can help accelerate their development just like it's accelerated arts.
Go to the next slide. So I think we just really liked when NEO announced a vehicle
that they're building on Orin. It's going to have four Orins, and it's going to go to
production next year. They mentioned that Tops is the new horsepower for
automotive. And I think what he really means by that, we don't actually think Tops is
the most important thing in the automotive, but the point is computing power is
incredibly important for automotive, because the vehicles are software deﬁned and
they're going to get better over their life.
And so we build our platform to consistently be upgradable. And so when we talk
about going from Xavier to Orin, and for it being Hyperion compatible, what we
mean is that Orin, form factor and computer is designed to be exactly form factor
compatible to the Xavier. So you can just swap it in and then you can provide new
features and functions to your customer base and have new revenues that you can
generate oﬀ of your vehicle.
And the same thing with Atlan. Atlan will be form factor compatible to Orin, such that
it's really easy to go from generation to generation. And what we're doing is we're
constantly upgrading that platform. Here we're talking about chips, but the sensor
set also increases with each of these generations' higher resolution, more sensors,
more diversity of sensors, more advanced networks. And so all of those things drive
the need for higher compete in the cars and that's what we're trying to do is make it
easy for customers to sort of have a partner that can consistently give them higher
performance and make it easy to leverage their investment across generations.
Next slide. Okay. So, at the core of our strategy and our view is that, there is two
fundamental disruptions in automotive outside of electriﬁcation which is of course
happening. One is the AV experience, so doing self driving software, and we talk
about building a stack end to end that delivers that AV experience, we call it Drive
Chauﬀeur because we want the car to be able to essentially have a virtual chauﬀeur
that drive you from place to place, parks you from place to place. And so you'll see
that we're building that entire stack for our partner ecosystem and we design it in
modules such that if you don't want the entire stack, all you want is the computers.
You're more than welcome to just take that from us. But if you actually wanted some
of the software either it could be active safety or parking or AV, we give you the
ability to scale what you take from us based on what is your need and how you want
to diﬀerentiate.
And we also see huge innovation inside the car and we talk about that as the
Concierge experience. What we mean is, once you take all these technologies like
our intelligent virtual assistant who has natural language processing. Once you have
a vehicle that can do that, you can now talk to your car and the car should know
everything about the automobile. So if there is something wrong with light it shouldFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-09

Q - Ross Seymoreknow. I got a sign last week that said that my rear light was broken in my car. You
should just be able to say what is the rear light that's broken? It should tell you, it's
like a halogen or Xenon type of light. And then you could just order it on the spot.
It's fully integrated with everything about you as well as your vehicle and you can
fundamentally change the experience inside a car. These are the two areas that all
AV -- like automotive companies need to invest, and is redeﬁning the experience
inside the car. We call that your concierge. And then redeﬁne how your car can drive
you from place to place, your chauﬀeur experience and NVIDIA is investing in the full
stack for both of those areas.
Next slide. And so with this Hyperion platform, what we're most proud of is the type
of companies we'd like, when we look at this we think these are the companies
building the most disruptive forward thinking software deﬁned platforms in the
industry. Volvo is doing some really exciting work, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and
then all the NEVs, whether it's Nio or Xpeng or Li Auto, where it's the full self driving
companies like Zoox or DiDi or Cruise.
We're kind of partnering, all these guys are our partners because they believe in
software deﬁned development, they are building really advanced solutions. And so
NVIDIA is very successful in both platforms, whether it's Level 2, Level 3, Level 4 or
full self driving across robotaxi or trucks. So when we go to the next slide, when we
sort of take all of those wins together, we have a huge pipeline that's going to be
quite a bit larger than where we're at today. So over the next six years, over an $8
billion pipeline, and it sort of spans all of those types of vehicles that we talked about
from passenger vehicles to commercial vehicles. And it deals with both situations
where we sell just the chips to our partners to full stack situations where we're
building the chips, the full self driving solution and we're providing the end to end
infrastructure that lets you sort of ﬁnd these issues which cause them and ﬁx them
and OTA them in the car as quickly as possible.
Okay, that's all the material that we had planned.

Q - Ross Seymore
A - Ali KaniOkay, great. Well, when we jump into Q&A, again if anybody has any questions just
email me at ross.seymore@db.com. But why don't I kick it oﬀ a little bit with, your
approach, the end-to-end approach, open and modular that you had on your very
ﬁrst slide, you have to be the best at every one of those aspects to pull that oﬀ. So
where do you believe NVIDIA is truly the most diﬀerentiated? Is it the attempt and
the actual success at being fully end to end, or is there one attribute, whether it's the
software, the simulation, the training, the hardware, the semiconductor side that is
the focus more so on the semiconductor analyst like myself? Where do you think you
are truly diﬀerentiated the most?
I think it's in an integrated infrastructure that lets you develop code both in
simulation and the real world with the same software stack, so that you could actually
OTA really quickly. Basically what I'm saying is the secret sauce is in having a
software development ﬂow that is safe and secure which is needed for automotive
safety standards. There is no one in the world that does that. Like how do you build
AI code that needs to be safe and secure with every drop. You can't release buggy
code in an OTA and self-driving vehicles. Well, how do you build code that is AI
heavy in a safe and secure way, it's that software development ﬂow that's end to end
in the infrastructure, and essentially being able to do that is really, really hard. No
one has ﬁgured it out and that's where I think NVIDIA is most diﬀerentiated putting
the development of a vehicle, and in a virtual vehicle together so that you have really
high quality and eﬃcient software development. So I think that's the core
diﬀerentiator.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
And given that historically the automotive companies would iterate at the natural
pace that they could handle by just driving real world miles and it be the more cars
you have on the road with your sensors, the more situations you could record, et
cetera, for mapping in incidents, prevalence and diversity, those sorts of things. Are
the OEMs trusting of a more SIM diversion of getting to the same endpoint or is that
kind of something where you've had to earn their trust over the years?
I think the whole industry knows that you need to do SIM and real world together
now. It's just -- it's too hard of a problem when you have a heavy vehicle and it's
supposed to do self-driving. You can't make any mistakes. And it's impossible to
come across every real-world scenario just by driving your ﬂeet of vehicles. It's just --
it's too hard, right, like imagine in each of our lives, how many times have we seen
something random on the road. And now you're building AI code that's supposed to
ﬁgure it out, if it's never seen it before, how will it handle it, which you have to in
some cases do synthetic data generation. And only if you take synthetic generation
and couple it with what you see in the real world, can you feel like you have enough
diversity such that your AV experience is diverse.
And I say on top of that, you also need a diverse AV stack, not everything is based on
AI. Some of the code that you need in a vehicle needs to use legacy methods just for
that sake, that you might not recognized something, you might not have trained aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 11Q - Ross Seymore

A - Ali Kaninetwork. And so you need maybe in addition to an AI network that sees objects but
something a little bit more legacy that just is optical ﬂow base and you fuse both of
them together. So having a stack that it's not just synthetic generation by real world,
but also has some elements of legacy architecture as well as a modern deep
learning based architecture, you fuse it together, then you -- the combination of both
of those, then you have a really disruptive safe self driving experience.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
And from an NVIDIA technology point of view, are your customers also -- are you
basically running all of this for them? You have the DGXs, you have the constellation,
you have all of that. Are they wanting to take on some of the technology themselves,
whether it's your supercomputer enabled development, so you sell them DGXs. How
does the kind of the relationship across this open and modular capability reside with
NVIDIA or with the customer or is that the part that you really are ambivalent
between -- or agnostic between each of those?
Yeah, that's a great question, and it's always up to the customer. And part of it's
good to kind of be able to explain this. We have cases where customers don't use us
at all in the car. But they buy infrastructure from us to train their networks. And some
of them are our biggest customers. So you don't even need to use us in the car, you
have to buy our chips in the car to be someone that we can help with DGXs and
simulation.
We have some customers who just who buy chips from us and they had their own
strategy for training and simulation. We have many cases where people are buying
chips from us and using us for training and simulation. And we have some cases
where people are buying chips from us, as well as the software in the car and using
us for training and simulation. And so it literally is based on what the customer wants
and where they feel they need. And the fact that we're developing at full stack in end
to end, it gives us the opportunity to help them in more places, but it's just up to
them. In many cases, they have the expertise and they don't need our help and that's
great. And we sort of say just tell us how we can help you and we will just help you in
those speciﬁc ways.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
If we look 10 years down the road, where do you think NVIDIA would be adding the
most value in the car or in the development side of the equation?
It's balanced. It's mix, and I think both of them are huge once in a lifetime
generational opportunities. And I believe that both of them are just starting because
today most of the cars are active safety cars, right. It's just like it keeps you from
getting in an accident. It's not really driving you, but that will change over time where
essentially every car one day will be able to drive you from any place to any place.
And so that needs much higher performance computers and much more advancedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 11Q - Ross Seymore
A - Ali Kani
Q - Ross Seymoresoftware in the car. And we're uniquely positioned to be able to deliver that kind of a
computer and software driving solution.
And then in the infrastructure, the training and simulation that you need for active
safety is really minor. But then you look at what Tesla talks about in terms of another
building in L2 plus experience. And they have a really big infrastructure, right. They
have announced, they have close to 10,000 GPUs. They've announced it themselves.
So that's how big their infrastructure is. That's just L2 plus and a million cars a year.
There is a 100 million cars a year, which can be not just L2 plus but L4. And so that
market is going to be many 10 times larger. I think of it as there's only a few million
cars a year that needed today an L2 plus, while every car will needed an L4. So it's
going to be like a 100 times in size and it's already a very large business for us. So I
think it's not one, I think it's both, and I think they're both generational opportunities.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Within the car itself, how do you see the processing power being delivered? Do you
think there is one chip to rule them all the supercomputer in the trunk more
diversiﬁed or more distributed around the vehicle closer to the sensors? How does
NVIDIA envision that because there's diﬀerent companies seem to be attacking it in
diﬀerent ways. And it of course depends if they're trying to enable L2 plus or L 4/5,
but how do you envision the distribution of the processing power?
Well, so when we think about a software-deﬁned car, the decisions and criteria of
platform architecture selection will change. And we're seeing it already with some
vendors like Volvo and Mercedes-Benz and the NEVs like Tesla, Nio, Li Auto, XPeng.
They are centralizing their architecture. And the reason why you do that is that it's
easier to support and maintain that vehicle over its life.
If you have like -- there is vehicles that have a 100 computers in them. How do you
OTA, how do you update and manage that over the c the car. It's really, really hard.
But when you centralize the architecture and you sort of have more centralized
approach, it's easier to maintain and update that vehicle and to do it in a safe and
secure way, which is critical for AV. And so I think you will see more and more data. I
think it's just to me, it's no doubt that the whole industry will move that way and it's
already happening and it's because the industry is starting to recognize that there
really is a great transformation where these cars are becoming software deﬁned
vehicles that will get better after the day they leave the lot. And you going to have to
kind of create new features and functions over the life of that vehicle. It's not like the
car is at its best, the day it sold. But it will get better after you buy it. And so then you
want to have an architecture that's easy to program and update. And so then you get
that bigger computer in the middle. So I think that will deﬁnitely happen, and we're
still starting to see that transition already in a big way.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
You mentioned when you're watching the video that that vehicle was self-driving and
it is a vision-based system, talk about the sensing modalities that NVIDIA supports. I
know you don't have the sensing side itself, but you'd be the processor for the dataFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 11A - Ali Kani
Q - Ross Seymore
A - Ali Kanithat those create. So talk about which of the sensing modalities you believe will be
most prevalent going forward as we move to L 4/5?
So we do have the sensing. So like Mercedes-Benz as an example, we're going to be
doing all of the camera perception, radar perception and light our perception and
driving stack. But so I think there is a place for camera radar for passenger cars and I
believe that when we get to self-driving, we need to see if there is innovation in
radar. There's some really exciting radars coming up on the imaging radar side. And
it's possible to do full self driving with camera and imaging radar. And I believe that
you have to have at least two sensor modalities, because there are some cases that a
camera will not see something and you want a redundant way to see it, right. And so
you want that second modality.
And so at least camera and radar, and once you get full self-driving, we see a need
for lidar, we're certainly going to support lidar in our Hyperion architecture. And one
of the platforms that we're taking to market will have camera radar and lidar. And I
think lidar does have a good role when you deal with stationary small objects,
because a camera can see it and our radar is not so good at seeing like a piece a
brick on the ﬂoor because it's not moving. And radar won't even see it. So you kind
of beneﬁt from having that lidar to see that. And so I do see value in lidar as well
when you get to sort of full self driving functionality.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
So we did have a question from one of the investors. And so I'll just read it verbatim.
How does NVIDIA system compared with Tesla self driving software live updated
data and ecosystem with over 1 million cars on the road creating and storing real
data, not just the synthetic data that NVIDIA is talking about?
Okay. So I think from a platform side, we're much more open, right. So, NVIDIA's
platform is we have a developer platform, we see to the entire community and
people are building AV software on our platform themselves. And so the rate of
innovation and speed that you'll see on the DRIVE platform is really, really fast and
fastest in the industry in my opinion, because it's not just NVIDIA software
development speed versus Tesla. There is all these customers that we just talked
about the Zoox and the cruises. They're building some great software on our
platform and sometimes, some people want L4 and you get the beneﬁt from that
developer ecosystem that is on the DRIVE platform that you don't have on Tesla
because the only person programming at Tesla is Tesla.
Then as far as self-driving experience, I mean, we showed you guys that drive it's an
L2 plus drive. You can't do it on a Tesla today. So I feel like we are best-in-class.
They're doing some really great work. I think, Tesla and XPeng are building
production cars today, the best self-driving software. But I think other than them we
are the other best option available on the market. And where we try to diﬀerentiate
is there is a developer ecosystem. They can diﬀerentiate even faster than us.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-09
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Q - Ross Seymore
A - Ali KaniAnd then of course we tried to progress faster. And I think the two years ago, Tesla
was driving better than we were. But today we're doing scenarios that they can do.
And so we'll see who ends up full self driving faster. But we feel really good about
the investments we're making in our strategy and we think that speed of
development ﬂow really is critical to be successful long terminating.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Great. Thanks for that answer, Ali, and thanks for the questions from the audience. If
anybody else has any questions just email me. Why do we switched to the business
model side of the equation because there some interesting implications on that.
Some of the move to autonomy has taken longer. We've been talking about this. I
think we've been holding this AutoTech Conference for seven years or something.
But it seems to be rapidly approaching ﬁnally.
The rub [ph] I sometimes get into is who pays for this functionality. You guys look like
you're getting -- taking a diﬀerent business model at least with one of your partners
with Mercedes and more of a subscription model. But if we start from the beginning,
what's the general cost adder you see to adding autonomy to a vehicle, Ali? And
how do you think that gets passed along and oﬀset in some way, shape or form.
Does it have to be a change in the business model with your customers, not
necessarily just the sharing of revenues between a supplier NVIDIA and the
customer but also between the customer and their end-user as well?
Okay. So ﬁrst, you know, I think there is a fundamental transition here where the
industry recognizes that these vehicles are software deﬁned. And when you do that it
has a fundamental change in your business model pricing strategy. First, if you have
a software deﬁned platform, you want the highest performance computer and
sensor set that you can have in that computer every time you release a vehicle. You
guys see that iPhone does that, right. It's always the best newest SLC ﬁrst launches
on the iPhone and then they put the best sensors they can for the camera, and they
launched that vehicle. And then over time, and they tried to sell that product
relatively aggressively, because there is a lot of features and functions and services
they can provision after the device is sold. And so what we ﬁnd is these customers
when they're making their decisions, think of it like that, hey it used to be -- by the
way some people still do this, they say, hey, I just want like the cheapest and cap car
that I could build. It's not something NVIDIA is building because they are not
thinking about it software deﬁned. But when you start thinking about a software
deﬁned, you say I want to put the best computer and the best sensor set on this car,
and we want to sell that car cost eﬀectively to our customer base and then we're
going to sell services over time.
And so then the business model and the pricing model changes where you want to
sell as many cars as you can, because the value of your platform is the size of your
installed base. So they're not trying to take this investment, just raise the price of the
vehicle. They want to take that investment and sell as many of those platforms as
they can. Over the life, they'll have a larger installed base. And the value of that
installed base is far more important and valuable to our partners, then they spendFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-09

A - Ali Kanilike an extra $100 on the computer in the car. So I think we see that transition and we
see customers thinking of it as that kind of a platform. So they are not trying to
increase the price of the vehicles as much as increase the installed base of vehicles
that have the ability to be upgraded and add new features and functions over the life
of the customers.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Got it. We have about one to two minutes left. So why don't I just ask the last
question which is, you are running -- your automotive business at NVIDIA is running
$500 million, $600 million a year right now. You talked about an $8 billion pipeline
that's I think a six-year pipeline. Walk us through, going from $600 million to $8
billion or $1.5 billion or so on an annual basis? What's the sort of trajectory that we
should as investors follow?
I think ﬁrst it starts with Orange ramp which happens sort of in the second half of
next year. So just as it ramps up, we've announced wins with many companies. You'll
ﬁnd that China NEVs will go to production fastest because they are more start up
[ph] and have a faster development ﬂow than what you would expect from a typical
traditional OEM. And so we talked about how you will see that transition happen in
the second half of next year. You will see an uptick there, and then you'll see the
pipeline numbers. So you know if the -- if we're running at $500 million to $600
million a year today, the average over six years is over $1 billion a year, you're going
to see uptick over those six years, and we will see some attractive growth over this
pipeline timeframe.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
And do the margins expand too with that or that whole size of the installed base
being the focus initially with that subscription model and services model mean
maybe the margins don't go up initially, but over time there is a nice tailwind behind
them?
Yeah, that's the right way to think about it is that hardware margins are hardware
margins and they are fairly consistent, but the software potential scales up over the
life of the car after the car is sold and that will provide increased proﬁt opportunity
for NVIDIA.
{BIO 20902787 <GO>}
Perfect. Well, Ali, thank you so much for your time. I know you're exceedingly busy
these days, and we'd like to see your dog popping in and saying hi, behind you as
well. If anybody has any questions on this just email me, we can get them through to
the folks at NVIDIA. Thanks to Stewart as well. And with that we're out of time, so
we'll wrap it up. Thanks, again.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-12-09
