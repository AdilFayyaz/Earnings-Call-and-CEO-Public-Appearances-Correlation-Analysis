{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
Good morning. Welcome to the dbAccess Global Consumer Conference 2017. I'm
Paul Trussell, the U.S. broadline and apparel retail analyst. I'm very happy to have you
all with us today.
Very glad to kick the conference oﬀ with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Very happy to have
with us today the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Brett Biggs. I
also want to deﬁnitely acknowledge Steve Smith of Investor Relations right here in
the ﬁrst row.
This morning, Brett will kick things oﬀ with a few opening comments around the
ﬁnancial framework. And then we'll go into a ﬁreside chat conversation that will also
have some time for Q&A from you guys. We just ask that if you have a question, to
raise your hand and wait for the microphone.
And with that, Brett?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
All right, yes, thanks for having us this morning. Appreciate your interest in Walmart.
If I can get -- do I need to point it at something speciﬁc, Paul? There we go. You all
want to see the forward-looking statement, I know that. That will get the conference
kicked oﬀ in an exciting way. This is in -- on our website. If you have any questions
about our forward-looking statement, you can go to our website, as I might be
making forward-looking statements this morning.
I want to start out this morning just a little bit talking about our recent results in the
context of our ﬁnancial framework, which you would have seen and we introduced
last October. Start with, as we always do with the company, start with growth and
strong, eﬃcient growth. And what we mean by strong, eﬃcient growth is, we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 2 of 13going to grow as a company. As a retailer, you need to grow. But we want to grow in
the right way. We want to grow in a way that's capital-eﬃcient for the company and
return-eﬃcient for shareholders.
As you have seen in the First Quarter, good comp sales, particularly in Walmart U.S..
And that's continued really for a couple of years in the U.S. business. And that's what
we want to do, we want to grow comp sales. And you would -- that includes e-
commerce growth. And you would've seen a very strong e-commerce growth of 63%
in the First Quarter. Now there's acquisitions in that number. And as we have
opportunities to make acquisitions that are helpful to us from an assortment
standpoint or from a capability standpoint, we want to take the opportunity to do
that. But the majority of that growth was still from our organic business. So we were
really pleased with the growth numbers in the First Quarter.
On operating discipline, you've heard us talk quite a bit about two things. One will
be expenses and another will be working capital. From a working capital
perspective, over the last couple of years, we feel good about our discipline from
that standpoint, both on the inventory side as well as the payables side.
And so we feel good about cash ﬂow. We had a record level of operating cash ﬂow,
as you know, last year. So we're pleased with that.
From an expense standpoint, we still have work to do. We've been talking about this
for quite a while. And we've taken the opportunity in the last couple of years to
invest in technology and e-commerce and wages in the stores. But we know, over
time, we've got to get back to leveraging expenses. And we did leverage expenses
in the stores in the First Quarter. And we're glad to see that. So I think it's a good
start to what we want to continue to do from an expense standpoint.
And we know capital allocation is very important to you as investors. And there's a
number of things that I think are showing progress there. Back in October, we talked
about, if you went back a few years ago, a great majority of our capital was in new
stores and particularly in the U.S. and we've slowed down new store growth in the
U.S. Now you're seeing more of our capital go toward remodels, ensure that we
keep our ﬂeet with a good customer value proposition. You've seen us put more
money into technology. And that's technology both to help the customers. So front-
facing technology as well as back-end technology will help us work diﬀerently as a
company. As we look at leveraging expenses, that kind of technology is really
important for what we do going forward.
And you've seen us make decisions. You've seen us take our e-commerce business
in China in Yihaodian and partner with JD.com, which has been a really good
partnership for us in China. And you've seen us make decisions in a country like
Mexico, where we've sold a bank, we've sold a restaurant chain, we've sold an
apparel chain; all 3 of which were good businesses, just not core to what we want to
do in a country like Mexico. So we want to be smart with how we spend our money.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13

that.
So with that, I'll just turn it back to you.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
Well that's helpful opening, Brett. And you touched on it. But going back to same-
store sales, you guys have had some momentum of late. First quarter showcased,
once again, positive traﬃc, with strong e-commerce growth. If you can narrow it
down to a few factors, what have been the main drivers of that sustained comp
momentum, especially in a backdrop across the U.S. where a lot of your retail peers
have not been able to have the same level of success?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Traﬃc certainly is key for us, key for any retailer. And you would have seen in the
last -- take a 2-year stack, would've been about a 3% comp in traﬃc, which is unusual
a bit today in the retail environment. And I think there's a number of diﬀerent things.
And I'd go back to a lot of the work that Greg Foran and the team -- just speak
speciﬁcally about the U.S. -- Walmart U.S., that they've taken over the last few years.
Greg is a retailer. I mean, he is -- I've described Greg before as maybe the closest
thing to Sam Walton in quite a while in Walmart. He just knows how to run stores and
how to motivate people. The amount of work that we put in being in-stock, it's
important. You need to be -- you have product on the shelf. It's amazing, it sells when
you have it on the shelf.
And despite taking inventory down 6%, 7% really a couple of years in a row on a
comp basis, having in-stocks go up is incredible performance. What we put into
wages and in training over the last couple of years, I think sometimes the training
piece gets missed on that. But putting that -- those -- that investment into training
has made a diﬀerent associate experience. And along with that, we have more
associates back on the ﬂoor with some of the work we've taken out of the back end
and some of the work we've taken out of the front end has allowed us to put most
department managers back in. If you go into a Walmart today in the U.S., you will see
more people on the ﬂoor as you go around. That helps with the customer
experience as well.
Being sharp on pricing. We talked about we're -- we always -- pricing is not an on/oﬀ
switch for us. But 18 months ago, we talked about that we were going to put several
billion dollars into pricing. Price matters and it will always matter. And so customers
noticed that as well. But I think it's just an overall experience. Fresh is much better
than it was a couple of years ago. Fresh is a big traﬃc driver for us, any food retailer.
And will continue to do so. So I don't think there's any one thing, I think there's
several things that have helped us on the comp side.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 13A - Paul Elliott Trussell
A - Brett M. Biggs{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
Absolutely. And as we drill down into the comp performance in the First Quarter, e-
commerce, walmart.com, aided the comp by 80 basis points, which was surprising to
The Street. And really hands (sic) hats [ph] oﬀ to the team on that type of
performance. Walk us through how you've built the infrastructure to generate that
level of performance. And also, does your success on your e-commerce platform,
does it alter the thought process around store count and how you utilize the stores?
And maybe you can just discuss also how we should be thinking about the longer-
term proﬁt algorithm, given the success you're having in e-commerce.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
A lot in that question. Go back a couple of years ago, the growth rates in e-
commerce were -- and we came out and said this, is not what we wanted to be. It
was single digits. But we said we are laying the foundation for what we think is going
to be good over time. And that was putting money into the systems, putting down
our fulﬁllment center network. At that time, over two years, we put in 5 fulﬁllment
centers. And we said be patient a little bit. And there's a lot of that, that is starting to
play out. And where it plays out -- so the fulﬁllment center really allows things like
the 2-day shipping, 2-day free shipping over $30. It allows us to get the assortment
in the right place to be able to do that in an eﬃcient manner. The systems work that
we did allowed us to dramatically increase the marketplace on our site. So back
about a year ago, we had around 10 million items online, now we have over 50
million items online. Now 50 million is still not as much as some of our competitors
would have.
The diﬀerence between 10 million and 50 million is a big diﬀerence. Over time, I
think we'll ﬁgure out what the right number of SKUs would be online. So having that
foundation put in place. And then you combine that with acquiring Jet a little less
than a year ago. And the team that Marc Lore has brought with him, along with the
team that we had at walmart.com, has allowed us to accelerate some things and do
some things -- you're talking about, how do you put this together with your stores,
that's where we win, long term, it's putting this together with our stores. So Marc,
working with Greg Foran, things like Pickup Discount. So items that aren't in our
stores that you can go online and we'll give you discount to pick it up in the stores.
Gives the customer good value, also gets you in our stores; one of the types of
things that only we can do. The trial of associate delivery is something that, again, we
think that only we can probably do and have the scale to potentially do it at scale at
some point.
All those things are unique to us. And that's what we want to focus on. We want to
play our game, which is a combination of these businesses. From a proﬁtability
standpoint, we've got to look at it from a holistic standpoint as Wal-mart, Inc.
Certainly, we know what the proﬁtability is, the pieces of how we do this. But as a
management team, what we're focused on is how do we pull it together in a way,
how do we pull the right levers in a way that, as investors, you're happy with what
you see from an earnings perspective and a cash ﬂow perspective. And over time,
we've just got to make sure that, that works together in a way that makes sense. ButFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13

A - Brett M. Biggswe want to be there for the customer. And we just got to ensure that we're doing it in
a way that's investor-friendly as well.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
So to continue on the e-commerce conversation, talk to us then maybe about the
positioning of Jet.com relative to walmart.com. And how we should think about
some of the bolt-on acquisitions that have been made over the past year and where
this can go.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Jet, obviously, was the big acquisition in that. And Jet and walmart.com are separate
today, particularly from a front-end perspective. And anticipate that being the case.
Jet has a diﬀerent customer base, not entirely diﬀerent. But a little more urban, a
little more higher income. And so the interesting thing, too, about having another
website -- now we have several more with Moosejaw and choose.com [ph] and
ModCloth, is you can try things with a brand that you may try on one brand, you may
not try on the other. It gives us a way to test and do some other things. But Jet, from
a technology standpoint, from a talent standpoint, from a capability standpoint, I
think from a customer standpoint, was a diﬀerentiator for us. And it did accelerate
some things that you've seen us do on walmart.com.
The 3 smaller acquisitions that we did subsequent to that, we do get some questions
on those. And certainly, you like the sales you get out of it. But for us, it's more about
the capabilities of the people inside those companies, the ability to have maybe
diﬀerent brands than we would have had. By having those brands, it then potentially
has other brands that think diﬀerently about you, having a diﬀerent assortment,
having category experts. So if you think about a company like Moosejaw, that's an
outdoor gear company. We brought in people that really know that category. In
addition to that, over time, it does allow you to mix out diﬀerently. We believe these
acquisitions are in categories where we're a bit under indexed as a company. You
can do at marketplace. But we felt like we were a little under indexed where we
should be in these categories. And they're categories with somewhat higher
margins. And so if you can bring that into ﬁrst party versus third party, it does allow
you to have a little bit of a margin mix inside your e-commerce business, getting
back to your proﬁtability question. So a lot of diﬀerent aspects to those acquisitions.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
Makes sense. So your biggest category, grocery. Talk a little bit more around some of
the initiatives that Greg and team have put in place to drive success in Fresh, in
particular. Maybe give us an update on the Pickup that you all have been rolling out
from a grocery standpoint. And maybe for the investors here in the room, discuss a
little bit more around the competitive environment around grocery. You obviously
have some foreign entrants that is quite a bit of the buzz in conversation. To what
extent is that something you're very mindful of? And how do you think about
assortment and price and strategy given the rollout of those new concepts?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 13A - Paul Elliott Trussell
A - Brett M. BiggsFresh has been and will be a very, very important part of our business going forward.
You -- as a big box retailer, you need food, I think, to drive traﬃc into your stores.
And we've put a lot of eﬀort in that. In the last 2 or three years, Greg Foran, Steve
Bratspies and his team, a number of initiatives over the last couple of years, which
have now rolled out to pretty much all of the chain. And one would just be how you
merchandise Fresh. When you come in, does it pop? Do you have good sight angles,
where you can see Fresh and is that the thing you notice when you come in our
stores? It needs to be the thing you notice. So that's important. But more importantly
are what we've done around training with our Fresh managers, what we've done
around training around calling a product. Also, we've been able to take 1 to two days
out of the supply chain over the last couple of years, which is a big deal, because not
only does it -- is it fresher in the store and you have -- and actually, you've culled a lot
of that Fresh before it even gets to the store. But more importantly, when you take
those bananas or grapes to your house, they should stay fresh for a couple of days
longer. And customers notice that. That's where they really notice it, is in their home.
So we put a lot of eﬀort, a lot of work and a lot of resources into the Fresh business,
because it has to be a huge part of what we do going forward.
It is a very competitive business, as you know. You mentioned a competitor coming
in shortly over on the East Coast. We're very mindful of them. We're mindful of
anybody, actually, that would like to compete with us. But there -- speciﬁcally about
Lidl, they're a great competitor. ALDI has been in the U.S. for quite a while and
they're a really good competitor as well. We -- just a little bit north of here, in the
U.K., I think anybody in the U.K. has learned some lessons about discounters and
about how you compete better with those discounters. And we've had the
opportunity to know that they're coming. So as we think about price, as we think
about assortment, it's got to be tight. It's got to be really in a good place with the
customer. That's always been the case with us. But usually, we feel like good
competition just makes us better. And I think that's likely to be the case here as well.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
And so this is a little bit kind of big picture. But obviously, we're always talking about
the productivity loop. And what are some of those puts and takes as we think about
factors that are going to impact margin going forward? Obviously, at the recent
shareholders meeting, you, yourself spoke about still a need to get better on the
expense front. What are those focus areas and opportunities for the team going
forward?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It's -- there's a lot of pieces to that puzzle as you think about gross margin, you
think about expenses. And we know that investors are certainly mindful of our
operating margin and what that might be longer term. We think there's a lot of
diﬀerent ways to kind of get to the same answer of what your operating margin
might look like over time. A number of things go into gross margin. And there's
several that we've talked about in the past few years. One is we've gotten better at
buying product. And that's helped our gross margin even as we've been investing in
price. We're buying better than we used to. And that helps. We're always looking for
eﬃciencies and logistics. And a good piece of that ends up rolling through your cost
of goods as well. We're focused on gross margin rate, more focused on gross marginFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 13A - Paul Elliott Trussell
A - Brett M. Biggsdollars. And you were talking about the productivity loop. And the productivity loop
is really about lower expenses. So reaching lower prices so you can grow sales so
that you can lower costs. And over time, I think the market, to some degree, will
determine, within reason, what gross margin should be in any kind of business.
And I think you have to be prepared for gross margins to be at diﬀerent levels. And I
think we are and will be prepared for that. Our SG&A is around 21% as a company.
It's -- we've invested in some things; we talked about, wages, technology, e-
commerce, intentionally over the last couple of years. And SG&A has gone up. But
we know, over time, that number needs to be lower than 21%. And as you get that
number lowered, just gives you even more options about how you manage gross
margin, how you manage your operating margin. And eventually how it ﬂows to free
cash ﬂow, which is most important to shareholders. So we're very mindful of the
productivity loop. I think you saw it -- you've seen it back in action again a little bit in
Walmart U.S. stores in the First Quarter. And so that's a good data point for us.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
So a little bit earlier, you alluded to experience, obviously, competing with the hard
discounters in the U.K. Maybe let's just talk a little bit about the international
business. The performance and kind of new team in Asda, maybe just give us an
update there. And also some other data points maybe that we should be mindful of
across some of your other countries.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Sure. Yes. As you heard us talk about, we're extremely focused on North America.
And particularly the U.S. That's our biggest business. We continue to have a very
strong business with Walmex in Mexico. I think Walmex is one of the best retailers in
the world. Candidly, it just happened to sit inside of Walmart. Canadian business
continues to be good, pleased with the progress there. And we'll continue to be very
focused on China. We continue to build stores. Sam's Club has a really good format
force in China. We think there will be room for stores for quite a while in China. Some
of the bigger cities, you're seeing move much more quickly to e-commerce. And
that's why we made some of the decisions we made around the alliance with
JD.com. And that we had a nice e-commerce business in China. But when you
looked at the scale of what JD was doing, what Alibaba was doing, just felt like we're
better oﬀ with a partnership from an e-commerce perspective, which also gives them
access to our stores and Sam's Club and like I said, we've been really happy with
that. But China is going to continue to be an important market for us.
India is a market, over time, that I think, whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 30 years from
now, we'll be glad we're in India. And I think there's a lot of growth opportunities
there. The U.K. has been a tough market, everybody knows that, particularly for the
big 4. The discounters have made an impact in the U.K. We're happy with what the
management team at Asda is doing. Really, just a number of things that we did in the
U.S. is getting back to retail basics. It's making sure you're pricing is right, making
sure your stores look good, making sure you're in-stock, some innovation around
merchandising. And we're starting to see the gap between us and the market close.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13

the progress there.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
And with that, we'd like to open it up to any questions from our audience. A
microphone is coming up. Thank you.
Curious about how you've been taking inventory out for the last -- you've done such
a great job for the last few years, 6%, 7%. Curious, how did you get back into stock,
taking all that inventory out. And where are you on that kind of cycle? Are you
ﬁnished? Are you, kind of, is that an ongoing initiative?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. It's always an ongoing initiative. I think, if Greg were sitting here, he would say
he still has more work to do in the stores. It's really -- it seems counterintuitive that
you can lower inventory and actually be better in-stock. It's actually pretty much
exactly how it works, in that as you lower inventory, you move it less; associates can
ﬁnd it, you can get it closer to the shelf; you're having less in the back room; more
that's sitting on the shelf. And some of that's come from some of the disciplines that
Judith McKenna and Greg have put in the stores of using more technology in the
back room. It goes all the way back to the DCs and how you're ﬂowing goods a little
diﬀerently, holding a little bit more back in the DCs, not pushing so much out to the
stores and ensure that they can handle it when it gets there. And so what -- a lot of
times merchants will say, "I need more merchandise to increase sales." That's not
always the case. You need the right merchandise to increase sales. But just having
more of it in your stores actually can be very counterproductive to trying to get more
sales. So it's a number of diﬀerent things. I think there's still things that we can do
better. But the last couple of years have been pretty spectacular as far as inventory
performance.
A question about the pickup in-store initiative that's been rolled out to, I guess, a
little less than 20% of the U.S. store base. Can you update how that initiative is
trending so far?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I missed it. I think it was part of your 3-part question that I missed, was Online
Grocery. So we're in a little over -- almost 700 stores now on Online Grocery. It's still
a fairly small part of our overall business. But it's been some of the best NPS scores
that we've had in, I think, any initiative we've done inside the company. I think it's
given us a bit of a halo impact as well with customers. Think about particularly busy
moms with kids in the backseat that don't want to come in the store. The ability to
order groceries, come up and within 5 minutes you've got your groceries, once you
pull up, in your trunk. So we like what we see. We're putting -- we'll continue to roll
this out. We're trying to make it even more eﬃcient as we put into new stores, we're
making sure the sightlines are good, the drives are good. And as we build newFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13

A - Paul Elliott Trussellstores, it's a big part of what we do is looking at the pickup element of the store. But
really excited about it.
Is the expectation (inaudible) to roll it out nationwide?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We'll continue to roll it out where it makes sense. And there's some stores that --
these stores weren't built with this in mind. Every once in a while you have a store
that just doesn't work as far as the ingress and egress of the store. But where we can,
where it makes sense, we want to do it. I don't think you have to do it in every store
to cover an area. I think we'll look at what makes sense to make sure that we can
cover diﬀerent areas.
In the U.S., you've done a great job driving same-store sales. And also in the U.S.,
you've done an even better job driving e-commerce growth. And if we take current
trends, it's not too hard to envision a scenario in the future where e-commerce is
more than 100% of the same-store sales growth. Do you agree with that? And if so,
can it be done in a way that's economically attractive?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We -- again, I'll go back to what I said earlier. What we want to do is put it together.
The customer, over time, is going to determine how they want to shop. And we want
to ensure that we can be there on all those occasions. There's people that are going
to want things shipped to their house, people are going to pick up online groceries,
people are going to want to come in stores. I think stores are going to play a part in
this company and in retail for a long, long time. We've got to make sure that we're as
eﬃcient as we can be in each one of those parts of the business. I think, over time -- I
can't remember, Paul, whether you and I talked about this, over time, it's going to be
more diﬃcult, actually, I think for us to breakout exactly whether it's coming from e-
commerce, whether it's coming from the stores, because where we win is where it
comes together. Then we've got to ensure that the proﬁtability of that mix works and
that it's investor friendly. So we don't give -- we haven't given guidance, I think the
kind of thing that you're looking for there. But what we want to do is have an
expense structure, a margin structure in place that allows us to be ﬂexible in how we
win with the customer and how we win with investors as well. So I know I didn't
exactly answer your question. But we need it to come together.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
And maybe just to continue along that discussion though, Brett, maybe talk about
some of the more speciﬁc items you all have tested and rolled out of late, such as
the discounts to pick up some of the online items in-store. You obviously did
mention the 2-day shipping a little bit earlier. Just some of those eﬀorts to really
integrate the stores and dot-com, Ship from Store. Maybe if you can just elaborate a
bit on some of those eﬀorts.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13

Sure, it's a great partnership. And I've had investors ask who came up with these
ideas. And it really takes both of the groups, both the stores business as well as the
e-commerce business. And also within Sam's, e-commerce business at Sam's sits
within The Club business. But I would say the same thing for Sam's Club. This is
where we win, is getting the stores and e-commerce store together. 2-day shipping
has -- it's really good, I know even from a personal standpoint. If you look at -- if you
go back a year ago to shopping at walmart.com to now, the 2-day shipping, you
have 50 million items instead of 10 million items. It's hard for me to ﬁnd something
now that I can't ﬁnd in walmart.com. Big diﬀerence from a year ago. The Pickup
Discount, we want you, as a customer, if you're willing to go to the store and save
yourself some money, we're good with that, because the best way -- the most
eﬃcient way for us to get a good delivered is to the store. We're sending full
truckloads, palletized. And if I can send that along with a truck that's already going to
the store, that's incredibly eﬃcient. And if you want to save money, then we win and
you win. If you want it delivered to your house, we'll do that as well. So however you
want it, that's how we're going to get it to you. And we're going to let you share in
the beneﬁts of that. So it's just -- any way that we can run our play, I think, in the past,
we probably have been a little bit responsive to some things in the market. And now,
I think we're playing a little more oﬀense.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
And just a follow-up in terms of something that you actually tried and walked away
from with ShippingPass and Jet.com, obviously, when it started had a membership.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Membership, right.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
That is no longer the case. Amazon recently rolled out an initiative to kind of provide
a discounted prime membership to individuals on government assistance. I mean,
does that -- what are your thoughts on that from them and their eﬀorts to really
penetrate a lower-income consumer? Because it seems like you didn't ﬁnd a
membership rewarding.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We have a membership in Sam's Club. So we have a -- we do have a piece of our
model that's membership-based. We're going to try things. We're going to -- I think,
as a company, we're better than we used to be at trying things. And if you stop it, it's
not failure, you tried something. And from ShippingPass really came 2-day shipping.
And go back to even 30 years ago as a company, one of the worst formats we ever
had was the hypermarket -- or the hyper -- we had 3 or 4 of them, maybe, they were
terrible. But it led to the supercenter, which ended up being one of the best retail
formats in the history of the world. So we're always going to try things. You have to
ask the other company what they wanted to do with what their recent
announcement. One thing that I think people forget about with Walmart a bit. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13

A - Brett M. Biggswe talked about maybe a couple of years ago at our analyst day, is that when you
look at our customer base, whether it's age-based, whether it's income-based, we
pretty much mirror the U.S. We're not into just one part of this or one segment or
one age. We really -- our customers really do mirror the entire U.S., which shouldn't
surprise you, given we have 140 million customers a week in the U.S. And so I can't
comment speciﬁcally on what they did. But...
How does the arrival of the Lidls and ALDIs inﬂuence your policy in terms of SKUs
and also of own-label?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, great question. We, over the past few years, have put a lot more eﬀort into
private label. And you've seen us get -- I'll use Sam's Club as an example, you've
seen us get more focused. We have, basically, now one private label in Sam's Club.
We used to have several. In the U.S., you're seeing more penetration of private label.
The Great Value brand, which we -- which is in several countries as well, is a big
brand. There would be -- a lot of companies would be happy to own Great Value and
have the business that we have in that product. The U.S., I think, is today still quite a
bit diﬀerent from Europe, in particular the U.K., as far as own label, is just not as
penetrated in the U.S., certainly compared to the U.K. But it's an important part of
our business. We're a house of brands and believe our customers want brands.
Brands are the best place to show price diﬀerentiation as well with your customer.
But if you can get a strong -- following a strong loyalty with a private label, that can
be a very important part of a retailer's oﬀering and it's important to us. Lidl and ALDI,
certainly that's been their trademark over the years. And we'll get a sense of how
well that works when they come to the U.S.
I have 2 questions. First question on the U.S., could you come back to your strategy
on proximity stores and your square meters growth? So with the brick-and-mortar, on
the brick side, what is the growth you expect? Proximity ﬁts better with pickup than
having to drive miles away for a pickup. So can you elaborate on this? Then my
second question would be on international. Are you ready to maybe divest, for
example, some countries that doesn't ﬁt anymore with your strategy?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
So I'll start with the kind of the square footage strategy. So today, in the U.S., about
90% of U.S. population lives within 10 miles of one of our stores. So we're very close
to the customer. And we think that's a beneﬁt for us going forward, whether that's
brick-and-mortar, whether that's e-commerce. We've talked about that we're
building fewer stores in the U.S. We'll have a couple of handfuls of supercenters that
will open and about the same number of Neighborhood Markets. We want to -- I
think there will always be places where stores will make sense. I think you'll continue
to see us have some stores that we'll add. But the ability now with pickup and e-
commerce and having those hubs where customers can come pick up grocery -- I
mean pick up groceries, pick up general merchandise is really helpful to us, we think,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13

A - Brett M. Biggsgoing forward. And so as we build stores, we're very thoughtful about how to serve
the customer. It's not just, well, there's a place to put a store, let's put a store. It's, if
we put a store there, does that help us with our e-commerce strategy, does it help us
with our online grocery strategy? It's a little bit of a diﬀerent discussion, as you would
expect, than ﬁve years ago.
On the international front, the markets in which we're in today make sense for what
we want to do and serving the customer. We have some great businesses do a
fantastic job of serving the customer. I think you've seen, with actions we've taken
and a little bit of a smaller scale, that we're rational about our investments, though.
And we've got to have our investments put together in a way that's good from a
return perspective, good from a proﬁtability perspective. And to the extent that
businesses continue to make sense in our portfolio and help us serve the customer
globally, then that's what we'll do.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
We have time for just one last question from the audience.
Could you just touch on how you're working with brands in terms of shelf space
allocation? Is there going to be increased focused on category captains [ph], #1, #2
market shareholders compared to #3 brands? And also, how you're working with
smaller, higher-growth brands.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. All pieces of that are important. Certainly, the big multinational suppliers are
very important to what we do. They're a big part of our business, we're a big part of
their business. But we also want to ensure that we have innovation in our stores and
that we have the ability to have local suppliers or regional suppliers in our stores to
be a store of the community. And our merchants are good with that. Our store
managers have some ability to inﬂuence that as well. If there's a brand that makes
sense in the Western part of Texas, they can go work with our merchants to get those
brands. We've got to make sure we're in compliance and the safety and all that gets
met. But we want to do that and be local with that community. Can you repeat the
ﬁrst part of your question? I want to make sure I answer the very ﬁrst part.
Yes. How (inaudible) -- how are you allocating space, shelf space? Are you working
with the #1, #2, maybe rated #3, #4 brands. Is there going to be increased focus to
the category captains really?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. As you mentioned, we have category captains for our categories inside the U.S.
It's a mix. And it's always a balance, too, of branded products versus private label;
the number of SKUs that you want to carry in a store, you want to have -- you don't
want you to have too many SKUs, because you then get ineﬃcient from a logisticsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-06-13

A - Paul Elliott Trusselland merchandising standpoint. But if you don't have enough SKUs, then your
customer has options elsewhere. And so there's some categories where 40 kinds of
mustard, is the 40th kind of mustard important to your customer? Sometimes it is.
And you've got to -- and we have the data to ensure that we're thinking through that.
But all the various pieces of that have a place within our merchandising strategy. And
it hasn't changed dramatically in the store.
{BIO 20732173 <GO>}
And with that, I want to thank the audience for participating and Brett for being with
us this morning. Any closing comments?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
No, just appreciate being here. We're excited about what's going on in the company.
And always more work for us to do. But we're working hard.
