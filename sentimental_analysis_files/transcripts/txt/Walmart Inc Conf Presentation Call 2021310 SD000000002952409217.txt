Presentation
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
I'm Michael Lasser, the Hardline, Broadline and Food Retail analyst from UBS. We are
extremely excited to have Walmart with us today. While Walmart is the world's
largest retailer, it has increasingly become known as one of the most innovative one
as well. With us today is Brett Biggs, who's Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Oﬃcer. He's been CFO of Walmart since 2016, and with Walmart since
2000. He started when he was four years old. That's why he's able to maintain his
youth.
We're also joined by Kary Brunner; and Dan Binder. Dan leads the IR eﬀort, and
they're on the line. So thank you so much, Brett. We really appreciate the time you're
spending with us today. Where I want to start is, you've recently expressed how
excited you are about all the opportunities in front of Walmart. You could -- it was
very palpable a few weeks ago when you were in front of the investment community,
and you were smiling big and bright. So it was very clear that Walmart has a ton of
potential in front of it. The obvious question is, why is it all coming to fruition now?
What's been the big unlock to make this happen?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Hi, Michael, good to see you. Sorry, we got a little bit of technical diﬃculty before.
Yes. I mean it's -- I think I said that morning, it's unusual maybe to see a CFO excited,
but I really am excited about what we have going. Some of it is -- go back -- you were
there ﬁve years ago when we said, hey. We've got to go invest in price, we've got to
invest in e-commerce, we've got to invest in wages and it's those things that are
paying oﬀ. So the ability to go invest when we did and certainly, while last year, it was
challenging and really diﬃcult for so many people and so many companies, it
accelerated how the customer is shopping. Some of the things we're already seeing
prior to the pandemic accelerated some of those things.
And so the strategy that we had coming into the pandemic has now accelerated. We
think the strategy is right and now is the time to continue to roll forward some of
these things. But the great thing for us is all the things that we've talked about,
whether it's advertising or marketplace or fulﬁllment services or ﬁnancial services or
what we're doing in pickup and delivery, it was already started. These aren't new
businesses.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10

and it's exciting to see all that coming together, but it gives us so many diﬀerent
ways to serve the customer and to make -- to grow top line and bottom line than I
think we've ever had as a company.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And presumably, part of this, Brett, is that there's been a pretty dramatic cultural
change at Walmart under the current leadership team over the last few years, where
maybe in the past, Walmart had been slow to change and adapt. And for an
organization of its size, it was hard to do. There's now been a competency that's
instilled across the organization where it needs to innovate, it needs to move fast
and it needs to change. Is that fair, and that's been a key enabler for putting the
company in the point it's at today?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think companies all go through evolutionary periods and any company of scale
gets to a point to where the things that have made it successful can actually be the
things that hold it back. The supercenter for us was so successful and you could
continue -- and there's still -- supercenter is a great part of what we do, but it wasn't
the only thing that we needed to do.
And one of my favorite books is the Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton Christensen.
When you read that book, you read about companies that didn't evolve and what
happens over time. It's been so fun over the last 5, 7, eight years, to watch this
company evolve. The DNA of the company is still exactly what it was, integrity and
servicing customers and trying to be the best of what we do. None of that has
changed, but how we go to market had to change. To watch Doug lead that for this
company, a guy that's been with the company 30 years, has been really remarkable.
But that's why I see so much in the future for Walmart.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And let's focus on these words that the ﬁnance team is using, exciting, fun. This is a
whole new part of Brett Biggs' lexicon. He's used to saying, no, no, no. This is quite a
change. Another --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think even as a CFO, you learn and you evolve. It's -- there were things that we
needed to try and you know not all of it's going to work. That's part of trying and
part of evolving as a company. And as a CFO, even -- you've always got to be the
one that, if there's a discipline to be had, the CFO has got to be a leader in that, but
you've got to be able to take calculated risks and it's caused me to evolve as well.

Page 3 of 15A - Brett Biggs
A - Michael Lasser
A - Brett BiggsFor sure. Coming back to this meeting that you had a few weeks ago. The headline --
or one of the many headlines was the longer-term algorithm that Walmart put in
place, which was 4% top line growth. That's what was the key feature of it. How do
you build to get to the 4% top line growth? Historically, at least, over the last few
years, it's been more like 2% to 3%. So getting to 4% would be a bit of a new
algorithm. And how does it break down between the U.S. and the international
markets?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. So obviously this year, with the businesses that we've, at least, divested
materially, so the U.K., Japan, Argentina, that's about a $35-plus billion hit to start. So
that ﬁgures into the algorithm for this year. That's why we said it was kind of a year or
so away.
But as you look at the capacity that we're building and the general merchandise
business that's getting traction and the ecosystem that we're building, which should
allow us to get more of a customer's wallet and over time, to continue to bring new
customers in Walmart plus other things that we're doing, to put the amount the of
capital that we're talking about putting in over the next few years, there needs to be
beneﬁt to the shareholders for that. We think that's going to come in the form of top
line. So certainly, that's a big number from a U.S. perspective.
But the international business has changed as well. So the markets that we're in are
much higher-growth markets than we've been. So the algorithm, even inside of the
international business, the mix changes, and so that helps as well. But of course the
U.S. business is by far still the biggest business that we have. We needed to get a
good growth there.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
So internationally, levered to higher markets, the capital and expense that Walmart's
putting into place, you'll have Ativa [ph] return and so combination of those 2 factors
is what -- is where you build to 4%. Is it -- it's not any like new business that we
haven't heard about that will come to fruition to drive this 4%?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Well there will be. But we have all the things in place that we believe we need to
grow top line in that way today. And as we talk about all these businesses, and it's
diﬀerent than, Michael, when we were talking 10 years ago, and it was pretty much
about the supercenters and Sam's Club in a few big countries. Now it's diﬀerent
ways to make top line as well as bottom line.
And there'll be some things that will work better than we think there'll be some
things that won't work quite as well as we think and there'll be new things that come
up. But seeing what I see today and what Doug sees today we think that's a level of
growth that we certainly should get to at some point.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10

Got it. And at some point, that's the operative word. I think if there was anything that
was -- any questions that came up out of the meeting from a few weeks ago, it's
when should the market expect to see this algorithm come to fruition? That was left
somewhat open ended. Why was that the case?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, so we -- the biggest challenge we have right now is, how is this current year
going to shape up. So this last year, for instance, we had a big stimulus with things
that certainly were tailwinds for us. We don't know how that's going to play out in
this current year. We may get a stimulus plan here. We may get -- we could get
another one. So it's hard to predict exactly. And as you know, even with our guidance
for this year, we were a little less speciﬁc maybe than we have been in the past. So it
depends some on this year as well, Michael, on kind of how the acceleration
happens, and how it comps against the year prior to that. It's -- we've got to get a
better read on this year.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
So the message here is, look, it's not because of anything that we're mindful of with
our strategy. Our strategy is good, it's going to work. It's just -- this is -- go ahead.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
And -- yes, we need to continue to build out the capacity as well. So a lot of the
capital that we're putting in really is about building out e-commerce, pickup,
delivery, capacity. We had a great problem in that a week's demand accelerated at
least a couple of years. So we want to get ahead of that demand, we want to make
sure we're catching up with that demand. It's just -- it's all of those things together,
but what we wanted to lay out for investors a few weeks ago is that as we make these
investments and as investors give us capital to make these investments, this is what
we're expecting of ourselves.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Perfect. You alluded to this in your previous -- in the answer to the previous question,
but does the getting the 4%, does that require Walmart to capture more share of
wallet with its existing customers? Or capture more customers who really haven't
been big Walmart customers in the past? And what's the unlock to be able to do that
latter part? And as part of this, what's more realistic?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think it's going to be some combination of both. It -- again it goes back to this
optionality. It doesn't necessarily have to be one or the other. It's going to be a
combination of both of those. And as we continue to add services for 3P sellers,
which gets more SKUs into our system, as we do more things around ﬁnancial
services, health care, it gets more customers into our ecosystem, and we want to be
top of mind with those customers. We are -- for a lot of customers, we are top ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10

A - Brett Biggsmind. But we -- there's deﬁnitely room for us to be top of mind for more and more
customers.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Okay --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Existing customers and new customers.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Got it. You've also put the foundation in over the last few years to have these big
drivers of proﬁtability for Walmart that are allowing you to grow top line 4% and then
proﬁts in excess of 4%. These are areas like advertising, third party marketplace,
ﬁnancial services, local fulﬁllment, membership, health care. How would you rank all
of those opportunities on the size of their contribution -- potential contribution to
Walmart's proﬁtability over the next few years?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think the good thing is we don't -- you won't like this answer, but we don't --
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
No, no. I can tell where it's going. Come on, Brett.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
We don't need to rank them. It's -- I see -- I just -- I see possibilities, and I can see big
businesses with all of these things. They won't -- again they won't all come to fruition
the way we think. There'll be some that will be home runs more than we even think
they're going to be.
So the idea is to give them all the oxygen and the capital that they need to grow. I
think you've also seen, though, when we ﬁnd things that aren't working, we're much
more disciplined about stopping those, delaying that in a way that can allow
something else to grow. You've seen what we've done internationally. So I like the
discipline around that.
But I can look at all these businesses right now, and I can lay out a really bullish case
for all of these businesses. And at this point, I really don't -- I don't want to choose.
When you combine that with our ability to continue to be disciplined on expenses,
and you'll remember, Michael, ﬁve years ago when we said, hey, we need to invest.
So we're going to pay for part of it by being more disciplined on expenses, and
we've done that.
But there's also these businesses and how we're growing, whether it's marketplace
or general merchandise, that can drive gross margin in a way that probably feels
diﬀerent than it did a few years ago. That also gives us opportunity for gross marginFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10

A - Brett Biggsto maybe look diﬀerent than we -- better than we would have thought potentially
three years ago.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And so the potential from all these opportunities exists and is large. Would the
answer be any diﬀerent if I asked, if you had to rank them by the speed to which they
could pay oﬀ, which is a more realizable soonest -- presumably --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Right. Yes.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Go ahead.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Some of them will take less capital. So to some, you think about things like third
party marketplace, we're growing that business like crazy right now. But as we get
more capacity online, it unlocks a lot of things. Well it takes a little while to get all the
capacity on that you would like to have. So things like advertising can be quicker
because we're already in the business. We have great relationships with suppliers,
with platforms. So something like that just naturally can grow more quickly.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Got it. It's realistic for us to see -- expect those to have a tangible payoﬀ in the next 12
to 18 months?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Well I believe you'll see growth in all of these businesses. Financial services, we
just started a JV -- a new JV with Ribbit. So there'll be -- we'll accelerate some of that
as well.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Got it. On the e-com business, so we got -- before we move over to that, we got a
question on the health business, which is how much can the health care business
contribute over time? What have been some of the learnings from the health care
centers? And how quickly can you scale that up?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think there's a lot of diﬀerent ways in which they can go. As you know, we just
brought on a new leader of our health care business, Cheryl Pegus. I've spent some
time with her, and she's great, and I'm excited about what we're going to do there. I
mean we've done some things around testing, we've done some things around
these new clinics. The new clinics are really exciting and because it's the way people
want to do health care for patients. I don't need to make an appointment ﬁve days inFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15A - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggsadvance. It's going to be a good price for doctors actually get to treat patients
instead of dealing with a lot of paperwork and -- so for -- it's a win-win, and it's how
do you make that cost-eﬀective and some of that's just scaling, as you would
imagine.
Then how -- with the pandemic, how will people consume health care going forward.
It's going to look diﬀerent. I think digital has accelerated in health care. That's not
likely to change. That's probably going to continue to accelerate and there's -- with
the digital innovation that we have in diﬀerent parts of our business, that's certainly a
place that we can play.
So I think what we might do in health care could look a little diﬀerent than we would
have thought three years ago again just because the world's changed to some
degree but no less exciting, and we know that the customer gives us latitude here to
provide services for them.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Okay. I want to switch gears to the e-com business in a little bit more depth. The lines
have certainly blurred between Walmart stores and its online business. How has that
impacted the proﬁtability of Walmart's e-commerce segment? This had been
considerable -- in considerable focus for the last few years. You've outlined drivers
that have helped to improve the proﬁtability of the e-commerce segment. Where
does that stand today?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I mean it was really a couple of years ago, we started seeing the signs that we
thought we would as far as reducing losses in e-commerce. It was coming from
diﬀerent places. Top line, as you know, helps with a lot of things. You're able to
leverage ﬁxed costs diﬀerently. But as also, as we get more volume through
fulﬁllment centers, the variable cost fulﬁllment goes down. And as we were able to
bring more brands online and develop brands, getting the mix between general
merchandise and more consumable type products helped as well, so our
contribution margins continued to get better, and that got even much better again
last year.
So the direction, again when we bought Jet and when we got more involved into e-
commerce, the direction where we thought the business model would go, we --
we're seeing that the last two years. So I'm -- I feel good about that. But it's become
so ingrained in the business, and it's even more so now with the way that John has
structured the merchant organization, that I certainly know and Doug knows, the
team knows, here's what the proﬁtability is by channel but it's more about the
proﬁtability in total. And how do we drive the right customer experience, and we
have a sense of where we think they're going to buy from.
And it's up to the management team to make sure that, that is an outcome that's
good for shareholders. So we -- again I do know -- we do know what the various
aspects are, but the total is what we are completely focused on.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10

And that makes total sense, and I would imagine it would be a similar answer from a
lot of organizations. But as a piece of this, how much more investment is needed in
the e-com business? There was a lot of investment done over the last few years, for
example. You brought together 2 disparate apps. I think there's still more integration
that's needed to be done with the apps.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We've done a lot of that. But it's even a tough question now. It's like, how do you
deﬁne the e-com business. Is that e-com, where everything's bought online is e-com,
then you got e-com that's delivered to your house?
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Brett, I'm the one asking questions here. So let's -- let's -- come on.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I mean but it is -- it's right. I mean is it e-com delivered to your house? Is it e-com
you're picking up in the stores? Is it e-com you're picking up outside the stores? Is it
being delivered to you? It's -- the lines are blurring, and they're blurring for the
customer as well. They don't even think about how it's getting to them necessarily.
It's just I need this, I want it at x time, get it to me. It really is blurring.
I mean I'm not -- really not trying to duck your question, it is really blurring, and that's
to the beneﬁt of Walmart because we can do this and we can invest in it, and we can
still have a great top line and bottom line at the same time. It plays right into our
strengths.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
It would be helpful to hear what the big buckets of investment in this area might be -
- for example, the app is a good -- an area that probably needs a little bit more
investment. Are there others?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. We're going to continue to do -- put every dollar we need to in the app to make
it easier. We went in, we got into the one app now, but there's things we can do to
make using Walmart Pay easier. So all of that's evolving. And bringing in Suresh, our
CIO or CTO from a couple of years ago, he's been a great unlock for the company. A
lot of the capital over the next few years is going to go into capacity, but not just
capacity on the e-commerce side. Automation, which, to some degree, there's
advantages to being a second mover in a space like this in that you can continue to
have the most up-to-date innovation on how to move product within a warehouse,
but also how to get it to customers.
And so I think there will be some -- versus some of our competitors in a bit of a
second mover advantage and some of the technology that we'll be able to put in.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10

{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And as part of this conversation on omnichannel, I want to layer in a question on
Walmart+. At your Analyst Day you noted that Walmart is initially focused on
improving the Net Promoter Score for Walmart+ before focusing on really growing
the membership. What signpost should -- would you like to see on that front before
you get the ultimate signal that it's really time to shift in the membership acquisition
in the high gear for membership acquisition?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Walmart+ is something we considered for a while, and it's great. It's what we
need to do. We'll continue to grow it. We started out with a fairly modest number of
services and beneﬁts, and we want to get this done in a way that we know the
customer experience is good. We're watching, as you can imagine, NPS scores and
how customers are reacting, the questions they're asking, the challenges, if they're
having those.
And similar to probably pickup and delivery, you'll remember, Michael, let's say eight
years ago, is when we started really testing pick up, delivery in Denver and we were
seeing signs that the customer really liked this. We -- in that case, we rolled it out. We
got to the point where we said, you know what, we can make this pretty good, and
we rolled it out really quickly. Now it's a major part of our business.
I could see Walmart+ doing something similarly where we -- there's not a signpost
that we're saying, if we hit this metric, we're going. It's -- we want to be more ﬂexible
than that, but we're seeing good signs of how customers are interacting with it.
We've had a membership forever with Sam's Club. So we have some knowledge of
what we're doing. But it's not one guidepost. There's a number of things that we're
looking for. But I think this will be a really important tool for us going forward. I have
no doubt.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And have there been any consistent themes in the early responses from customers
that's allowed Walmart do business with some folks that might not have been able to
in the past? Or is this more putting a bear hug around your most active customers
already?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
No, it's some of both. I mean same as what we saw pickup and delivery, some of
both. Customers like it. Like everything, they want more services and you want to --
and we'll have that certainly over time. And competitively, I probably won't give you
a lot more insight into that.

A - Brett BiggsSure. No problem. I understood. I didn't expect it. Yes. On the fulﬁllment and last
mile, how does Walmart think about balancing third-party delivery through providers
like Spark -- or through Instacart and then your own Spark platform. Is that
something that Walmart needs to fully control over time? And within the Spark
network, is there an opportunity to expand to other retailers and what shipped [ph]
is doing?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think there's still a lot of room for this to play out and see how the market
evolves. There's no way -- there's no one way that it has to work out for us to be
successful, which is exactly what you want. I mean we use third-party providers, as
you mentioned. We use our own Spark network. We've tested with associates in the
past. I think any combination of those could work for us, long term. We're continuing
to build out the Spark network. I like where we're at because it's good for the
customer, and we still have great optionality. I'm kind of pleased where we're at.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And does the capacity of the Spark platform exist to meet Walmart aspirations within
e-commerce? Is there enough there to be able to do it? And do you have enough
control on --
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, yes, it could be. There's nothing really that would limit it necessarily. It's like any
other delivery platform, you've got to get enough folks to come work for you and the
infrastructure to go do it. But there's nothing inherently that would limit our capacity
on that.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Okay. There's so much goodness on the proﬁtability side, all these diﬀerent
strategies we talked about. If these strategies produce sizable leverage, and these
are above and beyond some of the cost management measures that you had
alluded to before and had been proven out over the last several years, what's the
thought process between how you ﬂow these gains to shareholders versus never
really letting it ﬂow to the bottom line because the expectation is you're going to
reinvest the outperformance back into the business?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I think you'll have to look at it over a period of time. There's -- I mean as we've
said before, there's going to be -- there could be your investment here, you're less
investment here, but we want you to look at it over a period of time. When you -- and
it's one of the reasons why we wanted to say what we said at the investor meeting,
which is -- when we talked about the sales growth, that operating income would
grow faster than sales. We think that's important for investors to understand that we
are going to continue to invest in the business, but we want good returns for those
investors as well.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10

A - Michael LasserNow obviously we're not going to invest in the business, if we think there aren't
good long-term returns for investors. So it should work to their beneﬁt both ways.
But we also know that they want to see progress, and we want to see progress on
bottom lines. So I think we can do -- we've been able to do both, really. We've been
able to grow proﬁtability and continue to have great returns for shareholders. We
had our 48th straight dividend increase, and we continue to buy back shares. So I
like the position we're in and we'll continue to -- I think we'll continue to be very
shareholder-friendly.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And speaking of investment, in many product categories, Walmart's price gaps over
the last year expanded. Walmart stayed very true and loyal to its everyday low price
strategy. Others may have dropped some of the promotions they ran in the past,
which allowed Walmart's price gaps to increase. So how are you thinking about
making price investment this year? So I'll start with that and then I have a follow-up.

Yes, price is always going to be an important part of what we do. Again I've talked a
lot about ﬁve years ago. But in that case, we said, look, we need to step on the pedal
a little bit on price investment, and we did, particularly in food and consumables. So
price is always going to be a big part of what we do, and we want to keep those
price gaps where they need to be for us to serve customers in the right way. But we
watch them very carefully. It's not just how do we do versus Kroger, how do we do
versus Target. It's geographically, it's product-based. It's much more surgical than it
used to be. I think over the last few years, we've invested a lot in price, and we've got
ourselves, as we expect we would, in a really good position.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Where do you see the largest opportunities to either pull back or push further? Are
the gaps where they need to be? On this topic, there's been a lot of well
documented inﬂationary pressures across many categories. How is Walmart thinking
about price inﬂation across the board this year?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I mean we're watching input costs like everybody else is, and that ebbs and
ﬂows. But again it's very product-based. It's not something where you hear someone
say inﬂation is going to be x, and oh, I need to take prices up by x. It's much more
strategic than that. We work with suppliers to -- if we're getting cost inﬂation in a
product, how do we potentially change the product? How do we make it less
expensive? How do we -- can you do that and still keep the quality of the product?
So it's all these conversations that happen and it's supplier by supplier and it's
product by product. But our goal is to keep prices as low as we can for customers.
That's what we've always done, and we've managed to, I think do that better than
anyone has.

strategy in the ﬁntech area. There's been a couple of high-proﬁle hires recently in the
markets looking for a little bit more detail on what the strategy is.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I'm excited about it. It's something where we -- we've had a pretty big ﬁnancial
services business for a while. I'd call it more of an analog ﬁnancial services business,
but it's important. It's cards, it's money transfers, it's other things that customers
want. But I think this gives us this joint venture and it gives us an opportunity to do
some things that are maybe a little diﬀerent, maybe a little more sophisticated, more
digital, for sure, and having the skill sets that we'll bring into that, along with the
resources that we have and the customer base that we have already. It's not like we
have to go out and have really expensive customer acquisition costs. We've got the
customers today that are already familiar with our brands. So when you put all that
together, I think there's a number of things that -- where we could really make an
impact on that industry.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Is this a payments play? Is this a banking play? I won't -- obviously Walmart's got a lot
of expertise in all those areas. Could you contextualize how investors should think
about the biggest opportunity within ﬁntech?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
I keep thinking about what customers need in their lives to make their lives simpler.
There's a lot of diﬀerent places in which a ﬁntech business can play in that. Do you
help people get access to services, make it easier for them to get access to services?
Certainly, what we do with Walmart Pay and how people make payments is
something that we've already been a big player in. We're a big player in India and
Mexico and other places as well in that space. So it's how do you make customers'
lives easier, more eﬃcient, less expensive on the ﬁnancial services side. If it ﬁts one
of those things, then I think it's something we could be interested in.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
And I want to pivot the conversation to international a little bit. Is the -- I'll transition it
this way. Is -- are you seeing anything international, whether it's in India, China, any
other market from a ﬁnancial services perspective that's motivating the Walmart U.S.
business to get further in this area? You're seeing more innovation internationally
and so staying ahead of the curve makes a lot of sense?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I mean there's a lot of innovation in the U.S. Obviously the ﬁrst couple of times I
went over to India and saw what PhonePe was doing -- Flipkart with PhonePe on
payment -- and again not just payments, but services that make customers' lives
easier. It really clicked for me, the types of -- me and others, the types of things that
we could do in the U.S. and they're very -- PhonePe, Flipkart, they're very sharp, very
thoughtful, very innovative in that space. So there are things that we've seen in otherFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10

the last ﬁve years, has been incredible as far as innovation in this space.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Yes. And how soon should the market expect Walmart to monetize its valuable
international assets like Flipkart, like PhonePe? And what will having this capital allow
these businesses to do that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to do?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. I mean we've put -- we're going to put the capital into Flipkart and PhonePe to
the extent that we need to and we have to continue to let them grow. But we've said
we're certainly thoughtful about IPOs and markets like that and timing depends on a
number of things, but we're still optimistic about the ability to do that. Obviously you
reward associates diﬀerently when you do something like that and you have a public
company. So still very much on our radar screen.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
Stay tuned, I guess. All right. I want to pivot to Sam's. Kath and the team have done a
really remarkable job. With that being said, over the course of the pandemic,
warehouse club sales across the board have really taken oﬀ in the U.S. Do you -- do
the sales lift change your long-term thinking about the number of Sam's Clubs in the
U.S.? There were some Sam's Club closures in the last few years, maybe those stores
weren't well positioned. So could you get back to growing that business? And are
there other opportunities for Sam's to grow in these areas that Walmart U.S. is
adding like ﬁntech and health care and advertising, et cetera?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. There's -- Sam's going to grow, it's -- and we're going to continue to want it to
grow. I think growth in the future just looks diﬀerent than it did in the past and not
just the Sam's Club. Really, across the world. Sam's has great growth in the last year. I
mean the comps -- 15-plus comps if you pull out fuel and tobacco, just a great year. I
love what the team's doing. They're -- they can help us in a number of ways.
One is they've become, over the past several years, kind of a tech incubator. So
we're able to try things at Sam's and around membership, which could obviously be
helpful with things like Walmart+. So we're going to continue to grow that brand. It's
in a great part of the retail channel. It's in a great retail channel.
The idea of building a lot more stores or clubs in the U.S. is probably not top of mind
for us right now. It's not to say that we wouldn't grow more clubs but what we can do
with existing clubs, I think is pretty exciting. You mentioned the things around the
other services that Walmart is trying. When you put all that together, the ability to
sweat the assets, so to speak, is probably bigger than it has been in a long time at
Sam's. So I don't think we have to grow boxes to grow Sam's. That's really a good
place to be in. But they serve a really unique place in our portfolio.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-10

And on the subject of Sam's Club, it's generated signiﬁcant membership growth, 6x
the number of members in 2020 than has been added in the last few years. There's
also been signiﬁcant improvement in the renewals. What -- is this just a function of
the environment? Or have there been actions that Sam's put in place to lead to these
outcomes? And is this sustainable?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Certainly, the environment -- you can't rule out the environment at all in the last
year. It's impacted everything. But when you look at -- they're making membership --
even transacting to get a membership is much easier than it used to be. Checking
out at Sam's Club is much easier than it used to be. Scan & Go, I use, you don't even
need to go through a checkout lane. So they've made it much, much easier for the
member.
The membership club business typically comes down to just great items. I think our
merchandising continues to improve at Sam's. Private label, Member's Mark has
been -- the progression on that in the last ﬁve years has been palpable. So it's a lot
of diﬀerent things that they're doing that I think continues to make Sam's just a really
valuable property.
{BIO 7266130 <GO>}
We're coming up to the end of our conversation. I'll ﬁnish with a topic that's near and
dear to the CFO's heart, which is capital allocation. The company ended last year
with a very sizable cash balance. So how fast should the market expect that Walmart
will deploy that cash in repurchasing its own shares? It's clear that there's more cash
on the balance sheet than is necessary. What's the thought process on longer-term
capital allocation in the approach to reverse the shares [ph]?
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes. Obviously it's a great position to be in as a company. The message I wanted
investors to hear a few weeks ago is that we're going to invest some of that capital
back into the business over the next few years, and -- but we also approved another
$20 billion share repurchase plan. So we're going to invest capital back in the
business, which should long-term, beneﬁt shareholders, but we want shareholders to
be beneﬁted in the short-term as well, short to mid-term dividends and share
repurchase.
So again the environment is still certainly more uncertain than it was two years ago
or even a year ago. So having a little bit of extra cash, I think is a prudent thing to do
at this point and allows us to be ﬂexible in things that we need to do. But as a
company, I don't anticipate holding the amount of excess cash that we are today
over any period of time.
