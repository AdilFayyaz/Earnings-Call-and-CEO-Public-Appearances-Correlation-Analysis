Okay. I think we're ready to get started. Thank you, all for coming this morning. I'm
Toshiya Hari, I cover the semiconductor and semi cap equipment at Goldman Sachs.
I'm very pleased to have Colette Kress, Chief Financial Oﬃcer from NVIDIA with us
this morning. Colette, thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule.

Questions And Answers
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
I wanted to start oﬀ by recapping 2017. The year was clearly a phenomenal year for
the company. I think all your businesses grew double digits, exceeded our estimates
by some crazy number. So I was hoping you could go back and share some of the
surprises from the year and some of the major accomplishments from -- for the
company.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So we ﬁnished our ﬁscal year and announced earnings last Thursday. It was a
great year both in terms of our revenue for the company as well as accomplishments
that we made from a technology standpoint in terms of establishing the great
markets that we have in front of us. We closed the year at $9.7 billion, growing more
than 40% year-over-year. There are 4 market platforms that we refer to, which is our
gaming business, our pro visualization business, data center and automotive. And as
we (discussed for) each group and grew more than double digits. In the case of our
data center business, which many people follow quite closely, we reached almost $2
billion and grew 130% year-over-year. So extremely strong growth for all of these
overall platforms.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Page 2 of 11It was a big year for our Volta platform. Our Volta platform (blended) with our data
center and was announced at our GTC last May. But our probably greatest surprise
and greatest accomplishment of the overall adoption of Volta was across the overall
industry, starting with our CSTs and moving quite quickly both for internal use in
terms of training. But also the capabilities of using it within the cloud. And you're
seeing many cloud instances come up each day, using our overall Volta architecture.
(But let's) not take away from our overall gaming business, which grew quite strong.
Quite strong on our Pascal architecture that we've had in-market for more than 1.5
years, with tremendous success in terms of both keeping the hearts and minds of the
overall gamers as well as bringing on new gamers into the overall market.
Our Pro Vis business has established itself in terms of the high-end market as well as
design. A very important piece of transformation in pro visualization as we think
about the use of AI or the use of virtual reality for much of the design that's taking
place in the enterprise as well, which has started that business, now growing at
double digits.
Our automotive business, also growing more than 10%, is really associated with our
infotainment systems now. But probably the key highlight is the many
announcements that we've made throughout the year in terms of our partnerships
with so many of the auto manufacturers, start-ups, partners, Tier 1 in the automotive
industry as we focus on self-driving cars.
So we're pleased in terms of the overall revenue growth that also comes through in
terms of our overall gross margins. As you know, our business is not just about
shipping overall chips. But it is about the best hardware. But also a full stack of
software for many of these industries that we're doing. So we started oﬀ the year,
there was a lot of concern in terms of the absence of our internal royalty, which was
going to expire in our First Quarter, which it did. But what we ended up doing was
still growing our overall gross margins more than 100 basis points, including what we
had in terms of more than 130 basis points in the other direction from the absence of
the Intel royalty. So growing more than 200 basis points in terms of our true
operations is really showing the value of our platforms, that full stack in terms of what
people are appreciating and we're able to see that in terms of the overall gross
margins.
We invested in our business. We invested in our business, growing our OpEx nearly
20%. But also producing overall operating income and margin expansion. Our
margins increased more than 500 basis points year-over-year. So I think we have a
tremendously great model of a leveraged overall R&D team. What we mean by that
leverage is we focus on one product. We focus on the GPU. We're able to build that
in terms of the best-of-breed. But then also work on software stacks that take each
one of those to a speciﬁc market. And that has beneﬁted us well as we think about
the overall investments that we did. So the overall proﬁtability growth growing more
than 60%, even more in terms of on the overall EPS line.
So in summary, a really solid year. Taking advantage of great, large market
opportunities in front of us. We have a very fortunate thing in front of us that we'reFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Page 3 of 11Q - Toshiya Hari
A - Colette M. Kressnot just concentrating on one large market. We have many large markets. Gaming,
gaming is here. Tremendously healthy. We'll get to the point where maybe every
person in the world is an overall gamer. And our platforms are best-of-breed and
able to really fuel a lot of the gaming and the high-end gaming that we see right
now with the high-production games that are coming out. Many of those that we saw
through the holiday season as well as the overall content in those games which
demand higher-end overall graphics. But additionally, the advancement of what
we're seeing in terms of artiﬁcial intelligence, the use of a GPU for democratizing a
lot of what we're seeing in terms of the ﬁrst stages of AI, have a very large market in
front of us. It's great to see our progress this year. But also the progress that we have
and the opportunity going forward. Automotive and autonomous driving is just an
extension of what we had seen in the data center and a very, very hard problem to
solve using artiﬁcial intelligence to build self-driving cars in the future, whether those
be Level 3, Level 4 or Level 5 going forward.
So we're excited. We're excited about the future.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Great. Thanks very much for that. Then I guess, I was hoping you could walk us
through the business formation -- transformation that NVIDIA has gone through over
the past ﬁve years. Since you joined the company, a lot has happened. Stock was at
$15. We're here sitting today at $230; it's a completely diﬀerent company. So if you
can walk us through some of those changes and how the opportunities are diﬀerent
today relative to when you joined the company?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Got it. So joining the company ﬁve years ago, the discussion was what we would
have in terms of onstage today versus what we did in terms of (5 years), there's been
a tremendous transformation. I actually feel we transform every day to take our (part)
in terms of this market. Yes. We are not a brand-new company, 25 years in the
making. But a lot of that was really based on a really strong core technology of GPU
that was used even back then. But primarily for the overall PC platform. So ﬁve years
really doesn't talk about the actual transformation. You have to actually go back a
little bit farther. Yes. The PC platform was a great piece for us to start the importance
of the overall processing capabilities. Graphics was essentially a great application to
use the processing capability of the GPU. But what happened probably more than 10
to 12 years ago was the establishment of the programmability of that GPU and
enabling that for many. Establishing CUDA. And establishing CUDA on several and
all of our diﬀerent GPUs available at the time, allowed us to build the overall
developer base that we have today. The developer base has grown astronomically,
exceeds more than 600,000 developers worldwide, which has established some of
the successes that we have today, both in the data center as well as in Pro Vis or
maybe even in terms of artiﬁcial intelligence and our future with autonomous
driving. And the reason why is they ﬁnd the use cases of a tremendous overall
processors to solve many of these more challenging problems that have required so
much data and so much processing put together. So yes, ﬁve years ago when we
would be up here talking about the PC market, the PC market would be declining or
would be ﬂat and (our) concerns in terms of our attach rate. It's been a long time
since we've had that question. And now we really, really talk about, what stage areFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Page 4 of 11Q - Toshiya Hari
A - Colette M. Kresswe at in terms of AI? How big is this going to be? When will that ﬁrst self-driving car
hit the freeway? How can we see that there? So a huge change. It's required the
company to keep on its toes. I think the company is probably one of the most agile
companies really focused on those leading-edge things and how they're changing
and how we can evolve as a company to reach those market opportunities.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Great. Then I guess, I wanted to dive into some of the segments and start oﬀ with
data center just given the focus that you guys have and being the focus that
investors have as well. Clearly, a major growth driver for you today. Can you walk us
through some of the individual subsegments within data center and how they
performed over the past 12 months?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So our data center business is essentially focused on 5 diﬀerent businesses
within it. The ﬁrst one, probably a very good percentage of our overall business, is
focused on AI training. AI training requires a signiﬁcant amount of data and, through
a process called deep learning, allows you to process that data not from writing
software. But allowing to infer from that large set of overall data. That is still a very
signiﬁcant part of our business and started in the early stages with CSPs, hyperscale
providers as well as they use that training both on applications internally as well as
applications that you and I use from a consumer standpoint from the overall Internet.
That business has continued to evolve and continued to grow. Our second key
business that has emerged and emerged quite well in this last year is the cloud
business. So not only using it on the overall applications with the hyperscales had or
the research team. But serving it up for all of the diﬀerent users out there in the
enterprise and other researchers to get started quite quickly. Quite diﬀerently, the
maybe -- infrastructures were built maybe 10 or 15 years ago, where you would self-
build a cluster within your data center, it is allowing an ease of use of researchers,
start-ups, as well as the entrants in terms of enterprise to use the cloud to get quickly
started on AI and get quickly started on deep learning. There's many diﬀerent use
cases of those overall cloud instances. But the focus on creating the cloud instances
has been a big piece of this last year. So I'd say sizing up quite well to the overall
deep learning training that we're seeing with our ﬁrst business. Our third business is
focused on inferencing. Now inferencing takes to a diﬀerent stage of AI, where the
data is already trained and we're going to focus now on new incremental data
coming in and processing that on a speed, usually referred to in a per second, an
image per second, an instance per second, those types of cases. Super early stages
at that business and using an overall GPU for that. Traditionally, this has been done
and primarily done through CPU market. But you're getting more and more
complexity in types of work that needs to be done, both analyzing video, for
example, analyzing voice to where a GPU processor actually can be tremendously
more beneﬁcial. Super early stages in terms of this is a market. But we're going to
continue to focus on it because it is such a future large market for us to overall
capture. Our fourth market is high-performance computing. Not a new business, a
business that we've probably been in for close to 15 years. Large supercomputers
around the world. Very, very deep computational type of work being done in high-
performance computing. And we have now established ourselves in terms of both
the top supercomputers in the world, probably 1/5 of them; as well as the top 15FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

A - Colette M. Kressoverall applications for high-performance computing using overall GPU acceleration.
This has sped up this year as more are realizing the slowdown of Moore's Law, the
slowdown of using a general CPU to improve performance time and time again.
They are using something else to accelerate the overall performance of those
supercomputing and the GPUs being more established. A little bit diﬀerent than AI.
But what you're seeing is terms of the conversion, a conversion to high-performance
computing and AI together to where now you can take some things and infer using
AI and then deep computational transactions also using in terms of the high-
performance computing. We've had long design wins in that market that will likely
continue. And that's been a really great part of our business this year. Our last
business is really focused on AI and the edge, autonomous machines, what people
are using not centrally in a data center. But machines and (PCs) going forward. Also a
great opportunity if you think about both smart cities, if you think about autonomous
vehicles; we're still going to have a signiﬁcant amount of work in terms of putting
those platforms there. So all of those are our diﬀerent businesses within our data
center today.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay. You mentioned there's (been early gains) with inferencing. But on the most
recent call, I think Jensen talked about that opportunity. Can you help us understand
how big that business is today within data center and how you view the
opportunities there will be in the next, say, 12 to 24 months?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So again, most of our business in data center today, the majority of it stems from
training the cloud, high-performance computing. Inferencing is still in its early
stages, a wide set of partners. And those that are overall (trailing), overall
inferencing. We see inferencing occurring in many parts of the world, within the
hyperscale applications as well. But it's still an early part of that business in terms of
representative of our data center business.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay, understood. Then, I guess, in terms of the competitive landscape in data
center. Clearly, given the growth potential, you have multiple competitors that are
aggressively going after the market and you've got privates that are supposedly
emerging sometime this year with their solutions as well. Can you remind us what
the value proposition is from NVIDIA and how you diﬀer from the competition?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. I mean, when you think about artiﬁcial intelligence, of course, there would be a
lot of interest from around the world, those folks being interested in being a part of
that. Long term, sure, there's going to be many diﬀerent players in artiﬁcial
intelligence. But we've simply come through with an overall focus, which focuses on
enabling AI in as many diﬀerent platforms and in many diﬀerent places around the
world, not focusing on any one framework, not focusing on any one hyperscale, not
focusing on any one form of computing. Our ability is to create a software stack that
enables all of that, that allows you a quick start in terms of working through aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

A - Colette M. Kresssigniﬁcant amount of metalware. Not to be confused. But we will always have the
best processor capable of handling a signiﬁcant amount of data that is out there. But
if we can democratize AI for as many diﬀerent types of populations that are out there
-- from researchers, from labs, from higher education to enterprises as well as the
hyperscales without aligning to any single one platform is really where our focuses
are. As things develop long term, there will probably be specialties within there. You
see us looking to extend our work to certain industries, certain verticals where we
will probably add more software to enable, for example, health care or more
software to help in terms of the overall manufacturing arm and the use of AI in those.
But really, we are to be available to almost any of the diﬀerent types of platforms that
are out there.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Then I guess, speciﬁcally from yesterday, we did get quite a few questions from
investors about the Amazon announcement and the Google announcement as well.
Can you perhaps address some of those issues as well?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. There has -- there's been a discussion about what people refer to as (custom
service). Is it the time for customization? Do you see players looking for
customization for very speciﬁc workloads? So nothing new essentially emerged
yesterday. Google coming out with their GPU (2). Now they're allowing a beta
version of that in the cloud is what we've seen. But our strategy still remains the
same, focused on all of the diﬀerent cloud providers, focused on all of the diﬀerent
frameworks and enabling. So nothing new in terms of that piece. Amazon, in the
same way, just a chip for a single kind of device, not necessarily a large autonomous
machine. Although we would probably be more focused on -- from more of a device
and coming out with a chip speciﬁc for that.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay. that makes sense. Shifting gears a little bit. I wanted to ask a couple of
questions about crypto, just given the focus there. On your call last week, you talked
about that part of the business being a bigger percentage of your business in Q4
relative to Q3. I know it's really hard to gauge how big that business is. But can you
help us understand the relative size and where you see that going over the next, say,
(4) quarters?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Sure. So that was -- probably an interesting part of this last year, of our ﬁscal 2018, is
the emergence of (overhead) cryptocurrency, not necessarily brand new. Over
several years ago, cryptocurrency popped up in terms of the bitcoin mining. But that
had moved to overall ASICs for that to take place. Right now, the current currencies
out there, using a GPU is very beneﬁcial for the work that needs to be done there.
Over the last couple of quarters, we've watched it quite closely. It has some very
important market dynamics that were popping up, where you had professional
miners starting to take place. But you also have a case where you have extra time
and outside of gaming that people can also be mining. So we may have a dualFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Q - Toshiya Harioverall function in terms of what we're seeing, the use of GPUs on the consumer
side. It's tough to gauge. It's extremely tough to gauge. If you think about what we
are selling in terms of our GPUs, GPUs for gaming or GPUs for crypto are sold
through the same -- adding card makers, are sold through the exact same channels.
And in some cases, maybe the exact same customer, gaming part of the time as well
as also mining. What we do understand probably from looking at the valuation of
your overall gaming and what we believe is the amount of work that needs to be
done, we do believe the market grew from the time in Q3 to the time in Q4. And that
we can see. Being able to pinpoint it exactly is just not something that we have the
capability to do because they may be doing dual. Probably what has evolved since a
couple of quarters ago is a -- market dynamics is getting to critical mass. The critical
mass of amounts that are happening in cryptocurrency is there. But it will probably
be here as an underlying trend for some time. So carrying forward, yes, it will be
there. Will it still be volatile? Absolutely.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay. Is there any way to manage for a potential decline in crypto pricing and some
of the GPUs ﬂooding the market? Or is it just too hard to manage that?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
At this stage, I'm not sure there is a path for that, given the volatility of just the overall
coin. I'm sure we'll see additional coins in the future. So it's just too hard to tell at this
point.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay, got it. Then, I guess, talking about your gaming business, which is still well
north of 50% of your (inaudible). It gets little air time these days given data center
and crypto. But in 2017, another very strong year. Was that mostly crypto or was it
gaming as well? What drove the strength in 2017 and what's kind of the outlook into
2018?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
So our gaming business is still growing strong. We can deﬁnitely see that just
because of the success that you see with a lot of the games that are coming out.
PUBG is, for example, probably one of the best games of 2017 that came out. Started
out early back in the fall. And late, has reached more than 25 million, 30 million
diﬀerent users. Those are gamers. Those are new gamers. Those are gamers that
have moved to a new game. And to play that, they are continuing the upgrades of
the overall Pascal cycle, thinking about our GPUs for that. So tremendous success.
Towards this latter half of the ﬁscal year, though, a challenge because those same
gamers and those same crypto miners were there. And at this point, we're supply
constrained. Those GPUs are under a lot of need to meet a lot of diﬀerent things. But
yes, the overall success of gaming can clearly be seen both by the revenue growth
that we have. But also if you just think of the overall success and the growth of the
games that are out there. We can easily see that.

Q - Toshiya Hari
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. KressGreat. Then from a competitive standpoint, you've clearly done really well in gaming
over the past couple of years, gaming share up at the expense of your nearest
competitor. Going forward, how do you view the landscape? Intel has talked about
coming back -- they've got a discrete graphics business as well. So on a multiyear
basis, how do you see the competitive positioning changing, if at all?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So I think our focus on addressing gamers, just as the other company does, has
their own unique strategy on how we address the overall gaming market. For many
of our competitors, the thought of just a chip would establish an overall gaming
platform is much diﬀerently than how we focus. We had focus in terms of
surrounding the overall ecosystem of our overall gamers. But providing them
GeForce experience, providing them the overall seamlessness of the GPU to overall
playing their game. And remember, we're continuously working with many of those
game developers to bring to life so many of those great features inside of the game.
So those that are very graphic intensive, we are working hand-in-hand with them for
many months before the game ever even comes out. So we have just a diﬀerent
approach in terms of befriending our overall gamers and having a very well-
established channel that knows how to reach those overall gamers that inﬂuences
our gamers coming back time and time again. They are the trusted value of both the
best processing capabilities. But also the great seamlessness of understanding the
overall gaming industry. So the competitors haven't changed much. They've been
the same competitors for 20-some-odd years. But we have again inﬂuenced both
the high-end types of gamers as well as the early entrants. Those early entrants are
continuing to use NVIDIA because we had a product that meets all of those diﬀerent
needs, whether or not you have $100 to spend or whether or not you want the top-
of-the-line $1,000 GPU for gaming, we have something there. So I think the
competition will always be there. But again, it's a tough nut to crack. It's not
something that just takes a couple of months to do. Our strategy is well ingrained of
a system, of the ecosystem. And I think it's here to stay.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Okay. Great. We have about 8 minutes left. I still have a bunch of questions. I just
wanted to make sure if we had any questions from the audience? There's one right
there in the (seventh) row.
So I think you mentioned earlier last year that there was a diﬀerent driver used for
crypto mining versus normal gaming. And are you able to tell the diﬀerence
between which GPUs were using -- used for crypto and which ones were used for
mining -- sorry, for gaming? I think the latest crypto stuﬀ, people have been using
just the latest NVIDIA drivers so it's hard to diﬀerentiate, right? But I think the one
thing they still do, is they overclock the memory. Are you able to ﬁgure out what
percentage of GPUs you're selling are like memory overclock versus normal
overclock?

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Q - Toshiya Hari
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Colette M. KressOkay. So let me -- for the room, we talked about last year. Yes. We brought to market
a speciﬁc overall GPU card speciﬁcally for the cryptocurrency market. Those are
captured not in our gaming business. But those are captured in our OEM business.
And you can essentially see them in the overall OEM business. They diﬀer because
they also don't do graphics. They're really just there for overall computation. Yes. We
are still selling those overall cards. But with the overall price increases that we had
seen in cryptocurrency valuations within Q4, people bought those. But also moved
to buy regular GPUs, which caused a signiﬁcant amount of supply constraint just
because you had them moving also into regular overall GPUs. Could be that they
were planning to do both gaming and mining together. The second question was
about the memory overclock and those types of things. Not something we can
speciﬁcally see because remember, we still don't even have a perfect understanding
of are you a pure miner, gamer? We can see a merge of that. But we don't
necessarily have the overall data ﬁgures in terms of the overclocking. Overclocking is
not something new. That's something that folks being experts along in terms of the
gaming, use the GPUs to do that. We have overall (inaudible) that choose the best
type of clocking for their overall games. But I'm sure they also may not -- possibly
(not doing) cryptocurrency. But we're not sure.
{BIO 6770302 <GO>}
Any other questions?
In terms of the process -- in terms of the product you have for the autonomous side,
can you -- do you have a sense on when do you think Level 4, Level 5 autonomous,
what's the time lines on that? And do you -- who do you see out of the automakers
versus the intermediate companies being better ready -- who's better placed today
to be ready for Level 4, Level 5?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Okay, sure. We haven't had an opportunity to talk about auto. So this is a good
opportunity. So we have our DRIVE PX platform. There's many diﬀerent parts of our
PX platform that we have for autonomous driving cars. The important piece that we
want people to understand and probably transform the lot within this year is, one,
earlier in the year, people really started to believe and understand that autonomous
driving was not going to probably take place without AI; that it really, really was an AI
problem, being able to process all of the data around the car in a nanosecond type
in order to create a path for the overall car to function was going to be key. So what's
also interesting is all the discussion regarding Level 3, Level 4 and Level 5. If you
move in terms of Level 5, Level 5 essentially says there is no steering wheel, there is
no brake pedal, there essentially is no driver. If we want to move all the way to Level
5, you go down it in a serial processing that says I'm going to get Level 3, then I'm
going to add Level 4 and Level 5. Probably not. So we introduced our Pegasus
platform within the year. The Pegasus platform is focused primarily at that Level 4
and Level 5, where you may do Level 5 in a conﬁned type of community area, a
several block radius, a college campus, a downtown area. That's an area that you
could actually map quite heavily and you could actually bring your process to the
market and remove the driver quite quickly and be functioning in that. So thinkingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 11Q - Toshiya Hari
A - Colette M. Kressabout bringing Level 5 that you need a car to drive from San Francisco to New York,
probably not necessary today. But rather thinking about this (all in the coming days).
Additionally, Level 3 moving from the advancements of high-end Level 2 and the
overall safety features that in certain scenarios, you would be able to drive yourself,
whether that be freeway driving, whether that be in parking lots to park your car, et
cetera, we'll be here also probably more in the near term. So at the same time that
we are likely to see robotaxis in certain communities as well as Level 3, they may be
about the same time. We already have the Tesla cars on the road today, which are
functioning with our overall platform. We've announced continued work, both with
Audi, pilots in terms of Volvo as well as many diﬀerent other robotaxis in terms of not
just here in the U.S.. But also international in terms of those areas. You asked a
discussion about who of the auto manufacturers are we thinking are most involved?
Actually, all of them are in all diﬀerent types of stages and diﬀerent approaches in
terms of how they want to address this market. Some of them really want to be a part
of the shuttle, want to be a part of the robotaxis. Others would continue very
similarly what they did with their high-end infotainment systems and creating high-
end cars, which will be autonomous driving at that point. What is unique about this
market versus what people put into cars in the years before, it's not about that same
just start with the ﬂeet of cars. You're talking about the transportation industry as a
whole. This is aﬀecting transportation as a service. As you see, our overall
partnership with Uber, as it thinks about a ﬂeet without a driver. This aﬀects in terms
of trucking and overall hauling materials across the country. How can we think about
using AI in those scenarios to improve both the safety and the overall eﬃciency in
terms of that market. It's not a U.S. market. There's a tremendous amount of work in
China. Overall start-ups and car companies there. Also in terms of the Europeans in
terms of having signiﬁcant amounts of ﬂeets and focus in terms of there. So this is
probably again one of the largest transformations of transportation that we've seen
in the last 100 years. But it's going to take diﬀerent starts and diﬀerent ﬁnishes just
based on how quickly they can move this out for each of those areas.

Colette, I wanted to ﬁnish oﬀ by asking about your ability to expand margins going
forward. You've done a great job growing gross margins, operating margins over the
past several years. I personally think mix improvement alone would drive gross
margins higher. But at the same time, you are expanding OpEx at a pretty fast rate.
So how should we think about your ability to grow margin going forward?
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Yes. So the company's focused on -- really on higher-end value platforms. It's really
the underlying machine regarding our overall proﬁtability and our overall margin
expansion. So it's interesting to focus on what we have. On the gross margin, what
you see is both the cost of those platforms in terms of actual components. But the
reality is the value in it is often the tremendous amount of work that our software
engineers are doing, hardware engineers that create that full end-to-end platform.
That work is in our overall OpEx. That work is a uniﬁed structure to where we can
support multiple diﬀerent platforms together and we can focus on one thing,
(inaudible) to enable that. So that whole combination has allowed us both to grow
the top line gross margins as people expand to these higher value-added platforms
while also allowing us to think thoughtfully in terms of our investments that we haveFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-02-13

Q - Toshiya Hariin terms of OpEx. So the right measure is certainly our overall margins, our overall
operating proﬁt. We reached probably close to $3.5 billion in proﬁt this year. And
even in the Fourth Quarter, we expanded margins close to more than 40%. But we
still have all those same tools in front of us as we go forward as focusing on the
higher end platforms. And we'll see how fast we can go. But we just want to make
sure that we're true to the initial -- excuse me, the additional investment that's going
to be required in our business as we think about the complexity of these platforms
going forward. We will still make sure that we are investing internally so that our
customers can take advantage of the GPUs that we're using.

Great. Thank you. So much. With that, we're out of time. Colette, again, thank you for
taking the time with us today.
{BIO 18297352 <GO>}
Thank you.
