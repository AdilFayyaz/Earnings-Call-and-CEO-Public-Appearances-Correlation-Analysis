Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We are delighted to have Ruth
Porat this afternoon for our afternoon keynote. We have a series of disclosures I have
to read. So we'll get through those ﬁrst.
Please note that any important disclosures, including my personal holdings
disclosures and Morgan Stanley's disclosures, all appear in the handout available in
the registration area and on the Morgan Stanley public website. The safe harbor --
some of the statements that Ms. Porat will make today may be considered forward-
looking. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainty that could cause
actual results to diﬀer materially. Any forward-looking statements that Ms. Porat
makes are based on assumptions as of today. And Alphabet undertakes no
obligation to update them. Please refer to Alphabet's Form 10-K for a discussion of
the risk factors that may aﬀect those results.
Ruth Porat is the CFO of Alphabet. Prior to joining Alphabet, she was the CFO of
Morgan Stanley. She has an undergraduate degree from Stanford, a graduate
degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science. And an MBA
from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, we are so delighted to
have you here. And thank you so much, Ruth.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Thank you. It's great to be back.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
A lot of questions, always a lot of things going on with Alphabet. I wanted to start
with a high-level one just to take us back a little bit over the last couple of years.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Ruth PoratStarting a new job is always a challenge. You almost have two years now in the role at
Alphabet. And I guess I'd be curious to hear about how your perspective, your daily
role. And your responsibilities and kind of how your outlook have changed from year
1 to year 2.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So Google has always been about innovation. And I would say if there's anything
that deﬁned year 1, it was about putting in place a structure that really helped us
push the frontier. And as we've talked about a lot, the beneﬁt of this structure is it
really supported greater focus within each of Google and Other Bets. And along
with that focus, we did a lot of work to really build out the set of data available for
our leaders that enabled them to make better decisions, faster decisions. It gave
them a better sense of all of the resources associated with any one of the products,
projects, eﬀorts that they were approaching. And within Other Bets, year 1 was really
about, again, focusing the portfolio. We brought in a number of great leaders and
we set up milestones for the various businesses.
So if you shift to year 2, we're really building on a lot of the process and insights from
that data as we look at what are the strategic priorities within each of Google and
Other Bets. And how do we best allocate resources to ensure that we continue to
push the frontier, with a lens to how do we use those resources most appropriately.
I would say one of the things that may sound a bit geeky. But was actually, I think,
really, really insightful was the shift in focus to GAAP reporting versus non-GAAP,
because what that really captured was a lot of the work done over that year and a
half to 2-year period to push a view of resources down to business leaders as they're
assessing how much are they consuming for each of the eﬀorts. And so that's sort of
been the journey. And we're moving on.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
We've been pushing that GAAP drumbeat as well. So hopefully, we'll get there.
Another one, I guess. So last year when we were sitting here, we talked a little bit
about what surprised you most since joining. And you mentioned what really struck
you is when you ﬁrst started working at Alphabet, how early stage it was for the
Company. And that was for online advertising, that was for cloud, that was for
machine learning, that was for virtual reality. And a lot of areas, it was really early.
Which of those areas would you say you've really made the most progress on, a year
ago versus now?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well I think that what still surprises me is how early we are. And I would say that the
data from last year underscores that that was a really fair assessment. When you think
about it, we had 24% revenue growth in 2016 on a ﬁxed FX basis, from $75 billion in
revenues up to $90 billion in revenues. And sitting here today as we look out, I
would say we almost have greater conﬁdence about the upside across the various
areas.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Ruth PoratSo Mobile Search continues to grow. The Assistant, we feel we've just started to
scratch the surface of what the Assistant can do for you. YouTube, again, increasing
user consumption. If you look at what machine learning is doing, not just within the
Assistant and recommendations on YouTube. But really across the Alphabet portfolio
of businesses, it's absolutely extraordinary and accelerating. If we then talk about
some of the biggest bets within Google, as you look at what's going on with the
Cloud, I think the work that Diane has led over the past year, building out the
organization and some of the functional gaps, really sets us up well for a large and
accelerating market.
Similarly, in Hardware, we're very early. We're pleased with the Fourth Quarter results
with our expanded family of products. But I think it's pretty evident we've only
scratched the surface there. Then when you look at the Other Bets, we're really
focusing on large addressable markets. If you think about, for example, what Waymo
can accomplish, again building on machine learning. But a very large addressable
market. And we're early days. Pleased with the progress on technology, pleased with
the progress of FCA. But very early days.
Or if you look at Verily, we talked last year about the work we're doing in diabetes
management with Novartis and Sanoﬁ. We've added a partnership with GSK, with
Glaxo. And we've also changed the way we're looking at executing some of these
steps. Bringing in Temasek as a minority investor with their $800 million investment
really underscores that what we're trying to do is focus on the best way to maximize
value over the long term. And what's attractive to us about them is their experience
in life sciences and the depth they have in Asia. So again, very early there.
So across the portfolio, to us it's early days. And to us, that's the exciting thing. I
listed a host of items. But it's pretty remarkable. And I would say that if there's one
point we take away from it, it is that notwithstanding market cap or revenues or the
number of employees we have, that isn't necessarily a proxy for level of maturity
when you're addressing markets as large as the ones that we're talking about here
and given their stage of development.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. To that point of size not mattering, on Google Websites, your largest business, in
2010, Google Websites was a $20 billion business, growing a little over 20% constant
currency. Then in 2016, it's a little over a $60 billion business, growing, we think,
around 25% constant currency. Pretty impressive. So could you just talk about two or
three of the biggest factors that are driving that, both consistency and then the
recent acceleration? And how deep is the pipeline for that to continue going
forward?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
That's a great question, because it really does go to how early we are. And that's, the
Sites revenue growth, is obviously driven by Mobile Search and YouTube as we've
talked about quarter after quarter. And so if you try and focus in on the biggestFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)

Ruth Poratdrivers of that, I would say one is we're riding a secular wave here, just the
addressable market continues to grow when you look, in particular, at mobile usage.
And the second is no question, our maniacal focus on innovation. And so as it relates
to the addressable market, obviously, increasing penetration of smartphones. But
more to that, the utility of these devices. We talk a lot about micro-moments, how
we're all on and oﬀ the phone constantly because of the ability to get actionable,
relevant material wherever you are when you want it, a lot of that beneﬁting from
machine learning. I think more to come with the Assistant.
Then when you look at what we're layering on top of it, whether it's voice recognition
or AMP or user formats, ad formats, analytics, it's one thing after the other that makes
these devices more usable for the user and for the advertiser. And so those are the
two. It's the backdrop of riding a secular wave and then adding through innovation.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Through innovation. On voice search, one of my favorite topics, last year at Google
I/O, you said that 20% of searches on the Google App on Android smartphones in
the US were voice search now. That's a lot. It's more than we thought. And you also
have the Google Home now. That's a great device that, as we were talking about, my
2-year-old has to say goodnight to you every day. So the Google Home is becoming
part of my home.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Hopefully, that's true for everyone out there.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Okay, Google, goodnight, has to happen every day. So talk about Alphabet's voice
search strategy for the next 3 to ﬁve years. And how do you ensure that you continue
to lead search as consumer behavior migrates over to voice?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So we are excited about the Assistant. I think one of the extraordinary elements of it,
we started on Pixel, we've gone to Home, we've gone to Android Wear. And
hopefully, you've seen that we're now on millions of Android devices so that if you
have Marshmallow or Nougat, you can use the Assistant. And what's really
extraordinary about what we're seeing users do is people are increasingly moving
seamlessly across diﬀerent surfaces. And that's probably best illustrated. And partly
by your kid. But what we're seeing with YouTube video is when you couple that with
Chromecast, the fastest-growing segment is actually the living room. And so what
people are doing is moving quickly from voice into other surfaces. And our view is
that having the ability to move seamlessly across all of these various areas will
continue to be a critical determinant.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 14Brian Nowak
Ruth Porat
Brian NowakAnd when you take what we bring to bear, again going back to machine learning,
with our natural language capabilities and you layer on top of that image recognition
or location, user context, you're bringing together a whole host of things which are
increasingly valuable for voice search.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. Makes a lot of sense. So on the topic of the living room. And I want to move to
YouTube, because advertisers and agencies that we speak with continue to say that
YouTube is still destination number 1 when it comes to online video to talk about
viewability, love the TrueView ad format. Competition does seem to be increasing a
little bit in the video side. Talk about main priorities for YouTube in 2017 on both the
advertiser side as well as the core user side.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So we are excited about YouTube and what it does. We've talked a lot about having
more than a billion users. Hopefully, you all saw that we now have over a billion
hours of daily watch time, which we're really proud of. I think it's a rather staggering
number. But 60% of that is on mobile and tablet. And that number is continuing to
grow. So we do think that we're early in the cycle for YouTube with respect to both
ad formats, that use the best ad formats. And the experience for users. And you
asked about what drives each.
So on the ad side, we've always had a lot of success with TrueView and then moving
to Google Preferred. We're very excited about what the Bumper ads can do, the 6-
second Bumper ads, what it means for advertisers and what it means for users. So
again, it's continuing to evolve what the opportunity is on this platform.
Then when you asked me about the priorities for users, one of them is continuing to
build out Red, YouTube Red. I think as we talked about on a number of calls, the
opportunity to oﬀer a subscription service to those who want that type of format, we
view as an attractive add-on to all that we're doing. We're continuing to develop
content for YouTube Red. We have 28 original shows now and continuing to build
there. And we're also extending to kids' content. So that is clearly one very important
area.
The other important area is Community. We've talked a lot about that this year
already. What's valuable there is not only are we connecting content creators to
users. But users to one another. And just the ability to be able to stay closely
connected on all of the things that one loves on YouTube has been really important.
And much of this -- I keep coming back to machine learning. But machine learning
continues to be a really valuable component of the oﬀering, making sure that we're
serving you and what you want, building oﬀ of the types of things that you consume.

Brian Nowak
Ruth PoratAs part of what I consume, on the last conference call, Sundar mentioned that you
already work with TV networks, individual shows, sports leagues to bring premium
content to YouTube. I guess I'd be curious to hear how important is having more
premium content on YouTube part of the go-forward strategy?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well as he said, as we've repeatedly said, premium content, we do view as very
valuable. It's what we like to consume. It goes back in part to my comment about
micro-moments. It's how many times can you pop on and oﬀ and watch, whether it's
SNL or Colbert or Ellen or a sports snippet or a news snippet. Like whatever it is,
people are increasingly, as evidenced by the billion hours daily watched, picking
their time when they want to see something, go deeper into something. And that
content is highly valued by our community.
I think the other point, though, that I view as really key, is Nielsen data suggests that
if you watched a YouTube video, you are 33% more likely to then go and watch that
program on television. And so overall, for the entire ecosystem, this is mutually
reinforcing.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Yes. A question on margins. Core margins, typically they seem to be a pretty hot-
button topic among investors. Over the past few quarters, we get a lot of questions
around Alphabet and really core Google margins have started to compress a bit year
on year, in 3Q and 4Q. A couple of questions for you. One, if we peel back the
layers, what's driving that core Google margin compression? Then two, could your
continued cost-focus cause that to reverse as we go throughout the year?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So that's sort of an age-old Google question. I know I've been asked it a bunch, as
have others at Google and Alphabet. And it all starts with the extraordinary valuable
desktop business that was our heritage. When you're starting with something like
that, as we've often said, anything you add, from a margin perspective, is likely -- or
will; I should not say is likely -- will put pressure on margins.
But as we repeatedly said, what we're focused on is revenue growth, earnings
growth. And proﬁt dollars. And we will continue to invest to make sure that we
continue to address the other things you've already asked about -- user experience,
advertiser experience, the opportunity set. We'll continue to invest in those to extend
our growth rate. And this is very much about looking for long-term revenue and
earnings growth. And even though businesses other than desktop will compress
margins, when you look at what's the long-term revenue growth, the earnings
growth. And proﬁt dollars, that's what we will keep coming back to. And we're
excited about the opportunities that we have out there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 7 of 14Brian Nowak
Ruth Porat
Brian NowakThat's sort of the long-term view. There is one thing just to note, which I did
comment on in the Fourth Quarter call, as you're looking at your First Quarter
modeling. I did mention that we've shifted our stock-based comp refresh cycle.
Historically, it was always in the Third Quarter of the year. And I indicated we're
moving it to the First Quarter. And the reason for that is we're putting all the
components of comp into one period rather than sprinkling them throughout the
year. So this is not an increase in stock-based comp or a change in philosophy. We're
just moving it to the First Quarter. And I call it out only because that means that the
step-up that you typically see in the Third Quarter, it's going to be in the First
Quarter. It's a half-grant.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
One of my favorite topics is -- yes, small change. One of my favorite topics that we
talked about last year was gating when it comes to budgeting. And you're tightening
the reins a little bit on the budget. I guess I'd be curious to hear about how the
gating process is going now and just how you think about the successes and
milestones and big hurdles that you see going on right now inside of Alphabet to
make sure that the budget and gating process are staying tight.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So I think it has served us, is serving us well. We start again with the notion that we're
focused on driving innovation. And it's about long-term revenue growth. But to
achieve moonshots, you want to have markers along the way. You want to have
leaders who are truly visionary and have huge ambition and then markers along the
way.
I would say as a banker to tech companies in my prior life, I certainly saw a lot of
people who had huge ambition and couldn't get to the ﬁnish line. And what we're
looking at with milestones is the ability to really have markers along the way. And it
starts with technology and the improvements in technology and some of the
operational elements. It's ﬁnancial elements.
And this enables us to really mid-course correct, gauge where we are. I would say
that it's serving us really well. We work closely with the leaders to articulate what are
those milestones along the way. For example, with Waymo, we start with safety,
safety, safety. So it's all about technology and testing. There's been a lot of data that I
commented on in the Fourth Quarter call. A recent report that came out on testing.
But there's a whole series of work we do as we're going through the technology
portion of it which precedes, then, what's the pace of investment as you're going
into a broader execution.
We obviously have talked also about driving down hardware costs and some of the
progress on cars. But each one of these elements is a marker along the way to what
we view as really sizable opportunities.

Ruth PoratMakes sense. Google Cloud, GCP, one of the big opportunities that's still in the core
of Google. You made several high-proﬁle hires over the last year. You continue to roll
out new products. Had a couple of big account wins, Snapchat being one of them.
What are the biggest learnings so far around GCP. And just talk about both the
biggest challenges you see you need to overcome. And then what are the strategic
priorities for this year?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So it is a huge strategic priority for us. We start with the notion that we are a very
demanding client ourselves -- $90 billion in revenues, very demanding. And we're in
the cloud and really thrilled with all that Diane is leading here, building out, as I said,
the organization and ﬁlling in some of the key areas.
The key things. And she's talked about this at a recent conference. Enterprises are
clearly moving to the cloud at an accelerating rate. And we're very well positioned
for that. And as we're seeing the take-up, really gratiﬁed with the progress that we've
been making. And the other thing is that we're increasingly seeing large enterprise
customers adopting G Suite, given the strength that that provides and the
functionality.
In terms of her priorities, she's articulated ﬁve of them. One is ongoing investments
in sales, marketing. And engineering talent. The second is deep integration with our
customers on an ongoing basis, from proof of concept to ﬁrst deployment to
ongoing development, optimization. And new workload additions. Third is building
out partnerships. Fourth is the ongoing investment to give our customers an
ongoing technology advantage. I mean, this really goes to what we've been talking
about. Everything that we're doing in data analytics and machine learning and
security and developer productivity and automation. Then ﬁnally, we're continuing to
push the footprint globally. And that to us is an important part of it, including all the
compliance and other related work. So we view it as one of the most important
opportunities we have and one that's moving at an accelerating pace.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Accelerating pace. It's a big opportunity. There's often press speculation around
Alphabet trying to really accelerate its cloud strategy through M&A. You don't have
to talk speciﬁcally about cloud M&A; you can if you like. But maybe at a higher level,
can you just talk philosophically about how Alphabet tries to think about the
decision of whether it wants to buy or build when it addresses big opportunities like
this?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well so Diane has been very strategic and targeted in using M&A, ﬁlling in, in certain
places. But more broadly, we view M&A as a very valuable complement to all that we
do organically. It's not lost on us that three of our seven properties with over a billion
users came to us through acquisition -- YouTube, Android. And Geo. Then on top of
that, DoubleClick has been and continues to be a really important centerpiece for allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)

Ruth Poratthat we're doing in programmatic. So we look at what we've been able to
accomplish through M&A and, as I said, view it as a great complement to what we're
able to do organically.
We do have a high bar. We want to make sure that we are making moves that do
drive long-term shareholder value. So we do have a high bar. But certainly are very
open to it, as we've been very active with smaller deals. But continue to look.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Got it. On the Pixel -- you mentioned it earlier as one of the opportunities. So by core
Google Other Revenue, it accelerated over 60% growth in the Fourth Quarter. I think
part of that is because of Pixel and Hardware. We can see the advertising and the
brand push around Pixel. So could you just talk about why Pixel is an important part
of the Alphabet strategy?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well Sundar commented quite a bit on this on the earnings call. In our view, having
Pixel enables us to bring, really, a seamless Google experience to users. It brings
what we view as the best of hardware and software working together, whether that's
security updates or what we're doing with the Assistant. So we're pleased. We
started with the Assistant on Pixel. And now moving it, as I said, on to M&N. But it's
enabling us to bring those two together in an integrated, seamless fashion.
It also enables us to present the experience the way we think we'd like to see it
presented through sales, marketing. And in-store placement. And we're working with
our retail partners to make sure that we're presenting, again, the overall experience.
So we continue to view it as early and complementing a lot of the other things that
we're doing.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Got it. Understood. Moving on to Other Bets, I want to start with Waymo. You
mentioned earlier, safety, safety, safety. One of the things that happened with
Waymo is it recently graduated from X to become a standalone entity. Talk about,
what does that mean for Waymo and how it gets capitalized, how it operates. And
how it really continues to move into the driverless car space.
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So what graduation means is it evidences a level of development across many
elements of the business. It started with safety continues to be the key driver, the key
thing we remain focused on. But when you look at the incredible progress that the
team has made, the level of disengagement and again, all reﬂected in the safety
report, we're really pleased with the work they've done there. Our CEO, John Krafcik,
has spoken about hardware costs and the amount of expense there and driving
expenses down. So that was another element of it, has made tremendous progressFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 14Brian Nowak

Brian Nowakwith FCA and continuing to push the opportunity with the car. So we just kind of
looked across the set and say it's reached a certain level of development where it's
time to graduate them from X, very similar to what we did with Verily when they
reached a certain point in their execution, building out the team and certain
elements of the business.
When we graduate someone from X, they're still reported in Other Bets, Verily is, as
Waymo will continue to be. But really, it's a codiﬁcation. And understand it's very
exciting for the team, because it underscores that they've really hit a host of these
milestones and they're moving down the path.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Graduation. Fiber. There's been a lot of debate about Fiber strategy throughout
2016. So I have a few questions for you. Investors often debate, with myself and
some of my colleagues, the strategy may have changed. So I guess a few questions.
Did the strategy change? And if so, how has it changed and how do you think about
the strategic vision for Fiber in the next couple of years?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
So we announced on the Third Quarter call that we were pausing some of the work
that we were doing in Fiber in order to give ourselves time to continue to progress
from the engineering work we're doing on both deployments and delivery. We're
continuing to support our existing subscribers. And we're adding new subscribers.
And we're continuing to go into a number of additional cities. But we have paused a
number of additional cities. And the view is we're making ample progress on the
engineering front. We want to make sure that as we continue to deploy this broadly,
we're doing it as eﬀectively and eﬃciently as possible. And that's what the pause that
we talked about in the Third Quarter meant.
We are continuing to build out the business. We remain excited about the long-term
opportunities as, hopefully, you saw we brought in a new CEO. We're excited about
him and the opportunity, given his industry experience. In addition, we've made
some changes on sizing of the operation. We didn't need quite the centralized
organization, given we're pausing. But we had a lot of people with tremendous
technical expertise, whether in hardware or in content. So there was ample
opportunity within Google. But we are continuing to move forward with it and
excited about the opportunity. We thought this was the most eﬀective way to
execute on what is a long-term growth plan.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Alphabet has a very strong balance sheet and cash balance. You've authorized about
$7 billion in share repurchases. How are you thinking about capital allocation
strategy going forward? And talk about the potential or the idea of either increasing
debt capacity or maybe eventually doing a dividend.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)

Brian Nowak
Ruth Porat{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well the approach to capital allocation hasn't changed since I articulated it on our
call back in 2015. It really is, again, I start with we remain committed to long-term
revenue and earnings growth and investing in the types of things that will continue
to propel our performance.
So it starts with organic growth and the types of investments necessary to support
organic growth. What we then do is a sensitivity analysis around M&A on the one
hand. And CapEx and investments on the other hand. And look at what does that
mean for the type of reserve that we've built in. Given the markets we operate in are
large, dynamic. And highly competitive, we like the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility that comes
with having a decent buﬀer. But given our cash balance, our view was we could
initiate a share repurchase. And we did. And I was very pleased when we came back
and were able to start on a second share repurchase program.
In our most recent K, we did indicate that we haven't paid a dividend and don't
intend to in the foreseeable future. And again, that goes to the ﬂexibility that we see
in the approach that we're taking. We continue to review it with the Board and in that
framework.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Understood. We are going to open it up to audience Q&A in a couple of minutes. If
you do have any questions, feel free to raise your hand. And the mic runners are out
running.
Measurability is something that comes up quite a bit, in particular over the past six
months when you talk to advertisers, when you talk to agencies, just making sure that
they're really getting the return for their advertising dollars. Can you talk about what
Alphabet is doing to really make sure that the transparency is there for the
advertisers? Is there anything, really, to come over the next 12 to 18 months to
improve that?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yes. So we completely agree. Eﬀective measurement tools are absolutely imperative
and are a key part of ongoing growth in the industry. And that's why we continue to
invest as much as we do in measurement tools across our products.
We do also work with a number of third-party measurement partners. Nielsen and
comScore are obviously at the front of that. And that's really just validating all that
we're doing. We maintain over 30 MRC accreditations, including AdWords, YouTube.
And DoubleClick. And we're currently in the process of accrediting and auditing
third-party viewability integrations on YouTube via the MRC. And we think that's

the metrics that we provide to advertisers. And we're continuing to invest here.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

Got it. One of the businesses that doesn't really get a lot of light is the Network
business. And the Network business is actually -- it was better than we thought, at
least, in the Fourth Quarter. I think it accelerated to 7% growth. You talked about
programmatic and AdMob. Is there any further light, or can you peel back the onion
a little bit more on what's going on in the programmatic space that's driving
Alphabet gains in this market?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Well I tried to be clear on the earnings call. But as we've talked about repeatedly, the
Network business consists of, well as you know, of a lot of diﬀerent businesses. In the
Fourth Quarter, a lot of things just went well and rounded to the positive. And what I
tried to call out was that we didn't view that acceleration as an inﬂection point or
something that we would extrapolate from. The programmatic side of the business
continues to grow well. We're thrilled that we have made the investments over the
years to be well positioned there. But we continue to have headwinds from the more
legacy business. So a lot went well. But don't extrapolate from it.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
Understood. We have time for a couple of questions. Questions in the audience? No
questions in the audience? One?
Questions And Answers
Could you elaborate a little bit more on what you said earlier about the shift from
non-GAAP to GAAP being helpful?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
I think it's been really useful when we look at planning for all of our leaders to have a
full picture of all of the resources that they're using for any particular product or
project. So again, the shift has been moving from one where headcount was viewed
as numbers of people rather than the OpEx associated with those people. Any
decision on planning and prioritization, you start with what's the strategic priority
and what's the addressable market, what's our diﬀerentiated advantage, why do we
want to be in it? But I think that it's very potent to be able to see across a whole host
of diﬀerent things that we're doing, what types of resources you're applying against
it.
And some of the opportunities that kind of pop up where there may be nice projects
or products and you start to see the fully loaded costs and the question is, over the
near to long term, is that the highest and best use of resources? Are there other
places that we should be applying them? And my view, very strongly -- our view, very
strongly -- is anchor decisions in data. And you're going to make sharper decisions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

they want more data because it enables them to ﬁgure out exactly within all of the
things that they're looking at, how do you make the best trade-oﬀs.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
It's a much fuller representation of the costs, too.
As we think about the increased transparency with Other Bets and the losses that
Other Bets had, is there any future thoughts about how to give even more
transparency since the market capitalizes those losses? And when you think about
graduating from the X program, is Alphabet just the technology holding company,
with Google the ﬁrst public subsidiary of their graduation (inaudible)?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Yes. It's a great question and one we've spent a lot of time thinking about and weigh
a whole host of diﬀerent elements. I think it was helpful when we moved to Alphabet
and we were able to highlight how much is going into Other Bets. And we've seen
over the year, we spent a lot of time shaping that portfolio. So even though the
investment in Other Bets has been pretty constant year on year, there's been a lot of
movement within the various portfolio. And I think that therefore your question is a
very fair question.
Breaking it out, I think, addressed some of the concern that we had that we were
maybe going -- we're unrestrained there. And this was giving you a sense that we're
making bets, we're going to continue to make big bets because we think that we're
attacking big opportunities that will drive long-term growth. But it addressed a
question. I appreciate every time we address a question. It wisely raises other
questions. And we continue to add to what we're doing. We're thinking about all sort
of things, adding -- the shift to GAAP was one of the helpful things. But appreciate
the question. Nothing to add today.
{BIO 16819013 <GO>}
And probably one more.
Yes, how do you think about, given the growing size of cash balance of the business
and just the absolute huge scale of the Company, how do you just think about large
acquisitions going forward?
{BIO 2536317 <GO>}
Again, I'm not sure I have much to add other than what I said. I think that we are
open to making smart moves that support growth in the business and that are
consistent with core competencies so that we're actually adding value to anything
that we bring on or it ﬁts elegantly within what we're doing. Acquisitions have beenFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-02-27

A - Ruth Poratan important part of our success, as I've already said. Some of our anchor tenants
came through acquisitions. So we've got a great team that looks at them when they
cross the platform and are open. But we think that it's appropriate, just because we
have cash doesn't mean we'd be applying it in one step into something really large.
We want to make sure that it ﬁts, that it's strategically smart. And that we can deliver
the kind of return that you should all expect of us.

Okay, Ruth thank you so much.
