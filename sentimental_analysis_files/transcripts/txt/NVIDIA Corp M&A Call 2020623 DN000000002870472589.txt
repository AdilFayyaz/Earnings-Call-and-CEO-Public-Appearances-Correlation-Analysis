Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to a very special
announcement on behalf of Mercedes-Benz and NVIDIA. My name is Yasmine. I am
your host today for this conversation, and I am very excited to have two high-proﬁle
executives from two separate industries. And as I've just learned, these are about to
join forces in an entirely new way. But don't take my word for it. Let me introduce my
two guests today.
First of all, we have live with us from Santa Clara, California, Founder and CEO of
NVIDIA. Good morning to you, Jensen Huang.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Good morning, Yasmine. Nice to see you.
Nice to see you as well, Jensen. And also live with us from Stuttgart in Germany, CEO
of Mercedes-Benz. Good evening to you, Ola Kallenius.
Hello, Yasmine. Great to be here.
Hi, Ola. Nice to see you again. Great to have you, gentlemen. Now, today, Ola, I
would like to stick with you for now. Mercedes-Benz is known for ﬁnely engineered
luxury vehicles. But as I understand, you are about to add new layers, so to speak toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-23

Jensen Huangthat experience for your customers, so why don't you ﬁll us in, Ola, what is today's
big news all about?
Absolutely. We're here today to launch very important strategic partnership between
two great companies, Mercedes-Benz and NVIDIA. What do we want to do? In
simple terms, we want to launch a groundbreaking software-deﬁned high
performance computer architecture for driving assistance and autonomous drive.
And that's the next generation that will go into the Mercedes ﬂeet, targeting a launch
sometime towards the end of 2024. That's what we're here for today.
That is big news. Very exciting news indeed, Ola. And Jensen, NVIDIA, you guys have
made a huge name for yourself in the gaming industry. But there is so much more
going on at NVIDIA, maybe not everyone is aware of that. So why don't you tell us,
Jensen, how does this collaboration ﬁt into the company strategy perfectly?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well, NVIDIA is all about solving problems that ordinary computers can't solve. And
autonomous vehicles is one of the world's great challenges. And if solved, has
enormous impact on the world. You know that the world drives some 17 billion --
excuse me, 17 trillion miles per year. And someday, all of those miles are going to be
completely autonomous or assisted. And we are at practically zero today. Going from
here to there is going to require some bold steps, new technology, new products,
new applications and services. And today, we're starting that with the -- with a once
in a lifetime, the biggest opportunity here, a partnership with Mercedes and we're
super excited about that.
It does sound super exciting, and it sounds like there's still a lot to come. Maybe
we'll get back to that at the end of the conversation, what we have to look forward to
in the future. Now, Ola, this announcement comes a somewhat of a surprise. We
have been speaking about strategies at Mercedes-Benz these past couple of weeks.
Didn't see this one coming. So, how does this co-operation ﬁt into your strategy at
Mercedes-Benz? Same question here?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yasmine, this ﬁts perfectly into the strategic future of Mercedes-Benz as an innovative
company. We were one of the ﬁrst pioneers more than two decades ago that started
working on driving assistant systems. And this is a ﬁeld that has so many
opportunities. It will make driving much safer in the future, all the way to
autonomous drive. So, I would like to describe this partnership for us at Mercedes-
Benz, really hitting two dimensions. One is the customer.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-23

Ola Kallenius
Jensen HuangWith regard to the customer through the technology that we're going to put on the
road together with NVIDIA, it will be endless possibilities in driving assistance and
also all the way to autonomous drive. And through an architecture, that makes it
possible to update this experience during the lifetime of the vehicle, really releasing
hardware architecture from software architectures. So it will be, in a way, for the
customer, the gift that keeps on giving. It will always stay fresh and we can add more
technology to it. That's the one aspect.
The second aspect, it's also important for the business model of our company. Many
people talk about the car, the modern car, the new car as kind of the smartphone on
wheels. If you want to take that approach, you really have to look at software
architectures from a holistic point of view. And that's a decision that we have made at
Mercedes, creating our own Mercedes-Benz operating system.
And one of the most important domains here is the driving assistant domain. And
that needs to dovetail into that, what we call, software-driven architecture, to be able
to, with high computing power, add use cases for the customer. In this case, the
driving assistant autonomous space throughout the whole life and also add revenue
streams, recurrent revenue streams, additional to the ones that we have already
today to our business. So from these two dimensions, we are very excited about this
partnership.
And from both dimensions, strategically makes a lot of sense, of course. Thank you,
Ola. Obviously, there is also a great mutual respect between both of you, the two
companies. You have already successfully worked together in the past. You have the
history with MBUX. But nevertheless, let me ask you this. Ola, you have options at
Mercedes-Benz. Out of all of these, why team up with NVIDIA? And the same
question goes out to you, by the way, Jensen. At NVIDIA, you have been working
and you work with other OEMs. Why team up with Mercedes-Benz? Ola, perhaps
you would like to go ﬁrst?
Well, the answer is really simple. We want to work with the best. And we feel that
NVIDIA is the best when it comes to putting this technology on the road. We already
have experience. I think what we did together in the infotainment domain, what we
call MBUX, the user experience in the car for MB. A few years ago when Jensen and I
talked about this, he said, I have this new Parker chip coming and it's going to be
fantastic. Do you want to go ﬁrst? Do you want to put some real power into your car?
And anybody who is a gaming fan knows what the graphic, especially the graphic
power is of NVIDIA's processors. And we did it. And I think we put the MBUX on top
with the help of NVIDIA. So to go to a now much deeper, much broader
collaboration and in an even more technically sophisticated domain, I think it was a
natural ﬁt for us.

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 11Yasmine BlairYeah. This is the biggest partnership of its kind in the transportation industry that's
ever happened. And I can't imagine a better company to do this with. This is a
gigantic endeavor. And this partnership breaks grounds in several diﬀerent fronts. Of
course, the ﬁrst part is the technology and we're leveraging NVIDIA's multi-billion,
multi-year investment in a platform -- autonomous vehicle platform, we call the
NVIDIA DRIVE.
And this is the ﬁrst time a partnership that is going to work together from top to
bottom and end-to-end, from the chip to the most powerful computer, to the system
software, to the application for autonomous driving from end-to-end, from data
collection to AI model creation and testing and virtual reality simulation and over-
the-air updates, this is a partnership that goes deep and is top to bottom end-to-
end.
The second part is that the entire product is going to be designed diﬀerently,
whereas in the past, a car is at its best condition at the point of sales in the moment
you take ownership of it. But in the future, this is going to be a perpetual upgradable
machine. And there'll be thousands of engineers that are working along with your
car for the entire life of the car. And their software is going to be developed on these
AI supercomputers to write the special type of machine learning application that will
then be upgraded into the car for its entire life.
The business model, as Ola said, is going to be transformed. This is a brand-new
business model opportunity for the two of our companies. For the very ﬁrst time,
we're going to be developing applications for a ﬂeet of cars that will be on the road
for quite a long time. And these machines that Mercedes built are so high quality, so
well engineered, they last to 10 years, 20 years on the road. And for the very ﬁrst
time, we'll be able to oﬀer applications to these customers for their entire life.
And then, of course, the last part of it. The user experience is going to be
transformed. And I can't imagine a better company to do this with. The engineering,
the market, the customer base, the loyalty of the customer base, the incredible
brand and of course, the gigantic global scale of Mercedes. In order to make this
technology work, we have to invest greatly. In order to beneﬁt from this business
model, you need a very large installed base. But if we could create those two
conditions, which I have every conﬁdence we will, we will absolutely revolutionize
how cars are sold, how products are created and how customers enjoy their
automobiles in the future.
This is -- Jensen, this is groundbreaking news and you've just mentioned on how
many diﬀerent levels the news is groundbreaking. And I keep on using the term
market changer in my mind. What do you think? This is a question that goes out to
both of you. What do you think this co-operation between your two companies is
going to change for perhaps the entire automotive market in the future.
Ola, would you like to go ﬁrst on this one?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-23

Page 5 of 11Ola Kallenius
Yasmine Blair
Jensen HuangFor us, this is such a crucial part of our strategy. As I mentioned in the analogy of a
smartphone on wheels, we are developing a full-scale operating system for the
whole vehicle. So a Mercedes-Benz operating system. And there is no domain that is
more important on that map than driving assistance and autonomous drive. So, this
eﬀort of an operating system, it will work seamlessly with the work that we're doing
now with NVIDIA that we already started, as I mentioned in the infotainment domain.
So literally, we will have the software architecture that will be downloadable over the
air. And as Jensen said, throughout the life of the car and this is 10 years, plus 20
years, that you can just keep on adding use cases in diﬀerent domains and
speciﬁcally in this domain of autonomous drive and driving assistance. And I think,
as I see technology develop here and sensors are getting better and the perception
and all those things are moving along, it's literally going to change the driving
experience and also increase safety. So it's technology that will ultimately save lives.
Jensen, how much potential do you see for the future market? I'm sorry.
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
The deﬁnition -- the deﬁnition of the car is going to change forever. No longer will
the best moment of your car experience be at the point of sale. In the future, the car
is the starting point. The beautiful amazing Mercedes-Benz is the starting point of
their experience with Mercedes-Benz. Behind it will be thousands of engineers. And
those thousands of engineers are like, they're going to stay with you, they are
personal software and artiﬁcial intelligence research lab, that's going to stay with you
your entire ownership life of that car.
And every car will have software engineers and supercomputers that comes with it.
It's quite an amazing thing. They witness the car. They enjoy the car. But behind it, at
Mercedes-Benz, at NVIDIA, we're going to have software engineers and
supercomputing infrastructures, and it's going to continuously enhance that car. The
business model, of course, of the car industry will change.
I am absolutely convinced that this business model is going to revolutionize the way
the cars are sold and cars are enjoyed. For the entire life of the car, you'll be able to
add new value to your customers. They'll be able to enjoy new services. You can
enhance it, update it, make it even better. Could you imagine owning a product and
at a point that you eventually would like to hand it to your child? That car was
actually -- is actually better than the car that you bought because the software was
better, the capability was better, it was more personalized to you, it's smarter. All of
these capabilities are simply not possible in the past. But for the very ﬁrst time, the
combination of circumstances of technology availability that we have now and a
great partnership we have with Mercedes, we can now revolutionize the car industry.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-23

Ola Kallenius
Yasmine Blair
Jensen HuangAll right, gentlemen. We have received a number of questions throughout the day.
And I'm going to try and get some of them covered as many as possible.
The ﬁrst one up is for you, Ola. And of course, this is about BMW. People are
wondering, Daimler and BMW have just announced the end of their autonomous car
co-operation. So the question is, does this have anything to do with the
announcement we're hearing today? And also how will this impact the partnership
with Bosch on AV development for robotaxi? So how is this going to eﬀect other
partnerships?
Let's call it a pause and perhaps not an end. It was mainly a timing issue. When do
you want to go for the next generation technology? And we decided that we want to
do this with NVIDIA towards the end of 2024, once we have kind of harvested our
ﬁrst generation in this domain that we're developing right now. And perhaps at
some later time, those paths will come together again. I don't know. There is still
ample room for co-operation on some of the parts that you need added to these
systems such as sensor sets and so on. So, that's more of a timing issue.
With regard to full autonomy, which is something that we have been working on for
the last few years as well. We have said, where is the best business case for that? We
believe it's truck hub-to-hub. So as we announced before Christmas, we're going to
focus on truck hub-to-hub ﬁrst and the truck team is on that case. And the more
bigger deployment of, let's say, robotaxis in an urban environment, we see that a
little bit more to the right. And that's why we're putting all our focus now and the
bulk of re-engineering resource. And they're very excited about this, by the way, into
this partnership with NVIDIA.
Thank you for that, Ola. The next question is about software and goes out to both of
you. Jensen, perhaps you would like to take this one. First, are Mercedes and NVIDIA
working on an exclusive car operating system? And is this engineering integration
for autonomous driving only or also for other domains is the question, Jensen?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Well, eventually, we would like to see all cars be autonomous. And today, as I
mentioned, 17 trillion miles are driven each year and more people are going to be
coming to earth. And over time, there will be more miles driven. All of those miles
eventually will be autonomous or autonomously assisted. We would like to see this
tech capability adopted by a large number of companies over time. And Ola would
like, too, as well. This is -- this is one of the capabilities you would like the industry to
be able to standardize on.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-23

Ola KalleniusHowever, being the ﬁrst mover has great advantages. And this is the opportunity that
we have here in working with Daimler -- excuse me, Mercedes-Benz, has the
opportunity for us to combine the great forces of two great companies to be the ﬁrst
mover of this new architecture, this new way of providing a product and service and
a new business model to the industry. With the scale of our two companies, it is the
perfect match and this is really -- this is really a combination that can transform,
revolutionize an industry.
Now, Ola, Jensen, already said in your name, Ola agrees or Ola thinks so as well.
Would you like to add anything to that?
Yeah. Absolutely. I think this is so strong. We came out of the infotainment area, as I
mentioned and now we're going into autonomous drive. And these, you can look at
it as pieces of the puzzle. The overall puzzle is what we call the software-driven
architecture, where literally, everything in the car will be in one operating system.
This -- the code for this, we are writing as we speak.
And it goes without saying that this co-operation with NVIDIA, that will ﬁt like a glove
into the software-driven architecture, so it's compatible. But I would like to add one
aspect, which I think is very, very important here. And I think Jensen kind of hinted at
it. It's the power of the chips. You need computing power for that product to be able
to grow over time and be better later then when you bought it, it's almost like you --
you always go for a little bit of an overkill on computer -- computing power in the
beginning. It's like you're buying a new house, but you're not furnishing all the
rooms at once. You leave some spare capacity to add more furniture later. And I
think, especially in the driving assistance autonomous domain, you need that
computing power. And that's what the next-generation chips of NVIDIA will provide
us here.
Let's stick to you, Ola, because the next question that goes perfectly with what you
were just speaking of. When it comes to business cases, have you thought about
ownership models of and features, pay once or subscription is the question? Are you
already that far in detail when it comes to development and planning?
To a degree, yes. Some of it, we're doing today. You can already, in our app store,
download all sorts of diﬀerent features. If it's live traﬃc, music, diﬀerent things that
are primarily but not only in the infotainment area, that we launched already a
couple of years ago with the ﬁrst generation of MBUX. And the second generation
that is coming in the new S-Class later this year will open that up. So let's say, the
story is getting bigger.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-23
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 8 of 11Yasmine Blair
Jensen Huang
Yasmine Blair
Ola KalleniusIn the area of driving assistance, we haven't done this so far. So, this new
groundbreaking partnership is going to open up that domain. And I can't stress
enough how technically sophisticated some of these problems are that you need to
solve. You need the best software engineers and of course, a high-power computing
platform. And I think the software engineers that NVIDIA provides into this
partnership are world-class. It's best in the world and we are adding our team [ph] to
that.
Ola, thank you for mentioning problem solving because the next one is about
technicalities. And Jensen, I would like to throw that your way. Now, when it comes to
hardware, many users complained that the software updates cannot be
implemented or are not supported by legacy hardware on the vehicles. How do you
intend on solving this problem?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
We are going to build this ﬂeet like no other ﬂeet has ever been built. We're going to
put into and adapt into these, into this ﬂeet of Mercedes-Benz's the most powerful
computer at its time. And we'll have plenty of headroom. It is incredibly
sophisticated. It's still being designed. Hundreds of engineers are currently
designing that processor. And it will go into a computer, that will be outﬁtted into the
entire ﬂeet. In no time in history has so much computing power been put into a car,
not to mention so much excess computing power to be put into a car.
As a result, the entire ﬂeet of Mercedes-Benz's will have one coherent architecture. It
will have more computing power than is needed at the time of selling the car, which
creates opportunities for us to upgrade it with more and more software and more
features, not to mention the thousands of engineers that are going to be with the car
and with the ﬂeet, optimizing, enhancing and creating new capabilities all along the
way. And so this is a very, very diﬀerent way of architecting cars, building out the
product line and then delivering the product and services to customers. It has never
been done this way. And I think it's going to be a revolutionary experience for
customers.
And I'm sure, they look forward to that. This is a question that I think a lot of people
have on their minds. And Ola, I would like to begin with you again. It's about Tesla. It
seems like Tesla for years have oﬀered the ability to update software in their cars.
And the question here is, what will Mercedes oﬀer that is fundamentally diﬀerent?
Ola?
I usually don't speak about competitors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-23
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 11Yasmine Blair
Ola Kallenius
Yasmine Blair
Jensen HuangI know.
But as I mentioned, we took the ﬁrst few baby steps of this over-the-air download
ability a couple of years ago. And we can see in our app store that interest is
growing. And this revenue stream is also growing. The electric electronic architecture
that comes later this year with the new S-Class makes that domain so much wider.
So, we see the opportunity here now to grow.
And with this partnership, it's like we're taking the ultimate step, dovetailing with the
overall software-driven architecture to open up the whole vehicle, paying attention
to all the traits of a Mercedes. It needs to be a luxury feel. It needs to be intuitive,
easy to use, of course, safety ﬁrst, that always comes with every Mercedes before you
deploy something that it's been properly tested and so on. So, we're on a journey
here and are quite excited about, I would say, how technology has created
opportunities for us to change our business model. And that's part of the
transformation of the auto industry that we're in the middle of.
Jensen, from the software developers' point of view?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
Yeah. Surely, for Tesla, we -- they deserve a great deal of credit for pioneering and
pushing autonomous driving and software upgradable features and most
importantly, inventing and discovering this new business model that is now proven
to be quite successful. The opportunity to sell applications into software
programmable cars is a business model that until now really hasn't had much
validation.
This is a very big deal and we're delighted by that. We're going to take this one giant
step forward unlike anything that's been done before. Of course, the quality of safety
and the quality of engineering is going to be at a level that's never been seen. The
capability is at a level that's never been seen. But no Mercedes-Benz customers have
ever enjoyed something like this before. And now this entire market of Mercedes-
Benz customers who love Mercedes-Benz's will have the beneﬁt of this new way of
enjoying cars, new way of buying into features, a new way of enjoying value over
time. And then, of course, lastly, just a incredible scale of Mercedes. Ola runs an
organization that's gigantic and manufactured, and sales and markets and have loyal
customers all over the world. This level of scale has never been achieved before.
And so I think the combination of all those things will be able to really make a
diﬀerence.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-23

Yasmine Blair
Jensen HuangJensen, thank you for mentioning the customers because the last question we're
going to take is actually on behalf of the customers. You say, this will extend the life
of the car. So the ﬁrst question is how will this aﬀect repurchase cycles and
downstream used car market? But also, again, very interesting, on behalf of the
customers is, will we be driving around in 20-year-old designs that have cutting-
edge technology inside? Are we going to be driving old cars with state-of-the-art
technology on the inside? Ola, what do we have to -- to look forward to?
I think that last point, my whole design and styling team, they would resign if that
would be the case. But don't worry about that. It's not going to happen. We're a
luxury brand. We make luxury products. Like every luxury brand, you always have to
reinvent luxury. It's got to be the right thing at its time. And styling is so important.
It's so important that you keep the product fresh. So in terms of product life cycles,
how long they are, I don't foresee a major shift there. That will probably stay the
same plus-minus.
But once you have bought one of those vehicles and many of the Mercedes turns
into classics, to hold on to them, some of them appreciate more than the stock
market if you buy the right one. And the great news is that product will be even more
valuable because those engineers -- those engineering angels in the background,
they are providing more content for you as you go along. But don't worry, we will
always have imagination for reinventing what luxury in the automobile space is
supposed to look like. So stay tuned.
Jensen, in terms of sustainability, do you picture yourself cruising around California
in a 20-year-old car with the most modern technology on the inside available?
{BIO 1782546 <GO>}
This is a great advantage of Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes-Benz has classic timeless
designs. One of the things that you see is, is the Mercedes-Benz customer base are
updating to the newest Mercedes-Benz all the time. They want the latest style. They
want the latest design. However, yesterday's Mercedes-Benz is a beautiful Mercedes-
Benz for hundreds of millions of other customers who aspire for that.
And so, I think one of the things that's really fantastic is with this new type of
architecture and this new way of providing products and capabilities and
applications to customers, the long tail -- the long tail of customers that are able to
enjoy Mercedes-Benz will still continue to be able to get the latest capabilities and
software, the latest enjoyment, the latest refreshes and Mercedes-Benz, of course will
be able to beneﬁt from that larger and growing and growing installed base. And soFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2020-06-23

That is agreed upon. Thank you, gentlemen. I'm afraid that's all the time we do have
left for today. But to all of our reviewers, please do feel free to approach the media
contacts at either company to get any questions answered that might remain open.
Again, our time is, of course, limited.
And once again, Mercedes-Benz and NVIDIA have just announced an upcoming co-
operation. The next generation of Mercedes-Benz vehicles will be equipped with the
NVIDIA AGX Orin platform. An AV and AI system that will be upgradable and
updatable throughout the entire lifespan of the vehicle. So some very big news here
today.
