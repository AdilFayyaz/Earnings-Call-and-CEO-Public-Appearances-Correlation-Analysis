Great. My name is Heath Terry. I want to welcome you all to the next session we have
here at the Tech Internet Conference, really excited to have with us back again this
year, Thomas Kurian, Chief Executive Oﬃcer of Google Cloud; Thomas, thank you so
much for joining us.
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Thank you for having me, Heath.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
I do just want to cover the Safe Harbor here. Some of the statements that Mr. Kurian
and I may make today, could be considered forward-looking. These statements
involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to diﬀer
materially. Any forward-looking statements that Mr. Kurian makes are based on
assumptions, as of today and Alphabet takes no obligation to update them. Please
refer to Alphabet's Form 10-K for a discussion of the risk factors that may aﬀect its
results.
So as everyone watching, I think knows Thomas took the reins at Google -- as
Google Cloud CEO in November of 2018. This is now the third year that he has been
with us at the conference. He has deep experience in building enterprise software
and fostering relationship with enterprise customers. Prior to Google Cloud, he
spent 22 years at Oracle building many new product lines and diversifying Oracle
from being a database company. And Thomas is focused on growing Google Cloud
and helping accelerate every organization's ability to transform through data
powered innovation with the best infrastructure platform, industry solutions and
expertise for digital transformation.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10

{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Thank you, Heath. Good morning and thank you for the privilege to share with you
the market trends that we see and how we are shaping our product and go-to-
market strategy to capture the opportunity. As heath mentioned, our mission is to
accelerate the organization's ability to digitally transform their business and we do
so by bringing Google's infrastructure, our platform, solutions for speciﬁc industries
who are seeing diﬀerent needs and our expertise as Google in having transformed
industries digitally.
Over the past 24 months, we're seeing three important elements. First of all, that the
cloud is in its early stages and has strong future growth potential as measured by
independent analysts, who project signiﬁcant spend in the years ahead. The drivers
of growth have also shifted. The primary driver we have seen accelerate signiﬁcantly,
is the need from customers to digitally transform their core business and that's been
further accelerated by COVID. This in turn has led to new technology requirements.
For example, companies want to work with multiple cloud providers to get the best
technology from them and to use that together, something called multi-cloud. They
want to re-architect platforms that they use to serve customers from multiple years.
So that did not carrying a legacy, so rebuilding on a cloud native architecture. And
they wanted to use data and analysts to understand customers, to improve the
products they deliver, to understand that exposure from a supply chain point of view.
And so we are seeing shifts in the kind of technology that people want from cloud
providers.
As we look forward, several of these customers needs tie very closely to our
strengths with Google. We're seeing technologies like continuing as a service, multi-
cloud, databases, data warehousing, machine learning and AI as measured by
independent surveys of enterprise customers and their plan to adopt. Our own focus
on building strong products in these emerging categories has made us a leader, as
measured by independent surveys from Gartner and Forrester, we're leader 29
times. An increase in the past two years of four times. So it's a signiﬁcant growth in
the maturity of the portfolio of products that in turn represents signiﬁcant total
addressable market opportunity.
As a result of this maturity and product and our investments in go-to-market, we're
seeing rapid adoption, strong return on investment in customers and signiﬁcant
metrics from independent analysts of customers expressing their intent to use
Google Cloud as a strategic part of their platform and of their infrastructure.
We oﬀer products in ﬁve important categories. Starting with infrastructure, we oﬀer
through a global network of 24 regions and 73 availability zones, high skill compute
storage and networking, protected by leading cybersecurity capability and greatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10

conﬁgurations. In our public cloud, we support organizations like Nokia, which is
migrating a large set of workloads to our public cloud from a variety of diﬀerent data
centers. We provide mission-critical infrastructure to run complex applications like
SAP to Cardinal Health & Gordon Foodservices.
Organizations like HSBC and Plat [ph] use our multi-cloud capability, running our
technology not just in our regions, but across multiple cloud providers, giving them
the ability to deal with regulatory issues like concentration risk and survivability. Our
private cloud running our Cloud inside the customer's data center, helps Macquarie
Bank meet the number of their technology objectives and our edge cloud brings our
technology into a 5G telecommunications network, providing great experiences for
both enterprises and consumers. As our work with AT&T and our recent
announcement yesterday with Telus. So we have a broad set of capability in
infrastructure. The heart of digital however, is also using data and analytic tools on
top of this infrastructure.
We provide organizations the ability to uniquely analyze both structured and
unstructured data, not just in Google Cloud, but across multiple clouds, where they
may be running their applications and also in their enterprise data centers. This
ability to analyze data across multiple clouds and across the enterprise data center,
provides a variety of capabilities to organizations.
UPS streams data from their trucks into Google Cloud and users are streaming
capability to reposition their global ﬂeet and plan their logistics systems. Vodafone
and Sky Broadcasting use our data link to handle large scale processing of network
information, customer information and product information. HSBC uses our data
warehousing to accelerate their regulatory reporting needs. And organizations like
Home Depot and Metro use our data warehousing capabilities to understand
customers better.
Even more organizations are using our data platform, as the core data infrastructure
for the organization. Twitter, for example, we announced just last week, a partnership
to help them use our data platform as the core infrastructure for their data and
analytic needs. One data has moved to the cloud and applications are moved to the
cloud, we provide organizations security to protect their data, their applications on
the users. Not just in our cloud, but also in other clouds and in their enterprise, so
they can standardize their security requirements across all these providers in one
place.
We provide security tools such as conﬁdential computing and our Application
Firewall Cloud Armor, to protect workloads for NCR, who is running their point of
sale systems in our cloud. Equifax and SCB the tool -- a leading Swedish ﬁnancial
institution as examples. Our enterprise-wide and multi-cloud security tools are used
by the London Stock Exchange, AT&T, and Lloyds Bank to protect themselves from
threats that we can accurately detect using our expertise in machine learning and
security breach detection across multiple environments. And we protect e-
commerce sites, social platforms, from bots and malware using our recaptureFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10

Page 4 of 12solutions, examples include Wayfair, Etsy, and many more. We're seeing strong
growth in this portfolio, along with our data and infrastructure and we have
successfully integrated our acquisition of Chronicle for security, Looker in analytics,
Apigee in infrastructure and we're seeing good growth in those portfolios as well.
Over the last 12 months driven by the pandemic, we've seen a huge shift in what we
call the hybrid workplace where people want to work in a combination of work from
home but also oﬃce settings and increasingly areas like manufacturing lines what is
diﬃcult to have people just work from home when you're in the manufacturing of
ﬁrst-line setting. To give you an example of the value that our cloud-native
communication and collaboration platform, Google Workspace provides customers.
Consider the following, we served over 1 trillion video minutes in 2020 with over 60
million daily meeting participants, including 96% of the next billion-dollar start-ups
that are emerging players in the economy.
We also provide great tools to enable front line or ﬁrst line workers. Our
communication collaboration tools are used by the nurses and doctors at Ascension
Health to deliver health care, by the scientists at Roche as they identify new drugs for
treatments, by manufacturing line workers that Fiat Chrysler making automotive and
automobiles, and Barilla making pasta for people, and by retail workers in online
retail and retail stores at Carrefour, Gantt, and Whirlpool so we're seeing a shift in the
use of these tools, not just by white-collar workers but also ﬁrst line workers.
Finally, Google has deep expertise in artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning.
We're taking our expertise in AI and ML and monetizing it by delivering solutions to
speciﬁc industries. For example, in retail we are helping organizations improve, how
the products are discovered online, optimizing inventory, helping them do better
demand forecast.
In ﬁnancial services, we're helping people detect anti-money laundering and fraud
much more accurately, streamline and automate your KYC, know your customer
process, and automate to make how lending processing works using our deep
understanding of documents.
In manufacturing, we're helping organizations improve how they do connected
products and build connected factories as well as using our visual quality inspection
tools to improve manufacturing quality. An example is our recent announcement
with Ford. All of these provide three important capabilities for us.
One, bringing monetizing Google's AIML leadership with products and services that
are unique to industries. Second, broadening our addressable market from not just
being the IT organization but important buying sectors in diﬀerent organizations and
diﬀerent industries. And third, providing highly diﬀerentiated high-value solutions to
customers.
We've invested not just in maturing our products, but over the past 24 months,
signiﬁcantly scaling a world-class enterprise software tool. Today, we provideFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 5 of 12services to customers in over 200 countries and territories. We're on track to expand
our direct sales organization by more than 3 times. We've certiﬁed our products, our
154 products with 75 compliance certiﬁcations, every compliance certiﬁcation opens
up a new addressable market for us. We've invested in training the ecosystem
enabling more than 2.5 million developers trained and certiﬁed. And as a reﬂection
of the demand for our products, Google Cloud certiﬁed architect is the highest page
certiﬁcation in the IT industry in both 2019 and 2020.
We're focused not just on bringing our technology to customers direct, but also to a
broad ecosystem of partners. Our ecosystem of partners has expanded by more
than 5 times in the last two years and consists of four important segments.
Independent software vendors and software as a service companies that expand our
total addressable market, technology partners that complete our solutions,
distributors that extend our reach to customers we may not be able to reach direct,
and global system integrators that help deliver solutions but also speak[ph]
consumption. We have global partnerships and dedicated Google Cloud practices
with 12 leading global system integrators.
All of this work in bringing our technology to many regions around the world,
maturing our products, and scaling our distribution has helped us rapidly win new
customers. We have both direct and indirect channels, build deep relationships with
these customers and expand these relationships. We serve over 7.5 million cloud
customers not just large enterprises, but the long tail of digital natives for all growing
up in the cloud.
We've seen growth of 50% -- more than 50% year-on-year in customers over $1
million. We've closed several deals over $1 billion in 2020 and we've seen a 3 times
increase -- more than 3 times increase in deals over to our $250 million. All of this is
not just coming direct, we've also seen a 2 times increase in deal volume via indirect
channels. A reﬂection of the deep relationship we have customers is that on average
customers are using more than 10 products from us, so not just compute storage and
networking, but database, data warehousing, security tools, monitoring, and
administration tools and a variety of other solutions. Because of the deep
relationships, we have customers their satisfaction with our products, on average on
a contract renewal we see 2 times expansion.
Here are just some of the customers, a small set of the customers we won in 2020.
They represent, not just enterprises but also digital natives and because our
technology applies not just to enterprises, but also digital natives, we have a broad
addressable market. We've diversiﬁed and have great strength across the globe and
in many industries. Here are examples of customers. Just one industry as an example
is our presence in retail. By independent analysts, we're seen as the leader in retail.
An example of our strength is our work with all of these customers. And during Black
Friday 2020, we processed more revenue through Google Cloud in support of these
customers than Amazon.com.
We're strong not just in retail, but in many other industries serving the largest and
leading companies in these industries. And as we continue to strengthen our salesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 6 of 12and distribution we've seen great momentum with these large customers. All of this
is driving strong growth in our backlog which nearly tripled from 2019 to 2020,
representing meaningful long-term commitments that customers are making to
Google Cloud.
We're also investing in having this revenue convert -- this backlog convert to revenue
through work that we're doing with customers as they onboard their workloads to
Google Cloud. So not only do we have strong backlog but as the backlog gets
converted, we're seeing good strong growth in revenue. Our revenue has more than
doubled in the last two years, and Google Cloud platform revenue continues to be
materially higher than the aggregate growth rate of Google Cloud itself.
Google Workspace's growth is driven both in expansion of seats and average
revenue per seat as more products from Google Workspace are used by customers.
Finally, this strong growth in revenue and backlog has led to diversiﬁcation for our
business across industries, products, customers, and market segments.
We're focused on investing recognizing that with the rapid shift to cloud customers
are making decisions on their core platforms. We're investing in three important
things. Data centers and regions to bring our technology to customers in each
country. For instance, a region in Indonesia services the needs of Gojek and
Tokopedia and several other Indonesian customers. A region in South Korea, helps
us serve LG, CNS, Samsung and a number of other companies in Korea. So the ﬁrst
thing we're doing is investing in bringing our technology to local markets because
data regulatory requirements now require regions in these countries.
Second, we've invested in a broad mature product set, every product investment
opens up new addressable market. And we're focused on scaling our sales and
distribution to drive revenue growth. As we scale revenue growth and as we scale
the business, we are working closely with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat to improve our
operating margin and operating loss, which will both beneﬁt from increased scale
over time.
So just summarizing, we continue to see strong growth in the market driven by
digitization. We oﬀer a leading and highly diﬀerentiated portfolio of products. We've
built a world-class software organization to complement our product strength, which
is leading to strong customer momentum both through our direct and indirect
channels. In turn, that is leading to strong backlog growth and revenue growth as
customers make meaningful commitments to work with us.
And ﬁnally, we continue to focus on accelerating revenue growth to capture the
secular shift that's occurring, and as we scale that, we will see improvement in not
just topline, but also operating margin and we're working closely with Ruth to enable
that.
Thank you for your time. And with that, let me turn it over to Heath so we can do
question-and-answer with all of you.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10

{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Thank you, Thomas. That was incredibly informative. One of the places that I want to
start is obviously there has been a lot of discussion around the impact that the
pandemic has had in the acceleration of the adoption of technology, particularly in
Cloud. How has that impacted cloud business and how are you seeing consumer
buying patterns shift in this environment?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
The technology shift for digitization means diﬀerent things to diﬀerent industries. In
retail, it's called e-commerce, in health, it's telemedicine, in ﬁnancial services, it's
digital banking. But one important thing that we're seeing is, once you get through
that ﬁrst phase of opening that digital front door that's when people start
experiencing the next (inaudible)
For instance, if you look at bank, ﬁnancial institutions, today your Internet or mobile
banking platform allows people to move money and transact. But it doesn't take all
the expertise that bankers have and deliver that to the consumer. The advisory
services and all the value added things and so people are starting to look at that.
If you look at e-commerce, while e-commerce has grown signiﬁcantly the way you do
demand forecasting, the way you do your logistics and supply chain in an e-
commerce environment with things like last-mile delivery is vastly diﬀerent than had
people visiting stores. So we're seeing, not just the process of opening that front
door to reach consumers, but now the internals of organization needing to change
in order to capture what digitization really means.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Sure. Of course. Two years ago, when you ﬁrst joined us one of your biggest
priorities for Google Cloud was a new go-to-market strategy. Two years in, how
would you say it's going, and what would you say your biggest priorities are for
here?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
We are very focused Heath. When we started, we said we're going to do 21
countries, 6 industries, 4 customer segments and 5 buyers. And we've been laser-
focused on that. We've built a great sales team. Craig to Robert Enslin, who runs that
team. We've brought in some fantastic talent from across the industry. And at the
same time, we've also had great relationships with partners. We focus on what we do
well. For instance, we don't have large professional services teams creating
opportunities for partners as we grow and we're seeing the partner ecosystem
recognize that and do a lot of work with us and we're seeing momentum not just
direct, but also through the channels.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10

A - Thomas Kurian{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Sure. Well, I mean, it certainly seems like it's having an impact. I mean in the most
recent quarter, we saw a nearly 60% growth in your backlog. What would you
attribute that to?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
I mean, lots of organizations are doing large commitments to long-term partnerships
with us because they want the expertise to help them digitize. I've mentioned just in
the last week for Twitter, TELUS, global payments, these are all examples why they
want to build long-term platforms and they want our expertise to work with them to
transform the business. With Ford for instance, we're not just bringing the capability
in the car but also transforming how people shop for cars, how do get service, what
their manufacturing and quality assurance systems looks, how we can improve the
way they do warranty. So a variety of diﬀerent things. And so it's a combination of
our technology, our expertise, and the partnerships, people are building with us.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Sure. We also got to see Clouds proﬁtability last week for the ﬁrst time. How would
you put that in context? I think a lot of people have looked at it, comparing it to other
platforms at similar scale, what's the right way for investors to think about what that
number means for Google Cloud?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
We're focused on three things. They're all about -- and all our investments are
focused on three things. Broadening our global footprint in data centers and
regions, allowing us to serve customers in individual local markets. Because now as
compared to other companies went proﬁtable the need is to serve because of the
new regulatory requirements, you have been the country to serve their needs. So
that's number one. And every investment in that opens up time TAM.
Second, we have a broad portfolio of products and these product investments also
open up TAM for us.
Third is we're broadening our go-to-market to capitalize on the opportunity that's
happening right now with the shifting customers. Now if you think about each of
these three elements, data centers, engineering, and product investment and go to
market. They're all ﬁxed cost structures that as scale happens will amortize over a
much larger business. And we are very conﬁdent that as we scale the business on
revenue and as our backlog converts to revenue, you will see that in our continued
focus on operating margin with Ruth as well.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
And as CEO, how do you prioritize growth over proﬁtability, longer-term?

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 9 of 12Q - Heath Terry
A - Thomas Kurian
Q - Heath Terry
A - Thomas KurianWe are currently focused on capturing this opportunity. We really believe we have a
good line of sight on how as you scale investments that open up markets and scale
revenue, scale will bring material improvements in proﬁtability and we are very
focused on that. We know that in this business you need scale in order to be
proﬁtable. And we know that customers are making long-term decisions now, so
we're investing in capturing that opportunity. And every investment we make is
about opening up new markets, opening up a larger TAM and scaling our revenue
faster.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
Sure. So obviously given Google Cloud's background, it's no surprise that you're
seen as a leader in data and analytics. Could you give us examples of why customers
are choosing Google Cloud for your products in those areas?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Three very simple reasons. You know, the ﬁrst thing is, we recognize that customers
are going to have data in multiple clouds. They're going to have data in their on-
premise environment. Telling them, you have to move all of it to Google in order to
analysis will not work. So we built a technology that works, no matter where your
data sits, it allows you to do analysis. That's number one.
Number two, we made it super easy for people to be able to do their analysis. For
instance, if you use our technology, you don't have to administer computers, you
don't have to worry about machines, you pay us based on the number of queries
you run or the number of questions you ask the system, which makes it much easier
for people to be able to handle questions at scale.
And lastly, we provide a uniﬁed platform. When I say uniﬁed platform, companies
want to be able to do real-time and batch on the same system. They want to do data
lake, data warehouse on the same system. And so we provide a uniﬁed platform. All
of these have led for example, when we work with Twitter on helping them
rearchitect their data foundation. That's an example of a customer who wanted the
breadth of the capabilities we oﬀer and also recognizing that all their data is not
going to be in Google Cloud. So we've made some important product decisions that
will help us diﬀerentiate our product oﬀering in the market.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
You referenced, multi-cloud, which obviously would be really interested in your view
on the state of sort of multi-cloud developing. But how meaningful is multi-cloud to
your strategy? And how do you see it translating into what customers are looking
for?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Customers when they -- two years or three years ago multi-cloud was not even a
topic people knew what it meant. Today 85% of enterprise CIOs, say need multi-
cloud. For us, multi-cloud represents three important buying decisions for
customers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 10 of 12Q - Heath Terry
A - Thomas Kurian
Q - Heath Terry
A - Thomas KurianNumber one, I need to move fast. Can I get the ability to use the best technology
from diﬀerent cloud providers together. Number one.
Number two, in regulated industries there is a concern around areas like
concentration risk. If I put all my ﬁnancial institution systems into one cloud and we
have an issue how does that -- how does that go forward and that's an issue around
concentration risk.
The third thing we're seeing particularly in Europe with digital solvency concerns
they want something called survivability, the ability to exist beyond a particular cloud
provider. All three things are facilitated by multi-cloud and we are seeing great
adoption of this because it gives customers choice. It allows them to move quickly
and with speed, and it allows them to get a consistent way to manage their entire
infrastructure.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
So Alphabet is obviously seen as one of the true leaders in edge technologies,
particularly artiﬁcial intelligence. What role does that kind of technology play in
enterprise customer decisions when it comes to choosing Google Cloud?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
Edge computing is really about bringing computing closer to where the application
is to run right? So for instance when we look at edge computing, we're integrating
our computational technology with many diﬀerent telecommunications providers.
And it oﬀers them the ability to oﬀer great experiences for consumers and
enterprise.
On the enterprise side, for example, people who want autonomous driving, they
want inside distribution center, control systems they wan to have the control systems
that control a clean room manufacturing facility but cannot run inside the
manufacturing facility. They want all of that to be powered but edge computing and
be able to (inaudible) data processing on the edge and this is where our and Ml
capability comes in. So we're building out a porfolio of solutions for enterprises and
consumers and working with lots of telecommunications carriers to integrate this
into their network.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
And what about sort of the frontier technologies, like artiﬁcial intelligence, machine
learning those speciﬁcally what you guys are doing with tensor ﬂow. What role do
those playing in the enterprise decision?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
A lot of customers now are talking to us about using our machine learning platform
but also increasingly about using our solutions. One of the limitations today in
enterprises adopting AI and ML is the lack of skills. And so by taking our technical
expertise in AI and ML and converting that to a solution that a customer can use itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL US Equity)
Page 11 of 12Q - Heath Terry
A - Thomas Kurian
Q - Heath Terryhelps us speed adoption, it helps us appeal to a diﬀerent buyer, it helps us get into a
door that we may not have been there prior, and it's opening up an addressable
market.
A very practical example, when e-commerce happened demand forecasting is
extremely diﬃcult because customers order online want it delivered home. They
order online and they want it delivered to the store for pickup. So where do you
position that inventory? You put it in the distribution center, you put it in the store
that's a very complex problem. Our expertise in AI and ML help many retailers with
that problem. And we're not saying here's a set of tools, why don't you just bring up
an army of data scientists which they do not have access to. But we're actually
helping them with the solution and that's our approach and it's helping us
diﬀerentiate from other players in the market.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
And when you look at the cloud environment, I think a lot of investors still think of
cloud primarily as being compute and storage. You guys have obviously had a lot of
success moving up the stack into the application level layer. Where is your level of
satisfaction with Google Workspace adoption in the business market. And would
really be interested in your thoughts on sort of enterprise collaboration market and
tools, such as chat, workﬂow as you move further up the stack.
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
We have seen cloud used to be thought as cheap compute storage and network to
sort of replace your data center with more utility computing. There's certainly that as
a market segment, but increasingly there are a variety of things people want on top
of analytic tools, data warehousing, security tools, collaboration tools. If you look at
Google Workspace as an example, we have seen continued growth, double-digit
growth in users, double-digit growth in average revenue per user and the
satisfaction when we measure through independent surveys with the product is very
high. We see increasingly startups, small and medium businesses and large
enterprises adopting it. And part of it is -- it was written cloud-native. So when the
pandemic hit and people needed to say overnight, I need to send all my employees
home and they need to collaborate and the only thing I can guarantee is that they
have a browser or a mobile phone, much easier for them to do.
Lastly, there's an entire collection of people who were not -- take nurses, for example
at Ascension Health, nurses are not writing documents of ﬁlling out spreadsheets or
doing slide presentations. But they are collaborating. They have digital devices and
as that collection of people come in, the buying decision on what they are
optimizing for is diﬀerent than what traditional white-collar workers are optimizing
for. So we see a lot of momentum with the product. We frankly rebranded it and
brought out new capability in it, and so far we've seen strong growth in the product.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
So I know it's not fair to ask you to predict the future. But if we had asked last year,
we probably would not have said that the biggest story in Cloud would be businessFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-02-10

right now, what do you see being the biggest story in Cloud in the year ahead?
{BIO 3811076 <GO>}
I haven't been through the pandemic, I'll be frank. Heath, I don't predict. I think
more[ph] trends we see is the following. I think many CEOs recognized digitization,
even though it was accelerated by the pandemic is fundamental. And so we expect
that to continue beyond the pandemic. We expect them to see greater
diﬀerentiation in the kinds of solutions people are adopted. And we continue to see
organizations making important business decisions on what technology platforms
they need, software and programing become the centerpiece. As you go to digital,
every industry needs talent in software, engineering, and programming. They've
increasingly choosing platforms that make it easy for them to get access to it. And
you'll see greater diﬀerentiation as we go forward with that.
{BIO 3406856 <GO>}
