{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Welcome, everyone. My name is Brent Thill. I run the Software team here at Jeﬀeries,
responsible for Microsoft. Really happy to have with us Jared Spataro, CVP,
Corporate Vice President at Microsoft. He's been at the company for, I believe, 15
short years. Jared, really appreciate you joining and sharing your perspective.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
I think we want to start out with Teams. We wanted to talk a little bit about the
positioning, thank you for helping power Jeﬀeries you've helped connect all of our
employees together during this during the last year.
I think we're all getting more ingrained into the system and using it more and more
as every day passes. Is the long-term view that Teams just becomes as essential to
employees as Outlook or the Oﬃce suite is the ﬁrst question.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes. The short answer is yes. For sure. I mean we just see such an opportunity here.
Maybe if I take a step back for a moment and frame it in this way. As we think about
the ﬁrst digital revolution of our business, it was PC power, it was about essentially
the digitization of paperwork.
This next digital transformation that we're all going through right now, we think it's
about the digitization of space and of time. That's what we feel like we've all
experienced over the course of the last 12 months.
What that translates into is that we believe every company is going to need an
organizing layer that allows them to transcend the space and time. And how do you
bring people together even when they're not physically together. How do you do
both synchronous and asynchronic collaboration.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11

A - Brent ThillSo we'd like to physician Teams as the only app that does it all. It's chat, meet, call,
collaborate all together. It has the Oﬃce apps. It has business process inclusion and
that allows it to act as this organizing layer. And we've seen -- just we feel like really
good momentum. We've got a lot of work we want to continue to do on the product.
And so a lot of opportunity ahead of us.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
You had explosive growth in 2020. Last reported, you had 115 million users in
October. And if we look back at the total oﬃce installed base, what penetration do
you expect Teams to reach over the long term?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Over the long term, if I start with that idea of the ops install base, we believe that
anyone who uses Oﬃce will meet what Teams has to oﬀer. Again, that unique value
prop is the only app that does it all. We think everybody is going to need the
collaboration and communication capability. So we get excited because we think the
penetration number should be very high for us.
I get even more excited, though, because one of the factors of for the business over
the last few years has just been this question of how do we expand our value prop.
And how do we then thereby expand the TAM.
And we see teams allowing us to do that. We can go well beyond the total
addressable market that's associated with people who would use Oﬃce. So that
moves us into for instance, it's the emerging economies.
Lots and lots of good signal that we have seen over the last 12 months in developing
economies where this really the teams kind of concepts really click with the way
business is done there because it's very comms and collab centric.
It also allows us to connect the frontline in a whole new way. So these are folks who
largely have been left behind by the PC revolution because they didn't care that they
didn't sit at a desk and they didn't carry a laptop with them. And we're seeing a
tremendous uptick in people using Teams, the Teams mobile edition for their
frontline workers and using anti connect frontline to the rest of the company.
So not only do we think penetration of the oﬃce space will be high, we think that it
helps us to expand the TAM. Those 2 things together get us excited about the
opportunity in the future.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
One of the things as a user -- we kind of -- you ﬁrst stumble into is chat. You start
going back and forth, Samad and I will collaborate and communicate on things
we're working through. The one thing I have really fell into and started to use more is
telephony and voice, video. We have eﬀectively -- we use it as the standard. I don't
pick up my Cisco phone. It's collecting dust next to me.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 14A - Jared Spataro
A - Brent ThillSo can you just talk to how you see this morphing beyond chat and collaboration
into a broader telephony and video play?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes. The whole idea here, if we, again, strategically look at the opportunity in front of
us as there used to be a day when I carried a ﬂip phone, I carried an MP3 player and
a camera all in my pocket. And then one day, I realized, wow, there's something that
brings all those things together.
We call that a smartphone. Those types of opportunities don't come around very
often in the industry, but when they do, they're very big inﬂection points. So we're
always looking for when will a platform kind of coalesce where our critical mass of
capabilities really matters. We think now is one of those times.
And we -- if we look across what we would call the workloads and teams, it is meet, it
is chat, as you indicated. Those are the ﬁrst 2, particularly during the pandemic, that
have really fueled growth. But then we move over into call, and we think that
telephony is a core part of the value prop of the current state of Teams and the
future of Teams.
The reason we think that's so true is that Teams, in order to be an organizing layer,
we believe, has to kind of bring in all the diﬀerent types of communication
modalities that people need and calling us one of those.
I also would say that we believe that this whole idea of calling and communications
is ripe for disruption. There is more that can be done with it. Today, it's largely in the
way that it's been set up, particularly with on-prem PBXs or phone systems on-
premise that people use. It oﬀers a core set of capabilities, but there's still much
more you can do when you plug that into a rich back end.
So for us and for Teams, phone, the way we refer to it Teams phones are just
absolutely key to the business case. They're very important for our customers as well
because what we see is when they start to use meetings and then chat, all of a
sudden, they're starting to realize, wow, there's a lot we can do, as you indicated, by
moving to these softphones.
So essentially your phone and your phone number, follow you wherever you go,
including on your own device when you're not in the oﬃce. So just a lot of
opportunity there for us to kind of expand from our current position in our
customers. And essentially help them to get more value from the Team's value
property.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Great. Just turning to the attention that you guys have garnered oﬀ of teams. Mr.
Benioﬀ decided to spend his biggest paycheck on Slack, a $28 billion, a transaction
that was well outside what I thought most were thinking he would do. And I know forFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 14A - Jared Spataroa fact that they were terriﬁed of what you guys were doing with the solution set. Can
you just talk about the diﬀerentiation.
Maybe that was a saw in the back, taken down the Slack trees in the background.
Sorry if -- that wasn't my saw. But maybe just go through competitively, how you're
thinking about what's happening here. And ultimately, what can Salesforce.com do
as they get this integrated.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Sure. Whenever we see a large acquisition like this, we're always watching for the
strategic signal. I think the market watches for a strategic signal. And I think one of
the important strategic signals we saw here was this idea that there had been some
great innovation in what I call a particular workload that's persistent chat.
But that, that innovation, as I indicated, was going to be best suited to be brought
into a platform. And I think that's a signal we should all read.
When we look across kind of what we're trying to do with the product set, we are
trying to blur the lines across communication modalities. And we're trying to help
people recognize that when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. If you
can get a complete toolbox, you actually help people to be more consistent in what
we would call the ﬂow of work.
And so as we trace how people work, what we ﬁnd, is that a meeting is an important
aspect. If we think about a competitor in Zoom, very important on what people do,
but not to be all and end all. We ﬁnd that persistent chat, very important. Again, not
to be all end all, what starts to be magical as you weave those things and together.
Now taking a step back, we feel like the core value prop that Teams has oﬀered
throughout the pandemic of meet, chat, call collaborate and then adding kind of
business process, particularly Power Platform into that, has been very strong,
diﬀerentiated us from the competition, has helped us to gain momentum.
However, at the same time, if I just try to identify what are the gaps and where are the
opportunities, we've seen a couple of places that we're really trying to address. One
of those has been external collaboration in the form of exactly what we're doing
right now, essentially external events, so webinars. We have not been as strong
there, and that's been a place that we have been working to catch up.
And just this past week at Ignite, we announced a whole slew of new features very
focused on webinars so that you can use Teams, again, not only for great internal
collaboration, but also external.
The second big place for us has been this idea of being able to use persistent chat
and workspaces externally. We announced something that we call Teams Connect.
That allows you to take this idea of portions of teams, in particular, as an example a
Teams channel, and you can extend that beyond the 4 walls of your enterprise. SoFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 14A - Brent Thill
A - Samad Samana
A - Jared Spataronow it opens up kind of the ecosystem so that we can connect. We're really excited
about that.
And then, of course, we continue to have announcements in other areas. One of
those was announcements with Dynamics. And that's in particular, Dynamics sales,
marketing, customer service and ﬁeld service.
And this perhaps gets to what you are pushing on. We have some great assets as we
bring together Teams and Dynamics. We start to have a very strong lineup as well
again for business process.
So we're trying to be very clear headed and very honest with ourselves, have a lot of
intellectual honesty in identifying where we have gaps, and then we're chipping
away of those gaps so that we can just provide the best value for our customers.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
Great. I'm going to turn you over to my partner, Samad. Samad, thanks for hosting
the day.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Yes. Great. Thank you, Brent, and kicking that oﬀ. And Jared, again, let me reiterate,
we appreciate your time today. Microsoft is obviously doing some really exciting
things. And as Brent mentioned, I live in Teams. So it's been great for us from an
internal perspective.
Yes. Maybe getting back over to voice and think about the market dynamics. Of the
150 million users, how many are -- to the extent you can comment, like what
percentage you're using telephony direct through Teams today? And maybe how do
you see that evolving over the next couple of years?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Let's start with the ﬁrst question, how many are using it today. We break down
telephony as kind of 2 components. There's a component that's voice over IP that
comes as a part of the standard SKUs with the standard packaging of Teams.
That component is widely used. It's the same underlying technology that powers a
meeting, whether it's one-on-one or a group meeting, whatever set up it is. And so
that's -- that is often learned and that voice over IP type setting is just constantly
used. As soon as people are exposed even to chat, they realize there was a button
there to escalate up into either voice, video or both. Widely, widely used.
Another component of Teams is this idea that we can become your phone system.
This phone system adds, as you well know, kind of call control type features. It adds a
lot of sophistication in terms of how you think about your telephony network, how
you're plugging into your providers.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 14A - Samad Samana
A - Jared SpataroWe talk more about what we're doing there. That phone system requires a separate
purchase. It can be purchased standalone or purchased as part of what we call our
enterprise ﬁber E5 SKU. And we've just seen tremendous, tremendous strength and
momentum in E5 lately.
And so we kind of come at it from both angles. We see a lot of opportunities, just like
our competitors do because what we're seeing right now is that companies are
making important decisions.
They started with meetings, Samad, because that was the approximate need that was
the immediate need during the pandemic. And many, many of our customers now
are rolling into great. Now that we've decided what we're going to do for our
meetings, our chat, where we're going to take phone. And that -- we see kind of 2021
being the year of phone in so many ways.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Understood. And that's -- that's what I was getting at, that PBX-like functionality, right,
where suddenly, you can have it where you can go across whether it's a PSTN
network or whether you can take calls that are coming inside of the organization.
And so when I think about, at least based on some of the diligence we've done,
Microsoft is tackling it in multiple ways. As you mentioned, as part of your own eﬀorts
through E5, but also, I think you're working with some of the UCaaS providers to
allow them to do direct routing inside of Teams.
And so maybe how do you think about that open environment approach. And how
do you automate the software? Is it -- we'll do what's best for the customer? Or how
are you approaching using a partner for direct routing or using it through Microsoft
with their own E5 license?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes. Let's look at it from a segment perspective. That might be a good place to start
and then we can look at it from kind of a platform strategy. At the segment level, we
broadly divide into 2 segments. We have SMB and enterprise, just kind of in a gross
way of dividing the world.
At the SMB level, what we ﬁnd the overall need from the market is simplicity. What
customers really need is. They are not going to pay for a large project that's going to
come in and do a bunch of integration pulling them into existing systems, or even
integration with, as an example, a telephony provider.
They're really interested in is there something simple for me there. So in that case,
we ﬁnd that simplicity trumps. All the work we're doing on product allows simplicity
to be kind of the higher base.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 14A - Samad Samana
A - Jared SpataroSo here, in that space, we end up seeing Microsoft as the telephony provider, which
we can do, being a major draw for customers. Now there are some very
sophisticated SMBs. We also oﬀer the option for what we call direct routing, and that
allows you to bring in a telephony provider.
And sophisticated SMBs want that, and we absolutely can oﬀer it. But I would say
that the oﬀer that is gaining the most traction would be the simplest, and that is what
allows us to be the telephony provider.
In enterprise, the landscape is much more complex and the needs are, again, more
complex and sophisticated. And there, we are just 100% focused on what customers
want, what they think is best for them.
We kind of learned our lesson when we tried this in the ﬁrst round of Skype for
Business many years ago, where we tried to go it alone. At that time, we learned a lot
about the industry and the contours of the industry. Things have changed in so many
ways, and yet things have remained the same as well.
And just as a very simple example, many of our customers have multiyear contracts
with telephony providers. And those contracts are important. They go far being just
the telephony, the voice services and into things like data. And so we ﬁnd there that
they would like to actually bring their own telco, and they'd like to plug back into
Teams, and we're very willing to do that with.
And in fact, we're not only willing to do that. We're going all around the world to the
top operators, telco operators, and we're proactively working with them so that we
can ensure that we go to market together.
So from our perspective, as we look at it, and we just want to do what the customer
wants to do. We're very focused on that and is the opportunity as opposed to forcing
a particular model on them.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Understood. And I think you mentioned the bring your own carrier initiative and
allowing direct routing. I think those all as Microsoft removing either the hurdles or
removing to friction to having, call it, being the core phone system for users.
But maybe to the extent there are any, could you maybe talk about what you see as
maybe some of the additional hurdles that may have kept customers from moving
over to this point, but that are now continuing to come down and they're jumping
over.
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes, that's a really good one. I would say one of the things that was a hurdle up to
this point was just this idea of how they were going to manage all of theirFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 14A - Samad Samanacommunication infrastructure, -- communication infrastructure. Pre-pandemic, most
companies actually didn't have a super coherent strategy for that.
And what we found as we walked into customers is that there is typically, if they're a
fairly large customer, they would have a department responsible for collaboration, a
department responsible for telephony those 2 wouldn't necessarily talk with each
other. There might even be a separate department that was doing things like
webinars and kind of external meetings.
What the pandemic has done is it's forced all of those folks to start to talk to each
other because there was just necessity. They had to ﬁgure out not only how they
were going to have meetings, but where does the phone ring when somebody picks
it up and dials my work number? How does it get to me? Does it not get to me?
All of that really started to push people to reconsider even their hardware
investments, Samad. So that was another kind of thing that brought them back is
wow, we've invested in all this hardware in the oﬃce and but about our phones that
are sitting on the desk. We all of a sudden, the phone was just the hardware itself
was just one component of an overall solution.
Going forward, what we see most customers already doing is planning for what we
call a hybrid work model where they're anticipating -- in fact, we found in our
research that 80% of companies believe they'll have much more ﬂexible work from
home policies post-pandemic. 70% of workers safely, they'll take their employers up
on that at least once a week.
And what that turns into is like all of those things that we previously saw that were
blockers all of a sudden kind of become -- like fade into the background a little bit.
The premier scenario ends up being, how do I follow my employee wherever he or
she is, and provide them with both telephony services and the other advanced kind
of collaboration communication services just to get their job done.
That is what I think has lowered the barriers that we've seen more than anything else.
And then it becomes a discussion of, okay, what's our approach? What's our
philosophy here? This is where Teams comes in and pitches essentially a uniﬁed
platform.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
I can give you a data point. Jeﬀeries has publicly already said they allow us to be
more ﬂexible. And I am one of those 70% that will take them up on it. So I hope that
we get telephony inside of Teams here.
Maybe as I think about -- you segmented the market between SMB and enterprise.
And it sounds like with SMBs, there's maybe lower barriers because they want life to
be easier. When you think about the enterprise side, is there anything from a
scalability standpoint that's preventing them from putting in a PBX or using E5 for
adding voice functionality? Or is it simply the market hasn't moved there yet?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 14A - Jared Spataro
A - Samad Samana
A - Jared Spataro{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
In general, we would say that we've gotten to the place we feel really good about
our technology. We feel like we're very competitive versus the other folks that you
see in the market that would be competing for business.
We certainly don't feel like we have any type of scalability diﬀerences any longer. As
we were a younger, more nascent solution a couple of years ago, we were building
our phone system capabilities. But today, we feel really good about them.
The place that you will see that over the last probably about 12 months, we've been
making consistently announcements has essentially been in our platform area. We
think of teams as a platform that can be extensible. And that goes into phone system
as well. And so you do see people who have specialized needs when they look at
their phone system.
Simple examples would be their call center or contact center needs, and you need
to integrate with other (solution) providers. They also might have speciﬁc regulatory
requirements about call recordings. We're going to just their own compliance with
how they run their shop that will be really important.
So that aspect of things is what you start to see as you move into truly becoming
someone's phone system and really taking over that role for them. And we're feeling
really good. We don't do all of those things ourselves, just like our competitors
don't.
And so instead, what we do is we oﬀer Teams on the platform and they work really
hard to, again, proactively go out to those independent software providers. And we
say, hey, can we partner with you and work together on the integration so our
customers don't have to do this one at a time.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Helpful. So speaking of partners, Accenture is an important Microsoft partner. And I
think on the last earnings call, the company mentioned they have 85,000 users that
are using Teams to make calls going in and out. And so -- I mean that stands out to
me as a marquee example.
And I was just curious to the extent you can share how they're approaching that
putting voice into Teams? And maybe if you could elaborate how such a large
organization has changed their approach to voice inside of Teams?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes, you bet. Again, the starting point for most people with voice inside of Teams
ends up being voice over IP. We're chatting, and then we can quickly escalate up.
And all of a sudden, you realize, wow, wait a second, I would have called you, but I
didn't have to call you. That's interesting. And that starts to build into essentiallyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 14A - Samad Samanademand for, like, why do I have this phone sitting here when I've kind of got an
integrated solution.
So if I kind of build on that particular situation, 50% of oﬃces there in Accenture are
fully on Teams where everyone uses a softphone instead of actual hardware
associated with a phone.
And we've been working on better click to join experiences even when they do use
hardware to specialize and working with hardware partners on specialized hardware
that is certiﬁed for Teams as well. So there's a lot of real goodness.
Now what we see is the main draw going back to kind of the -- what we would call
the secular trend here is as people are going to shift back and forth between home
and work all the time, the big question will be, how do I ring you. If somebody's
going to dial in, how do I bring you on your work number? And if your phone on
your desk is ringing, but you're working from home that day, that creates kind of
essentially a work stoppage type situation.
And so just in order to enable this new mode of working, we believe a lot of folks are
going to be starting to evaluate, how do we have -- essentially, a telephony system
that follows people wherever they are rings appropriately and is integrated into what
else they do, the other types of things that they do.
So Accenture, we do feel like is a great indicator. It's a great signal of where the
market's going. You talked earlier about boy do you see issues in terms of scale are a
great example with their scale point.
The other thing that I'll say about their use of Teams that is really interesting is we see
people not only using telephony, but then they start to use it as a platform for other
aspects of their business.
So they have over 40 apps that are created with Microsoft Power apps that are
published in Teams. And these apps are very focused on simplifying key workloads.
The reason I bring that up is because those key workloads are simpliﬁed and
integrate telephony into the simpliﬁcation. It's just built in there.
So that's another thing that kind of serves to tip people as they realize, as if you don't
have some sort of integrated solution. You start to do even oﬃce automation. You
ﬁnd yourself bumping into walls because you want to bring in your collaborate
communications platform to enable all of that.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Helpful. And kind of maybe sticking on the partner side. A lot of UCaaS tends to be
sold through master agents and value-added resellers, and I'm curious how
Microsoft is working with these partners that have been historically at least important
to distribution. And how much you guys are willing to, I guess, match on some of the
commission structures, maybe some of the more aggressive vendors are doing?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11

Yes. We certainly have seen that dynamic, Samad. A lot of as people have come in,
our competitors have come in and either maintain these types of margin structures
or, as you say, have been even more aggressive. Our perspective here is that this is a
really strategic workload for us.
These partners are very strategic. Sometimes you think you're coming in over the
top, and you don't need those partners anymore. That's not our strategy here. We
believe that the ecosystem is as it's currently constituted serves customers well. And
then what we need to do is to enable that ecosystem to be able to use our solutions.
And so over the course of the last couple of quarters, we've been working hard on
making sure that we're very competitive.
So just as any company does, we're out there kind of casing the market and
understanding what the current margin structure looks like. We've been making sure
that we're in line with those margin structures that we can be competitive.
We're feeling good about it. I would say that we are a little bit slow oﬀ the blocks a
couple of years ago as we were just ramping up teams as a platform, as a product
itself. And there are folks who are ahead of us, particularly some of those incumbents
that were ahead with the channel. We're feeling -- I'm feeling very good about our
channel momentum now over the last couple of quarters, and we can see that in our
own results.
One last thing is, I'll just pick up on your point, we think that in order to really
transform this part of the market, we'll have to go to market with those partners.
That's a really big important lesson we learned during the Skype for Business era.
And so we are just proactively approaching these partners, kind of giving them our
value prop pitch, talking about what's in it for them and then building practices and
building up our partnership together.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
You gave maybe alley-oop on Skype for Business. So I'll just jump to that question on
my list. And that's a large installed base, and we cover actually a company called
AudioCodes, which helps with converting over some of those customers with SBCs.
But how do you think about that base and the opportunity to convert them. Not only
to Teams, but also then putting telephony into that as well?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Absolutely. Anytime you have a base, you want to be careful with that base because
they're going to make a decision one way or the other.

So make no mistake that strategically is on our minds, quarters and quarters and
quarters ago, even before the pandemic started, but it was really the accelerated by
the pandemic. The Skype for Business base has been one that we've been paying a
lot of attention to.
We go to them with special help that we can give them to migrate to Teams. We see
many of them who -- even if they're not ready to migrate fully to Teams, they'll
decide to move their meetings to Teams, for instance, and keep persistent chat on
Skype.
And so we have -- as you'd expect, we have programs to help them. They have been
good customers, some of our best customers, very loyal, and we want to do
everything we can.
We review that often internally just to look at that base, where they stand. Why they
continue to stay on Skype for Business, and we just are systematically making sure
we're resolving any blockers for them. So very important to us, they're all going to
make a decision.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Great. And I think we have time for maybe a couple more questions. I'll read one oﬀ
from -- that an investor set me. So I was trying to ﬁgure out what may be the role of
the existing UCaaS companies is in a Teams world, right?
Let's assume if the world becomes a Teams world. How do you view -- like how many
-- of the percentage that moves over to voice in teams. What percentage do you
think comes direct with the service provider versus a UCaaS provider like a
RingCentral or an 8x8 which direct route into Teams?
{BIO 17854733 <GO>}
Yes. Let me -- I'll disambiguate a little bit some of the details. When we talk about
direct routing, we are very focused on the telecom operators, so the telco operators.
That's what our oﬀering is focused on. So when we talk about, hey, there's a direct
routing opportunity, we'll go to the telco and work with a customer with that telco.
We aren't trying to work so that there's essentially a double hop, some sort of call
control that's coming through later RingCentral. In fact, I would say it doesn't make
much sense for people to use Teams, one of those competing companies and then a
telco provider. So just to clarify that.
And we would just basically say we see people making decisions about whether they
will stay with their current UCaaS provider and then the telephony provide, the telco
operator or if they will go essentially with Microsoft and then have that decision ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11

approach.
So we don't see much of a coexistence in accounts if they're going to move
telephony to the cloud. We think that they have to make a decision.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Understood. I think that was very helpful clarity. And maybe just one last one. Data is
so critically important to organizations.
And I'd just be curious what your view on the value proposition is of having that rich
employee -- that usage data inside of Teams, whether it's in collaboration, whether
it's in phone calls within the organization, or calls that are going internal and
external. And how you're able to leverage that with the rest of the Microsoft
ecosystem and what the value proposition there is.

Ultimately, I mean, it's -- in so many ways, you set me up there, Samad, I appreciate it.
That ultimately, for us, if I, again, zoom the way out even beyond Teams, Teams is a
part of Microsoft 365.
And the single most important asset we believe that Microsoft 365 oﬀers to
customers is what we call their Microsoft graph. This graph is constructed as people
use the apps and services for Microsoft 365 on a daily basis. We aggregate up all the
signal associated with that, and then we can do 2 things.
Number one, we can feed it back to individuals and give them value-added services
that just help them get their job done. It's almost like having personal assistance in
the cloud. Copywriters, editors, designers, analysts that can help you get your work
done.
Then second we do is we feed that back in an aggregate de-identiﬁed way to the
organization itself. We can tell you, for instance, hey, it turns out, your organization
seems to be starting work 30 minutes earlier than they were six months ago. Do you
know what the stresses are, for instance.
That Microsoft graph is just key. And the more signal we get into that graph, the
more valuable it becomes. Just for reference, we announced a couple of quarters
ago that we now have over 30 billion minutes a day being spent on Microsoft 365
and what we call collaboration minutes.
So that synchronous and asynchronous collaboration, including the calling that we're
referring to here, and we've kind of majored on a part of this call. Every bit of that
signal helps us to sharpen the services that we're giving again to the individual in the
organization.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-03-11

idea that data is the new oil. We think it's not only data. We would say data and
insights are what will help you improve performance at the individual and the
organizational level.
{BIO 17883999 <GO>}
Well, Jared. I think that's the perfect place to end it. You took us to the top of the
hour. We really appreciate your time today, and the thoughts that you shared what
us. We wish you the best of luck.

Thanks, Samad. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me.
