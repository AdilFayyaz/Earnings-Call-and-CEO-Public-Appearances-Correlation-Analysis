Good morning, everyone. Hi, my name is Anurag Rana. I'm a Senior Analyst with
Bloomberg Intelligence. Welcome to the webinar focused on understanding IBM's
Watson Platform. Our guest speaker today, is Dave Schubmehl, Research Director at
IDC. We also have Jitendra Waral, Senior Analyst, Bloomberg Intelligence following
the Internet sector as our speakers.
So let me just start with some housekeeping notes. Today's presentation will be
recorded and available for playback. At the bottom of the slide window, you will
notice that you can adjust volume and maximize your screen. Feel free to ask a
question by submitting one to the right of your slide; we will address questions at
the conclusion of the presentation.
What is BI? Bloomberg Intelligence provide in-depth analysis and data sets on
industries, companies, government, ESG, credit, economic and litigation factor that
can impact business decisions. Bloomberg Intelligence is backed by about 300 plus
third-party data providers and is delivered with no buy or sell recommendations. Our
analyst team averages 20 plus years of buy and sell-side research experience; and
the research is provided exclusively to clients, who subscribe to the Bloomberg
Professional Services and can be accessed by BI GO.
I'm going to now leave the ﬂoor over for David Schubmehl, who is going to talk a
little bit about his research practice at IDC.
Thank you, Anurag. Good morning, folks. I wanted to talk to you today about
Cognitive Software and AI Software in general, and speciﬁcally IBM Watson and we'll
do that by starting out and talking about what the attributes of cognitive software
are. So if you think about it the software has been around for about 20 to 25 years,
30 years and has been around and responds essentially to a set of algorithms.
What we're talking about today in terms of Cognitive and AI software is, where
software that doesn't necessarily need to be programmed; where the systemsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 2 of 12actually learn on their own and you've seen many discussions about it. People talk
about deep learning; they talk about machine intelligence; they talk about artiﬁcial
intelligence in very general terms; and all of these are essentially synonyms for
Cognitive Software technologies.
And some of the technologies that we support are up here on this slide. So for
example, we handle a lot of unstructured information. So we handle audio
information and textual information, so we can do natural language processing. In
some cases, we're actually right, the software can generate human readable
sentences and paragraphs, so that's natural language generation. I mentioned the
machine learning component already, where the system actually learns and
essentially modiﬁes its own algorithms over time by using diﬀerent types of
algorithms. Pattern recognition and automated analytics and predictive capabilities
are all part of these Cognitive Software technologies.
At the same time, there is a lot of other technologies evolve too. So there's things
like image analytics, the idea of being able to understand semantics and being able
to interpret what people are actually saying and how they're saying it, which want to
be able to actually understand and create hypothesis and predictions; and it's really
all about understanding the various senses that people are looking at. So we've got
sensory input processing and also emotion recognition as well.
So if we take a look at this ecosystem, what -- the way that IDC looks at this is that we
have all these components that I talked about previously. We have the dialog
management; and the APIs, the text analytics, the speech recognition, all of those
components. All of those components are usually put together into a Cognitive and
AI Software platform. And this is where tools like IBM Watson and some of the other
tools, Wipro's Holmes; and TCS ignio; Salesforce's Einstein, these are platforms that
people are actually using to develop Artiﬁcial Intelligence applications.
Around that we have this white circle around content and data. And I think one of the
reasons that we include this circle is that these applications are inherently statistically
driven. So they are based on the data. Their actions, the predictions, the
recommendations are based on the data that's fed into these systems. So it's very
important that content and data feeding into these systems would be correct that it
be available, that you have a combination of ﬁrst-party and third-party and possibly
second-party data, so all of these considerations need to go into that.
The other thing that's very important here is that data has become an integral
component of these Cognitive and AI solutions, which we'll get to a little further
when we talk about IBM strategy. And there was actually a market for third-party data
that's beginning to emerge, as part of these kind of applications.
Last but not least, are the diﬀerent types of applications. So we have process
applications that are cognitively enabled. We have the -- we're seeing those in sales.
We're seeing them in ﬁnance. And we're also seeing industry applications around
being able to help healthcare in terms of improving patient outcomes; being able toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 3 of 12do money laundering; being able to come up with the right price for a particular
product.
We're seeing business-to-business services in terms of advertising, legal systems,
commercial leasing, you know, all of the applications that -- tools like Airbnb and
Uber are using to disrupt their industries are based on these kind of Cognitive and
AI type of solutions.
And then, last but not least is the cognitively enabled consumer services and
products; and we're seeing a wealth of these come into the marketplace. Everything
from the retail systems that help you pick and choose, what kind of coat you want to
wear, to being able to help you identify, where the best place to travel at the best
price, all those kinds of things are becoming what we call cognitively enabled.
So if we look at some of the most popular used cases, we're seeing obviously that
healthcare and manufacturing, ﬁnance, government and retail are some of the most
popular used cases we're seeing. In terms of IDC's cognitive spending guide
research, we're seeing that ﬁnance is one of the most advanced areas, where people
are spending the most money initially; and we're seeing healthcare following that
closely; and then retail right after that.
Manufacturing and government are a little bit more behind, but I think, where we're
seeing these opportunities is really -- the entire gamut of cognitive applications
running through all of the industries and running through all of the diﬀerent used
cases. So almost everything that we can think about in terms of software is going to
be or will be cognitively enabled at some point; and it's probably the near future i.e.,
the next 5 to 10 years.
So in terms of IBM Watson, we were -- I was asked by Anurag to kind of what is IBM
Watson? Well, it's really a technology platform. Their deﬁnition it's a technology
platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal
insights from large amounts of unstructured data and really that gets to the heart of
what we're talking about here. Taking all of this sensory input, taking all of this text,
taking all of this diﬀerent type of data and making sense of it and being able to help,
augment and improve workers' decisions and predictions based on that data.
So what are some of the components of the IBM Watson portfolio? Well, ﬁrst and
foremost is the Watson Developer Cloud. IBM set this up in 2013; and they've got
over a 100,000 developers and hundreds of partners. In addition, they also have a
venture capital fund, where they are funding various partners; and also providing
seed money to help companies with innovative ideas make use of the Watson
Developer tools. There is -- a number of tools, those Watson Developer Cloud is
available via Bluemix. Some people can get access to it easily and then they can start
working with that.
So that's one of the primary areas is the Watson Developer Cloud. At the same time,
there is other areas, so Watson Explorer is really their search and discoveryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 4 of 12application, which includes Cognitive and AI components in it; and is being able to
help organizations to ﬁnd and locate that information and then make use of that
information to the decision-making processes.
IBM has also created a number of Watson business units. Watson IoT, which is
looking at combining Cognitive and AI technologies with the IoT urgence or the IoT
areas that's growing out there. They've also created a Watson Health by acquiring a
large number of companies and combining the healthcare aspects with the
Cognitive and AI technology. So this is an area that that IBM has been in -- since
Watson ﬁrst got started just after the Jeopardy's challenge. There is a Watson
Solution for cancer diagnosis and cancer care based on data coming from Sloan
Memorial Kettering.
At the same time, Watson is also creating some new business units; and they just
recently made the announcement that they're going to acquire Promontory Group,
which is all around ﬁnancial compliance. So I think it's safe to say that we'll probably
see a Watson ﬁnancial compliance business unit coming up in the near future.
At the same time, there is a number of other tools. Watson analytics is really IBM's
answer to try to reinvent the business analytics workspace and to make Watson
analytics that tool, again a cloud-based tool, where you can upload your data, start
playing with it, automatically you get use predictive modeling and predictive
discovery to be able to identify diﬀerent aspects of your particular data.
And then last but not least are the Watson Solutions that we see out there, Watson
Engagement Advisor, Watson Discovery Advisor, there is a new one called Watson
Conversations for being able to hold Conversational User Interface; we're seeing
those kind of things out there as well.
So if we look at Watson Health, the Watson Health is really all about that data and
knowledge. And if you notice, I talked a few minutes ago about how content and
data is very important to these kind of applications. Well, IBM has been acquiring
companies that have lots and lots of data. Merge has 30 billion images; Phytel and
Explorys has 100 million patient records; Truven has 250 million claims records. And
then, then you've got the generic one, you've got the weather company including 3
billion reference point.
So all of this data is out there. Using that data in concert with the cognitive
applications is really what provides the insight around how well these organizations
actually can make use of these kind of Cognitive and AI Solutions. So it's the
combination of the data with the Cognitive and AI Solutions that really help to drive
all of the stuﬀ in the market.
So as we mentioned that Watson Health insights is really driven by data. And I think
this is just a good example of how to think about Watson's diﬀerent business units in
general. They're combining their data, but they're either acquiring or getting
through partnerships. They're taking their Cognitive and AI technology solutions;FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 5 of 12and they're combining the two together with services and other aspects to really
deliver the insight that companies are looking for in terms of being able to transform
their businesses in that digital transformation that we're starting to see in the
marketplace.
So one of the questions that I get a lot is, what does the competitive landscape look
like? Well, obviously, on the left hand side, we have a large number of Cognitive
platforms out here. IBM, we have upped [ph], but obviously there is other companies
like Palantir; and Digital Reasoning, IPsoft, and Nuance; startups like CognitiveScale
and Numenta are companies that have been acquired. Intel acquiring Saﬀron
Technologies and Nervana Systems. Other companies coming from -- some of the
consulting companies like Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys and Wipro, there's
just a very wide range of competitors in the marketplace.
Over here on the right hand side are the companies that don't actually have, what I
would considered to be Cognitive Software platforms today, but they do have those
APIs and services; and are starting to make those available to people. Everybody
from Lockheed and SAIC, who are getting involved in this work, and Fujitsu and
Baidu to companies like Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Amazon, who
oﬀer diﬀerent types of Cognitive API services, but I wouldn't really characterize those
as a complete platform at this point in time.
So last but not least, kind of in summary, we really see, IDC sees that AI is changing
the nature of work. These recommendations, assistance and augmentation in terms
of it automated advisors is really going to become the norm in almost every ﬁeld. So
every piece of software that you use is going to have some type of augmentation or
recommendation capabilities there.
And then I think this is really kind of a once in a generation transformation. I mean, I
think the idea of Cognitive and AI Software combined with some of the other
technologies that we're seeing in the market is really transforming the way that
people will use software over the next 5 to 10 years. And I think that in turn will also
transform how companies do business; and that's why we feel that industry structure
is going to be changed. To take advantage of these we're going to see disruption. I
mean, people talk about Airbnb, people talk about Uber, as disrupting inﬂuences.
Well, one of the reasons that they're disrupting inﬂuences is because they're using
Cognitive and AI and machine learning applications to help drive those disruptive
businesses and that the machine learning technologies; and the AI technologies are
really some of the disrupting components in this.
And from a company standpoint, I would recommend that if you happen to be
involved in decision-making at your particular company, you really need to start
thinking about how these applications are going to change your business and how
you're going to make use of these applications to really get the jump up and get the
edge in your particular industry.
With that, I'll turn it back to Anurag.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04

David Schubmehl{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Thank you so much Dave for that comprehensive overview. I'm just going to make a
request that if you have any questions feel free to ask them by submitting one in the
area to the right of the slides. So let me start oﬀ with a question and then I'll pass it
on to Jitendra to -- we will switch back and forth. So now, Dave you described
Cognitive Science as one -- is a generational transformation for the sector. Now
among the people that you talk to what is the current level of awareness?
I think people are aware of this. The popular press has done a tremendous job in
raising the issue, but I think they've also raised a lot of misunderstandings. But I think
that the awareness that Cognitive and AI technology is coming and what is going to
be able to do for you, I think is fairly common today. What I don't think is common is,
whether businesses and organizations have actually thought about how they're
going to use Cognitive and AI technologies to be more competitive or to improve
their ROI or to improve their sales. I don't think that level of thinking has really yet
taken hold.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
So Dave having said that, I mean what would you advise CEOs and CIOs with respect
to early deployment of Cognitive Solutions? I mean, where should they start? Should
they focus on costs, revenues? Where are some of the best practices you have seen
so far as far as early deployment of Cognitive Solutions are concerned?
I think it's really interesting. I mean, I think we're seeing companies that are kind of
doing every -- a little bit of everything. There were some companies that are looking
at reducing costs, we're seeing ﬁnancial companies, for example, looking at
Cognitive and AI Software to do fraud investigation because it -- you can actually do
a better job and a quicker job of solving that. We're starting to see people using
Cognitive and AI Software for cyber security to help solve those kind of problems.
We're also seeing organizations at the sea level, where they're starting to talk about
how can Cognitive and AI technologies disrupt our business, so that we can actually
deliver goods faster or that we can drive a new business model from Cognitive and
AI hub [ph].
So in terms of the best practices, what I think, we've been asking or we've been
telling people to do is really do an assessment of how data-driven your organization
is today. And if it's not data-driven, then you really need to get a handle on what
your data is? What do you have? What do you own? What do you get from third-
party sources? Because the data is really the -- one of the key components that you
need to look at. Once you have that data and you have a good handle on whatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 7 of 12Anurag Rana
David Schubmehl
Jitendra Waral
David Schubmehlyou've got and what the quality is, then you can start to take a look at, well, how
could a Cognitive and AI solution begin to change that mindset?
On the end user side, we're also seeing, there has been -- everything in this press
around Conversational UIs, and chatbots and the future is that. So we're seeing a lot
of companies being starting to test the waters around. Is it the right time for us to
maybe take our customer service and augment it with a conversational AI agent? Or
if I have an IVR system, should I think about replacing that IVR system with a
conversational AI agent to do a better job and also turnover possibility and to -- and
to turning my customer support calls into actual sales?
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Hey, Dave, in our conversations with the technology and software companies, I think
the awareness is very high, everyone and their brother is launching some new AI
product any -- any given day. But what's kind of the awareness for non-technology
companies that are, let's say, somebody in the manufacturing area or metals and
minings, I mean, what's they -- do they have any idea of what's happening here?
Oh, yeah, I think they do. I mean, if you look at -- if you look at companies like for
example, Caterpillar. Caterpillar has been developing autonomous driving mining
vehicles for the last several years in terms of being able to reduce their costs and
things like that. John Deere is combining Cognitive and AI software with data
collection at the point of where the farm implement actually hits the ground to try to
improve farmers' yields and things like that. They have been making the tractors and
the farm implement actually delivered data that can be then used to develop
predictive models.
So I think that -- I think there is lots and lots of opportunities here for all sorts of
traditional companies. You just need to think about what kinds of data that you have
and what kinds of data that -- that if you could develop predictive models or you
could develop recommendation systems, how would that potentially change your
business opportunity?
{BIO 15423976 <GO>}
Dave, can we go through some of the strategies of companies other than IBM? I
mean, everybody else is pitching to AI solutions, obviously Google is top of the hill
with the DeepMind acquisition and all the applications they're doing on back of that.
How does -- how does -- what is the diﬀerentiation with IBM Watson? And you think
this diﬀerentiation is something that will last longer -- longer term given of what the
competition in-store [ph]?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 8 of 12Anurag Rana
David Schubmehl
Jitendra WaralWell, I mean, I think that, if you look at how Google has approached this, I mean,
Google has been approaching this from a consumer standpoint for the most part.
And I think they just recently announced that they're going to add into the Google
horizon or I forget what the name of the new product is, but they're adding AI
components into their Google for work products.
So they've been focusing on embedding cognitive capabilities into their products
and not necessarily creating a complete enterprise platform for building a Cognitive
AI solution. I think that's changing, and as Google develops more machine learning
services and more APIs, I think they're going to get into that marketplace. But I think,
IBM has a -- it has a pretty big head start in that particular area.
In the same way, Microsoft has been developing AI technologies for a long time and
most of their AI technologies have been embedded inside SharePoint, their
Microsoft Delve product that really oﬀers all those kind of capabilities. They have
their Cognitive Services, Microsoft Cognitive Services, but I would -- I wouldn't
characterize those as mature as the IBM Watson technologies out there. So in some
sense I think, IBM has a head start on this. Also I think IBM has been thinking about
this longer as a transformational process involving Cognitive and AI systems than
other companies have.
I think Microsoft, Satya Nadella talked about how important AI was at this year's
Ignite and how everything is going to be transformed by AI. And I think that's great
and I think that's where it is, but the CEO of IBM was talking about that 2.5 years ago.
So I think there is that head start that the IBM folks have it -- based on the Watson
technologies and their approach to business.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Fair enough, Dave. Dave, actually look at just the cloud businesses of diﬀerent
companies, whether it's Amazon Web Services or Microsoft, they have been the
leaders for some time now. Now, how does Watson help IBM's cloud strategy?
I mean, I think it helps their cloud strategy in terms of being able to make the AI
components available via the cloud. I think, they've done a lot in terms of delivering
the Watson Developer Services, as part of the Bluemix platform; and I think that's
helped advance the usage and popularity of the Bluemix platform. And so I think
from that standpoint, I think it's been a -- it's been a win-win situation for them in
terms of the fact that they have all these Cognitive and AI services and they're
making available via Bluemix.
{BIO 15423976 <GO>}
That's great. So can we talk about like what -- how do you -- we think about the
market size over here because obviously the impact seems to be very widespread,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 9 of 12David Schubmehl
A - Anurag Rana
A - David Schubmehlhow do we size the market? How do you look at how much this is worth and how
these guys monetize it?
So we -- yeah, I mean, we're sizing it in a couple of diﬀerent ways. One was, as part of
our spending guide research, we're looking at the spend available on those. And in
terms of the software side, I mean, well, there is actually multiple diﬀerent
technologies. There's obviously the hardware side and for that we're seeing
increases in GPUs; and we're seeing increases in compute power coming from
diﬀerent folks.
On the software side, we see there is -- there is kind of two diﬀerentiations; one is
these Cognitive Software platforms that we -- that I've talked about, which is a
business that's going to grow quickly, but it's a tools business, all right. As opposed
to the cognitively enabled applications business, which is really, I'm going to add AI
into a piece of enterprise software or I'm going to develop a new piece of software
to do something; and it's going to be cognitively enabled. We see the totals of these
-- of all these technologies being something like a $30 billion business -- $30 billion
opportunity by 20 -- I think its 2019 right now is what we've got.
And then the growth rate is something on the order of 50% to 55% CAGR,
Compound Annual Growth Rate for these types of applications.
Now, one of the things I'm going to caution people about is that we're also seeing
enterprise software companies adding AI components into their standard enterprise
software; and in some cases, they're probably not going to charge for those. So for
example, the version of SharePoint that includes that Delve technology that I talked
about is, it doesn't cost any more than just regular SharePoint. It's just part of the
package. And we're going to see some percentage of these applications that
actually going to embed AI functionality; and there's not going to be any additional
revenue for the software vendors, but it will help to sell more copies of their
packages.
So in those particular cases, we won't count that as -- as a AI revenue or a Cognitive
Software revenue, we'll count it as ERP revenue or CRM revenue or what have you.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Thanks, Dave. Dave, we have some questions from the audience. The ﬁrst one is, are
there any speciﬁc AI companies in healthcare that you would highlight as being
ahead of the curve?
I mean, there is a number of Watson partners and people that have been out there. I
mean, I'm not really an expert in the healthcare area. But I mean, there is a companyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04

Page 10 of 12A - Anurag Rana

A - David Schubmehl
A - Jitendra Warallike Modernizing Medicine that I thought was quite innovative based on their
partnership with IBM. There is other companies out there that are doing interesting
things and our Health Insights Group is probably the people to ask speciﬁcally about
the healthcare environment.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Great. So the next question is could you discuss the extent to which Watson is -- are
being used to ﬁght cyber-crimes or attacks?
The -- I don't believe if there has been any announcements about IBM Watson in
terms of cyber security and things as of yet. I'm not really -- that's not my particular
area, but I don't -- I'm not really aware of it. What Watson has been used for is really
that fraud analytics and compliance analytics that we're seeing in the place. I think
there is also some work going on with IBM Watson under DoD work and things like
that that we're not really aware of oﬃcially, but I think it's a safe bet that IBM is
working closely with the federal government to try to -- to try to analyze and
understand diﬀerent types of threats.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Great. Just one -- another one is, what businesses are -- what do you think, what
businesses are at the risk of being obsolete as Cognitive computer replaces their
services. When you look down the list, what areas come ﬁrst to your mind?
Well, I mean, I think -- I think people need to be thinking about how diﬀerent types
of technology are going to be changed and impacted. So if you think about the fact
that you may have a Cognitive or AI program available to you and do you need
Records Management Software, do you need Content Management Software, if you
have a smart agent automatically ﬁnding that information and providing you with
that information on a regular basis. So I think -- so I think, certain categories of
software are potentially at risk, as you have automated solutions available out there
to do that.
I think there is -- one of the things I've been talking about with my marketing
automation counterparts here at IDC is, what is the future of marketing? Given that
you may have AI based assistance in the future onto your phone and onto your PCs
that are actually helping to ﬁlter information, are they going to ﬁlter ads? Are they
going to ﬁlter marketing tent? How is the intermediation of your automated agent
going to work with vendors marketing agent? What's the intermediation going to
look like? Will advertising potentially go away at least in the sense that we know it
today, in terms of targeting and things like that? I think those are all interesting
questions. And is that going to change the landscape for how people consume
information?

Page 11 of 12A - David Schubmehl
A - Anurag Rana
A - David SchubmehlThanks, Dave. You've brieﬂy touched on automated advisors, where are we on the
evolution curve of that? I mean, if you look at consumer application Facebook is
trying to pilot chatbots. There are -- there are examples that work; there are some
that don't. So how far are we in terms of these automated advisors being ready for
prime time?
I mean, I think -- I think it's early days, right now. I mean, I think we're starting to see
everybody continuing to push that. I mean Microsoft's Cortana and Google Assistant,
Apple Siri, all of these phone based ones continue to get smarter.
I think the question is, will you have something that's intimately tied to your phone,
into a vendor or is there going to be somebody that provide some kind of a general
purpose assistant that really becomes your advisor and that you pay to have that
kind of automated advisor like the x.ai that helps you to schedule or some of the
other personal assistant technologies that are out there. I think the form and the
factor of those are kind of up for grabs right now.
And the other question is, who gets to own your data? Obviously, you as the
consumer would like to own your data. But right now, if you use Google Assistant, or
you use Gmail, your data is read by Google to try to improve things, but that also
improves the targeting and marketing. Apple owns your data, if you're using an
Apple iPhone and Siri. I mean, they say that it's all yours, but obviously there is some
interaction there. And then, obviously Microsoft is in the same boat, as it uses -- as
you use Cortana, there is certain things that that it's going to be aware of.
So the question is who owns that data? Who is responsible for that data? And how --
when you go in and look at that data and work with that data? And then are you
going to want a third-party AI advisor out there or are you going to want a one that's
based on your phone and be for free. I think those things are all kind of yet to be
determined. And I think to some extent, I think everybody is doing a stepwise
improvement in this automated advisor area until something really takes hold with
the consumers.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Dave, thanks. Dave, let me ask you the last question; and then we should wrap it up.
One of the things you talk quite a bit about was buying data or everybody how data
is going to be very important to them; and obviously after Microsoft bought LinkedIn
we have heard a lot about Salesforce trying to say that they will -- might not get
access to something like this. Now, is this going to become a bigger issue? Will for
example IBM down the road say well, we are not going to give data for let's say the
assets of The Weather Company to anybody else out there or will this become kind
of an anti-competitive thing going forward?
I don't -- I think the companies like Microsoft buying LinkedIn data and IBM buying
The Weather Company, I think their -- I think their business models right now includeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-10-04
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 12 of 12A - Anurag Ranasharing that data with third parties. And I think everybody would be -- if they started
to hold that data and say they wouldn't share it. I think obviously the world's
governments would be out after these folks, in fact, it's -- to some extent it's already
happening.
But I do believe that here you're going to see this land grab continue of companies
trying to acquire data and have access to data and the data process and the data
integration capabilities of those; and then they're going to be ﬁrst and foremost. So I
think IBM will continue to look for good acquisitions of data like what they did with
The Weather Company, like what they did with Merge, I think Microsoft is going to
do the same thing with LinkedIn. Salesforce did this a couple of years ago with
Data.com.
So I think there is lots and lots of opportunities. I mean, Oracle is doing something
similar with the Oracle Data Cloud, the company they bought BlueKai and they
bought some other companies that they've integrated it into a real data provider. I
do believe that this -- there's going to be increased competition for data companies;
and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if other large data companies get acquired by the
