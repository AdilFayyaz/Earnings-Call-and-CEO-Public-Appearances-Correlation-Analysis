Before we get started with our next presentation I just want to take a moment to
recognize our President. CAGNY is a volunteer organization and the time
commitment that goes into being a President is actually pretty signiﬁcant. So ﬁrst I
would like to have all the past Presidents please stand. Thank you for your service.
And now please join me in thanking our current CAGNY President, Dara Mohsenian,
for his time and eﬀort on the CAGNY Board. He has contributed a signiﬁcant amount
of thought, time and eﬀort to making this conference a success. Dara. All right.
Our next presenter is PepsiCo. So please join me in thanking them for their generous
support by supplying beverages and snacks to the conference this week.
In a rapidly changing and increasingly volatile marketplace Pepsi has consistently
delivered strong shareholder returns by remaining focused on its core strategy. I
want to thank Pepsi's Chairman and CEO, Indra Nooyi. And Vice Chairman and CFO,
Hugh Johnston for being with us today. Indra, I will turn it to you.
{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
Thank you, Bryan. Good afternoon, everyone. And Dara, thank you for serving as the
Chair of CAGNY. Now it is our pleasure to be with you today. And before we begin,
please take note of our safe harbor statement which is also available on our website.
As you know, some of the statements today will include forward-looking remarks and
non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures.
So let me start with a snapshot of PepsiCo. Most of you know our Company; it is a
global convenience food and beverage Company with $63 billion in revenue thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 2 of 16gives us tremendous scale advantages. It is a business model that generates a lot of
cash, over $8 billion in 2015 alone.
A track record of very solid organic revenue growth, 5% in 2015. Attractive and
growing core operating margins and core net ROIC, approximately 16% and 20%
respectively. And consistent growth in earnings per share and dividends per share.
And very strong cash returns to shareholders, $24 billion over the past three years.
And as we reported last week, we met or exceeded every one of our 2015 ﬁnancial
goals, delivering 5% organic growth, revenue growth, core operating margin
expansion, over $1 billion in productivity savings, 10% core constant currency EPS
growth and total cash returns to shareholders of $9 billion. So we feel pretty good
about our recent performance.
But I have to tell you it has not been smooth sailing and the world has been and is a
volatile place. We have encountered economic slowdowns, currency devaluations,
geopolitical instability, increased regulatory pressure exacerbated by ﬁnancial
market volatility. And a variety of trends, some new and some long standing, from
what people consume to how they pay for it, continue to reshape our industry.
It all sounds bleak but it is not entirely bleak because there are pockets of economic
stability and even recovery in markets like the United States, the United Kingdom
and India. And our categories remain on trend and serve as aﬀordable luxuries even
through diﬃcult times.
You know there is an old adage that a pessimist complains about the wind, an
optimist hopes it will improve and a realist adjusts their sails. And adjusting our sails
is what we have been doing. To adapt to a volatile and changing environment, as
you well know, we have been on a transformational journey. We're transforming our
product portfolio, balancing our geographic footprint, becoming leaner and more
eﬃcient and building new capabilities and changing our operating model. We have
done all this while delivering attractive ﬁnancial returns.
And our decisions and actions have been guided by our True North, what we call
performance of purpose -- our vision to integrate sustainability into our business
strategy and to leave a positive imprint on society and the environment, not just
because it is good. But also because it is good for business all while delivering top-
tier ﬁnancial results. And our transformation eﬀort so far has positioned us well.
Our product portfolio oﬀers strong positions in categories with attractive global
growth. And our products cut across various demand spaces that range from
nutritional guilt free options to social pleasurable treats.
We have a clear number one global position in salty snacks. We have a strong
number two global position in beverages with leadership or parity in a number of
important markets. And because we have such a diverse portfolio, CSDs comprise
less than 25% of our total revenue.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 3 of 16And our transformational eﬀorts to date have also led to a well-balanced geographic
footprint. We operate in over 200 countries and territories around the world. But ﬁve
countries make up approximately three quarters of our 2015 total revenue. And we
are well-positioned in these markets; we have the largest food and beverage market
share in four out of those ﬁve top markets. And we were the largest contributor to
retail sales growth in each of those markets from 2010 to 2014.
Our balance across developed, developing and emerging markets provides a good
combination of strong current margins and returns with great potential for future
growth. The emerging markets tend to be primarily top-line growth drivers with
some potential for margin improvement in the short-term. Developing markets drive
balanced top-line growth and ROIC improvement. And developed markets
contribute relatively less to top-line growth but have very attractive absolute margins
and returns.
Taken together this portfolio provides for balanced growth, margin and return
improvement, attractive current returns and sustainable future growth opportunities.
And while our transformation eﬀorts have served us well and put us in a good
position today, our transformation journey continues.
Looking ahead, our priorities for running the Company are very straightforward, I call
them the ﬁve Cs and they are key to driving our sustained performance -- upgrading
our commercial agenda, elevating our cost focus, exercising disciplined capital
allocation, building new capabilities and fostering a winning culture -- the ﬁve Cs. Let
me touch on each beginning with our commercial agenda.
We will build on an already strong commercial foundation while leveraging to a
greater degree our demand space consumer framework. We want to do more to
capture the health and wellness growth potential. We want to lift and adapt ideas
across the PepsiCo world to leverage our global scale and focus on new
partnerships and foodservice opportunities.
Much of our commercial agenda involves driving bigger, more scalable ideas for our
global brands while maintaining local relevance and innovation. Here is how it works.
First, we align our global brands around distinctive brand ideas like Live for Now, or
Do the Dew, or For the Bold. Then having all our markets work oﬀ one idea creates
increased eﬀectiveness and long-term recourse.
Second, we design for execution across TV, video, social and retail channels and we
create these programs that can be leveraged across markets around the world to
drive eﬃciency.
Third, we adapt these global platforms and programs with local culture nuances to
drive increased relevance.
And lastly, we just activate at the local level utilizing the latest in media and
communications thinking. Let me quickly walk you through some examples of each.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 4 of 16Mountain Dew, the great drink, it is a great example of a brand with a strong global
idea that is enabling growth all around the world. In 2016 the global Do the Dew
campaign is taking on an inarguable trend for youth which is drones. But what would
our active Dew consumers do with drones? Now they would create an entirely new
sport, we call it drone hunting, let's take a look.
(Video in progress).
Now this commercial inspires an integrated eﬀort that will run in over 30 markets in
2016 aiding the brand's growth. It is not just about mass media; this integrated eﬀort
will go all the way to on ground activation and sampling events where drone racing
has already started to take oﬀ.
Another Dew example is the success of Kickstart. It shows the power of applying
consumer insights to extend a powerful brand. Kickstart, as you know, was launched
in 2013 and now has an estimated retail sales approaching $400 million with plenty
of growth as we expand this globally.
And from a marketing standpoint you would have to be living under a rock not to
have heard about Kickstart's recent campaign. Kickstart combines three awesome
things, Dew, juice and caﬀeine, just like a puppy, a monkey and a baby. And you
want to know why I know you must have heard about it, because it was the single
share of voice winner at the Super Bowl. The favorite of the trade and ﬁnancial press
alike.
Now this is no mistake, here is a brilliant example of designing a communication
program for the world of the Internet. It was a commercial in the Super Bowl without
a hashtag whose hashtag trended all might. And it earned more than 3 billion
earned impressions and counting and has become a cultural phenomenon. Let's just
watch.
(Video in progress).
I have to tell you, while some people tweeted the puppymonkeybaby was disturbing
or a nightmare , 70% thought it was awesome. The commercial was a huge success.
So that was puppymonkeybaby and Kickstart.
Our Doritos team, on the other hand, were pioneers in the integration of social and
digital in its marketing. For the 10th and ﬁnal year Doritos held its famous crash the
Super Bowl contest where we invited fans to submit a commercial with a chance to
win $1 million. And also thrown in was an opportunity to work with directors Zach
Snyder and have the ad aired on Super Bowl Sunday.
Fans voted for the winner from a pool of 50 semiﬁnalists and three ﬁnalists. And
while we had amazingly innovative submissions, I want to show you just one of thoseFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 5 of 16adds today, it was a runner up and it was a funny and creative at and generated a lot
of media attention. Let's watch.
(Video in progress).
Now a great example of global and local execution using a central theme is our 2015
Say it with Pepsi campaign. Emojis are the language of today. But no one has put
them in the world like Pepsi will in 2016. With more than 70 global and local unique
predesigned emojis printed on cans, bottles and cups all over the world, you're
going to be able to stay for the Pepsi all through the summer of 2016.
Our design center has designed all these emojis and we've created a copy which
shows emojis and a Pepsi really come in handy. For example, when you ﬁnd yourself
stuck at a train station in a foreign country or at a concert when it is too loud to speak
you can use your emojis to communicate. And our customers are very excited about
this program and this will run in about 100 markets this summer.
So moving from advertising to innovation. Deep Ridged Chips are a great example
of the intersection of great R&D and the deployment of list and adapt. MAXX Deep
Ridge is a unique proprietary deep cut chip for maximum crunch and intense ﬂavor.
It is designed for the young and hungry (inaudible) seeking a more satisfying
snacking experience. This chip has launched in 33 countries and is delivering
approximately $250 million in retail sales today. That is Deep Ridge.
Walkers Sunbites is the range of snacks full of goodness from sun grown ingredients
that naturally taste good. Our product line includes multigrain chips, ready-to-eat
popcorn, multigrain crackers and bread bites. The full range of Sunbites deliver tasty
bites of crunchy goodness. And the products today are in eight markets and will
launch in Mexico in 2016. Sunbites are delivering approximately $400 million in
estimated retail sales globally.
And addressing consumer demand for on-the-go great tasting nutrition we launched
Quaker High Fiber Oats Drink in China this past year. Using a proprietary process we
blend quicker oats with high-quality milk from New Zealand to retain the ingredients
-- the natural ingredients of natural grains while boasting a smooth and silky texture
with plentiful dietary ﬁber. Quaker High Fiber Oats Drink was launched in two ﬂavors,
the original ﬂavor and the nut ﬂavor. And was recognized as the best dairy drink of
2015 at the World Beverage Innovation Awards.
Exploiting another growing consumer demand, we recently introduced a new line of
gluten-free oatmeal so that those who consume gluten-free foods can also enjoy the
great taste of Quaker oats. The oatmeal is available in three varieties all of which are
clearly labeled as gluten-free. Quaker quick one minute standard oats, Quaker
instant oatmeal single serve pouches in both original and maple brown sugar
ﬂavors.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 6 of 16And even though oats are naturally gluten-free (technical diﬃculty) wheat, rye, barley
and spelt may be introduced during the farming, storing and transportation
processes. But our R&D team partnered with our expert millers and they've taken the
time and extreme care to develop processes to now oﬀer great tasting gluten-free
Quaker oats which meets FDA standards and is a product that consumers can trust.
We also continue to elevate our product to reach premium plus consumers and Pure
Leaf is a great example. Pure Leaf was launched in 2012 to target consumers looking
for a real brewed tea experience in a ready-to-drink format. Unlike other ready-to-
drink teas, Pure Leaf is brewed from real tea leaves versus being made from tea
powder. And we have experienced double-digit growth for four years in a row.
Last year in 2015, we launched our ﬁrst national advertising campaign called,
(inaudible) leaves and we activated the (tea inﬂuencers) that spoke with real passion
for the ingredients and the authenticity of the brand.
In 2016 we are extending the Pure Leaf family to a range of super-premium organic
iced teas called Pure Leaf Teahouse Collection. It comes in three delicious unique
ﬂavors: organic black tea with a hint of (inaudible) lemon and honeysuckle, organic
black tea with a hint of wild blackberry and sage; and organic green tea with a hint
of Fuji Apple and ginger.
Those are our products in innovation and activation. Now partnerships, key focus to
driving our commercial agenda as evidenced by a recent Super Bowl execution for
the NFL. In 2015 PepsiCo brands became the oﬃcial foods and beverages of the
NBA, the WNBA, the Development League and USA Basketball. Gatorade has been
the oﬃcial drink since 1984 and we are pleased to have brands like Mountain Dew,
Aqua Fina, Doritos and Ruﬄes join this powerful (inaudible).
We're also extremely proud of our new partnership with UEFA Champions (League).
Lay's, Walkers, Gatorade and Pepsi Max will serve as the lead brands for the
prestigious European Cup football tournament and Doritos, Lipton and 7 Up will be
integrated into the sponsorship programs.
And our commercial agenda extends into the enormous food-service opportunity.
For example, Pepsi beverages have become the oﬃcial sponsor of Live Nation. We
have always been a leader in music and now, along with exclusive pouring rights
with Live Nation, we can continue to deliver new and exciting music experiences to
our consumers, Live Nation.
And our design center partnered with our food service innovation team to develop
ﬁzzology. It is an innovation that combines the future of CSDs with mixology to
create unique and unexpected ﬂavors in the ultimate consumer beverage
experience. We are unleashing culinary innovation far and wide with our NSPIRE
mobile (inaudible). I hope some of you were at the Super Bowl; it was just amazing
to see all of this innovation in action.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 7 of 16And we are reimagining the fountain with our Stubborn Soda which pours craft
beverages while expanding our foodservice footprint. And our world-class design
team is creating the future of on-demand nutrition with our Hello Goodness healthy
vending machines. You can see an example of that Hello Goodness machine right
outside this room.
And the good news is in initial testing these vending machines have higher revenue
throughputs than our traditional oﬀenders. And only PepsiCo can ﬁll them with a
variety of food and beverage products ranging from guilt free to pleasurable
indulgence. So we are putting many, many of these spending machines out this year.
And a few weeks ago we unveiled plans to launch Kola House, the ﬁrst experimental
cola bar, restaurant lounge and event space in the US market. Everything at the Kola
House will be centered around the cola nut and we are using the space as a social
hub for testing new products. The ﬂagship location will be completed this spring and
will open in New York City's meatpacking district. I hope to see many of you there.
As you can see, we have a lot of exciting opportunities ahead of us that we will
continue to drive innovation and price utilization as we continue to capture new
channel distribution opportunities. So that is the commercial agenda.
Our next priority is the cost agenda, making every penny a prisoner and using them
eﬀectively to drive value creating growth. We are targeting $1 billion in productivity
savings annually through 2019 through leveraging our global capabilities of scale,
exploiting automation and advanced technologies and implementing smart
spending, which is our version of zero-based (inaudible).
Here is a snapshot of the composition of our entire $53 billion cost (inaudible). While
our $1 billion annual productivity target is directed at operating costs which we
deﬁne as all costs excluding direct materials and (A&M), we are driving for greater
productivity in virtually every bucket. We are optimizing our direct materials cost
through a combination of procurement excellence to lower the rate, reducing usage
through improved operational (technical diﬃculty) sustainability initiatives and by
increasing our local sourcing.
In labor we have reduced layers of management; we have increased spans of
control. We are increasingly automating our manufacturing and warehouse. We are
more precisely aligning wages with work. And we are increasing productivity
through advanced operations metrics monitoring. We are increasing the productivity
of our logistics, transportation and manufacturing eﬃciency by optimizing our
network improvement.
And in marketing, we are increasing eﬀectiveness by shifting more of our spending
to consumer facing marketing while applying smart spending principles and
procurement excellence to many of our marketing activities and vendors. And we
are very, very aggressively applying smart spending to a broad range of
discretionary G&A categories.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 8 of 16Our smart spending approach is disciplined; it's actually embedding new behaviors
across PepsiCo. For 2016 we have fully implemented smart spending across the
organization with signiﬁcant productivity to be realized across discretionary
spending categories including travel and entertainment, sponsorships, consulting
and facilities (technical diﬃculty). And much of our productivity is being harvested by
our global operations group and let me give you just a couple of examples.
This operations group was instrument in the clean sheeting of our global
manufacturing footprint in 2013 which has led to a rationalization of about 30 plants
globally. We have standardized a (route to) engineering playbook based on global
best practices; an implantation of technology, much of it pioneered at Frito-Lay
North America, leading to signiﬁcant DSD route productivity.
Similarly, our sustainability eﬀorts are also producing greater productivity. Since
2007 we have improved water use eﬃciency by 20%, reduced packaging waste by
350 million pounds and signiﬁcantly reduced our landﬁll waste. So that is the cost
bucket.
Our third C focuses on exercising discipline on Capital Return. We discussed our
commitment to capital allocation discipline and enhancing Capital Returns in detail
on our Fourth Quarter call. So I'm not going to cover it at length there. But rest
assured that we are driving higher return on invested capital and greater CapEx
eﬃciency through a broad menu of initiatives including: focusing intently on
relatively lower returning businesses (technical diﬃculty); leveraging our
partnerships; and implementing lower-cost business models.
We have made particular progress in our capital spending eﬃciency having reduced
CapEx as a percentage of sales by 70 basis points since 2011. And one of the key
ways we've done this is by increasing the capacity utilization of our existing assets.
So for example, we have extended the productivity of our logistics by increasingly
integrating the over the road network of our businesses to eliminate any empty miles
in the system.
And in manufacturing we are increasing throughput by boosting line productivity. As
a result our core net return on invested capital has steadily improved and has
increased over 430 basis points since 2012.
And to further advance our commercial agenda I outlined earlier, we are building
new capabilities, which is our fourth C. Here we have particularly focused on ﬁve
capabilities for building, capabilities to do eCommerce, taking design to a whole
new level. Revenue management, which I think is a critical capability going forward.
Front line selling tools and data analytics.
We are enhancing our design capabilities to deliver more compelling experiences to
our consumers and our customers. And to accomplish this we have established a
global design team with world-class talent and now they are spread in many parts of
the world. They are highly engaged with our brand teams to enhance brand identity,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 9 of 16Hugh Johnstonbrand experiences (in campaigns), as well as being highly integrated in product,
packaging and equipment design.
We continue to develop and reﬁne our revenue management capabilities to convey
greater value to our consumers through packaging and price points and promotions
that are tailored to the shopping occasion, channel and customer. And we are
extending our DSD advantage through the development and deployment of
advanced frontline selling tools, especially those leveraging mobile technology.
With these tools and applications we continue to enhance our frontline ability to
optimize assortment, (technical diﬃculty) using granular market and product
performance data and execute new product launches and promotions. So that is
what we are doing on the capability front.
And ﬁnally the ﬁfth C, culture. Here our priority is to foster a culture of learning. The
great news is that PepsiCo has a terriﬁc culture. It is strongly based in values and
people with a can-do spirit with a must-do sense of responsibility and accountability.
So our priorities here are to have in place incentives, communication, direction and
organization that reinforces our values and accentuates three speciﬁc cultural
elements: making sure our pay is aligned with performance and that we are
rewarding true excellence. Second, cultivating eﬃciency and accountability. And
third, driving collaboration across functions in geographic business units.
These are the elements that we have always stressed at PepsiCo. But when we look
at our priorities these are the behaviors we have to keep stressing to ensure that we
remain successful and we are winning in the marketplace.
So tying it all together I would say to you that the PepsiCo model works. We have the
right balance, the right priorities, the right vision and a commitment to creating long-
term value for all of our shareholders. So with that let me turn it to Hugh.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Great, thank you, Indra. Good afternoon, everyone. For the remainder of the
presentation I will share with you how our transformation and ﬁve C priorities have
and will continue to translate to attract ﬁnancial results. And it really comes back to
the virtuous circle of ﬁnancial performance that we have shared with you in the past.
It begins with top-line growth that is enabled by the many portfolio and capability
advantages that we have been talking about. This feeds into scale advantage, which
combined with aggressive productivity programs drives strong earnings growth and
cash ﬂow generation. And that enables sustained reinvestment in brands, innovation
and further capability development which continues to fuel the top-line growth. This
in turn translates to an attractive overall ﬁnancial model.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 10 of 16We believe our business is capable of delivering over the long-term mid-single-digit
organic revenue growth, operating margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points per
year on average, which together with ﬁnancial leverage should generate sustainable
high-single-digit core constant currency EPS growth.
Further, with our disciplined capital allocation and focus on maximizing cash ﬂow we
expect to generate free cash ﬂow growth in line with earnings growth, drive
continued attractive cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases as well as continued improvement in our net return on invested capital.
So assuming a constant multiple high-single-digit EPS growth, combined with a
dividend yield of about 3% should yield a compound TSR in the low-double-digits.
So let's see how that has played out over the last few years' actual performance.
For the past three years we have had organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%, in line
with our target, enabled by enhanced revenue management capability, a strong
innovation agenda, increased marketing and solid in-market execution. We've
achieved approximately $1 billion of productivity savings annually since 2012. We
completed our ﬁrst program of $3 billion over three years, 2012 to 2014. And this
past year completed the ﬁrst year of our current ﬁve-year $5 billion productivity
program.
And as Indra mentioned, cost and productivity is one of our priority areas going
forward with plans in place and good visibility into delivering the current program.
Our eﬀorts have led to good increases in our key productivity metrics including for
operating proﬁt for employee which is up over 8% since 2011. And it has also
translated to steady expanding gross and operating margins.
Gross margins have expended by 285 basis points over the past three years and
operating margins, excluding A&M and R&D, which we do not target for dollar
reduction productivity, have expanded by a cumulative 195 basis points over the past
three years.
So the organic revenue growth and productivity have enabled us to continue and
invest in growth initiatives. This is the virtuous circle that I just mentioned in action.
We took A&M as a % of sales up by 40 basis points in 2015 and it is up over 110 basis
points since 2011.
At the same time we've made a lot of progress in shifting our marketing mix. We are
spending a greater percentage of our marketing dollars on consumer facing so-
called working A&M and we have shifted a greater percentage to social and digital
where we see a higher return on our marketing investment.
Another area of investment has been in R&D where investment is up 44% since 2011.
And these investments have yielded very good returns and have accelerated the
pace and stickiness of our innovation. In fact, innovation is now approximately 9% ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 11 of 16A - Bryan Spillane
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participantnet revenue, a 120 point basis increase since 2012. All of this has ultimately translated
to very attractive earnings performance.
Core constant currency EPS is increased 9%, 9% and 10% over the past three years,
at the high end or above our long-term targeted range. And it is important to note
that a substantial portion of these earnings has translated to free cash ﬂow. In fact,
over the past three years our free cash ﬂow, excluding certain items, is at an index of
119% to core earnings.
This reﬂects not only the generally high cash generative nature of our business. But
also the focus we have had on capital spending eﬃciency and working capital
management. In absolute terms, our core free cash ﬂow has averaged $8.2 billion a
year for the past four years, or a cumulative free cash ﬂow of $24.5 billion.
And ultimately this has generated attractive total shareholder returns on both an
absolute and on a relative basis. Our three year cumulative TSR is ahead of the S&P
500 by 640 basis points and ahead of the consumer Staples index by 310 basis
points.
So to conclude, Indra and I would like for you to take away four simple messages
from our presentation. First, PepsiCo has a well-balanced product and geographic
portfolio constructed to deliver consistent and stable results and returns.
Second, we have and will continue to transform our business to survive and thrive in
the rapidly changing external environment and deliver on our ﬁnancial commitments
as we do so.
Third, we have a clear set of priorities to advance our ﬁnancial and strategic agendas
and we are executing well against them.
And forth, our goal is to maximize long-term shareholder value creation, what we
refer to as managing for both the level and for the duration of returns.
And with that we will open it up for your questions.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 2147799 <GO>}
Bill.
Indra and Hugh, can you just give us a bridge to where the $1 billion of annual
restructuring savings are going? Because it's about 10% growth itself. So is there a
way to kind of map that in local currency terms? Then is the $1 billion really like $1.1FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18
PepsiCo Inc (PEP US Equity)
Page 12 of 16A - Indra Nooyi
Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
A - Indra Nooyibillion because of the currency? Because I think you call it in dollars. So how do you
to kind of toggle that when sort of currency moves?
{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
(Sort of a standing slide to you). What I want to do is leave you a construct to think
about where the productivity comes from and where it is going, okay. So think of our
earnings growth, let's say the earnings growth for the (Company), operating earnings
growth is (6% to 7%), just pick a number.
The way we think about it start with the earnings year zero, the combination of
volume, price, commodity (inﬂation) and marketplace investment like routes and
racks, the four of them should net out to give you the earnings (technical diﬃculty).
Then we look at operating expense inﬂation, OpEx productivity and investments in
our operating expense productivity. The combination of those three should net to
neutral. That is really how we look at a country by country, region by region, cluster
by cluster. What has been happening in the past?
We have been getting the operating expense productivity. But the OpEx inﬂation has
outpaced OpEx productivity because the business model has changed. So what we
are trying to do is make investments in operating expense productivity. But that
combination has still not netted out to a (technical diﬃculty) diﬀerent.
So what we are really -- I will give you an example. When the product portfolio in
North American averages fragments, all of a sudden you have got to source the
product diﬀerently from a diﬀerent network than from the distributed network we
have (technical diﬃculty) the costs go up. So OpEx inﬂation goes up.
So we have to rethink the entire manufacturing process to see how we can recapture
the beneﬁts of our network as opposed to single sourcing a few plants. So that is
what contributes to OpEx inﬂation more than the OpEx productivity. So we are
making OpEx investments to increase the OpEx productivity. So there is a lead lag
eﬀect.
So net-net, the algorithm works because we make the volume price commodity
inﬂation bucket generate the earnings growth to the extent possible and we balance
the OpEx inﬂation productivity. That is how we play the global portfolio.
Is it overly optimistic to think there might be a point in time when some of the macro
volatility slows that you will be way above trend (inaudible) more of that?
{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
You know what; we would love to see this macro volatility slow. But at this point
where the eye can see I don't see the macro volatilities growing. When we get there
we will be here to talk about it. Okay?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18

Brian.
Just a question about the productivity goal each year, with the macro environment
being more challenging in developed and developing markets that -- I think you had
a slide that kind of showed some of the productivity will come from those markets.
Does -- in the scenario where things deteriorate, does it become more diﬃcult to
actually realize those cost savings if sales are lower or there are some other sort of
mitigating circumstances?

think actually -- I think costs is easy. You can just say every other person is gone or
cut the people by 20%, that is easy to do. What happens in those cases, you lose the
best people because the best people ﬁnd new jobs and leave. And you typically cut
growth initiatives because they are not yielding in the next quarter. And those are the
initiatives that you can never rebuild fast enough.
And so, if you look at all of these haunted stories about cost-cutting, what do they
struggle with? Delivering the top line. That is really the trade-oﬀ you are making. So
when we looked at smart spending and looked at productivity end-to-end we always
separated our growth driving costs and sort of management and administrative
costs.
We looked at cost reduction in each bucket very, very carefully. So I would say even
in a downturn it is important to protect the growth initiative, because we're not going
to be in a permanent downturn forever. The question is how do you deploy those
growth initiatives to do other things, creative things so that when we come back we
can capture whatever growth (technical diﬃculty). I don't know, Hugh, what do you
want to add to that?
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
Yes. No. I think that is exactly right. We spend a lot of time making sure we not only
protect but we continue to over index on investments and growth driving initiatives.
And that is why you are seeing such healthy top-line growth.
Probably the biggest challenge. And Bill, it connects a little bit back to your FX
question. To the degree that the dollar continues to be strong it does create local
inﬂation in lots of countries which does put pressure on operating expense inﬂation
which pushes us to push for more productivity.
Now we have drawn some lines in the sand around growth investments and said as
long as they're returning well we are going to continue to protect them. But that isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18

Let's just continue along the front here. Dara.
{BIO 3017577 <GO>}
Indra, I was hoping for some thoughts around the third C, capital. And if you go back
relative to the restructuring announced four years ago, clearly you have had a focus
on returning cash to shareholders over the last few years. But since then you have
delivered (inaudible) or above what you promised. (inaudible) going to be a very
strong ﬁnancial shape as (inaudible) today. The world consolidated around you, rates
are still low, multiples have moved down for some of the possible targets out there.
So can you give us some updated thoughts on where M&A ﬁts into your priorities
versus four years ago? And particularly doing something larger as opposed to just a
bolt-on deal?
{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
You know, Dara, one of the things that we don't shy away from is investments that
can grow this Company meaningfully in a value creating way in the long-term -- over
the long-term. We have the management bandwidth, we have the capability, we
have the talent, we can do it. What we are struggling with is ﬁnding the right
opportunities out there.
The small ones are just excessively priced because everybody wants to go after it.
And the big ones each have their warts, whether it is management team not there,
the business model doesn't ﬁt or it is a conﬂict of what we're doing in our own
strategy.
So we have yet to ﬁnd that gem of a Company out there that we think can
meaningfully create value and grow PepsiCo better than what we are doing today.
So there is nothing out there at the moment. But if you have any ideas, let us know.
We will certainly listen to you.

Anybody else?
Yes, I noticed in the presentation the total cost -- a detailed question and then a big
picture question on marketing spending. 6% of the $53 billion gets you a little bit
lower than what the 10-K number was at like $3.9 billion or something. And what
(inaudible) technically what the discrepancy is there. And a lot of people have talked
about the diﬀerent ROI on marketing spending today, marketing and advertising,
particularly moving to digital. Do you anticipate an opportunity for that number to
trend over time?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-18

To trend lower?
Yes.
{BIO 1404395 <GO>}
You can address the discrepancy issue if there is any. But let me -- we were in -- when
we were in California just before the Super Bowl we had a whole discussion with all
of the gaﬀer types and all of the people dealing with networks on what is an ROI on
A&M? Who really has a model to calculate ROI and A&M? Because each person
comes in and says, the ROI is 25%. But if you total it up, it is not there, okay.
And really I'll speak for myself. I was a big TV watcher and I am now binge watching
Netﬂix or HBO NOW, which worries me because I have so many TVs at home and I
never turn it on. My kids have never turned the TV on in their apartment. So I really
worry about the future and what is the A&M ROI.
Having said that what we all do know is if we don't advertise what the negative
consequences are, what we don't know is what is the positive ROI on all of the
investments we make? Individual investments we can tell what the ROI is. But it is a
terrible way to calculate ROI based on if you don't invest, people sort of worry why
you didn't put -- you were not in the Super Bowl, why didn't you put out a great
digital campaign.
So it is proving positive through a negative as opposed to proving the positive
through a positive. I think today the networks and the Google, Facebook's are all
focused on calculating -- developing a good methodology of calculating ROI and
A&M. That is the single biggest assignment that all of them have because companies
are demanding it right now.
So -- and we are doing our own work with some (inaudible) ﬁrms to think about is
there a good model we can come up with that looks at the digital world where
people can blank out these eyeballs advertising to really calculate an ROI. So I would
say a work in progress.
{BIO 15089105 <GO>}
I was just going to say, Bryan, a couple things on your technical question, number
one, (the K) is right. Number two, I think the diﬀerence is some of it is rounding and
some of it is the characterization that we have done here, which is more of traditional
marketing characterization whereas sort of the very pure accounting deﬁnition,
where the geography is in the A&M between sitting inside of these cost buckets and
sitting inside of trade spending. So I think that's the diﬀerence between the two.
