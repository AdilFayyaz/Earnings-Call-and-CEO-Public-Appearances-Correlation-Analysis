Grant Bradski [ph] will now introduce proposal number ﬁve, requesting a report on
retirement plan options. Mr. Bradski has re prerecorded the following statements.
Hello, I am Grant Bradski, representing As You Sow on item ﬁve of the proxy
statement. This proposal asks Amazon to report to shareholders on the likely
negative impact from the misalignment of our company's retirement plan holdings
with its stated climate action goals.
While Amazon has made signiﬁcant eﬀorts to address climate change across its
operations and as adopted ambitious climate goals, the company's retirement plan
is at the same time, quietly directing over $650 million of employee savings into oil,
coal-ﬁred utilities, and agribusinesses involved in deforestation, thus creating
cognitive dissonance, reputational risk, and potentially lowering returns for
employees.
The brand damage of having the company say one thing and do another is
important to measure and understand. The ﬁnancial risk of high carbon investing can
destroy shareholder value. Fiduciary duty requires that retirement plans be
administered in the interest of plan participants.
Fiduciary duty means incorporating an assessment of material climate risk when
selecting plan options, by oﬀering only a single sustainable plan option that may or
may not suﬃciently reduce carbon risk. The company its failing as ﬁduciary. This may
also make it more diﬃcult to retain employees who are increasingly concerned
about catastrophic climate impacts.
We've seen Amazon employees across the world come together to publicly call on
the company to demand climate action. It is only a matter of time until these same
employees discover that Amazon is directing their hard-earned savings into
companies that are burning down the Amazon. Amazon's climate goal of net zero by
2040 has positioned the company with a strong, sustainable vision for the future.
By becoming the world's largest purchaser of renewable energy, Amazon has also
shown it as willing to take climate action. Amazon now has an incredible opportunity
to reduce climate-related ﬁnancial risks for plan participants and address
misalignment with the company's climate goals. This is not a diﬃcult change toFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Thank you. Cathy Rowan [ph] will now introduce proposal number six, requesting a
report on customer due diligence. Miss Rowan has prerecorded the following
statement.
{BIO 19900448 <GO>}
Good afternoon, Amazon board members, employees, and fellow shareholders. My
name is Cathy Rowan, the Corporate Responsibility Coordinator for Maryknoll
Sisters, a long-term shareholder and co-ﬁler of the customer due diligence proposal
led by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Brentwood.
The aid institutions who ﬁled this proposal are faith-based members of the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility. Proposal six requests a report assessing
Amazon's customer due diligence process to determine whether use of its products
and services with surveillance, computer vision, or cloud storage capabilities,
contribute to human rights violations.
This proposal received over 30% support from Amazon shareholders over the last
two years. We, again oﬀer this proposal to encourage the company to meaningfully
assess the impacts of its high-risk technologies and contracts with government
agencies, and strengthened due diligence processes in areas where there are gaps
in order to prevent future harms.
Recognition facial analysis tools, the use of ring security footage by police
departments, and Amazon web services hosting of the department of Homeland
Security's biometric database are all examples of products and services with actual
and potential adverse impacts on human rights and civil liberties, particularly for
black, indigenous, and people of color, and immigrant communities.
Internationally, business relationships linked to the expansion of state surveillance in
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China, Palestine, and the United Arab
Emirates put Amazon at risk of contributing to human rights violations. Inadequate
due diligence at the contract vetting stage and throughout the life of contracts likely
to cause such severe harms exposes Amazon to legal, regulatory, and reputational
risks. I hereby move proposal six and ask for your support. Thank you.

Conrad MacKerron{BIO 19774246 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Jennifer Bates. I'm here to present ballot proposal
number seven on behalf of Oxfam America and co-followers. The proposal calls on
Amazon to consider hourly [ph] associates as candidates for the board of directors. I
work at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. A few years ago, few people
had heard of Bessemer.
But today you've probably heard of our eﬀorts to organize the union. We'll go met
with ﬁerce and unlawful interference by company management, bombarding us with
antiunion meetings, antiunion texts, posters, and videos that either put antiunion
messages in the bathroom stalls. The NLRB rules that their interference were illegal.
We have just held our second election.
A month ago, our fellow workers in New York succeeded in forming Amazon's ﬁrst
union vote in history. I can assure you that this is only the beginning because we
were tired of Amazon, not listening to his workers and treating us if we weren't
disposable.
Amazon should listen because we're speaking up about grueling hours,
backbreaking, physical labor, fears about taking time oﬀ task, discipline by
algorithm, and a management team that does not care. This is not a good look for
the company because the media, the public and lawmakers, they are listening. The
need for worker representation on the Amazon board is greater than ever today. It
will create a sea change opening doors for management to understand our needs,
learn from our experiences, and work with us to build a better and more successful
company.
Vote yes on proposal number seven. We can make sure the leadership understands
its most important asset. The workers, this is one step among many that are needed,
but a vital one. I thank you.

Thank you. Conrad MacKerron will now introduce proposal number eight,
requesting a report on packaging materials. Mr. MacKerron has prerecorded the
following statement.
Good morning. I'm Conrad MacKerron, Senior Vice President of As You Sow,
representing Sarah Sackner [ph], the shareholder who ﬁled proposal eight on the
Amazon proxy. Plastic pollution has become an international environmental crisis
drawing top of mind attention from governments and citizens.
Public concerns about plastic pollution now rivals that of climate change. The
scientiﬁc community has warned that plastic pollution may be nearing an irreversibleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

at least 10 times higher than the market price of plastics.
At the heart of the plastic pollution problem, our single-use plastics, which make up
the largest part of the 11 million tons that ﬂow into oceans annually. Without drastic
action, this rate is set to triple by 2040. Plastic pollution fatally impacts more than
800 marine species causing up to $2.5 trillion in damage annually to marine
ecosystems.
Amazon's substantial and growing use of plastic packaging exposes the company to
increase ﬁnancial and reputational risk. Our proposal asks Amazon to report on how
it could reduce plastic use in alignment with the ﬁndings of an authoritative report
by Pew Charitable Trusts, which concluded that retailers need to cut plastic use by
one-third to achieve an 80% reduction in ocean plastic pollution by 2040. The
company lags its peers and addressing this problem.
Amazon has not taken basic actions such as disclosing the amount of plastic it uses
or committed to cuts in plastic use as competing retailers like Target and Walmart
have done. A recent report by the nonproﬁt group, Oceana, estimated that Amazon
generated nearly 600 million pounds of ecommerce plastic packaging in 2020.
The company says it did not use that much plastic, but has to (inaudible) client
should disclose how much ecommerce plastic it does use. I moved proposal eight
and ask for your support. The information requested will help investors assess the
extent of the company's exposure to plastic pollution and encourage it to step up
and match its peers by committing to signiﬁcant cuts in plastic use. Thank you.

Thank you. As New York City Comptroller, I am presenting proposal nine on behalf of
the New York City pension funds with Amazon shares valued at more than $2.5
billion. Amazon's warehouse workers are injured more frequently and severely than a
non-Amazon warehouses.
The company has not disputed these ﬁndings while Amazon's proxy statement tells
lower injury rates in the U.S. in 2020. Those rates reportedly rose 20% in 2021 and
surge 64% here in New York. Amazon's injury and illness rates may have a more
pronounced impact on the health long-term earnings and career potential if it's
racially and ethnically diverse warehouse employees.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Michael ConnorThat's why we've made our case to shareholders to vote for proposal nine to provide
investors with transparency into how Amazon evaluates the adverse impacts of its
health and safety practices on these employees. That's why we've earned
shareholders to join us in voting against Directors McGrath and Huttenlocher, long-
time members of the boards Leadership Development and Compensation
Committee who we believe have failed to provide independent oversight of human
capital management on behalf of shareholders.
Today I also want to speak directly to the board. As shareholders, we elect you to
ensure that company management protects workers health and safety, to address
unsustainable employee turnover, to uphold Amazon's policies on human rights,
including freedom of association. We do not have conﬁdence that you are doing that
job.
You have failed to provide adequate independent oversight of Amazon's human
capital management as evidenced by those injury and turnover rates, and by
repeated interference with Amazon's employees eﬀorts to exercise their rights to
freedom of association
Amazon is one of the most inﬂuential companies in the world. Your leadership or
your lack of leadership matters to the well-being of millions of households to the
company's bottom line and to long-term value for shareholders. What will you do to
show us that you will hold management accountable? Thank you.
{BIO 5884426 <GO>}
Thank you. Michael Connor will now introduce proposal number 10, requesting
additional reporting on risks associated with the use of certain contract clauses. Mr.
Connor has prerecorded the following statement.
{BIO 5963078 <GO>}
Good morning. My name is Michael Connor. I am here to move item number 10 on
behalf of Whistle Stop Capital. The proposal requests that Amazon's board of
directors publish a report assessing the potential risks to the company associated
with its use of concealment clauses, in the context of harassment, discrimination, and
other unlawful acts. Concealment clauses are deﬁned as any employment or post-
employment agreement that Amazon asks employees or contractors to sign, which
would limit their ability to discuss unlawful acts in the workplace, including
harassment and discrimination. We believe support for this resolution is warranted,
given that Amazon has not yet complied with this request. Amazon's practices
appear to lag its peers.
The use of concealment clauses creates an unknown level of risk for investors.
Investors beneﬁt from accountability systems within companies. The use of
concealment clauses can undermine beneﬁcial diversity and inclusion programs.
Amazon argues in its opposition statement that the proposal is unnecessary because
of disclosures it made in a blog post published by the company last January.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 8 of 32David Zapolsky
Paul ChesserThe blog posts, which the company estimates, will take three minutes to read, barely
longer than my comments this morning, neither shows that Amazon prevents all uses
of concealment clauses nor satisﬁes the essential objective of the proposal by
providing a full understanding of the risks.
Further, the blog post does not reference the company's use of concealment clauses
with contractors. Amazon's business model depends on large numbers of
contractors, which include reportedly more than 150,000 delivery drivers employed
by independently owned companies in eight countries.
Using concealment clauses for contractors can prevent shareholders from getting an
accurate understanding of what's really happening in the workplace, representing a
considerable risk for investors. For all these reasons, we ask shareholders to vote for
item number 10 regarding the use of concealment clauses. Thank you.
{BIO 5884426 <GO>}
Thank you. Paul Chesser will now introduce proposal number 11, requesting a report
on charitable contributions. Mr. Chesser has prerecorded the following statement.
I'm Paul Chesser, Director of the Corporate Integrity Project for National Legal and
Policy Center. Two minutes is ridiculously short to present a proposal, so visit
nlpc.org to read more about our Amazon resolution. Amazon's transparency about
this charitable donations is vague at best and opaque at worst. We know almost
nothing about the amounts that has donated to causes that are destructive to our
nation. But we do know one scandalous group Amazon donated to.
In June, 2020 during the height of the nationwide urban riots following the death of
George Floyd, Amazon Chairman and Chief Jeﬀ Bezos responded to a customer
who stated that all lives matter by saying unbelievably that he disagreed with them.
Representing the company, Bezos said in part, “Black lives matter speaks to racism
and the disproportionate risk that black people face in our law enforcement and
justice system.”
And Bezos added that, “My stance won't change.” Well two years later an Amazon
stance has changed, removing BLM from the Amazon Smile Program. Who knows
how many millions of the company wasted on the BLM organization. But now
leadership, at least partially sees this Marxist Group, and indeed, this phony Marxist
defund the police movement for what it is.
My organization exposed the fraud that is BLM showing that its leaders collected
tens of millions of dollars from white guilt donations by corporations like Amazon,
which the BLM grifters then spent on several multimillion dollar mansions.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Father Séamus Finn. I'm here this morning to represent the Missionary Oblates of
Mary Immaculate and the UIP Trust [ph]. With the greater (inaudible) pension fund
have presented resolution number 12 with the support of investors with $3.5 trillion
in assets.
In the 21st century, the issues of transparency, accountability, and accuracy in regular
reporting by public corporates has attractive new levels of scrutiny by those who rely
on this information as they decide what companies to include in their portfolios.
The stability and security of the global ﬁnancial system is dependent on the legal
standards and rules that have been established in numerous jurisdictions and
adapted by organizations all over the world.
As the world continues to face serious challenges, such as pandemics and social and
environmental catastrophes, conﬁdence in many long standing institutions that we
have relied on, including those that operate in the ﬁnancial sector is at its lowest in
generations. Marshaling [ph] the commitments and the resources to respond to
these challenges is everyone's responsibility, including public corporations, like our
company, Amazon.
The resolution that we have presented is grounded on legal, moral, and ethical
foundations that were designed to promote and protect the common good, serve to
foster prosperity, and support the well-ordered functioning of societies for centuries.
Responsible and sustainable corporations should want to have a reputation for
doing their fair share to make such a vision or reality. Instead, Amazon has been
named as one of the handful of companies. We have worked to sustain the eﬀorts to
reform the global tax regulatory system. Tax avoidance negatively impacts
communities, increases risks to investors.

Here's the bottom line. I am a loyal Amazon worker who liked shareholders got a
harebrained who wants our company to succeed. That is why I am pleased to be the
interim vice president of the Amazon labor union, representing thousands of
workers who voted overwhelmingly to have a union, despite a massive antiunion
disinformation and have asked my campaign by Amazon management. It should
have required such as the visits and acrimonious ﬁght. Amazon management wasted
millions of dollars on entire union consultants. It all backﬁred. What a waste of time
and money. Other successful companies across the world, like Kroger, UPS, Kaiser,
Ford, General Motors, and many others make boatloads of money while respecting
their workers rights to organize a union and express their freedom of association.
I probably wouldn't be here today. Shareholders, were conﬁdent that the board was

will join us in condemning and setting down the higher with expensive antiunion

David Zapolskyconsistent with the interest of shareholders.
Amazon fails to provide an annual report detailing its lobbying payments by
individual states, trade associations, and social welfare groups. Thanks to federal
disclosure requirements, we know that Amazon spent nearly $19 million on federal
lobbying in the year 2020, and was the largest corporate spender for the ﬁrst half of
2021. However far less clear are the sums Amazon is spending to lobby at the state
level or through its support of nearly 250 third-party groups that in turn, engage in
lobbying. This includes trade associations and social welfare groups.
This lack of disclosure presents reputational risks when it's lobbying contradicts
company public positions. For example, while Amazon strives to be the earth's best
employer, it attracted attention for hiring lobbyists that worked for trade associations
opposing unions. While Amazon publicly embraced corporate tax hikes, it lobbied to
preserve its tax breaks and has drawn scrutiny for avoiding federal income taxes.

David ZapolskyThank you. Isaiah Thomas will now introduce proposal number 16, requesting a
report on warehouse working conditions. Mr. Thomas has prerecorded the following
statement.
Good morning. My name is Isaiah Thomas. I am a current Amazon warehouse
employee. I'm speaking on behalf of resolution number 16, requesting that the
board of directors commissioned an independent audit of Amazon's warehouse
working conditions.
While Amazon pledged to improve safety, and Jeﬀ Bezos promised to make Amazon
the earth safest place to work, the injury rate at Amazon facilities increased by 20% in
just one year alone. But Amazon safety report claim their injury rate went down.
Amazon's warehouses are more high pressure and dramatically more dangerous
than any other warehouses.
Would you want to work in a place where you're constantly watched through
surveillance, or given physically unsustainable quotas, or where you're punished for
not working fast enough? This is what it's like to work for Amazon and all of the ads
up to an abusive production system, which according to one headline, is maiming its
employees. Bezosism is a term invented to describe the way Amazon uses
technology to squeeze performance out of workers. It is ruthless and it's the reason
three U.S. states have had to introduce new bills to regulate warehouse quotas.
Amazon's ﬂagship warehouse recently received as fourth safety violation in the past
year. It was classiﬁed as a willful violation. A willful violent is only issued when a
company operates with intentional disregard or plain indiﬀerence for employees
safety or federal law. Meanwhile, every 11.5 seconds, Jeﬀ Bezos makes the equivalent
of one year salary of his lowest paid worker.
His fortune is built oﬀ the backs of his workers. Maybe that's why Amazon has an
estimated employee turnover rate of over 150% shareholders. You'll have to apply
for a warehouse job at this rate. Investors love to think about their returns, but what
about the safety of the people who helped you get those returns? I'm asking you as
an Amazon worker to vote in favor of item 16.

Page 13 of 32Jennifer LeeAs investors, we have worked with many companies, including Amazon, pressing
them to disclose pay data. In fact, this is the ﬁfth year we have ﬁled this proposal. Yet,
Amazon continues to tell only half the story limiting its closures to statistically
adjusted pay data that compares how minorities and women are paid for the same
roles as their white male peers.
That data does not account for who holds what jobs, ignoring the structural racism
and sexism that relegates people of color and women into low-paying job
categories. Our proposal asks for medium pay data so investors can understand how
money is allocated at Amazon by demographic. Medium pay data shows us quite
literally how companies assign value to their employees, through the roles they
inhabit and the pay they receive. It also provides an adjustable data point for
investor to access how the company stacks up to peers and makes progress over
time.
Peers that are showing leadership and a commitment to publish medium pay data
include Starbucks, Best Buy, Target, Adobe, and Microsoft. They are not hiding
behind statistically massaged data because they know that by being transparent,
they are creating a new standard for accountability and performance.
I am frustrated to say that Amazon is not one of those companies, despite its stated
commitment to diversity and inclusion. I am surprised that given where we are as a
country with paid divides that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, and the
protests of whole black lives that Amazon is ﬁghting the simple and reasonable
request. Thank you for your support of transparent fulsome and honest pay equity
accounting.

My name is Jennifer Lee here on behalf of the ACLU of Washington and the Tech

privacy and civil rights, and unfairly target or surveil people of color, immigrants, and
activists here in the U.S., and racial, religious, ethnic, political, and LGBTQ+ groups
around the world.
Nearly 70 organizations have asked Amazon to stop selling recognition, citing its role

race, ethnicity, religion, identity, and political beliefs. Face surveillance technology is
rife with racial and gender biases, and has led to the wrongful arrest of at least three
black men. But even if facial recognition operated accurately across race and
gender, it's used kills our democracy in our civil liberties, by allowing for
indiscriminate dragnet surveillance of the entire population.
This technology will also continue to be used disproportionately to surveil
marginalized communities, further entrenching systemic racism, exacerbating
inequities, and resulting in life or death encounters with police.
Recognizing that facial recognition harms everyone's civil liberties, at least 24 U.S.
jurisdictions have adopted bans on government use of this technology, including in
King County, Washington where Amazon is headquartered. In 2020, Amazon placed
a partial moratorium on sale of facial recognition to police. But this moratorium does
not address sales to other agencies or to governments outside of the U.S. with a
history of human rights abuses.
We urge shareholders to support proposal 19 as a ﬁrst step in protecting our
democracy and our liberties here in the U.S. and around the world.

Thank you. Daniel Olayiwola will now introduce a nonbinding proposal, requesting
that the company and the use of productivity expectations and workplace
monitoring. Shareholders can vote on this proposal if properly introduced by typing
4 against or abstain in the text box that appears on the meeting website under the
caption, other business, and clicking the Submit button. Mr. Olayiwola has
prerecorded the following statement.
Hello, federal shareholders. My name is Daniel Olayiwola. I've been an Amazon
employer for four years. I'm speaking today to introduce a resolution that seeks to
end Amazon's injury crisis. Everyday Amazon workers like me are injured on the job,
whether you're a driver, a picker, a steelwork. When you work for Amazon, you put
your health and safety on the line every single ship. OSHA records have shown that
Amazon's workplace injury rates are well above national aggregate.
And these injuries have been linked to Amazon's productivity quarters and
surveillance practices, where theyre called rate and time oﬀ task or going by another
name, Amazon workers are pushed to their limits by policies that set the pace of
work and monitor their movements. As a result, people are getting hurt.
I have personally felt the physical toll of working for Amazon. I have seen my
coworkers work themselves to exhaustion. I know the stories of workers getting
injured, contracting COVID-19, or even dying while working at Amazon. I'm not the
only one taking notice. The injury crisis that Amazon has even drawn the attention ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Unidentiﬁed Speakerlegislators, regulators, shareholders, and the public. Amazon itself acknowledged
the problem when Jeﬀ Bezos committed the company to being the earth safest
place to work.
Despite this, the injury rate at Amazon actually went up last year. I'm speaking up
because something has to change. Amazon owes its success to its employees, but
the company's directors and management have failed to protect them. That's why
I'm introducing my resolution because without workers, Amazon collapses.
Therefore, be resolved shareholders of amazon.com request that the company, and
the use of productivity quotas, and worker surveillance across its warehouse facilities
and distribution network, including, but not limited to the policies commonly known
as rate and time oﬀ task.
These policies are to be ended for all Amazon employees, including the drivers for
delivery service partners and other third-party contracted employees by August 31st,
2022. Thank you.

Thank you. The company recommends that shareholders vote against this
shareholder proposal. The proxy statement for this meeting explains the reasons for
the company's recommendation against each of the shareholder proposals
appearing in the proxy statement. We have received some questions regarding the
proposals. Thank you for those questions. In response, I invite you to review the
board statement and recommendation as applicable on each of the proposals as set
forth in the company's proxy statement.
This concludes the presentation of the proposals. The polls are now closed on all
proposals. The formal portion of this meeting is now adjourned. Based on
preliminary voting results, each nominee for director received a majority of the votes
cast for such nominees election. So all 11 nominees have been duly elected.

Hello, everyone. I'm Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's Chief Financial Oﬃcer. Today I'll be
providing a recap of our 2021 ﬁnancial results in business highlights, which will be
followed by presentations from Dilip Kumar who heads up our physical retail and
technology team. Catherine Buell who'll provide an update on the Amazon housing
equity fund, and Ofori Agboka from our people experienced in technology team.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 17 of 32This will be followed by investor Q&A with our CEO, Andy Jassy. Let's start with our
ﬁnancial results for 2021.
Sales were $470 billion, which is up 22% year over year or 21% excluding foreign
exchange. This compares to 37% growth excluding foreign exchange in 2020, which
was fueled by pandemic-related lockdowns and a sharp increase in online shopping
globally. Note, our revenue growth rate in 2019 before the pandemic was 22%
excluding foreign exchange. In 2021, our consumer business continued to see strong
customer demand and sales throughout the year, even as the economy opened
back up and consumer demand returned to pre-pandemic patterns.
Prime members in particular continue to rely on us for their shopping and
entertainment needs. Here, we see the 2021 sales and sales growth by business
segment. North America revenues grew to $280 billion up 18% year over year.
International revenue grew to $128 billion up 22% year over year or 20% excluding
foreign exchange. And AWS revenues grew to $62 billion up 37% year over year. This
represents the 700 basis point acceleration and growth rate when compared to
2020 as developers and enterprises continue to look to AWS as a preferred
technology provider.
In 2021, operating income was $25 billion up 9% or 8% excluding foreign exchange.
2020 and 2021 were both disruptive years due to the pandemic. But 2021 in
particular was a challenging cost year as well. We started to see additional costs from
new operations capacity that we're bringing online to serve as high pandemic
demand levels. The back half of 2021, we saw a new costs from labor shortages,
which caused us to run less eﬃciently in our operations.
Additionally, we felt the eﬀects of inﬂation throughout our business, including wage
and fuel increases. As a result of these factors, we started to see our operating
income trend down as the year progressed. These challenges have continued into
2022.
And we're working hard to return our operations to their pre pandemic eﬃciency
levels. While we navigate these costs challenges, the customer facing fundamentals
of our retail business remains strong. We worked very hard to minimize the impact to
customers. Throughout this period, we've all seen good tailwinds to proﬁtability.
Advertising growth has remained strong. It allows sellers and brands to better reach
our customers and enables customers to better discover new selection. And AWS
performance continues to be driven by a broad-based customers and a steady
increase in the number of new products and services. At the same time, the AWS
team continues to innovate in ways that drive eﬃciencies and reduce costs across
the business.
Cash ﬂow is our most important long-term ﬁnancial output metric. Let's ﬁrst look at
operating cash ﬂow, which represents cash generated by the business before
factoring in capital investments.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 18 of 32For 2021, operating cash ﬂow was $46 billion down 30% year over year. Similar to
what we discussed with sales and operating income, 2020 was a period of
unprecedented growth, which created challenging comparisons year over year in
2021. During the peak periods of the pandemic in 2020 and early 2021, operating
cash ﬂow beneﬁted from supercharged working capital eﬀect, has high consumer
demand meant that we're turning our inventory much faster than normal.
Starting in Q2 of 2021, we returned to more normalized customer demand patterns.
This slide shows our free cash ﬂow. Free cash ﬂow is what remains of our operating
cash ﬂow after we invest in capital expenditures. In 2021, this free cash ﬂow is an
outﬂow of $14 billion. This was driven by the lower operating cash ﬂow previously
discussed, as well as increased capital expenditures. Here, you can see the ﬁve-year
trend in capital investments.
In 2021, we invested over $72 billion. We continue to invest meaningfully to support
the growth we're seeing across our businesses. This included ongoing investment in
our fulﬁllment and transportation networks where over the past two years, we nearly
doubled our operations capacity, something that previously took 25 years to build.
We continue to invest in AWS infrastructure where we've added regions and
capacity to support our robust growth.
Here's a high level breakdown of our capital investments over the last few years.
Roughly 40% are driven by infrastructure with AWS, the leading contributor. This
includes investing in data centers, which house the servers and networking
equipment. About 30% is driven by fulﬁllment center capacity expansion.
The next 25% is related to transportation capacity and the building out of our
Amazon logistics network globally. The remaining 5% is corporate real estate and
other similar projects. As we now look to 2022, these investments put us in a good
position to continue our expansion of primes fast delivery oﬀering and support the
rapid growth in innovation we are seeing within AWS.
Next, let's talk about the consumer business, starting with our Prime program. Prime
means, quarter [ph] emission of being earth's most customer centric company. Prime
is available in 24 countries.
And there are now more than 200 million paid Prime members around the world.
Prime member engagement remain strong across our growing catalog of Prime
beneﬁts. We see increasing use of our grocery delivery and digital beneﬁts, as well
as one day delivery and compared to pre pandemic levels.
Prime is consistently high member renewal rates across geographies. This year Prime
day will take place in July in more than 20 countries. This is Amazon's big annual
shopping event where Prime members will be able to save on products from
national brands and small businesses across every category.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 19 of 32We continue to innovate and invest in fast, free, and convenient delivery for our
customers around the world, including free one day delivery, which is available on
millions of items coast-to-coast, and free same day delivery available in more than
90 metro areas in the United States. Here, you see one of our new Rivian delivery
vans. We expect to have over 100,000 of these electric vehicles delivering packages
to you by 2030.
As I just mentioned, Prime video is one of the Prime beneﬁts, which drives member
adoption, retention and engagement. In 2021, over 200 million prime members,
worldwide stream shows and movies, including live sports and Amazon originals.
We continue to add great new content, including the upcoming Lord of the Rings
Series, The Rings of Power and the inaugural season of Thursday Night Football.
Both these shows will debut on Prime in September. We also recently completed our
acquisition of MGM, a century old studio with more than 4,000 ﬁlm titles, 17,000 TV
episodes, 180 Academy Awards, and 100 Emmy Awards. We look forward to working
with MGM to create even more opportunities to deliver quality storytelling for our
customers.
Next, let's talk about our third-party sellers in our retail marketplace. Third-party
sellers remain a key contributor to the strength of our oﬀering for consumers. And as
of Q1, 2022, represent more than half of all our units sold on them.
To reach more shoppers, we are also seeing strong adoption of advertising services
and a range of free tools that help sellers surface relevant products to customers,
including Amazon Posts, which allows sellers to share shoppable lifestyle and
product content, and Amazon Live, where sellers can showcase products and
features through interactive shoppable videos.
Our teams at Amazon remain committed to sellers, building their brands by
improving usability, providing relevant and engaging ad experiences, and
developing measurement and analytics tools that provide actionable insights for
sellers. The growth in our consumer business could not have been possible without
our dynamic tech infrastructure powered and supported by AWS.
The scale of AWS has global infrastructure footprint delivers advanced, reliable, and
secure cloud services that millions of customers can depend on, no matter their size
or their changing needs. With our customers need to deploy their application
workloads across the globe in a single click, or they want to build and deploy
speciﬁc applications closer to their end users with single digit millisecond latency,
AWS provides customers with the cloud infrastructure where and when they need it.
AWS currently has 84 availability zones in 26 geographic regions, with 24 more

well as third-party stores. At Amazon, we're always looking for ways to makeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

Page 21 of 32Catherine Buellcustomers' lives better. Passion for invention is one of a four guiding principles. And
Amazon's employees are constantly creating large and small inventions.
Several years ago, our physical retail team asked ourselves, how we could make the
physical shopping experience better for customers, and add unique value in a space
that was pretty well-served on many dimensions? We concluded that while there
were many great aspects of physical shopping, there was an opportunity to make in-
person shopping trips faster and more eﬀortless with technologies like Just Walk
Out, the Amazon Dash Cart, and Amazon One. I'm excited to look back at what
we've delivered for customers this past year.
As many of you know, we opened the ﬁrst Amazon Go store to the public in Jan
2018. In 2021, we expanded Just Walk Outs capabilities to scale the full-sized grocery
stores, 40,000 square feet, including Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market.
Today there are more than two dozen Amazon Fresh stores in the U.S. and U.K. that
use Just Walk Out technology alongside the 20 plus Amazon Go stores in the U.S.
We opened the second Whole Foods Market store with Just Walk Out technology in
March this year.
We also build the Amazon Dash Cart that uses computer vision algorithms and
sensors that detect as customers add items to their cart. When a customer's ready to
check out, all they have to do is exit the store to the dash cart claim, and the credit
card associated with their Amazon account is charged.
As another example, we continue to expand Amazon One, a palm recognition
service we launched in September, 2020 as an entry or payment method at Go
stores, Amazon Fresh, and Select Whole Food store. Over the past year, we've
equipped more than a dozen third-party location, such as Climate Pledge Arena, TD
Garden, or travel retailers like Hudson and WHSmith with Just Walk Out technology,
Amazon One, or a combination of both.
In early 2022, we announced Amazon Style, our ﬁrst ever physical apparel store that
oﬀers a personalized convenient shopping experience that makes it easy for
customers to ﬁnd styles they love at great prices. We continue to see a lot of
potential application for Just Walk Out technology and Amazon One. Last
November, Amazon Go and Starbucks announced the launch of Starbucks pickup
with Amazon Go in New York City that brings together the connection and comfort
of a Starbucks café and convenience of Amazon Gos Just Walk Out shopping
experience.
There's a saying an Amazon that it's still day one. And 2021 was a busy year for us.
And 2022 is already oﬀ to an exciting start. The possibilities to reimagine in-store
shopping are endless. I'm excited to see where the year ahead takes us.

Page 22 of 32Thank you. Dilip. It's an honor to be here today speaking with shareholders from
around the world. At Amazon, we believe that all people should have access to
housing they can aﬀord. We are using our scale and reach as a large employer to
support innovative aﬀordable housing initiatives in the communities we call home.
And we believe that private and public sectors can work together to address the
aﬀordable housing challenges that people are facing across the U.S. That's why we
launched the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, a $2 billion commitment to create and
preserve aﬀordable housing in our hometown communities. The Puget Sound
Region of Washington State, the Arlington, Virginia, and Washington DC region, and
Nashville, Tennessee.
We are helping those in need while also emphasizing our commitment to equity and
inclusion. Low-income and minority families are disproportionately aﬀected by an
aﬀordable housing shortage in the United States. We need diverse perspectives and
the housing conversation to come up with lasting solutions.
Our fund takes a multipronged approach. We oﬀer low-rate loans, and grants to
public agencies, and mission-driven partners to help unlock and accelerate
aﬀordable housing initiatives, we team up with local governments and agencies on
inclusive and innovative solutions, and we provide grants to support community-
based organizations, traditional and nontraditional public agencies, and
organizations led by people of color.
The Amazon housing equity funds speciﬁcally targets to help low to moderate
income households, earning 30% to 80% of area median income.
These are the members of our communities who serve as ﬁrst responders, teachers,
healthcare workers, and others who don't qualify for subsidies, but whose wages
haven't kept pace with escalating rents. Here are a couple of ways we are inventing
lasting solutions. This past year, we teamed up with three public transit agencies to
help build 3,000 new aﬀordable homes near high capacity transit stations.
To date, more than 1,000 aﬀordable units are in diﬀerent phases of connection. The
Amazon housing equity fund awarded over $21 million in grants to pilot an
accelerator program, which oﬀers free professional training, mentorship, and access
to capital funding to help lower barriers real estate developers of color, who are
focused on aﬀordable housing and inclusive community building, as well as to
increase the diverse pool of ﬁrms and all three of the funds priority communities.
As of March 2022, 14 months post-launch, we have protected and created more than
8,000 aﬀordable homes that will house more than 18,000 people. Nearly one
quarter of whom are children.
In one year alone, Amazon helped to increase the long-term multifamily aﬀordable
housing stock by 20% in Bellevue, Washington, and by 22% in Arlington, Virginia.

President of People, Experience & Technology for Global Operations.
Thank you, Catherine. And hello, everyone. The safety and wellbeing of our teams
are Amazon's highest priorities. This includes fostering a diverse equitable and
inclusive workplace where all perspectives are heard. At Amazon, we've navigated
unprecedented times together, rising above challenges through innovation and
investing in our people. I want to tell you today about two programs, Welcome Door
and Career Choice that show how seriously we take the challenge to be better
everyday.
Through the Welcome Door program, we provide direct support for immigrants and
refugees who have left their homelands and help them to reestablish themselves to
start a new with great jobs and support. For these employees, language barriers and
scarce resources can often mean experience gaps in their careers.
Without assistance to get back on track professionally, these gaps become setbacks.
The Welcome Door program helps immigrants and refugees in many ways, including
a citizenship assistance portal, reimbursement for employee authorization document
renewal fees, free legal resources to help navigate immigration-related questions,
and access to skills, training, beneﬁts-like career choice.
A good job is one of the most impactful ways for refugees to build a new life. We're
excited to welcome these new Amazonians to the team. Now, let me expand more
on how we've enhanced Career Choice. We want our employees to maximize their
full potential in education and in their careers inside or outside of Amazon.
As part of our announcement to increase the company's upskilling 2025 pledge, we
are proud that the Career Choice program provides full prepaid tuition to
employees as they pursue a bachelor's degree, earn industry certiﬁcations leading
to in demand jobs, or build skills through English language proﬁciency and high
school completion programs. To make this oﬀering even stronger, we've partnered
with four national nonproﬁts in 140 local universities and colleges to deliver high
quality education to our hourly workforce in the United States.
Underpinning the success of initiatives like Welcome Door and Career Choice is
Amazon's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Having diﬀerent voices
around the table means, we are engaging in dialogues that challenge our own
points of view.
While these conversations can be uncomfortable, they show us where we have room
to grow. Last fall, we were delighted to welcome Candi Castleberrys Amazon's Vice
President of Global Diversity Equity and Inclusion to lead this organizational growth,
ensuring an equitable and inclusive culture is something we all own. Through Candi

Thanks Angie. Hi, I'm Andy Jassy. Today is the 25th annual shareholder meeting for
Amazon, but it's the ﬁrst one I've had the honor of attending as CEO. So thank you
for taking the time to join us today. I'd like to put business aside for a moment
before we move into the Q&A portion of the meeting. Yesterday in Texas, 19 children
ad 2 teachers lost their lives in a senseless act of violence. And 11 days ago, 10
people were shot to death at a supermarket in Buﬀalo.
I know that I speak for all of us at Amazon when I say how deeply saddened we are
by these tragedies. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims and anyone
directly or indirectly aﬀected. I can only hope that we come together as a country to
ﬁnd a way to stop this kind of tragic violence in the future.
There's no easy way to transition to the next portion of the meeting, but I'll do my
best. I want to start by thanking our more than 1.6 million employees for all their hard
work during the pandemic. I'm proud of the incredible commitment and eﬀort from
our employees all over the world.
Throughout the pandemic customer obsession has remained central to everything
we do. As we've been faced with the choice of optimizing short-term proﬁts or doing
what's best for customers in the company in the long-term, we've consistently
chosen the customer. You can see this in all aspects of our business, especially our
large existing businesses. Our consumer business has grown 23% annually over the
last two years with extraordinary growth in 2020 of 39% year over year, that require
us to make very substantial investments that we hadn't planned to make us fast.
For instance, we had built a very signiﬁcant size fulﬁllment network in our ﬁrst 25
years as a company that we had to double during the pandemic in just 24 months.
We also had to nearly double the size of our workforce.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25
Amazon.com Inc (AMZN US Equity)
Page 25 of 32As capacity and labor constraints have recently eased, we've been working to
address cost pressures related to inﬂation and the wider economy, productivity in
our operations network and ﬁxed cost leverage. Today we are focused on reducing
our cost structure by improving our productivity, growing into our capacity, and
identifying opportunities to mitigate ongoing costs. We have eﬀectively lowered our
cost structure before. I have high conﬁdence that we'll get back on track as we work
through these incredibly unusual past two years.
In AWS, we grew at 34% annually over the last two years and 37% year over year in
the First Quarter, as the breadth and depth of our services helped millions of
companies accelerate their move to the cloud. As 95% of the world's IT spend is still
on premises and not in the cloud, our opportunity here remains large.
We are also seeing strong growth in areas such as Amazon advertising, where it's still
early days, and we've only just begun working on solutions and streaming grocery
and devices. We see high future potential in our investments in areas like Prime
video and entertainment more broadly, Alexa and devices, Grocery, Kuiper and
Zoox. I believe it remains very early days for what we can invent for customers.
There's a lot to look forward to in the months and years ahead.
We're also focused on making our employee experience better. This is something
I'm passionate about and deeply committed to. I spent a fair bit of time at our
fulﬁllment centers, speaking with our employees about topics like safety. I'm
conﬁdent we will keep improving. We want to improve our workplace every day
every week, every month.
It's why we oﬀer an average starting wage and more than $18 an hour, more than
double the minimum wage. We also oﬀer full healthcare and insurance, paid
parental leave, 401(k) company matching that starts on day one, and we pay for full
college tuition for operations employees if they want to pursue it. It's why we're
spending a lot of energy and resources on safety.
We have about 8,000 people who just work on safety. In 2021, we invested $300
million in safety improvements, such as capital improvements, new safety
technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions. We know
it will take time, but we want to be the best in the industry.
We're also committed to and invested in building a sustainable future for our
employees, customers, and communities. We are on a path to power operations with
100% renewable energy by 2025. We are the world's largest corporate purchaser of
renewable energy. We cofounded, and we're the ﬁrst signatory of the Climate
Pledge, a commitment to reach net-carbon zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris

Puget Sound Arlington and Nashville regions. Last, I spoke about in my shareholder
letter, how with every business we pursue, we're constantly experimenting and
inventing.
We believe customer experiences can always be better. We are relentlessly
debating, iterating, and tinkering to take the seeds of big ideas and make them into
things that resonate with customers over a long period of time. Amazon ﬁrst set out
our long-term approach in our 1997 shareholder letter. What's written there is as true
today as it was in 1997. With that, I look forward to taking your questions.
Questions And Answers
Thanks, Andy. We'll now move to our ﬁrst question. What factors are contributing to
recent lower proﬁt in the consumer business? And what steps are you taking to
improve proﬁtability going forward?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well we're very focused on proﬁtability. I'm conﬁdent, we'll get back to a healthy
level of proﬁtability in our consumer business. We're working really hard on it. We've
had some unusual things happen the last couple of years, some more in our control
than others.
The external factors that were maybe a little less than our control really relate to
inﬂation where the costs of (inaudible) haul, and trucking, and ocean, and air, and
fuel have all gone very substantially up. We're working hard to mitigate those costs
wherever we can. Weve built a pre-Scrappy program to recruit alternative logistics
providers, willing to be more aggressive and reasonable on costs.
We absorbed a lot of these costs for sellers for much of the pandemic, really the ﬁrst
two years, hoping costs would attenuated the beginning of 2022. But when the war
and Ukraine hit and the inﬂationary costs continued to go up, we just couldn't keep
absorbing all of those costs and run a business that's proﬁtable and sustainable. So
we pass some of those on to our fulﬁllment by Amazon sellers. We didn't take this
decision lightly. We hate raising costs for our sellers. We're as eager as anybody to
see inﬂationary costs subside.
On the more controllable cost side, let's start with capacity. As I mentioned in my
opening remarks, we doubled our capacity that we'd built in the ﬁrst 25 years of
Amazon in just 24 months. We had to make decisions on when to build the
fulﬁllment centers really a couple years in advance.
It's typically a long lead time, but even longer in COVID. So we made a decision to
build to the high side to avoid constraining consumers and sellers in any way. We
have a number of steps we're taking right now. We're trying to defer building activityFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

A - Andy Jassyand on properties where we just don't need the capacity yet. We're going to let
some leases expire as well. But I'm also quite conﬁdent that we will grow into this
footprint.
On the productivity side, there are a lot of elements here ranging from how we do
inbound, to staging, to productive hours and processes to optimizing our large and
recently fast grown fulﬁllment and transportation networks that weve build. We know
how to work on productivity. We've had several instances, many years in our history,
where we have worked very hard on productivity and improved our productivity.
So we're conﬁdent we'll make progress there as well. So I netted out by saying that
cost is a really big area of focus for us. It's the number one priority for our retail team.
It's something that I'm spending a lot of time on myself as well. We have a lot of
clearly identiﬁed opportunities that we think will improve the situation. I'm conﬁdent
that we'll return to the type of proﬁt -- the healthy proﬁtability and the consumer
business.
The next question is, it seems like you're investing in many unrelated areas from
Alexa to satellites. What's the common denominator for Amazon? And is it a good
use of capital?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well we exist to make our customer's lives better and easier every day and
relentlessly invent to do so. That is the common denominator across all of Amazon's
businesses and across all the customers that we serve, whether you're talking about
consumers, or sellers, or developers, or enterprise, or creators, or brands. We've a
diﬀerent way of looking at new business opportunities than other companies. I'm not
saying it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way.
And when we look at a new opportunity, we asked ourselves a few questions. If we
were successful, could it be big enough to move the needle at Amazon? Is it being
well-served today? Do we have a diﬀerentiated approach? And do we have
competence in that area? And if we don't, can we acquire it quickly? if we like the
answers to those questions, then we will put a single thread of leader and team on it
so they're not distracted by the existing business.
And that process has led to some expansions that seem pretty natural to people.
When I joined the company in 1997, we were a books-only retailer, and we expanded
into music, and video, and electronics, and toys.
And I think those expansions felt natural. I didn't feel as natural at the time. But I think
today they seem pretty natural. But that process has also led us to some investments
that probably seemed less natural to people. AWS is a good example of that, where
people didn't expect an online retailer to build a technology infrastructure platform
in the cloud.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

A - Andy JassyAnd in the early days for several years, people externally and internally really
questioned whether that made sense. But think about what a diﬀerent company
Amazon is today because we invested in and built AWS. So you really have to
evaluate each opportunity on its own. You have to look at what you think the
possible return on invested capital and the upside is for each of these opportunities.
And I'm really optimistic about some of the big bets we're making here. If you look
at Prime video and the entertainment investment we're making, I think we're very
much on the right track there. If you look at Alexa, where we're trying to build the
world's best personal assistant, we obviously have a signiﬁcant amount of traction.
We have over 200 million endpoints that are accessing Alexa. So we're optimistic
about that.
If you look at Kuiper, there's 300 to 400 million people in the world who don't have
the type of connectivity that allows them to leverage the internet and technology like
most of us do today. I think that's a very signiﬁcant opportunity that has some things
that are reminiscent of AWS about it. I think it's very early days for us in Grocery
where I have a lot of optimism. Then I also am excited about our autonomous driving
ride-hailing eﬀort in Zoox given the way that we see automotive consumption
patterns changing.
So it's up to us, at the end of the day to make these investments work. But if any one
of the ones I just mentioned becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of a
marketplace, and Prime, and AWS, we're a diﬀerent company. So I think they're very
worthwhile bet.
Thanks, Andy. Can you please discuss what you're doing to maintain stock value
during this period of stock market downturn?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well I know there's a lot of uncertainty in the market right now. It's impacting a lot of
companies, including Amazon and their associated stock prices. I understand why a
number of people are uneasy. I think it's important to remember that we're going --
we've been through a pretty unusual time, both of you look at the war in Ukraine, as
well as the tumult of the pandemic that force companies like ours to build to a very
unusually large scale in a very short period of time.
But we've always subscribed to Benjamin Graham's theorem that in the short term,
the stock market tends to be a voting machine. In the long-term, it tends to be a
weighing machine. That's because if you do the right thing for customers and the
business over a long period of time, you tend to get the right results.
And so what we've -- we've been in this spot before. We've seen downturns both in
the market and the stock. What we found is if we focus on customers and the right
experience for them, and our cost structure, and making sure we deliver the right
operating income and free cash ﬂow, and remembering that we're trying to build aFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

A - Andy Jassyset of customer experiences in a business and optimizing for making it right over a
long period of time, I think we've delivered very strong results over the last 25 years
for shareholders. I expect that to continue.
Your next question is, there's been a lot of media coverage about safety issues and
high injury rates at Amazon. What are you doing about that?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our teams. We spent a
lot of energy and resource on it across our network. We'll continue to do so. Having
spent some time with the safety data myself, there are a lot of ways you can spend
that data. There are special interest groups that regularly skew them for their own
agenda. But what I would say is a few things. The companies who hired a lot of
people during the pandemic like we did, and there are plenty of others, saw their
incident rates and DART rates, which really time away from your normal job go up.
In our case, we hired about 300,000 people in 2021 alone. Most of whom had never
worked in this type of manual and industrial space and had to be trained. Now, all
the data we have says that the incidence of entry in the ﬁrst six months always as
much higher than thereafter. So when you hire a lot of people, your rates tend to go
up.
When we look at the last comprehensive and veriﬁed safety data from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics or BLS, there are a few macro categories that they -- where we have
people. These are their terms. We have a lot of people in the warehousing category,
a lot of people in the messengers and couriers, and a number of people in the
grocery category.
And if you look at the industry averages versus our numbers, we're a little higher on
warehousing and a little lower on messengers and couriers in grocery. So about
average. But I take no solace in being average. We want to be the best in the
industry.
And this will take us time, especially as we expect the numbers to go up and years
where we're discontinuously hiring as, I mentioned earlier. But I do believe it's
achievable to be the best in the future. I'm focused on it and the team's focused on
it. So there are several things we're doing right now to try to improve,
First of all, we have 8,000 people who are just focused on safety in the company.
We're making meaningful investments in wearables, haptic signals that tell our
teammates when they're pursuing dangerous movements so they can be safer and
how they move around.
We've built a rotational program with pretty sophisticated algorithms that predict
when people doing repetitive actions are about to incur entry, and then moving
them to a diﬀerent activity so that they don't incur that entry. We've delivered newFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

A - Andy Jassyshoes, which provide both toe protection, as well as prevent slipping. We're
continuing to invest in a number of transportation vehicles and technology. We just
roll one out. They cut the accident rate in half.
So there are a number of things that we're doing. We're working really hard on it. But
I won't be happy and the team won't be happy until we're the best in the industry.
And even then, we're not going to be happy because we know there are injuries that
we could be preventing. So we have a lot of work to do here, but you can bet, we're
going to be very focused on it.
How does Amazon plan on building long-term shareholder value by taking care of
its employees better?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
Well I think Amazon is a really unusually compelling place to work for a lot of
diﬀerent reasons. We can just start with the mission. When you have a mission to
make customers' lives better and easier every day and relentlessly event to do so,
that is a really inspiring mission. And by the way we're all customers. Theres so many
companies who say they're going to do that, and very few do it.
And Amazon is unusual that way. Then when you layer on top of it, the fact that
you're not only improving customer's lives, but you get to impact so many customers
because of the scale, which Amazon operates, and the fact that we tend to invest,
and to bet, and to invent, and to move quickly when people have good ideas.
And we tend to be long-term-oriented, and are trying to build something that last all
of us, so we leave a real mark on the world. That's a very compelling set of beneﬁts.
It's part of why Amazon ranks so highly as a place to work, including being number
one in the recent LinkedIn list.
All that said there are for sure areas where I think we can be improving. Ill list a few. I
think when you think about people who leave companies, they tend to leave
managers more than the company itself. We have a very talented group of managers
at Amazon. But we have also grown the number of people at the company the last
ﬁve to 10 years very substantially. With that, the number of managers. Many of whom
we've promoted internally. Some of whom, we've hired externally.
And we have a management training that we have built over time. But we have work
to do to continue to make sure that our managers understand that managing is a
privilege. The number one job for them is making sure that they are developing their
teammates and their employees, so they grow their careers and continue to grow
what they can do for the company and for our customers. So that's an area we'll
continue to focus on.
Then I think there's some fundamentals that you just got to get right that we can
keep working on AI [ph]. I talked about safety earlier, that's a signiﬁcant area of focusFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

A - Andy Jassyfor us. I think that we've made a lot of progress on diversity inclusion.
And if you want to serve the number of customers that we do and we desire to
across every imaginable segment, you need the right diverse and inclusive set of
employees and culture to be able to build the right experiences. While I think we've
made a lot of progress there the last number of years, we're not close to where we
want to be. That will continue to be an area of focus.
Then I think that the tools and customer experiences that we've built for external
customers over the last number of years has outpaced those that we've built for our
employees. I think there's work we can do to make our employees everyday lives
easier to get their work done and do their job inside. So I think we have an unusual
and very compelling place to work. But I think we can improve in every area. We will
work on improving everyday.
Thanks, Andy. This will be your last question. Does Amazon really believe it's
possible to reach net zero carbon?
{BIO 15111610 <GO>}
We do. I do think it's possible. It's not simple. It's going to take a lot of work and a lot
of invention, but it is possible. It really was the catalyst behind why we cofounded the
Climate Pledge, which is our commitment to be net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years
ahead of the Paris agreement.
We have more than 300 companies at this point who have signed on to Climate
Pledge. We hope that many more will. And a long with the Climate Pledge, theres a
number of activities they were taking to try to make progress. We pledged to power
100% of our operations with renewable energy by 2030. We're on pace right now to
get there by 2025, so ﬁve years earlier than what we anticipated.
We now have a 310 active renewable projects globally. We're the largest corporate
purchaser of renewable energy the last two years. We expect that to continue. We've
ordered over 100,000 electric vehicles from Rivian and Stellantis. We've recently
announced that we'll have several thousand on the road in a short period of time.
Our buildings from our fulﬁllment centers, the HQ2, are being built with
sustainability in mind right from the start, including powering our buildings with
renewable energy, committing to lead platinum certiﬁcation, providing electric
vehicle charging stations to encourage our employees to have EVs, and leveraging
low of ﬁxtures and reclaim water usage to reduce water consumption.
It's not simple to get all the way there, to get to zero. We know how to get a good
chunk of the way there. But we still have work to do to the event ourselves and with
partners to get all the way to 100%. It's why we announced the Climate Pledge, when
we did was we need to work on it with partners to get there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-05-25

countries have to work on it together. It's incredibly important. It's something we're
very passionate and committed to.

interest in what we're doing. It means a lot. We really appreciate it. Rest assured,
we're going to continue to do our part, making our customer's lives better and
