Good morning everyone. My name is Anurag Rana. Welcome to the Bloomberg
Intelligence Webinar on Windows 10. I'm here with my guest panelist Al Gillen from
IDC, who will be our guest speaker and we will be doing mostly Q&A about
Windows 10.
Just some housekeeping notes. Today's presentation will be recorded and available
for playback. At the bottom of the slide window, you will notice that you can adjust
volume and maximize your screen. We recommend you maximize your screen for
best quality. Feel free to ask question using the Q&A to the right of the PowerPoint
slides. We will address questions at the conclusion of the presentation. A copy of the
slides will be distributed following the presentation.
Just a quick word about Bloomberg Intelligence. Bloomberg Intelligence provides
unique analysis and context on industries, companies and government and credit
factors that impact business all integrated with the Bloomberg Professional Service.
We cover over 100 industries and about 800 companies globally. The research is
data driven about more than 300 third-party providers. We have analysts with an
average tenure of more than 17 years of buy and sell-side experience. We do not
provide any buy or sell recommendations.
For the software dashboard, you could type BI space ISFT go and go and see all the
diﬀerent themes that we write about the soft -- the infrastructure software side as well
as data. We license data from IDC that's part of the dashboard and we have a
number of tools that will help you monitor companies and overall industry.
So with that I'll now move into Al, who can give a quick introduction of himself and
then we'll start the discussion.
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Anurag. This is Al Gillen so I'm responsible for a number of areas of
research at IDC. I've been doing the operating systems research both client andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19

our enterprise server research so collectively we see that all as infrastructure
research the foundation for cloud as well as the OS layers on the client devices.
So what I wanted to start was -- start with was just a brief overview and just oﬀer a
few opening thoughts around how I see Windows 10 and what some of the
positioning is; what some of the improvements are just in general give you a sense
of where I think the product ﬁts into the market.
So if you think back to when Microsoft brought out Windows 8 part of understanding
Windows 8 was to understand where Microsoft was focusing and targeting that
particular product. It was very much a consumer-oriented play. It was very much a
touch ﬁrst solution. And certainly, I think you could argue that Microsoft over rotated
[ph] on those two dimensions and they brought out a touch-centric device, which
was very consumer oriented; it didn't have many of the features that business users
would have wanted and would have expected nor would business users have
adopted Windows 8 anyway even if it was a perfect product for them for the simple
reason that Windows 7 had already been the solution that was displacing Windows
XP, most business users skipped Windows Vista so we had this momentum going to
Windows 7.
And our experience in watching how business customers move, they don't jump
from OS to OS every two or three years; they tend to wait a much longer cycle than
that. And frankly, I think you could even argue that just getting those Windows 7
businesses to move to Windows 10 is this -- is at sometimes is going to be a
challenge for at least some segments of Microsoft's customers or Microsoft's sales
force to bring those people over.
Probably the most important diﬀerential between Windows 10 and Windows 8 was is
the graphical user interface. So instead of having a touch oriented user interface,
which really put classic keyboard and mouse applications at a signiﬁcant
disadvantage, Windows 10 integrate those two environments together and has a UI
that you really truly can move between the two paradigms very comfortably.
You can use touch oriented applications alongside of and conjunction with keyboard
and mouse applications, you now have the ability to resize both Windows side by
side or on top of one another unlike the scenario with Windows 8 and Windows 8.1,
where you had really a ﬁxed number of conﬁgurations, where you could size your
Windows 8 applications alongside of your windows -- your older Windows 7,
Windows early or early Windows applications.
So start menu Microsoft got a lot of grief for removing the start menu. There was a
half-hearted addition of the start button at least to Windows 8.1 and the update and
really what that did is it brought you back to the native UI, which is native to the
Windows 8 environment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 18So what they've done is they've actually brought back the UI, which looks a lot more
and performs and behaves a lot more like the Windows 7 start button, which frankly
for business users is very, very important. And again the paradigm shift that didn't
happen here is that the users did not go out and replace all of their applications to
be Windows 8 nor could they because in most cases business applications weren't
even updated to be Windows 8 native, so you couldn't get the Windows 8 native UI
in your applications you're still running Windows 7 applications in a Windows 8
environment.
So going forward those applications will be -- won't be second-class citizens the way
they were at Windows 8. -- 8 and 8.1. In terms of the applications itself, I really believe
perhaps the single most important thing technology, which has been added in
Windows 10 is the universal application platform. The universal application platform
allows developers to build applications that can be leveraged across all of the
diﬀerent devices that Windows 10 will run on. So you can write one application and
with relatively little work extend that application to both phone, tablet and PC user
experiences. And frankly that that does two things, one is that it creates a much
larger ecosystem for those developers. Microsoft is having a hard time courting
developers and getting them to get excited about the relatively small installed base
of Windows-based tablets and relatively small installed base of Windows-based
phones. So by integrating all the PC environment together with phone and tablet,
Microsoft has this larger overall ecosystem that they can pitch to the developers and
get the developers to bring their applications and upgrade their applications to the
Windows 10 Native.
And honestly I think that, again that's probably one of the more important things
they've done simply because they can allow these application developers to be
successful in building an application that will run across multiple platforms will give
you essentially the same look and feel and granted the form factors a little diﬀerent
on a phone than it is on a PC, but the user interface is similar enough that you really
feel like you're using the same application. So I think that's an important technology.
Of course Microsoft has the challenge today of getting their application developers
to use the universal application platform and modernize their apps. We'll talk a little
bit more about that in a couple of minutes when I get on to the topic of the larger
Microsoft ecosystem.
Some of the other features the Cortana integration; we certainly have had a need for
having a smart intelligent assistant or intelligent agent on your devices. And the nice
thing about this is that again Cortana exists not only on PCs, but on phones and
tablets so you can move from one device to another and have a common experience
there and have the same value and beneﬁt.
The application experience -- the Microsoft store is going to oﬀer a convergence
point for all of the applications that customers will want. So everything from their
phone to their PC applications will be able to be acquired through the Microsoft
store, which again creates a more uniﬁed experience for Microsoft's customers that
creates a larger ecosystem for the developers, which again is pretty important.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 18I think I talk a little bit about uniﬁcation of the experience. I think that -- again that
together with the universal application platform those two features really go hand in
hand. We've got some new technologies; the Edge browser got a lot of publicity
earlier this year when Microsoft rolled it out. We recognize that that Internet Explorer
does not disappear and go away. I mean it is still embedded in the system and for
certain application types or should I say for certain websites you're still going to be
using Internet Explorer for the simple reason that the Edge browser doesn't support
all the same protocols and experiences that the Internet Explorer browser did.
So for business users in particular, where there are a lot of older websites that
require Internet Explorer I mean will still be used in those cases, where it doesn't
have to be used the Edge browser is going to be the preferred browser. And I think
that part of what happened was Microsoft had embraced some -- really there were
standards that were developed by the industry that really nobody else embrace and
Microsoft went and developed these things; customers use them and those
technologies were never used by other browser makers and the other browsers one
of being lighter and faster and Internet Explorer one having to carry all those
baggage around from these old APIs and old programming techniques that were --
were not necessarily used by the other browsers. So Microsoft was frankly, as
something of a disadvantage in terms of how their browser could compete, which is
why the Edge browser became fairly necessary for them.
And ﬁnally, I think that it's important to think about ecosystem. From my point of
view, Microsoft has enlarged its ecosystem and is on a trajectory, where they are
going to really have a single larger ecosystem for all of the devices and again
spanning from phones all the way up through PCs however, it goes beyond that. And
if you look at what Microsoft is doing for example with HoloLens and granted
HoloLens is not necessarily an end user productivity solution in the conventional
sense, but it is a platform and it is a Windows 10-based platform.
And frankly it creates really fascinating new opportunities for developers and the
excitement around that particular technology was not really a surprise to me. I had a
chance to see it early in the year when Microsoft demonstrated it for the Analyst
Community back in January (inaudible) some of the press community, but when they
brought it forward to the Microsoft Ignite event and so forth. The people that were
attending these events were really quite excited to have a chance to try out the
HoloLens and they had some developer workshops and so forth to help people
understand how to program to these products.
My sense is that that creates a greater ecosystem; a greater reason to develop for
Windows overall; and frankly I think that helps create more interest in the Windows
family overall and that in of itself is important. So it's been long time, since Microsoft
did anything that truly got developers excited.
Surface Hub is another one, you've probably seen the announcement of that I think it
was last week and two weeks ago possibly the Surface Hub is a really a collaboration
system, which is designed for large format and it provide some great interoperability
with other Microsoft products and it's going to create a -- I think -- we think it's goingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19

Page 5 of 18Anurag Rana
Al Gillento create some waves in the large collaboration space. Equally important is that's a
Windows 10-based device as well and we'll be bringing more windows 10
opportunities from a development perspective, so again more target locations for
developers to put their applications.
And ﬁnally with Xbox One, Microsoft is continuing to bring Xbox and Windows
closer together. You can run Xbox applications on the Windows 10 environment and
frankly the experience is becoming more and more like a Xbox environment. So you
can see that the goal here is that Microsoft is moving to unify its ecosystem into
something of a more cohesive and complete ecosystem.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Al, thanks that was a very good description. So let's start talking about the ecosystem
I think at the end of the day, that's all the ﬁght is about. Let's talk about the strategy
behind this. And enlighten us, when I look at Apple and iOS, Apple has a diﬀerent
operating system for their MacBook or and they have a diﬀerent operating system
for the phone. And I believe it's the same case with Android. What is the critical
reason why Microsoft decide to go all -in with one operating system for all devices. I
mean, from a technical point of view, is there an advantage to it or is there a
disadvantage to it. I've had discussions with software developers that have picked
both sides. I mean, there are people who believe one is better than the other. What's
your take on it?
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
I think you can -- I think just both an advantage and a disadvantage for having a
single ecosystem and let me explain. From let's do the disadvantage ﬁrst. So
(inaudible) forward and made clear they are going to have one ecosystem for their --
for all of their device types, but the downside of that is that they didn't really oﬀer a
way for the developers to optimize to any of them and that the problem there is that
they were basically asking their PC developers to develop for phone and they are
trying to recruit phone developers to develop for this, myriad of devices when in
reality, many of those phone developers -- the phone and tablet developers were
really focused on a singular form factor of deployment or two very similar form
factors for deployment.
And I think that part of it is that Microsoft was seen, it was perceived by the
developer community as clinging onto its PC roots. And why would Microsoft -- why
would Microsoft go away from that PC business because it was so important to them
over the long-term. And I think lot of people would see it as Microsoft trying to prop
up their PC business by expanding it. And I don't necessarily agree with that
perspective. But I can see why many people in the industry would see it as a
negative and see it is not being attractive for the developers.
So from the positive side, Microsoft is able to leverage what is frankly a very large
developer community around the Microsoft Windows product base. And when you
think about it, there is an excess of $1 billion PCs, in market billion and a half PCs
something like that installed and majority of those are running some form ofFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 18Anurag Rana
Al Gillenwindows. So they have this really large community. They had been able to sell a lot
of product and developers have been really successful there. So from that
(inaudible) from that point of view, Microsoft is leveraging its strength; leveraging its
relationship with the developers to give them a new platform to develop for.
Again footing back to the negative side for the developers that were not in the
Microsoft ecosystem, they probably looked at this and said well, there really aren't
very many Microsoft tablets and are very, very few Microsoft phones in market right
now why should I develop for such a small market, when I've got this really large
market with the Android or with the iOS.
From my point of view, I mean that's the pros and cons that Microsoft was struggling
with there.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Yeah. I completely agree with you. Now at the end of the day, it's all about the apps;
it's all about getting developers to start making apps for your own ecosystem. And
so let's touch on universal windows apps for a second and you gave us a good
description of it. If I look at the apps right now, Windows have somewhere you know
around 350,000 somewhere in that range, iOS and Android are skirting around the
1.5 million mark.
And one of the ways software development has worked very well over the last 15, 20
years is you give a lot of incentives to the developer community to make those apps
and at the same time, if the user community thinks you can -- you have good apps,
they can get your product so it's like a chicken and egg problem.
Now Android did it by making their software free and getting it licensed to all sorts
of OEM vendors out there and you know, it worked very well for them. Microsoft is
also going down the route as to they are making it, you know the Windows license
fees extremely variable in nature below a certain size, they don't have to pay
anything; you don't have to pay anything to upgrade. So they are going all-in to
make sure that the ecosystem around Windows 10 becomes very large, which would
incentivize the developer community to develop apps.
Do you think this is the right way to go because if you talk to people in the ﬁnancial
services community or the ﬁnancial investment community, a lot of them are not
happy about the free upgrades. They are not happy about Microsoft giving away
their license fee for smaller screen devices.
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Yeah. So you touched on two diﬀerent things, you talked about ecosystem; you
talked about the motivation for Microsoft to give away product in certain market
segments, which relates very directly to ecosystem. So my sense, my perspective is
that Microsoft absolutely did the right thing in making Windows free for small formFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 18Anurag Rana
Al Gillenfactor devices mobile devices and in particular. that's important simply because
there is no revenue to be gained there.
I mean, of course Apple doesn't sell, it doesn't sell iOS exclusive of its hardware just
not like developers can go and build a phone and then get buy iOS to put on it and
Android is eﬀectively free. So if Microsoft is going to compete with something, which
is eﬀectively free when they arguably didn't have another value proposition that
would justify paying for a Windows license, there is no way they're going to sell it.
So what are the choices? The choices were to come to market with a product that
has some price tag on it and sell nothing or give the product away and hope that
you get some traction with developers and with device makers and by doing that
you help build the ecosystem or the device ecosystem since you have a place for the
software developer the go to. I think the latter was really the reason why Microsoft is
doing this? They need to have an ecosystem. They need to have a large installed
base of devices so that there is a place for the application developers to sell their
product and you hit right on the head it's a chicken and egg problem. I mean, you
can't have a -- you can't have a robust ecosystem and a robust set of customers, if
you don't get your product in market. And your product won't go in market, if there
is no reason for people who develop devices using the product because they feel
there is no ecosystem to sell the device -- sell devices into.
So they are really, the two go hand-in-hand. Microsoft needs to create a strong
interest among device makers to use its product and it has to create an environment,
where the software developers see a lot of Microsoft, where a lot of devices running
Microsoft software to be an attractive place to build their applications. So getting
those two things to move and sync is actually a hard thing to do. So giving away
windows on smart phones and tablets, I think was a smart thing to do.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
I mean [ph] that's in theory that is -- that was as you said the right thing to do but it's
been some time now. I -- If I remember correctly was it the Mobile World Congress
last year or the year before when they decided to do this and so it has been
sometime. And we saw the restructuring yesterday at the company and I just, I'm not
sure how what is the kind of the traction the Windows phones are getting because it
seems like the competition, which is both Android and iOS is doing pretty well at this
point.
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Yeah, they are doing pretty well. It was a year ago, it was last spring when Microsoft
made that announcement. It was around the same timeframe when they announced
the version of Oﬃce for iOS, which also was very much a mobile ﬁrst driven decision.
So from my point of view big part of this was Satya Nadella trying to make clear that
he was going to create a Microsoft ecosystem in these spaces.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 18Anurag Rana
Al GillenAnd with regard to the restructuring yesterday, I mean, obviously, we don't know
how that's all going to sort itself out in the end. But it seems fairly clear that they are
deemphasizing some of their focus on hardware. But at the same time, they're also
bringing the hardware and the software teams much closer together, which I would
have to argue makes them more agile and able to put a more integrated device
together.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Yeah, absolutely. Let's -- let's I mean, I think you brought up a very good point on
Satya's Mobile First, Cloud First initiative let's talk about that a little bit. And one of
the things we have written extensively over the last six months is, we have seen a
huge cultural change in the way things have operated at Microsoft now whether it'd
be, as you said making oﬃce available for the iPad or starting to partnering with
people like Box, Dropbox to going out and making Azure open to other rival
basically the biggest stuﬀ rivals out there. Is it that something out of necessity or are
they being pressured to do that or is it just genuinely that the company is becoming
a lot more open and that's the only way to go for them in terms of the next leg of the
IT infrastructure out there.
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Well, it's really a little bit of both. I mean, if Microsoft could ignore Linux, I'm sure
Microsoft would ignore Linux because frankly at the end of the day it's a competitive
threat from a lot of diﬀerent dimensions. The problem is that Microsoft can no longer
ignore Linux and has recognized that Linux is a viable operating system, which has
its place in the environment.
Customers are using it; service providers are using it, so Microsoft has no real choice,
but to except this new, this new structure or the new world order if you will whether
they play in. So in terms of supporting Azure or should I say Linux on Azure
speciﬁcally. I mean, in that particular case, I mean, I don't really see that as being
necessarily a bad -- well certainly not a bad decision, but it's -- I don't think that's, it
doesn't necessarily drive or accelerate Linux in anyway.
I mean, customers that want to run Linux in an IaaS environment are going to do it
somewhere, whether they are going to do in Amazon or on Azure or if they want to
do it on Rackspace or some other service provider I mean they can do that anywhere
they want.
In the end, what Microsoft is doing is, they are focusing on a longer-term goal, and
the longer-term goal is about making sure that they're successful in a cloud
ecosystem in the future. And part of that involves supporting the workloads and let
me underscore the word workload, not operating system that customers want to run.
So if a customer wants to run something on Linux on Azure, Microsoft is selling the
cycles and really is there any diﬀerence in the monetization that Microsoft
experiences running a Linux instance on Azure versus Windows instance on -- in IaaSFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19

Page 9 of 18Anurag Rana
Al Gillenenvironment on Azure. The answer is no, not really. I mean Microsoft is selling the --
they are selling the cycles; they are selling the disk space; they are selling network
connectivity that's all part of what they are doing there.
So from my point of view that's sort of where they have to go. In terms of supporting
some of the competitive products in other dimensions especially on the mobile, the
space. I mean, again Microsoft is recognizing that the world has changed. It's not a
Windows-centric world anymore, and Microsoft still basically owns the PC market,
but that's a market, which is not growing is not necessarily, where the future is for a
lot of customers.
So they have to be part of this new ecosystem and since they don't own it at the OS
level, Microsoft is focusing very hard on being part -- an essential part of that
ecosystem in other ways. They are doing it through things like Oﬃce 365, Azure AD,
some of the mobile device management they have I mean these are all ways of
being part of that ecosystem.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Absolutely. In fact, you hit the nail on the head when you said that they don't own
this particular market. And I think that's the best you can do, but this cultural shift is
actually something that people who have followed Microsoft realized that
completely comes as a shock to them, but deﬁnitely. So let's jump on to you brought
the Azure Active Directory. Let's discuss, Azure Active Directory and Windows 10 and
what are kind of some of the features that would make it easy for enterprises to start
using mobile devices let's talk about that?
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Yeah. Well, again, I think as you -- you think about where the enterprise ecosystems
are moving to they're moving to an environment where they've got on prime
applications and they are going to be increasingly using applications that are oﬀ
prime, some of them are going to be SaaS applications; some of them are going to
be applications running in an IaaS environment. And over the longer term, we're
going to see net new applications being built that are beginning to run in a platform-
as-a-service environment.
We're not seeing so much of that today, but that's where a lot of the excitement is in
the developer community and that piece hasn't really begun to manifest itself in the
enterprise space. But in the consumer space, we've got a lot of pass based
applications that are already being deployed.
In terms of using Azure, Azure is really the vehicle that Microsoft is banking on as
being one of their key revenue producers in the future. It's reasonable to believe that
existing installed instances of Windows Server and pick your number, whether it's
2008 or 2012 or even some of the old server 2003, they are still out there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 18Anurag RanaAll the applications that are running on those windows instances continue to live in --
in a Windows environment; they are not going to be ported to some uniquely
diﬀerent environment certainly not for Linux and probably not natively to Azure. They
are going to be running in an IaaS environment probably for the rest of their lives,
which I had to argue in many cases is not going to be measured in years but rather in
decades.
And if anybody doubts that just remember what and let's not forget what happened
in 1998-1999, when our industry was in a panic to update or replace all of the
Mainframe and AS-400 applications that were out there that had two digit decode
problems. In most cases we ﬁx those applications and in most cases, we're still using
those applications because they had business value then and they have business
value today.
So anyway dialing it back to Azure that's kind of how Azure plays in as a platform to
support those apps. But from a mobile and end user device perspective, you have to
access all these diﬀerent applications and increasingly the inﬂux of mobile devices,
which are not corporate owned, which are not necessarily going to be fully
authenticated into their Windows infrastructure. Microsoft is encouraging its
customers to look at using Azure AD, as the key entry point for those devices into
their on prime and their oﬀ prime applications.
So you see the things starting to get stitched together. There is also some other
things for example, Windows 10 has some multi-factor authentication capabilities
that's going to improve security that sort of thing is being built into Windows 10 as
well. I think that the integration that we see between Azure AD and Windows 10, I
mean that's one of the things that Microsoft is really positioning themselves for in the
future to drive customers to use that solution.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
I mean I -- this is -- well this is one of most exciting things I'm looking forward to how
that comes from into the corporate world. Now if I was to think about it, the
consumer world, you may have been behind, no doubt about it because they were
late to the game. But with this integration, I think there is an opportunity to break into
the enterprise space, as that space starts to move more into the tablets and the
mobile phone area to get a lot of the work done.
Right now, we are seeing some pure play, let's say mobile device management
companies out there or there are specialized solutions, do you think down the road
stuﬀ like that would be integrated at either in the core operating system or it will be
part of as something like an Azure Active Directory where you don't have to pay a
whole lot for it. I mean you pay something for it.
But in case of tying up [ph] products it becomes a little more easier in that case than
it is buying a separate bundle. What are your views on that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 18Al Gillen
Anurag Rana
Al Gillen{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Yeah. I mean, if you think about what has happened through the last 20, 20 [ph] plus
years of history in the operating systems market, what happens is the operating
system provides some level of functionality. There is other products, which are built
that are close to the operating system like management solutions and well, I mean
you can (inaudible) back and say things like browsers and TCP/IP stacks and so forth
that was exclusive with the OS. Over time, these technologies get absorbed into the
operating system.
Hypervisors is another really good example. I mean, certainly Hypervisors -- when
VMware brought audio ESXi [ph] it was very much a standalone technology. Today,
every major operating system has an embedded and integrated hypervisor and it's
really hard to go on and monetize the hypervisor in and of itself. And VMware does
its monetization primarily through the associated management tools and frankly a lot
of the stuﬀ that software deﬁned technologies that VMware has been adding as
appendixes on to that basic hypervisor functionality is where the monetization is
made possible.
So the point being that the operating system absorbs the functionality and either the
cost of that feature that you use, you have to pay for is either just (inaudible) part of
the operating system going forward or you pay some small uplift to have access to
that. I think the same thing is true in Azure. I think that you're going to ﬁnd that
Microsoft is going to continue to absorb and deliver more integrated solutions that
provide device management and again the authentication and identity management
is really, really important dimension. I mean, there are too many players out there
that can oﬀer that kind of an directory infrastructure like Microsoft can and that in
and of itself is one of the keys -- the kingdom that other people just would like to
have it they don't.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Yeah that's exactly what I thought and that's why I was saying that as I look at the --
right now, you look at enterprises, your traditional enterprise. Now the newer
companies that are based on clouds are completely diﬀerent but if I was to go at a
traditional bank today or a traditional manufacturing ﬁrm, you still have a whole lot
of PCs and desktops lying around. I mean has that wave moves to some kind of a
mobile device whether it's a tablet or whether it's a device.
Do you think, I always felt because of this thing that Microsoft actually is might have
an edge over here compared to other companies given they already have a huge
installed base; they already have applications that's written on Windows with these
kind of integrated tools; they can actually make that switch a little bit easier. What's
your thoughts on that?
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 12 of 18Anurag Rana
Al GillenYeah. Well, so I mean there is really a big distinction between consumer markets and
professional or business markets. And you're right, Microsoft has deep penetration
into the commercial sector that doesn't change. In fact, even as we had mobile
devices in commercial business, we continue to use PCs, I don't know about you, but
I have as many PCs in my oﬃce now, than I had ﬁve years ago. I just happen to have
a couple of tablets and couple of cell phones as well.
So in many cases for -- especially for -- certainly for knowledge workers, but frankly
for -- even for manufacturing and retail, so forth the use of the PCs doesn't
necessarily go away they get augmented by additional devices. So in that respect we
IDC believes that the PC market on the commercial side, while not necessarily
growing it's not -- not going to be contracting either.
So it's a relatively ﬂat market as these business opportunities continue to consume
Windows products. And you're right in as much as so maybe of the applications that
were written for these segments of the industry were written on Windows PCs and
you can't necessarily replace those things easily with the mobile device and frankly,
I'm not sure it's the right thing. If you're in a manufacturing environment did you
really want to move an app from PC over to a tablet. I don't know if that's the right
thing to do in many cases.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Fair enough. So, let's jump and talk a little bit about devices at this point. We -- this
has always been the case. We obviously went through a massive upgrade last year
from an XP to 7 and you also mentioned that in your opening remarks. I don't think
anyone in their right mind -- right mind is expecting a similar kind of wave in the
corporate world. And but what do you think could happen in the consumer space in
the second half of this year or over the next 12 month as -- will this trigger oﬀ new
form factors, touch devices, what's kind of your view point on that?
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Yeah. So in fact, let me switch over to the next slide and some of the same talking
points are on there. So my sense is that ﬁrst of all let's talk about the one year
upgrade oﬀer that Microsoft oﬀered and let's talk about what we think that means
and what it doesn't mean. I've gotten a lot of questions from folks both in the
ﬁnancial services industry as well as, as our other customers in the manufacturing or
the OEM space as well as end users about what this really means.
My belief, ﬁrst of all, when you think about Microsoft's business of selling upgrades,
they have two basic business of selling upgrades. They sell upgrades through
enterprise agreements with software assurance. So the software assurance gives you
access to the next more current version of the product each time it comes out. And
large companies tend to be the ones that would buy software assurance contract.
On the consumer side or both on the small business side, on the consumer side, we
don't see customers buying those kinds of agreements and certainly consumersFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19

Al Gillencan't buy -- they can't buy a maintenance contract for their windows product. What
the consumers would do is they would go down to Staples and they would buy a
box of software, which says Windows 10 upgrade buy this for replacement of your
Windows 7 or Windows 8 product. And if you have a genuine Windows 7 license, you
can upgrade it to Windows 8 or to Windows 10 or whatever the version might be.
The reality is that business well, it was relatively visible because you would see the
boxes of software in the retailers that was never really much of a material business
from Microsoft. So they didn't really, I mean it's by oﬀering a free upgrade to
Windows 10 I don't believe they're leaving a lot of money on the table by moving
down that direction.
But what they are doing is they are creating a motivation for customers to move and
they put this one-year window around the upgrade oﬀer so that if you want to get it,
you got to get it now or in the next 12 months. And I think that's going to motivate a
lot of consumers to move forward.
And if Windows 10, as long as Windows 10 doesn't get bad reviews right out of the
box I don't really think that's going to happen. I would expect that the majority of the
consumer installed base is going to take advantage of this and move forward over
the next 12 months.
So what that does is that creates if you will a fairly instantaneous installed base of
Windows 10 devices granted they are not phones and tablets, they are PCs. But
Microsoft (inaudible) and made that billion device commitment in a three-year
window. We actually went back and looked at I'm sorry--
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Yeah. I agree. yeah. I remember that.
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we went back and we looked at the numbers and said how can
Microsoft get to a billion devices and actually when you look at the numbers, you
look at the number of PCs and market and if you don't even think about phones and
tablets for a minute I mean, you could almost get there by upgrading all the
consumers -- if you upgrade say 90% of the consumer PCs and maybe half of the
business PCs you get pretty close to a billion units right there and that happened not
even in a three-year period I mean, that's an like a one-year period because this is
one-year upgrade oﬀer.
So when you start to add in, factor in the net new PCs and phones and tablets that
ship over the next three years getting a billion devices is not so -- it's not outrageous
at all. In fact, I had have to argue that that was almost a fairly conservative statement
that they made, and from my point view it's doable.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19

Page 14 of 18Anyway, back to the point, what happens is we think that the consumer side of the
market, we'll make a fairly aggressive move to Windows 10. And again assuming that
number one, that when customers click on upgrade me to Windows 10, it works
eﬀectively and doesn't break for a lot of users. Number two, if after they've done the
upgrade, the Windows 10 functions as well as Microsoft promises for two. And the
early people that upgraded, if there's bad experiences that could actually slow down
the upgrade momentum. But if the early experiences are generally pretty good, I
think that will help open the doors for the consumer market to move forward.
Same thing holds true particularly for small businesses, which typically behave more
like consumers then like large businesses. When things get a little less certain is
when you get into the mid-size and the large businesses. If there is any kind of a
structured IT department in place, they're probably going to be resistant to moving
to Windows 10 simply because the guarantee that they can support 10, they're going
to want to qualify, they going to -- we'll make sure their applications are compatible.
That all of the things that typically break on an upgrade, so they're anti-virus
software, they're back of the agents, some of the management tools are using. Those
are the things that they have to make sure will work with Windows 10.
So if those things are actually able to move to Windows 10 without a problem that
lowers some of the barrier for movement. So ﬁnally, in terms of the enterprise
customers, which typically have software assurance in place. If they have an SA
contract, these businesses, they already have access to Windows 10, they didn't need
a free upgrade oﬀer from Microsoft to get it.
So in that respect, they have the option to go to Windows 10, whenever it's right for
them, which ironically enough, will probably slow them down means that there is no
one year time pressure on the larger organizations having SA, simply because
they've got -- as long as they continue to stay current on SA, they can upgrade any
point -- at any point in time that they want to. So that's kind of the scenario for that
upgrade.
Now in terms of -- one last comment on this point. In terms of this one year oﬀer,
Microsoft has been I don't know vague is maybe the best term to use about what
happens after the end of one year. In fact, at one point, we wrote a document that
we had shared with Microsoft for review and we made a comment that after a year,
you'll have to pay for the upgrade. Microsoft gave us some feedbacks that well you
really should strike that sentence because we haven't said that. And I thought that
was a really telling comments.
So what they're telling us is that we shouldn't be telling customers that after a year
you're going to have to pay for Windows 10. So what I think they're doing here is I
think they're leaving the door open, so that if they have to extend this one year oﬀer
to two years or something like that, they're prepared to do it. And again it all comes
down to building at that immediate ecosystem, so that the developer community
feels the pressure to get their applications upgrade for Windows 10 and new
developers, they maybe don't have Windows, Windows-based products at all today
say iOS or Android developers are going to look at this and say okay, yeah thereFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2015-06-19

Al Gillenreally are a lot of devices out there running on the Windows ecosystem maybe I
should be there.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
See a lot of those developers that you said and that are only writing for iOS and
Android. I mean, also, I mean, probably, in my judgment might have never thought
of Microsoft as one of the cool companies out there, but do you think, when you
have HoloLens, you have the Surface Hub and you're trying to be the platform for
internet of things, do you think that changes stuﬀ because internet of things you
need decent enough platform and if Windows 10 works the way it's supposed to
work I mean, it could be one of the choices customers make and if that's the case
then you would see developers rushing after that to build applications on it.
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Yeah, I hate to say it, but Microsoft lost its designation as a cool company probably a
decade ago. And I agree with you that things like HoloLens and what they are doing
with the Windows 10 Ecosystem, the universal application platform makes it a lot
more attractive to developers. HoloLens in particular, I think -- I don't think anybody
can argue that that's not a cool technology.
I mean, I think that things like that it gets the attention of the developers because it
enables new developers -- enables developers to build new applications that do
things that people haven't thought of doing before.
So I'm actually -- I'm very pleased to see them doing some things and stepping out
of their comfort zone and it felt to me like during the early 2000s that Microsoft was -
- we saw themselves as a conservative company that wasn't willing to take a risk on
things until it was fairly certain that it was a safe bet to do and you saw them drag
their feet on things like virtualization for example. I mean they're very slow getting
into virtualization and VMware took oﬀ and it was until VMware taking oﬀ then
Microsoft realized that maybe we really have to be in this space. So the fact that
they've gone out and done something where there is no precedent for it really that
speaks a lot toward being innovative and being frankly something that developers
will look at say that's really cool.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
And they bought Minecraft so you know some cool stuﬀ over there. Let me just ask
you this? I mean, this I found it to be a very interesting thing just because I think it's
very logical. You have this Windows Insider Program that -- what close to 4 million
users right now. For any software development, the better feedback that you have,
the better your product is going to be. So why is that that has taken them so long to
even think that something like this they should be -- why didn't they do this like ﬁve
years ago or seven years ago or anything like this?

Page 16 of 18Anurag Rana
Al Gillen
Anurag RanaWell, Microsoft used to make early copies of their products available to a ﬁnite
number of close customers that would work with them. They never really had the
kind of broad open developer experience like they're having with this insider
program. And certainly with Windows with the move toward Windows 8, in fact they
really slammed the door closed on collaborating with the community at large, and
frankly I don't think that works well at all for them.
So I think that Microsoft has woken up and realized that the concept of community is
real, the concept -- the using of community to your advantage is actually very
beneﬁcial. I mean certainly the Linux and open source developer community has
illustrated that engaging large numbers of people to collaboratively work on
projects is a way of really getting beneﬁt from people you normally wouldn't
necessarily consider to be collaborators. So, again if Microsoft really getting back in
sync with the way the industry is moving today by being much more community-
oriented. And if they hadn't done this, I think they would have left themselves a
signiﬁcant risk of being out of sync with their own customers.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
I completely agree. We have a question from the audience that wants to understand
that whether the Windows 10 will spur replacement demand in PC, especially
consumer PCs?
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Yeah. So we've had a lot of talk about that internally. It's our sense in IDC that the
Windows 10 -- giving away Windows 10 for free does two things. One is it makes it
available on a very broad basis so that users that normally would maybe not
(inaudible) if they buy new PC right now we'll get to experience the new product.
And frankly, my experience personally is that if you have a touch screen even using
Windows 8 and 8.1, I mean it's a much better experience with the touch screen and
without.
So once you've had a chance to experience Windows 10, and if you've experienced
that without having a touch screen, and then you go to a store, and get plywood
machine on the shelf that has a touch screen, you realized how convenient and
helpful it is. We think that there's going to be a certain amount of ah-has [ph] that are
going to come from that experience and it may help consumers actually realize why
buying a new PC with Windows 10 on it is beneﬁcial. What we don't see, and let me
be clear here, we're not suggesting that this is going to create a surge in the market
for Windows PCs.
But we do think that it helps maintain the market evolution and frankly will help
move customers more quickly toward considering new PC's by just giving them the
experience of having touched Windows 10.

Anurag RanaI have another question, Al, that says, will customers be forced to upgrade the
hardware, or the hardware requirement is very diﬀerent this one than it is in the
previous versions.
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
No. If you've got a Windows, certainly if you've got Windows 8 and even Windows 7
in most cases you can put Windows 10 in the same PCs without a problem.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Okay, cool. That's good to know. I have another question, that says is the supply
chain, holding oﬀ production till Windows 10 has launched, do you -- have you've
seen any bottlenecks on that end?
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
I have to -- that's actually not my coverage area so I can't really speak directly to the
supply chain. What I can say is, is when we look back at previous Windows launches,
we generally see some contraction of shipments leading up to the launch of a new
Windows product followed by some kind of a resumption or little bit of a surge
following the launch. But if you kind of average that out over several quarters, it
doesn't necessarily create a -- you don't see a sustained acceleration of product
sales speciﬁcally surrounding a Windows operating system release anymore. That's --
that happened years ago, but it doesn't really happen these days.
{BIO 7440273 <GO>}
Cool. Just a reminder, if you need to ask any question, please use the Q&A panel on
the right of the PowerPoint slides. We will wait for a couple of minutes and see if
there are any more questions. All right. I don't think, there are anymore questions.
So, I mean, that's all I had. Al are there any ending remarks or anything else you want
to talk about of?
{BIO 3529173 <GO>}
Well, speciﬁcally in the side of the Windows Client Product probably, we did a pretty
good job on that. But I'll just mention they recognize that this is only one of a fairly
large portfolio of products that Microsoft has and recognized that Windows Server
2012 is coming down the pike as well that will be launched sometime in the ﬁrst half
of 2016. That's going to lead ultimately to another wave of Windows replacement. So
we'll see the Windows Server 2008 products starting to taper down and being
displaced by server 2012 and server 2016. And from my point of view, that's going to
be the product that's going to bridge a lot of customers into cloud-based
deployments.
