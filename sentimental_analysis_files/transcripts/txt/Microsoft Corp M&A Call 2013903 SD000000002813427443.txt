Thanks Chris. And thanks, everybody, for joining us on this call today. I say hello from
Salo, Finland which is one of the heart and soul development facilities for the Nokia
Lumia Windows phone. I am excited to have a chance to talk to you about the very
bold and exciting deal, transaction that we announced today. On slide four I just
want to make sure everybody has the key elements of the deal in mind. I know it's all
in the press materials but let's make sure everybody's clear.
Number 1, Microsoft is acquiring Nokia's Phone business both its so-called Mobile
Phone business as well as its Smart Device business. Number 2, along with the
acquisition of Nokia's phone business, we are also being assigned rights to Nokia's
license, IT license with Qualcomm and other key IP licenses. Number 3, we are
licensing, not buying, we are licensing Nokia's patents to be able to use them not
only with our Windows phone and other phone product lines but across the
Microsoft product set. Number 4, we are licensing the ability to use Nokia's HERE
mapping geospatial location. We'll use those words interchangeably today, service
to use that and modify it broadly in our products.
Nokia is a Company that will continue under the Nokia name. It retains the NSN
business which is a network infrastructure business, its location and mapping
business HERE, its CTO oﬃce and the patent licensing business that goes along with
the advanced technology work they're doing. With this announcement, we also
cement the original partnership that we put in place two and a half years ago to
focus together on Nokia phones that are Windows phones. There was a date in 2014,
we call it the recommitment date at which we would each add some options on how
to move forward. It's quite complicated. But we have been talking for a while about
where we wanted to go. We think we have made excellent, excellent progress with
the partnership and yet we also know we have a long way go and felt in balance that
together this is the best approach for both companies' shareholders.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 3 of 19Terry MyersonOn slide 5, I show you a sampling of some of the beautiful Nokia phones. Nokia
ships well over 200 million phones a year. The vast majority of those are mobile or
feature phones that get sold for prices as low as say $25. And are often the ﬁrst
connection with technology that people in many places in the word have, with any
kind of communications or information technology device. We look at that as an
excellent feeder system into the smartphone world and a way to touch people with
our services even on much lower-end devices in many parts of the world. And so
we're pleased to be acquiring the full capability of Nokia in phones, from mobile
phones to smart devices, from engineering to marketing, manufacturing, supply
chain management. And the like. Nokia's a phenomenal Company that we really had
a chance to work with and get to know over the last two and a half years. We knew
the Company earlier. But the working partnership is phenomenal.
On slide 6, I just want to highlight the four key rationales for the deal. We're going to
walk through each one of these. Number 1 and most importantly, we are trying to
accelerate our phone market share. As good as the work is that we have done
together. And Terry Myerson will have the chance to talk about it, we know we need
to accelerate. We're not confused about that. We see opportunities to do so and
Terry will discuss that. Number 2, we want to strengthen the overall opportunity for
Microsoft from a Devices and Services perspective and that opportunity for our
partners as well. I will speak about that later. We're going to talk about why this is a
smart acquisition from a ﬁnancial and assets perspective. Amy Hood and Brad Smith
will do that. And last but not least, we'll talk about our execution plan and Stephen
Elop from Nokia will have a chance to join Brad and I in that part of the discussion.
So with that, I'll turn things over to Terry Myerson. Terry has run our Windows Phone
business. He now runs all our operating systems work. He has been on the front
edge of the partnership with Nokia and in championing inside this fast forward. And
I'm going to let Terry talk about our plans to accelerate phone share.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. This is the single most exciting deal in my 17 years at
Microsoft, unlocking our potential to win in mobile devices. We can go to slide 8.
This all started in fall 2010 when the Nokia and Microsoft teams began talking about
partnership. We asked ourselves with two great brands, Microsoft software and
Nokia hardware, what could we create? At Nokia we found great leadership,
innovative concepts and incredible engineering capabilities, not to mention a ﬂare
for original and world-inspiring hardware design.
In February, 2011 we signed our strategic partnership. Nokia would invest exclusively
in Windows Phones and Microsoft would bet on Nokia's HERE mapping technology.
We shipped our ﬁrst phone together nine months later, the Lumia 800. Last Fall we
shipped Windows Phone 8, which enabled Nokia to create a full portfolio of
Windows Phones that spanned a broad array of price points in over 100 countries.
Today we have the best selling Lumia 520 at an entry level price point, the 620, the
720, the 820, the 920 which was voted smartphone of the Year by Engadgets
Readers the same year iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 launched. And now the best cameraFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 19Steve Ballmerphone in the world, the Lumia 1020. In just over two years Nokia has gone from
shipping no Windows Phones to shipping 7.4 million last quarter.
As a result of our Windows Phone innovations, combined with Nokia's amazing
device portfolio, their capability and distribution and retail promotions, Windows
Phone has reached over 10% share in nine markets. And in 34 markets Windows
Phones are out-selling Blackberry from Australia to China to Brazil, Italy, Mexico,
Russia. And the United States. The Nokia Windows Phone momentum has made
Windows Phone the fastest-growing mobile platform with 78% year-over-year
growth. Every quarter for the past eight quarters more customers have activated
Windows Phones than in the prior quarter. We are building momentum. But we still
have low share today. Last decade with Xbox and Exchange, we were in this same
position, starting small.
Here we aspire to the same trajectory. We need to make the market for Windows
Phone. We have to go to the customer with a clear message that highlights Windows
Phones diﬀerentiation. The marketing approaches we have used in the past are
insuﬃcient. This deal enables us to invest in a single marketing campaign, which
allows us to oﬃcially communicate the Windows Phone value propositions to
consumers with one brand and a united voice, making the market for the entire
Windows Phone ecosystem. The thing I am most excited about with this deal is how
our innovation will accelerate. Our teams have a proven ability to work together and
this deal removes the seams in our collaboration. Nokia's mobile phones division
reaches a whole new customer segment for Microsoft, shipping over 53 million
phones last quarter. We are excited to partner with this team to bring the next billion
people on to the internet.
In the area of imaging, the Lumia 1020 has no equal. We are excited to bring this
technology together with our breakthrough connect camera technology to delight
our customers. Our phones have evolved into our personal assistants helping us
navigate our day. This deal brings us a new HERE data license, which when
combined with our Bing information platform, will enable us to create a more
immersive experience for our customers. From the Skype and Lync experience, to
next generation sensors, to how our devices connect to cloud services, to the
interactive entertainment, to device categories not yet on the charts, the Nokia and
Microsoft teams share a common vision for innovation at the hardware/software
boundary. Together we will now explore this boundary together ultimately creating
opportunities for all Windows OEMs. Together, Nokia and Microsoft have the scale to
combat Galaxy, the design to combat iPhone and the innovation capability to lead it
all.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Great. Thanks Terry. I am going to talk a little bit about the totality of Microsoft and
how this deal strengthens us as a Company in so many ways. So on slide 13, if you
will, I want to harken back to themes we have been striking over the past couple
months, actually the past couple of years, of the transformation of Microsoft. The
Company I joined 33 years ago was a Company focused in on software for personal
computers. Software is a great skill and will always be a core strength of Microsoft.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 5 of 19The PC is an important device, the most productive device on the planet. And will
continue to be so.
And yet for us to, not only to grow. But for us to really fulﬁll the vision of what we can
do for our customers, we have evolved our thinking. We need to be a Company that
provides a family of devices. In some cases we'll build the devices. In many cases
third parties, our OEMs, can build the devices. A family of devices with integrated
services that best empower people and businesses for the activities that they value
the most. The core deliverable for us has been software. And yet the core way in
which people will consume that is through hardware experiences as well as cloud
services, which is a fundamental transformation for our Company, which is very, very
important.
We started the cloud transformation ﬁve or six years ago. We have made great
progress. We certainly have been working hard on devices. And yet the Nokia
acquisition, the deal that we are talking about today, is transformational in terms of
giving us the capability to do physical devices in addition to the work we do with our
OEM partners on virtual devices for us, that is on Windows PCs. I do think. And we
want to touch on why we believe that greater smartphone success is good for
Microsoft and our shareholders as well as our partners. I do want to talk about
geospatial services and the work we are doing with the Nokia HERE division.
Because when you think about the high-value services of the future, these mapping
and location services are essential. And we think we have made a smart win-win deal
in that area.
If you go to slide 14, the ﬁrst thing I want to talk a little bit about is essentially, why
phones? There are many theories of Microsoft and where we should go, that I get a
chance to read and hear from investors and from journalists. In a simple way I would
say much as apps help operating systems and operating systems help apps, devices
help services and services help devices. Being successful with end-users, I would use
the word consumer but it implies people don't have a work life and a personal life, a
professional and productive life and a fun life. But being successful with users is
absolutely just vital to succeed both at work and at home. Where people talk about
the consumerization of IT, that's a phenomenon that we grew up with. The PC
represented the ﬁrst consumerization of IT.
If you want to as we do then, to capture a large user base, real people who use our
products in many aspects of their life, you must focus either on consumer services,
devices or some combination. I would say that in many ways we are coming at both
of these. But devices are particularly important as a place to capture and really
involve the end-user and frankly the devices, while we continue to pursue service
opportunity. And we see great opportunities particularly for revenue upside in our
Bing service. The device opportunity is perhaps the best opportunity for pursuing
users in very, very large numbers.
The phone as a device is, of course, obvious. It's the most popular device, intelligent
device, now on the planet. It is important for us to really make sure we have the
innovative high quality experience that lights up on great devices. We do think thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 19there will be innovation in hardware and in software. And that will give opportunities
for us to build market share in the phone as a device. And that brings with it proﬁt
opportunities. I continue to believe that there is enough innovation in devices, unlike
some of our investors, that it will be a growth opportunity in terms of the ﬁnancial
reward to the bold, to the innovative who pursue it.
We will, as we do today, we will support both iPhone and Android Galaxy phone with
our services. We are not holding back services from other phone vendors, platforms
in any way. On the other hand, we cannot do a full and ﬁrst-class experience on
those platforms. The level of integration, the level of device support, the level of
economic tax taken by the platform vendor, all of those things. We run the risk that
Google or Apple will foreclose our ability to innovate, to integrate our applications,
the way that we have an oﬃce, to do distribution or to impose economic terms. For
all of those reasons, not only in an oﬀensive aspect but in a defensive aspect, we
think it's very important to have an absolutely ﬁrst-rate Microsoft phone experience
with integrated software and services.
We're not new to devices. There will be over 300 million Windows devices sold this
year. Certainly as I talk to our hardware partners in PCs and tablets they agree with
me passionately that success in phone is important to success in tablets. And I've
already had a chance to talk to a number of our big OEMs who are excited about the
transaction that we are announcing today with Nokia. We also know that there is a
relationship between tablets and PCs. In some senses. And in successful investment
Windows Phone and Windows ecosystem should help raise the tide of everything
that we do. We know that that rising tide attracts application developers. And we
recognize the gaps we have in application ecosystem today, particularly on Windows
Phones.
On slide 15, I want to talk a little bit about why we think we need to do our own
phone hardware and what the ongoing opportunity is for our OEM partners. As we
discussed, Windows Phone has achieved the number three position in smartphones
globally. Some of you say three is not two and not one. I will tell you, you cannot get
to be two until you are three. And we will work very hard on the opportunities that
are in front of us. But what it means is we have the smallest share of the real
contenders. And today a very high concentration, over 80% of the Windows Phone
business is already with Nokia. And so in terms of evaluating paths that would ensure
that we continue to see great Windows Phone devices from the Nokia team. And in
an attempt to really ask what's the most sensible economic model, it made sense for
us to go ﬁrst-party, have our own phones to ensure a Windows Phone presence.
We looked at various OEM alternatives, continuing an OEM-only model. Those
actually looked prohibitively expensive from a marketing standpoint. And this
actually looks to us to be the best risk-return and upside opportunity for our
shareholders. Terry talked about why an acquisition is better than continuing from an
innovation and marketing standpoint and arm's length relationship with Nokia. So
we think the combination gives us the maximum opportunities and Amy will talk
some about that from a ﬁnancial perspective.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 19Amy HoodWe absolutely believe this acquisition grows our OEM opportunity. More success
with phones helps our OEMs and tablets and PCs. I talked to a number of OEMs who
are more enthusiastic today than they were yesterday about pursuing phones,
because they know we have a ﬂagship product with which to blaze trails in this
market. And there is plenty of opportunity for OEMs to address the diversity of
markets that are out there. I am pretty excited. It's a diﬀerent model than the PC
model. But I am pretty excited about the way in which we can balance our own ﬁrst-
party hardware and get support and help that's important from our OEMs.
On slide 16, in some sense of the question is why Nokia? Of we are going do phone
hardware there is absolutely no question in my mind that Nokia is a ﬁrst-rate
Company when it comes to device design and engineering. We know that from
working with their teams and seeing their products, device distribution and sales,
supply chain, operational processes, hardware distribution. They can do that today
all with Windows Phones. I think there is no question that if we are going to need to
be and want to be scale player in hardware, having a culture, a set of processes, a set
of talent and people who really know how to run a ﬁrst-rate hardware business, is
essential. We certainly think we have many talented hardware engineers. But we
have a very, very capable team, a team that ships as many electronic devices as
almost any Company on the planet, now becomes part of Microsoft. I'm very excited
to welcome the Nokia team. I'm traveling in Finland for the next few days meeting
people beyond the leadership team and I think it's really exciting to see the team
that's here.
Finally, I want to talk a little bit about high-value services. Nobody buys hardware for
hardware and it's sometimes hard to get real end-users to buy services without
buying hardware. So we think about, as I said, devices with services and with oﬃce,
with Skype, with Xbox Entertainment Services, SkyDrive, Bing, we have a powerful
line-up of ﬁrst rate services to deliver on high value experiences. But in the mobile
world mapping is essential. And we need a very eﬀective alternative for mapping to
Google. It is important to many players including Microsoft, that there be more than
one digital map of the world.
What we're doing in the partnership today, what we'll do, sorry, with transaction,
Microsoft will get ﬂexibility to integrate Nokia's HERE geospatial assets into all of our
experience. We have great freedom to innovate around the HERE location platform.
And yet Nokia can maximize the use of the HERE asset by other industry players. Like
every other aspect of the deal being announced today, we examined many
possibilities and collectively decided that the new partnership is simpler, more
eﬀective. And more likely to lead to economic success for both entities. And a real
second digital map of the world. We will become, with the conclusion of this
transaction, we will become a top three customer for Nokia. Those economics are
outside the acquisition economics that we summarized in the sheet. But they're in
the analysis that Amy Hood will now share with you. Amy, you want to talk some
about the smartness. So to speak, of this acquisition?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 8 of 19Absolutely. Hello, everyone. As Steve and Terry have both mentioned, today is a very
exciting day for Microsoft. We feel great about the opportunity that this deal
represents to drive long-term shareholder value with both top; and bottom-line
growth.
As we turn to slide 19, let me get into a few speciﬁcs of the deal. There are really two
primary components. First, we are paying EUR3.79 billion for Nokia's Devices &
Services business, which includes thousands of design patents, key brands. And the
beneﬁt that we receive from Nokia of signing its patent licenses with third party's
Microsoft. Additionally, EUR1.65 billion is being paid to license Nokia's broad
intellectual property portfolio for ten years with an option to convert to a perpetual
license. We consider this portfolio to be among the best in the mobile industry and
we will be able to leverage it across Microsoft's entire portfolio of products. Brad will
cover the details on these key assets in a few minutes.
The combined purchase price will be paid using oﬀshore cash. We do not believe
that this transaction will impact our ability to continue to return cash to shareholders.
In addition to the Lumia brand of products, an important component of Nokia's
Devices and Services business is the scale and breadth of their Asha branded
phones and other phones developed by the mobile phone business units. Nokia
sold over 53 million mobile phone units in the Second Quarter. And their strength in
growth markets creates unique opportunity for Microsoft to reach these users as they
transition the smartphones. Many of Nokia's strongest smartphone markets are
places where the mobile phone business was a key part of that foundation.
Now to slide 20. Earlier, Terry walked through some of the beneﬁts that we'll gain
from this deal, particularly from an engineering and go-to-market perspective.
Additionally this deal aﬀords us greater economic opportunity. Under the
commercial deal that was in place, we were capturing less than $10 per device in
software royalty gross proﬁts, then making platform payments to Nokia and investing
in sales and marketing support to grow the business. By owning the devices and
services business, Microsoft will now be able to capture and utilize the entire gross
proﬁt of the device, which for Lumia was about $40 per unit in Nokia's most recent
quarter. Using assumptions that are in line with industry forecasts and current
performance and trajectory, after it is integrated into Microsoft we estimate that we
will achieve operating income break-even for this business when we sell
approximately 50 million smart devices a year. For reference, Nokia sold over 7
million units last quarter, up 32% sequentially. As we continue to drive further scale,
the per-unit proﬁtability is signiﬁcantly better for us with this acquisition.
Now to slide 21. We expect this deal to have a negative $0.08 impact on and
adjusted basis and $0.12 impact to GAAP earnings per share in ﬁscal 2014, based on
a close date in early calendar 2014. Adjusting for acquisition-related amortization
and integration expenses, we expect the deal will be accretive on a non-GAAP basis
in ﬁscal year '15, driven by both increased smart device unit volumes and cost
synergies. Cost synergies are expected to occur across both Companies over a wide
variety of functions. We are committed to operating this business eﬃciently. As Steve
mentioned, Nokia brings signiﬁcant expertise in areas such as supply chain andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 9 of 19Brad Smithdemand planning. And has mature operational systems in place that will be a key
asset for the combined entity.
On slide 22, with this deal we have a real opportunity to materially drive long-term
shareholder value. The smartphone market is expected to reach over 1.7 billion units
a year. And as Steve and Terry discussed, this acquisition better positions our
Company to compete in that market. The directional values presented here are those
directly related to the acquired Devices & Services business. In addition, we believe
there are opportunities to create additional value with a positive impact on our
family of devices, particularly tablets but also PCs, along with our portfolio of
business and consumer services. Those impacts are not included in these numbers.
Before I hand it oﬀ to Brad, let me leave you with this. With this acquisition, we have
an opportunity to fundamentally change the economic structure of our mobile
business. It is a change that, as the business grows, presents an opportunity to
deliver enhanced economics with signiﬁcant additional beneﬁts to other businesses
across the Company. With the commercial deal showing positive early momentum
and both Companies assessing their strategic positions, this was the right time to
make this deal. And with strong execution, it is an acquisition that can deliver
signiﬁcant economic return. Now let me hand it oﬀ to Brad, who is going to talk
through some of the details regarding the patents and the intellectual property.
{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Thanks Amy. And hello, everyone. Let me turn to slide 23 and talk a little bit about
the IP aspects of this. If you step back and think about it, it's pretty self-evident that
an important part of managing a smart devices business well involves management
of intellectual property rights. Anybody who reads the news will see that if you don't
do a good job, you will run the risk that you infringe other people's patents, your
shipments can be enjoined. Even if you are able to secure licenses, if you are not
creative in the way you put all of this together, you can drive up your costs. And
indeed for some companies, the patent costs amount to 10% or more of their bill of
materials. For other companies that's substantially lower. We put a lot of thought as
we have structured this transaction and considered the Company's strategic
opportunities at addressing the patent issues.
If you look at what we are getting in this agreement it really breaks down into a few
pieces. Number one, there are some IP assets that are being transferred from Nokia
to Microsoft. This includes about 8,500 design patents. These are the patents that
distinguish the physical features of a product from another product. It includes the
transfer of two important brands, the Asha brand and the Lumia brand. We secured a
ten-year license to use the Nokia brand on feature phones. That is what is being
moved over in terms of ownership.
Second there is a patent license for which Microsoft is paying EUR1.65 billion. This
involves the right to, in eﬀect make, use of Nokia's inventions. It doesn't involve the
transfer or ownership of the patents itself. But what it does give is, it gives Microsoft a
license for all of Nokia's patents except for the NSN patents. It gives us the option,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 10 of 19Steve Ballmerwhich we'll exercise, to convert this license from a ten-year license to a perpetual
license, meaning we'll have patent coverage for the life of all those patents. It also
has a broad ﬁve-year, two-way standstill between both Companies including the
NSN patents.
One of the reasons we focus so much on securing this license, one of the reasons it
has a high price tag is because of the very substantial value of Nokia's patent
portfolio. When we look at the industry. And in particular when we look at patents
that are relevant to wireless connectivity, using the CDMA standard or the GSM
standard or 3G or 4G technologies, we really believe that Nokia has one of the two
most valuable portfolios in the industry. The other is Qualcomm's. So we secured the
right to use those patents as we produce and innovate in this device space going
forward. There's also some signiﬁcant value for our existing business. We have been
making annual patent royalty payments already to Nokia for our existing businesses.
And we assign roughly a quarter of the value of the EUR1.65 billion patent license to
these existing businesses.
If you go to slide 24, you see the other part of what is a very signiﬁcant aspect of this
transaction. In our view, Nokia has been one of the smartest, I'd go as far as to say
the most sophisticated and smartest device Company, in securing the patent rights it
has needed to produce smart devices, smartphones. And under this agreement, the
beneﬁts of over 60 patent licenses that Nokia has negotiated with third parties are
assigned to Microsoft. The most important of these is with Qualcomm. Nokia
reported publicly that it negotiated a 15-year license that went into eﬀect in 2008
with Qualcomm. It paid EUR1.7 billion. It also transferred to Qualcomm a number of
Nokia patents. As a result, Nokia has what we regard as an important and attractive
patent arrangement in place with Qualcomm. We now beneﬁt from that
arrangement.
But it's not Qualcomm alone. There are a number of other important third parties as
well from which we'll now get the beneﬁt of the existing licenses. We get to combine
that with the license agreements we have been putting in place over the last few
years. And typically over the last few years as we have negotiated patent agreements
with other companies, we have bargained for the right to produce devices if we
wanted go that route. So our existing agreement with Samsung gives us coverage
under Samsung's patents without paying additional money. The same is true for a
number of other patent agreements that we have in place. When you put all of this
together the IP assets that are transferred, the Nokia patent license, the patent
licenses that are transferred from Nokia to Microsoft, we believe it puts us in the
position to have the most cost-eﬀective patent arrangements for any Company in the
smart devices space.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Great. Thanks very much, Brad. I am going to turn to slide 26 and talk some about
the execution plan. One of the things which I think we are most acutely focused in
on, is how do Companies really make big acquisitions work? In this case, we have
two and a half years now of experience in making many aspects of this acquisition
work. Our partnership provides us with great conﬁdence. We know the people. WeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 11 of 19Stephen Elopcan produce products together. We know how to go to market together. We can do
it all more eﬃciently. We understand that. More eﬀectively, we understand that. I
have to say I don't know whether we would be here if we hadn't already operated
under our current collaborative agreement do so much great work.
So building on the existing partnership and the structure of the deal, I spent time
with Nokia's senior team on the Devices and Services side as is Terry Myerson and
others, as part of the transaction. And associated with the transaction, Stephen Elop
and, frankly, most of the leadership team from Nokia on the Devices and Services
side is signed up, excited, moving over to Microsoft. So that we have the opportunity
to execute on this without missing a beat. The leader of the Smart Devices side, the
Mobile Phone side, the talent and expertise that Juha brings in operations, Chris
Weber who runs the ﬁeld, all intact. Stefan Pannenbecker, who has done some of the
most important design on Lumia, joins as part of this deal. We'll hear from Stephen
Elop in just a moment.
We have a structure for the integration that makes sense to us. Steven will run our
Integrated Devices organization and his team on the engineering and supply chain
side will come with him. And will be the center on which we integrate Devices. And
supply chain will be with Stephen. Our Phone device R&D will be centered here in
Finland. We will consolidate marketing as well as the development of software
services. The Nokia sales team, importantly, will stay intact. We need that team out
there everyday, not only just to close but post-close, really generating sales through
the relationships with the operators. And we think we've got a good plan there. We
have integration executives mobilized on both sides. Tom Gibbons, who has been
with Microsoft over 20 years in a variety of hardware and software aspects of our
business will lead, as will Juha Putkiranta on the Nokia side. Then as I said, we have
working rhythms between the two Companies that are intact. I'd like to turn things
over to Stephen Elop, who will lead the Microsoft devices eﬀort post-closing. And is
currently, as of yesterday was CEO of Nokia and now is EVP of the Devices division
of Nokia. Stephen.
{BIO 3600175 <GO>}
Thank you, Steve. I'm glad to be able to join you on the call today. At Nokia we've
been building momentum around our Lumia products steadily over the past four
quarters. We've continued to connect the next billion people with new advances in
our Mobile Phones business. We have been going faster than Nokia has ever gone
before and as other manufacturers have fallen by the wayside or gone sideways,
achieving our goal of becoming third ecosystem is becoming very real. That is one
of the reasons Nokia and Microsoft have entered into this transaction.
We believe this transaction will accelerate the momentum of the Devices and
Services business. By bringing our teams together we can increase our share in
smart devices through faster innovation, through better products and through
uniﬁed branding and marketing. In short, we can reduce the natural frictions in the
system between our two Companies. We can invest more resources into the eﬀort
and we can build on the momentum that has already been established. As well, the
potential for what we can do with mobile phones goes up, as we are presented withFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03

Page 12 of 19Steve Ballmerthe opportunity to bring a rich array of Microsoft services to ﬁrst-time smartphone
users. And as we create an on-ramp to Windows Phone for people that are having
their ﬁrst smart experiences. Our likelihood of success with Devices & Services goes
up as a result of this transaction.
When Steve and I ﬁrst discussed the original partnership between Nokia and
Microsoft in early 2011, we spent a lot of time focused on designing how our
Companies would actually work together. We put in place the organizational
structures and management rhythm necessary for our teams to jointly design and
engineer the award-winning products that we have since delivered. Our collective
teams have now had two and a half years of experience with working together side
by side every single day. This represents a huge advantage as we enter this
transaction, because we already know each other. We have learned how to solve
problems together. And we continue to share the same broader goals.
That experience with Microsoft combined with our passion to win with our strategies,
has allowed us to conﬁrm that we will be bringing a very talented and motivated
team across to Microsoft. For example, Jo Harlow will join Microsoft and will continue
to lead Smart Devices. Timo Toikkanen will join Microsoft and will continue to lead
Mobile Devices. Juha Putkiranta will join Microsoft and will lead the integration eﬀort
between our Companies on behalf of Nokia, while continuing to lead operations for
us. Stefan Pannenbecker will join Microsoft and will lead design. Chris Weber will join
Microsoft and will lead the devices sales team, with the Nokia sales team being the
nexus for Microsoft's devices sales team going forward.
And as we speak, dozens of other leaders at Microsoft have already conﬁrmed their
commitment to the success of this next chapter and are, as we speak, helping
everyone else at Nokia through what is an emotional period of time. I will be focused
on leading the talented and passionate teams of Nokia through this transition. I'll
concentrate my eﬀorts on the months immediately ahead on the Devices and
Services business within Nokia. And when the transaction with Microsoft closes, I too
will transfer to Microsoft and become the EVP of Devices. We have exciting
innovation across Nokia's Smart Devices and Mobile Phones. And with a strong plan
for execution we can accelerate the current momentum to be a more successful
leader in the mobile market. Thank you, Steve.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Thanks, Stephen. I just want to underscore one point before I pass things to Brad to
talk about regulatory, which is the next step. I am incredibly proud of the products
that we have produced with Nokia. The Lumia Windows Phones in market are some
of the best products Microsoft has ever built in terms of capability, design, quality.
We are very, very ﬁrm in our commitment and belief. We have work do to establish
even greater diﬀerentiation. We have work do on the so-called application gap. We
have work do for market success. But we have created absolutely ﬁrst-rate products
of which we are all at Nokia and Microsoft incredibly proud. And we will continue
that as we move into this new space. Brad, why don't you talk a little bit about
regulatory approval?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03

Steve Ballmer{BIO 1721351 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks, Steve. As an acquisition involving two global Companies, not
surprisingly this involves merger review by a number of governments and regulatory
authorities around the world. So we'll be moving quickly to submit this for the
requisite approval in the European Union, the United States, in China, in countries
such as India, Brazil, Russia, Canada, many others. We're conﬁdent that we'll secure
regulatory approval in the ﬁrst calendar quarter of 2014.
And I think the basis for our conﬁdence is pretty clear. Number one, this is an
instance where you really see complimentary assets coming together. Microsoft and
Nokia are not competing in this space today. In fact we are already partners that are
collaborating. And the essence of the rationale for regulators is clear as well. We will
be more eﬀective as a competitor in the market by bringing all of these strengths
together and by operating separately or through this partnership in two diﬀerent
Companies. We get to bring together the new capabilities to Microsoft that Nokia
has really excelled at over the years. That includes everything from design and
manufacturing and inventory and supply chain management, to the other aspects
that are critical to being in the devices business. That will make us more eﬀective. As
Amy pointed out, the economics will enable us to be more eﬀective.
In short, we will be a stronger number three. And regulators like it when the number
three competitor in a market has a better opportunity to challenge the two market
leaders. And at the same time, as Steve has highlighted, we are committed to
continuing to work with our partners in the Windows and Windows Phones
ecosystems. Indeed, we believe our success in phones will help our partners when it
comes to other areas, especially tablets and PCs. Ultimately as we all know,
regulators quite rightly look ﬁrst and foremost at what a deal will mean for
consumers. In this instance, we believe emphatically that this is good news for
consumers. By bringing together hardware, software and IP licenses, we are in a
position to drive down our cost. We are in a position to accelerate innovation. We are
in a position to oﬀer consumers more choice, better innovation and stronger
products. That in short, is what regulators look to approve. That's why we're
conﬁdent we'll secure approval for this.

{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Steve Ballmer, on the tablet side, obviously we could say as many of the same things
as you put into the slide deck as rationale for doing an acquisition on the phone side
is, as we could say about the tablet side including picking up more gross margin. I'm
wondering how this transaction impacts the strategy going forward in tablets? And
whether or not you need to, in a sense, double down further on ﬁrst-party hardware
in the tablet market. Then just had one follow up.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Okay. Terry, do you want to talk a little bit about that? That would be great.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
Phones an tablets are deﬁnitely a continuum. We see the phone products growing
up the screen sizes and the user experience we have on the phones. We have now
made that available on our Windows Tablets. Our application platform spans from
phone to tablet. I think it's fair to say that our customers are expecting us to oﬀer
great tablets that look and feel and act in every way like our phones. We'll be
pursuing a strategy along those lines.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Tablets is an area where we absolutely have our own ﬁrst-party hardware, as you
know. And see opportunities to continue to build and strengthen. And it's an area
where we have very strong programs in place with our OEMs, particularly on the
Intel Atom processor-based product lines that I think people will really get a lot of
value on. And you will see a range of new products coming for the holiday season.
{BIO 4672133 <GO>}
Then, Terry, can you talk about the ability to scale Windows down? Obviously Nokia
has a large base of very low-priced feature phones. That base may be dwindling
over time. You have been cost reducing Windows, the specs and so forth, to be able
to get Windows down to low-priced devices. Can you talk about any eﬀorts to
accelerate that process, given potentially access to a much bigger pool of low-cost
phones that are out there already?
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
It's deﬁnitely a priority for us to bring Windows to as many customers as we can
around the world. The lower price phone is a strategic initiative for the next Windows
Phone release. We have nothing more really to say now.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03

Mark Moerdler, Sanford Bernstein.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Steve Ballmer, two questions. The ﬁrst is how does this aﬀect the re-org? Given
hardware was in one group and operating systems in another, software in another,
does the Nokia device, does the merger aﬀect that? Does it merge into the hardware
business and hardware/content device group? Or does this now change that? Then I
have a follow up.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
The re-org is absolutely intact. Obviously the Devices business has a broader scale
and new capability. Julie Larson-Green, who is running devices and studios is ﬂat
out. We've got a lot of work we are doing here over the next several months and
Julie and her team will work on a planning and integration phase. Julie will continue.
She's excited about working on devices. But absolutely the critical mass of the group
with this acquisition is in the phone space and Stephen Elop will run the group and
will take the appropriate steps, with Julie working with Steven to ﬁgure out
appropriate integrations.
{BIO 16855032 <GO>}
Excellent. Then as follow up on it. What's your expectation going forward in terms of,
want to clarify this, the percentage of Windows Phones that will be from OEMs?
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Today Nokia, as I said, is well over 80% of all of our phones. I don't perceive that
changing dramatically in the short run. But as the market grows I expect to see
additional percentages, if you will, go to our OEMs. But it's premature to predict
today. We deﬁnitely have interest from OEMs in the Windows Phone opportunity,
given that people understand we're going to blaze the trails here with our own ﬁrst-
party hardware.

Thanks, Mark. I want to remind you, we want to get to as many questions from as

avoid long multi-part questions, please. Operator, next question, please.
Brent Thill, UBS.
{BIO 1556691 <GO>}
On the cost rationalization, Nokia at 32,000 employees versus Microsoft's at 99,000,
a considerable bulk of employees. Can you talk about the rationalization over time
and your view how that plays out.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
Amy will take it. I do want to highlight that in many hardware companies
manufacturing labor is primarily outsourced. Amy can remind us the numbers but in
Nokia there is more in-source manufacturing. Nokia's had a strategy about that that
is, obviously they've executed very well. You have apples and oranges a little bit
between the 32,000 and our almost 100,000. Amy, why don't you provide some
context and detail?
{BIO 18040963 <GO>}
Sure. Thanks, Brent. About 18,000 of those 32,000 employees are really directly a
part of the manufacturing business. And so I think a better way as you think about
the scale and opportunity, is to really focus on the percentage of Nokia outside of
that. I actually think both Steve and Stephen did a thoughtful job in the execution
slide about talking really about the philosophy we're using as we go through the
integration process around the beneﬁts of the incremental sales force that we're
getting with Chris and his team, as well as really going through and being thoughtful
about the rationalization so that we get to one voice, one brand, one team that can
best execute and be eﬃcient.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}

Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
You guys have talked about the success in the partnership to date and putting out
some really good products. I was wondering, Steve, perhaps you could give us some
concrete examples. What does the acquisition enable you to do that you guys
couldn't do through the partnership? Maybe give us some more concrete examplesFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03

Q - Rolfe Winklerthere. Or is that maybe not the point? Maybe the point is more so that this really
solidiﬁes Microsoft's presence in the smartphone market. It's more about ensuring
that you guys are going to be a presence here for an ongoing, for a longer-term
basis?
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
While the latter is certainly true, we see at least three distinct opportunities to do
better as one Company than as two. Number one, we talk about one brand in a
uniﬁed voice to the market. I will say that I think we can probably do better for
consumer name than the Nokia Lumia Windows Phone 1020. And yet because of
where both Companies are and the independent nature of the businesses, we
haven't been able to shorten that. Just take that as a proxy for a range of
improvements that we feel we can make. We can simplify the way in which we work
with operators and the overall consumer branding and messaging gets much
simpler. That is an eﬃciency of being one Company.
On the innovation front we've done a lot of great work together. Yet as two
Companies, there is always some lines along which it's hard to innovate. The Lumia
1020 is awesome in terms of what it has for camera and imaging. And yet, I think, as
one Company we would have doubled down on that and made an even greater
range of software and services investments around the core hardware platform.
Third, I think we get business agility. As two Companies we're making two
independent sets of decisions about where and when and how to invest by country,
by operator, by price point. There is, let me say, an ineﬃciency ﬁnancially as well as
lack of agility that comes with that. So in all three of those areas, despite the fact that
I think we've done a really good job, we can improve and accelerate quite
noticeably.
{BIO 6993337 <GO>}
Excellent. Thank you.
{BIO 17955231 <GO>}
Thanks, Keith. Operator I think we have time for two more questions. Next question,
please.
Rolfe Winkler, Wall Street Journal.
You guys have 15%, a fairly aggressive market share assumption for where you guys
are going go in a few years? I am wondering, to get there one thing you are going to
need is a lot of developer support. Developers already have IOS Android. You can
make an argument that HTML size over the next few will grow. That will give them a
third development platform. How will you guys convince them to develop for
Windows Phone?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-09-03

Terry, why don't you talk a little bit about developers if you don't mind.
{BIO 17496274 <GO>}
For developers today, Windows oﬀers an incredible opportunity with the install base
of PCs, phones and tablets and soon the new Xbox One. We want to oﬀer them this
opportunity to build either HTML5 applications or native applications that span all
those devices, enabling them to reach segments of users on those devices, users in
an enterprise, users on a gaming console; and just provide them very unique
opportunities to monetize their application investment. We are pretty excited about
the platforms we are bringing to market. Developer reception in some areas is
certainly better than others. But overall we are making progress. We know we've got
a lot more work to do.
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
One of the keys, of course, is driving volume. We think we have diﬀerentiated
products. We can tell the story a little bit better. We get volume up. We have over
160,000 applications in the store. We know we have a long way to go. The key is
really oﬀering, with our own ﬁrst party applications and ﬁrst party hardware, enough
reasons to buy, to drive volumes and then attract a broader developer ecosystem.
Obviously HTML5 would be a neutral thing. I would expect all the major platforms to
embrace it to some extent. And in some senses it takes away a little bit of the app's
barrier to entry, which we know we need to work hard on right now.

before they entered their cooperation and standstill agreement?
{BIO 1390481 <GO>}
