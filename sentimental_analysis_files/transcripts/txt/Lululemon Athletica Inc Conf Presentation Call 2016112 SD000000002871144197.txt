Presentation
It is my great pleasure to introduce the senior management at lululemon, one of the
iconic brands in the outdoor space and in the athletic space. We're going to have
Laurent Potdevin come up and Stuart Haselden. And if history is a guide, we're
probably going to get a little bit of a show as well. So welcome, everyone. And thank
you very much.
{BIO 18481730 <GO>}
All right. Good afternoon. We realized it's late in the day and we also know that you
guys are all here for the function show. So Stuart and I will be relatively brief. But we
are thrilled to be here. So before I forget, you guys know the drill, we will be making
forward-looking statements.
So with that out of the way, I'm going to give you a brief update on the business on
our holiday season and then, Stuart will come and get into a little bit more detail with
our ﬁnancials. So obviously, we are thrilled with the way holidays went for us.
Numbers have been exceptional. We were conservative with guidance. Back in
November, after seeing two weeks of a trend that had changed, it turned out that
that change was actually fairly short-lived and mid-November, we resumed our
positive traﬃc number and high single-digit comps. So all from holiday season and
what we're more proud is the quantity of the business that we generated during the
period.
So if you think about our revenue between Cyber Monday and Christmas Day, we
did 90% of our business at full retail and quarter up to-date, including Black Friday,
Cyber Monday, that number hovered around 85%. So obviously, very high quality
business during a very key period of the year. What's most important in that is it
speaks to how well our product is resonating with our guests, it speaks to our store
managers and our educators, who all the heartbeat of the brand and deliver
exceptional experience that are very unique in the retail landscape today. And itFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-01-12

Page 2 of 7speaks to the fact that our go-to-market strategy, which is grassroot driven, which is
about creating authentic relationship in the communities that we live in; it's a very
powerful, sustainable, eﬃcient way to build our business.
So we've got the question a couple times today about why don't you do more
traditional marketing? And I answered that why would we? What we're doing is
incredibly eﬃcient. It actually speaks to our (inaudible) in a far stronger, powerful
way than traditional marketing and actually, we see that strategy work around the
world. So we're going to stick with what we do and do it really well.
What you're going to see in the future is as we build a digital culture at lululemon,
you're going to see us amplify our grassroot messaging in a more powerful way. So
what do we stand for? Well ﬁrst and foremost, I mentioned our store managers or
educators, I mean 9,000 of them around the world creating amazing experiences
everyday.
Moving forward, what I'm most excited about is I ﬁnally have a full management
team as of next week with Gina Warren joining us as our Head of People Potential. So
it's really the completion of evolving from being a founder-led organization to
building a high-performance culture. In every single one of the function, we have an
amazing strong global developed leadership team. I am very excited to have all of
that horsepower as we enter 2016.
Our brand operating model remains very much the same. I mean if you guys have
heard me talk about the triangle of product, guest experience, brand and
community, when we balance that triangle, we win. So the chances that we've made
from an organizational standpoint to a point Lee Holman as our Creative Director
and Tom Waller as our Head of Innovation really solidiﬁes that triangle and allow us
to continue to build the business that's (inaudible) building globally across men's
and women's. Then, from a brand and community, it's really continuing to build
resonance and relevance in our communities one relationship at a time.
So from a digital standpoint, it's about building CRM, it's about understanding our
guests better and obviously, at the store level, continuing to do what we do so well.
So our brand operating model is very, very solid, very powerful and relevant around
the world. Then, obviously, we've talked a lot about our international expansion and
we're continuing to be very focused on key major cities around the world. We've
gone up to Asia, we've gone up to Europe. Asia is far exceeding our expectations so
far. We've had a brand presence in Asia before we had a brand presence in Europe.
So that's part of it. And Europe is on track with our expectations.
And I think when you compare the Asian guest to the European guest, I mean
European guest probably takes a little bit longer to accept and embrace a new
brand, especially at the premium level. So we're going to be a little bit more patient
in Europe and really use diﬀerent ways of going to market to build a brand
awareness quickly and eﬃciently and we're going to leverage the momentum that
we're seeing in Asia.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-01-12

Page 3 of 7And obviously, we had a lot of questions on gross margin and inventory. Operational
excellence has been very much top of mind and with tools, with processes, with the
leadership in place, we're ﬁnally in a place where we can deliver margin inﬂection
and go back to levels that you guys will enjoy more than you've enjoyed them in the
past couple of years. So people, as I said, I mean as we enter 2016, I'm thrilled about
the quality of the team, not only from the standpoint of the people and how aligned
they are with our culture. But how strong they are in their own ﬁeld. So should have
got Whitespace and the Creative Director. That is all driven by innovation and
design. And so, we've got this right brain function-focused group of two people that
are very much inventing the future that we will be living into.
From an operational excellence, we've got IT, operations and ﬁnance led by Stuart,
who will speak in a little bit. And digital was never a huge area of focus for the
organization. The digital function reported into the stores and we've actually built --
we've got six months of center of excellence for digital and we're building a digital
culture, we're building a digital muscle led by Miguel Almeida, who joined us about
six months ago from Walgreens and prior to Walgreens, Apple.
We've had a tremendous online business and we haven't even started to scratch the
surface on how much we can optimize that business. So in Q4, we started to dial up
digital marketing and we've been able to drive amazing highly-qualiﬁed traﬃc that
had no impact on conversion. Our regional GMs, we've got Ken in Asia, Kristy in
Europe, Celeste in North America doing an outstanding job and being experts in
their own market.
Brand and Community led by Duke, which is an amazing balance. Duke is not a
digital native; Miguel is a digital native; and Duke is all about brand, having begun at
Nike and Seventh Generation. And so, the combination of Duke and Miguel is really
the best of both worlds. And last but not least, certainly as far as we are concerned is
Gina Warren joining us next week to lead Culture & People. So it's taken a while to
build this group. But again when you think about evolving from a founder-led
organization to a high-performance culture, I've got a team that I'm thrilled to be
working with moving forward.
All right. So from a product standpoint, I mentioned Lee being appointed as Creative
Director. As a brand that is succeeding by creating a market driven by innovation
and design, Lee is the guy with the background at Nike and Burberry that he is
perfectly suited to understand how to solve problems for the athletes and bring
craftsmanship and design on the product. So the relaunch of the pant wall is actually
a really good example of some things we do really well and that's when we are
courageous. When we bring innovation to the market, our guests respond instantly
with a very little price resistance.
From a guest experience standpoint, we've had for a long time a very successful
formula of rolling out 3,000 square foot stores that was square with a certain amount
of window and it's been very powerful for a long time. What we're doing now is that
we're actually playing with diﬀerent formats. And I want to be clear that when we talk
about diﬀerent formats and when we talk about ﬂagship, we're actually not talkingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 4 of 7about a marketing investment that's going to lose money, we're looking at all of
these formats having the same level of proﬁtability that we're going to expect. But it
could be an 1,100 square foot store in Hong Kong at IFC across the Apple store that's
tracking to about $8 million or it could be our most recent Flatiron store in New York
at 10,000 square feet.
What we're most excited and where we see most success in the mid-term in this is in
those expanded square footage. So we're not so much focused about the store
count. But we are very focused on expanded square footage in communities where
we already have a lot of success. So think about what we've done in Vancouver, in
Santa Monica, in Miami or in New York, we've actually seen sales growth outpacing
the growth in square footage. So from a store standpoint, we're really having the
options to play with diﬀerent formats and allow us to be in smaller communities,
whether it's at the beach or the mountain. And have larger formats stores like
Flatiron that will obviously serve the New York Community as well as being an
incredible platform to put more eyeballs on the brand as we grow our international
business.
Then, obviously, from a digital standpoint, I mentioned that we're starting to build a
digital culture. Miguel is leading this. What we've done with digital marketing for the
past two months has been very, very successful. And so, when people ask us about
traditional marketing and we talk about grassroot, there is whole spectrum of things
that we can do. And so, we're not stuck with grassroot at the local level. But we're
going to use tools that actually allow us to very eﬀectively amplify what we do at the
community level. So it's also allowing us mid-term to have very localized assortment
of products at the store level, knowing that our educators have access to the entire
pool of inventory that sits online. So creating seamless omnichannel experience and
we've got the foundation to do that, having rolled out our (inaudible). Brand and
community, again it's all about building relevance and resonance with our guests
and do that from a very grassroot level. So Seawheeze is an outstanding example of
how we do that. I mean if 10,000 people are running, it sells out in less than an hour
and it was just voted the best half marathon in the world.
And when you think about the quality of the engagement, in the sport and the
athletic world, we were recently voted in the Top 3 brands of engagement and
impact on social platforms and Number 1 from a responsiveness standpoint. So
when we engage with our community, we see a really strong dialog going on.
From an international standpoint, I touched on that a little bit earlier. Asia is
exceeding our expectation. We opened two stores in Singapore; two stores in Hong
Kong. We've got two showrooms in South Korea that are performing well above
expectations; that will trigger a full rollout. We opened our presence on Tmall, which
obviously allowed us to put a lot of eyeballs on the brand. So still very, very focused
on key major cities and not sort of getting distracted by going into more inﬁll
markets. But very happy with what we're seeing so far.
In Europe, we're on plan. So we're not seeing the same level of success and that's
certainly doesn't mean that Europe is not working. We're just on plan and it will takeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 5 of 7Stuart Haseldena little bit longer to build brand awareness in Europe. And as I said earlier, we're
looking at diﬀerent ways of going to market that will allow us to accelerate a building
brand awareness. But we're very disciplined. But not getting the store count get
ahead of brand awareness. I mean that would be the worst thing that we could do. I
mean we kill it, we win when the stores roll out like a little bit behind the excitement
in the community.
And so, the start -- two years, I mean we've been very, very focused on coming to an
environment, where we had negative store counts, we had PR that was not the
greatest, you guys know that. We had product issues. I mean we've been incredibly
focused on being guest centric, on bringing product to life back where that; that is
design led, that is obviously from a quality standpoint second to none. We've done
that really well. It shows in our store counts, it shows in our international expansion
and in the background, we have built the processes, the tools and the team to really
have the discipline to run a very eﬃcient business. And now, we're positioned with a
momentum that we have to really deliver on the margin expansion that we've been
talking to you about. So I feel very good that we've got a very, very solid plan with a
very clear accountability in each and every bucket that will drive margin expansion
and you'll see that happening as we enter 2016.
So with that said, thank you very for listening to us today. And I'll pass it onto Stuart.
{BIO 17615686 <GO>}
Great. Thanks, Laurent. So just a few slides on the ﬁnancials. So thought I would start
with a recap of the guidance update that we provided in the press release that we
issued yesterday. So very pleased with the holiday sales results and I think, as
Laurent mentioned, very strong full-price business in December.
As we look at the upside and the outlook now in the Fourth Quarter and we look at
the underlying drivers of that upside, certainly the trends that we saw in traﬃc and
conversion stabilizing into December is a big part of that story as well as the strong
positive AURs that we saw continuing in the month. So we saw those trends both
across our e-commerce business as well as our store business. And we saw a nice
ﬂow-through on that revenue and we included comments in the press release
describing how our gross margin rates will -- at the outlook where our gross margin
rates remain consistent with the guidance that we've given earlier in December.
And the intent of that was just to communicate that this sales upside does not come
from higher markdowns or markdown sales. It was a full-price business that is
ﬂowing through and accounting for the upside and the EPS guidance as well. Then,
we also provide here just the updated full-year outlook. We expect to post sales this
year above [ph] $2 billion and again, very pleased with the momentum in the
business currently.
This next slide, really just -- it provides a chance for us to step back and look at what
were the topline drivers in 2015 and it really speaks to the power of the model, both
across our channels as well as key categories. And as you look at what drove thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-01-12
Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU US Equity)
Page 6 of 7revenue number above $2 billion or we expect to drive above $2 billion for the ﬁscal
year, certainly high single-digit comps, square footage growth north of 20%, e-
commerce growth in the mid-20s, men's growth north of 20% and a solid women's
comp in the mid-single digit driven largely by the outperformance in our pants
business, we believe paints a pretty compelling picture for the momentum in our
business model broadly and we're excited at the prospects of how we will be able to
extend this performance into next year.
Inventory. So couldn't get out the room without talking about inventory. So certainly,
the headlines and the overall pictures that we see now is pretty consistent with what
we saw when we reported in December. Certainly, we've been able to chip away as
on-hand inventory as a result of the improved sales trend. The in-transit elements are
largely unchanged. So the net impact of the Fourth Quarter will be some
improvement in on-hand inventory, some improvement in the overall number. But
still elevates, it's still above where we like it to be. I will be into Q1 before we're able
to fully align inventories with our forward sales trend and I'm excited that by Q1, we
can stop talking about inventory overhang. So in the bottom line here, we're very
conﬁdent that the excess inventory is contained and that we have an orderly plan to
exit that inventory and align our inventory balances by Q1.
Then, lastly, just wanted to provide some -- the key themes for 2016. Certainly, when
we report the Fourth Quarter in March, we'll be able to, at that point, give a more
complete view on the outlook for the year as well as update you on our view of the
ﬁve-year vision for the business. But from the key elements of the growth story as
well as the economic model. But certainly some of the key themes we just wanted to
highlight today from a revenue standpoint, product innovation remains at the
forefront of how we will drive the business broadly and in particular drive our comps
across those are our stores and our e-commerce businesses.
Square footage growth, we expect to continue to drive healthy double-digit square
footage growth into the foreseeable future; e-commerce digital outsized increases in
this area as we continue to invest aggressively in new capabilities from e-commerce
standpoint; and international remains a focus for us. For the long-term, we'll
continue to accelerate our business through new store openings in both Asia and
Europe next year. Gross margin, talked a lot about this. I'm not going to a drain the
page here. Certainly, the key elements that will drive to leverage an inﬂection that
Laurent mentioned will include air freight, improved costing and logistics and duties.
Foreign exchange remains a headwind for us broadly, particularly in Canada.
Occupancy and depreciation, while this will be a source of deleverage next year, it
will be meaningfully improved to where it was in 2015.
And SG&A, just to make the comment that we will continue to invest aggressively in
our growth drivers, you see listed here in terms of digital, international, brand,
supply chain and innovation broadly and our Whitespace, our R&D function, which is
again at the heart of how we think about our business. So those were the headlines
as we think about them into next year. And as I mentioned, we'll be able to provide
more speciﬁc guidance for 2016 on the March call.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-01-12
