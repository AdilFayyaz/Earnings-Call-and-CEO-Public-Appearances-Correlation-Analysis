{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
I'm excited to introduce today's panel. As someone that covers the media and
information services collectively, I think the tracking, targeting. And measurement of
eﬀectiveness of advertising is certainly top of my list of important topics.
Before we get into it, just a couple of important housekeeping announcements.
Firstly, this is being webcast. So I'd ask, when we get to Q&A, if people are patient
and wait for a microphone so we can capture the audio of the question. Secondly,
before we get into it, I'll go through a quick safe harbor statement, since we are
webcasting this.
So on behalf of Facebook, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that
during the course of this conversation, Brad may make forward-looking statements
regarding future events and the business strategy and prospects of Facebook.
Facebook cautions you to consider the important factors that could cause actual
results to diﬀer materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risk
factors are described under the caption Risk Factors in Facebook's annual report on
Form 10-K, ﬁled with the SEC on January 28, 2016. In addition, please note that any
forward-looking statements that Brad makes are based on assumptions as of today.
And Facebook undertakes no obligation to update these statements as a result of
new information or future events.
So maybe with that, just quick intros. Thanks, Brad. How do you follow that?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Craig MineardSo to the left of me, Andrew Appel, President and CEO of IRi. Next to Andrew, Dave
Morgan, CEO of Simulmedia. Then we have Steve Hasker, President and COO of
Nielsen. And then Brad Smallwood, Vice President of Marketing Science, Facebook.
Maybe before we get into some of the discussion, I'd go from left to right, give a
quick intro and just one or two bullet points about your organization, maybe focused
on the topic to hand and where you play it. So media, measurement, targeting,
eﬀectiveness, et cetera.
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
Thanks, Craig. Andrew Appel, IRi. I think where we play is in amalgamating all of the
purchase data assets necessary to measure the impact of media. So we're partnered
with WPP and comScore. Eﬀectively, comScore's role is in the media measurement,
all the things that Martin was talking about. And our role in the partnership and
ecosystem is, I think, building the data backbone and pulling all the datasets
together and then, on the purchase side, measuring the impact of advertising on
actual behavior.
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
Simulmedia is a television-based marketing company. We use data, science. And
software to drive desired business outcomes for large brand marketers in a
predictable, provable, proﬁtable way. And we do that by closing the loop between
what people view on television and what they purchase and being able to predict
that in advance and actually running the campaigns and proving the results. And in
this case, I'm talking about linear television, the old-fashioned part of TV, not the
addressable part. So basically, it's taking a digital approach and applying it to linear
TV.
{BIO 16578627 <GO>}
So Nielsen measures what consumers watch and what consumers buy in over 100
markets. For this speciﬁc topic, we're very focused on measuring the total audience
to a piece of video content or video advertising. And we're the only independent
player in that measurement space.
{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
So the marketing science team at Facebook, our job is to help advertisers
understand the value that they're getting from the marketing on Facebook. But also
digital in general. So all of our data partnerships and measurement partnerships that
we have is run through my team.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
Terriﬁc. Well I think we've been fortunate enough to get some great presentations
during the course of today from a number of the world's largest media companies,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Craig Mineardmany of which are somewhat concerned with remaining relevant in an industry
environment where we're seeing increasingly shift from traditional dollars into digital
dollars.
Maybe I'll start with you, Dave, on this. How does television ﬁght back, as someone
that's really in the midst of that?
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
Television for 30 years could sell however it wanted to sell, because it was by far the
largest media channel. And it just de facto delivered results. I think the way it has to
ﬁght back is ﬁrst, it has to recognize that the audiences aren't escaping nearly at the
level people think. I mean, actually, they've relatively plateaued. But it has to start
selling more like digital buyers want to buy. It has to be more integrated to digital
solutions. It has to stop selling just large programs on average rating points by day
part. But actually selling people-based campaigns. It has to understand the actual
results.
And I think there's companies like Nielsen that are trying to pull them forward. At the
same time -- which you can't say. But I can say -- but being held back by people that
still want to sell how they used to. And I think TV's at a really important time. It now
has to prove its way through. And it didn't have to before.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
But is it really possible to maybe reconﬁgure the metrics and change the landscape?
So we had Joe Marchese from Fox on this morning. And someone said -- well, he
made the comment, "TV let digital set the metrics." Then the question was, "Well can
that genie be put back in the bottle?" The answer was no.
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
I disagree. I think that -- I don't think that the future of TV is only the gross rating
points and cost per thousands in demographics. I think they will become lesser and
lesser factors. But I think if you listen to the message of Facebook in the market, it's
about people, it's about outcomes. And I think TV will do very well in that
environment. I think TV just has to take leadership in this next level of measurements.
And there's a lot of new companies that are coming in with measurements, doing
things on their own. And there's the incumbents like Nielsen, providing Nielsen
Buyer Insights, Nielsen Catalina, proving it to sales. And so I think if it's about sales
and outcomes, we're going to ﬁnd TV is very well positioned to help drive that
currency.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
Steve, what are you doing speciﬁcally around changing the currency? As someone
that's really been at the forefront of currency over the years, how do you view the
landscape today and how will it evolve?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Page 4 of 18Steve Hasker
Andrew Appel{BIO 16578627 <GO>}
So Craig, there are two things we're doing. The ﬁrst is we have developed a total
audience measurement system which measures any piece of content, be it
advertising or programming, no matter where it is seen, when. And by whom. And
we have developed that system, we have launched that system, it's in place, it's fully
functioning. We are in the process of instrumenting clients, more and more clients,
be they media companies, agencies, or advertisers, to be able to see that data on a
daily basis. And we're very happy with where that's going. That's the ﬁrst part.
The second part is to coordinate and conduct a set of conversations with buyers and
sellers with traditional media companies, with digital media companies, with
agencies, to update the metrics. So today, the national television currency trading
metric is something called C3. And in many cases, that's what national advertising on
a TV is traded on. Occasionally it's traded on seven days. So live plus three and live
plus seven.
And we've developed a system to be able to supersede that. The question is, what is
the metric that will supersede that? We've got all the capabilities in place to move on
that today. But what we need is for the buyers and sellers to agree on the right
metrics. And anybody who thinks that Nielsen or anybody else can wake up one
morning and say, "Good news. We're going to move from C3 to C35. We're going to
include all devices. And we're going to include dynamic ad information," is crazy,
because the uproar that would cause would be tremendous.
So we're in a process now, pulling together buyers and sellers to help redeﬁne that
metric so that headed into these upfronts and next year's upfronts, there is a new
metric which reﬂects the fact that TV content and all video content is viewed across
all devices, it's viewed in very, very diﬀerent time periods. And it includes the same
ad loads, linear ad loads and dynamic ad loads. And in some cases, no ad loads.
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
I think the challenge is scale and speed. So in the end, the world is getting
personalized, right? The digital world has brought personal, addressable interactions
with consumers. And the challenge of additional measures and metrics is that they're
still eﬀectively modeling out the behavior of the world when the world is eﬀectively
moving to real-time addressability of scale. And so if you think about what the
system needs, it needs the ability to be able, at scale -- and that's one of the beneﬁts,
I think, of what comScore is trying to do -- is to try and do it at scale -- 40, 50, 60, 70,
100 million households -- and have all the participants somehow play in the
ecosystem that allows you to get a census scale-based view of what each individual
consumer is exposed to.
That is the challenge that I think is going on in media around viewability, is as it
fragments, it becomes increasingly diﬃcult to ﬁgure out who's exposed to what. And
you can try and come up with another proxy metric with a sample as one
mechanism. And that may work; it may work. Or the system just may outgun it. AndFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Page 5 of 18Craig Mineard
Andrew Appelin the end, you come down to -- hold on, Steve -- you come down to -- from our view
it's about what exposures does each and every person have. And then more
importantly, what impact does it have on their behavior?
Because in the long run, the reason you create demand, you do advertising, is you
want to create purchase and maybe purchase intent. But in the end, it's about sales
lift. If you had to pick one measure that you would use for the entire ecosystem of
advertising, we would assert it would be impact. It wouldn't be viewership.
Viewership is a means to an end.
And so whether it's Facebook or Google or Simulmedia or any participant in that
ecosystem, the goal is ultimately to ﬁgure out what each and every person is
exposed to and what each and every person then does with that information. And
that's the angle we come from -- let's build a dataset of 100 million households, link
it to Rentrak's 50 million or 40 million set-top boxes. And actually be able to then not
just measure conceptually from an analytic and insight standpoint. But from an actual
behavior standpoint for those actual people. What are they actually seeing and what
are they actually doing?
And the more the system can support it. And the more you can then move to that
next, ultimately, real-time environment -- because that's what you want to do, right?
You want to basically then be able to move in real time, not look backward at what
happened and then reinvent the next year. That's what the digital world taught us, is
you want to reinvent the next minute. And right now, programmatic is on views. And
most of the players are basically optimizing on viewership. Our view is if we can get
sales measures and lift and impact measures and scale, you could optimize on that.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
So Andrew, do you see two complementary solutions operating in parallel, or is this
a race to the ﬁnish line and winner takes all?
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
Well I think they'll have to live in complement for a reasonable period of time
because of the legacy way in which TV has been bought. And so it's an ecosystem
that has existed for a long time that has to do with upfronts and lineality. And so it
will be, until the system changes, the secondary system, which will eﬀectively be the
ability to adjust in real time the exposures at an individual level based on their
behavior, not just based on what they see, will run in parallel.
It will become an optimization engine for that ﬁrst. And then, as I think TV becomes
addressable, the more television becomes addressable, the more the idea of
sample-based or metric-based -- you know, you'll end up buying the inventory
based on did it actually change the behavior of the consumer in my product? And I
think someday Facebook will move. You know, if they could get measurement and
scale, I think -- I don't know, I can't speak for Brad. But I would imagine that you
would sell inventory based on --FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Craig Mineard
Brad Smallwood{BIO 16578627 <GO>}
Before Brad jumps in, I suppose we have a slightly diﬀerent point of view on how this
will evolve in terms of the broader measurement space and your question about
coexisting measures, Craig. We believe that, from the point of view of exposure or
reach, there is real beneﬁt to having a single, independent referee on the ﬁeld. So
that is someone who has the capability and the scale and the independence to form
a view as to how many people saw a particular piece of content or a particular
advertising at one period of time.
We also believe that on top of that, the eﬀectiveness measures, whether they be
basic research measures like brand recall, purchase intent, which is still important for
some categories of cars that are purchased with a cycle that's very long, or whether
it's ultimately to Andrew's point about purchase, that those metrics will become
more and more important.
However, you can't get to those without a common view of exposure. That view
needs to come from one place. That view needs to be provided by an independent
player, not someone who's selling media and not someone who's buying media
because of the integrity and the trust that's required there.
On top of that, every marketer wants a slightly diﬀerent ﬂavor. They're coming to
Simulmedia, they're coming to Facebook asking for diﬀerent things. And every
media seller wants to tell a slightly diﬀerent story. So I think to have one independent
standard in eﬀectiveness will not happen. But we can't see a world where you move
away from one standard.
And the last comment I'd make is if you compare media markets across the world
where there is one independent third-party measure and you compare the growth
rate of the media compared to where there is either an industry committee that sits
as an intermediary or there are multiple metrics in the marketplace, the growth rate
of the media where there is one referee on the ﬁeld is always higher than the growth
rate where there isn't, like for like.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
Brad, as someone maybe on the outside looking in. But the beneﬁciary of
measurement targeting having been at the forefront for a lot of that, what would you
say to some of the arguments put forth today. And what advice would you give or
coaching to maybe guys that are more focused on linear?
{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
Well maybe we could take a slightly diﬀerent slant. Instead of focusing on the
measurement answer, we'd focus on the actual problem, which is how our
advertisers, like how should they be buying media? What's the most eﬀective way for
them to be mining media? And if you look back many years ago, their only choiceFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Steve Haskerwas to buy large television shows. It made total sense to do what they're doing,
which is they'd buy media and they'd look at that.
Increasinglywith digital and more and more forms and addressable TV, there's now
the ability to actually buy consumers. And buy consumers that maybe have certain
buying behavior; to understand consumers across all of the media that they're
consuming. So TV, online, all that together. And actually manage the buy at a
consumer level instead of looking at it like television, digital, mobile, social -- you
have all these diﬀerent silos -- it's actually tying that all together.
And where I think the ultimate currency is going, at least on this reach measure, is
what we need is consistency across all of those. And the more that we can bring that
consistency so it's not us measuring ourselves or others measuring themselves, it's
actually a third party doing that. As Steve mentioned, that ﬂoats all boats within the
market. And that actually ends up being a really good thing for the market.
So we see that that consistency is a really important part of driving overall media
eﬀectiveness. But we do think that it needs to become more and more granular over
time. And honestly, like some of the work that Nielsen's doing with total ad ratings
and digital ad ratings and DCR and all that is certainly a step in that direction, which
is great.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
So do you see a real line of sight to cross-platform measurement? There was an e-
Marketer article toward the end of last year where I think that topic ranked extremely
highly. And yet most of the respondents said that that wasn't being met today and
wasn't coming any time soon.
{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
It's certainly happening today. Is it at the end line? I don't think it's at the end line.
But it's certainly happening today. And with TAR, it's certainly happening and lots of
campaigns are going that way.
I think there's a lot of places still to go there. But we've made major strides over the
last four or ﬁve years, which I think is, again, good for the entire digital and the TV
ecosystem, because what we do know from all the studies that everybody's run
across all media, is that as people are exposed to media across diﬀerent platforms, it
actually makes both forms of media a lot more impactful.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
So a rising tide lifts all boats.
{BIO 16578627 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23
Meta Platforms Inc (META US Equity)
Page 8 of 18Dave MorganYes, one of the things you've got to look at in that sort of study like that e-Marketer is
study is who are the respondents? I think there are digital publishers. And
Facebook's not one of them. But there are digital publishers who like to tell a story
about their size based on, to Andrew's point about based on views or uniques or
something. When you actually calibrate that back to time and attention, they're tiny.
So they have beneﬁted from the Wild West of many, many metrics.
I think there are also TV companies for whom they're getting a price point for their
digital inventory because of lack of supply that is higher than their TV CPMs. And
therefore there's a level of trepidation about true cross-platform measurement. So
you've always go to go a level beneath and look at whose ox is gored if we truly
move to true cross-platform measurement.
As Brad said, that's what we've enabled. And now the question is how fast do people
move? And that is answered by who wins and who loses.
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
So Craig, I think one of the ways to think about it is, having spent most of my career
in the pure digital world. But now the last seven years in a pure linear TV world, the
adult table that we never got to sit at was the TV money. And it always sat in its own
silo under its own metrics and its own buyers and its own measurement. And it never
had to be accountable to anything else. And that's changing. And it's changing
pretty quickly. And it's changing because there's now massive amounts of direct
measurement being brought to bear.
There is a lot of pressure on the industry. There's a pricing model that, the fact that
you're worth one-ﬁftieth as much at 11.01 watching ESPN Sports Center as you were
at 10.59 because you moved out of prime time is pretty ridiculous when you really
should be focusing on what customer you're buying.
And because there's enough digital back-end and digital data, you can now actually
start matching this to a lot of the other datasets. I mean, Nielsen now has Arbitron in
the same household and can start really thinking about radio and TV and how they
work together.
And so I think what's going to happen is you are going to have a lot of change very
quickly. You're going to have the digital channels will work together well. But the TV
is now going to be pulled in and have to contend with everybody else. And that
didn't happen before. And that's going to put a lot of dynamism in the marketplace.
And it's not going to just sort out because Nielsen puts a number out. You're going
to see a lot of individual companies.
And we've got Turner, NBCU, Viacom, each with their own new eﬀorts, which is great.
There's probably going to be ﬁve more companies by this upfront that will have
press releases out, because there's about eight paid companies. So ﬁve more. And
the three that have them out will have ﬁve more press releases. And we're going to
see a lot of diﬀerent ﬂavors of innovation that will lead to some more change.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Andrew Appel{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
Yes, I'll blend a little bit of what Brad said and a little bit of what Martin said. I mean,
in the end, you do all this to target an individual person to change their behavior or
their perception of your brand so they actually do something. And so anything that
amalgamates an audience to a group, right? The people that are watching that show
at 11.01, those 3 million people, have incredibly diﬀerent behavioral characteristics.
And so as long as you keep aggregating and looking at the media as big --
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
I can't disagree. It's quite diﬀerent than when they were a 15 million block. Because
actually, at 11.01, it's probably about 1.1 million. And they are actually carrying -- I
mean, with their own data, they're carrying a lot of characteristics that are quite
diﬀerent than the 400 other choices available at that time.
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
Yes. But I think their actual behavioral propensities are very diﬀerent. And unless you
can get the datasets together, it's kind of meaning -- and the only dataset that has
scale right now on TV is the Rentrak data.
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
That's not true. We have more data than Rentrak. We have more data than Rentrak.
So that's not true.
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}

Steve Hasker{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
Because agencies don't have an interest in them having a clue about it. I mean, we're
working with 90 of the top brands of the top 250. We're doing some work together.
So -- we're doing a campaign together right now, I think.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
You guys should exchange business cards.
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
No. But I think the end state is at the individual level, to understand the exposure
and then to understand the impact. And everything that goes in between is just
interim steps. And the variation is extremely high. And the level of accuracy of the
data is getting worse, not better.
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
I agree with that. My only --
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
Fragmentation is making it more diﬃcult.
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
But I do agree that reach matters, because I think you need to know who's actually
been exposed to the messages to understand the diﬀerent behaviors and the
behavior changes and how propensity is created that you can then convert. But
we're much more in agreement than in disagreement.
{BIO 16578627 <GO>}
I had one other comment on it. I think we do as much work with big data as anybody.
We've been working with the Facebook registration dataset now for six or seven
years. We've been working with the Catalina loyalty card data for about the same
period of time. We have 80% of the credit and debit card purchases, where we
process them every day.
Here's the downside. And I think we've done a lot of work with Simulmedia on this as
well, which is these big datasets have, as Andrew said, tremendous precision for
those who actually are producing the data. So in other words, what about the people
who purchase products using cash? What about the 20% of Americans who don't
have cable or satellite? You have to include them. If you're going to be
representative of the population, you have to include them.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Andrew AppelIf you're going to produce analytics to show what happens when a particular person
is exposed to a message, that's a diﬀerent task. And that's an interesting task. I think
that's a good business to be in. It happens not to be the one that we spend much
time on. But there's a lot of fact and a lot of ﬁction about the data out there. There's a
lot of fact and a lot of ﬁction about the roles of the diﬀerent metrics that are
produced. And I think everyone's at fault, including us.
I think what I'm looking forward to over the next 12 months is just much more
illumination of what data sources do, how they can and can't be combined. And
what purposes they serve. Because I think that is going to make, to Brad's earlier
point, life much easier for arguably the most important constituent in any of these
conversations, which is the advertiser.
{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
And just one little last piece on there. We're describing advertising as somebody
sees an ad and they go all the way through the process. And then they love a brand
and then they purchase. And that happens on an ad or it doesn't happen on an ad.
The reality is, the actual impact of an ad is the attribution of many diﬀerent
touchpoints that an advertiser has. And so like you can't just track every impression
to either convert or non-convert. There's always -- there's like this complicated
modeling that goes on that is not deterministic. It's a science. But it's not
deterministic. And I think we have to be careful about setting people's expectations
that that's what measurement is, that you're going to be able to follow an impression
all the way through to a transaction or an end outcome every time.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
But Brad, don't you think there's merit in chasing that dream. So the Holy Grail of
connecting those dots. And if you can only do that for a subset of the audience and
you catch everyone else through more generic --
{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
It's looking at that lift that's created. But it's always -- it's not one person. It's always
you're always looking at groups of people and understanding, on average, with like
test and control or all this kind of stuﬀ. So I won't go into the details.
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
Yes. And I agree with that. I think it's a portfolio of exposures for individuals or very
small segments. I mean, it's not segments of 10; it's segments of 2 million over time.
And they have a portfolio of exposures. And the analytics need to be fast enough
and sophisticated enough to be able to model out how that portfolio of exposures
and experiences changes their behavior. But in the end, the datasets today are
fragmenting so quickly, it's becoming diﬃcult just to ﬁgure out the portfolio of
exposure.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Andrew Appel{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
So I agree it's fragmenting. But the data integrity issues are real. When you look at
like the cookies, I guess how digital measures, right, or used to measure, or still does.
When you look at like the actual -- like you look at cookies and how they operate on
mobile and how you tie them across devices, it's a very complicated process. And it
is very diﬃcult to tie all that together. And we see lots of conversions disappearing
into the ether because of that. And so Steve's point about the data integrity issues
are real and need to be dealt with as well.
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
And I think one of the things that's important, living in a world of the highly granular
data, I mean, one of the things that happened when we started working with Nielsen
more than six years ago, when we got the data and we compared all of this actual
viewing data to their data. And we're going to show it at an Advertising Research
Foundation event, I mean, immediately, it was like, "Oh, my god, this is going to be
embarrassing and they're going to try to shut us down and the contract -- "
Then we found out that the panel held up. It did what you would have expected, in
that it actually very well mirrored the actual viewing. And obviously, there was
granularity you could see in the direct viewing. And so I think one of the things that's
going to be really critical is going to be when you can have integrity in panels and
groups of people where you've got no fraud, no box, no cookie-changing all of the
time, those components are going to be critical. They'll be parts of. And whether at
the center or on the side, of how all of the measurements are going to be, whether
it's going to be at the conversion or otherwise.
Because as we know, the last thing we want is a supply chain that looks like the
(inaudible) non-walled garden digital world, because it's just pollution. And I feel
responsible. I built a couple of the companies that are part of that.

I'm conscious of time. I want to leave some time for Q&A. Given that there's a
number of public investors, public company investors in the room, I thought maybe
just to close the panel discussion before we open it up, to go down the panel. And if
there's a company out there that you see that's interesting and to the speciﬁc theme
that you would want to highlight for the beneﬁt of public company investors in the
room, what would that be? Andrew?
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
Well I can't speak to a speciﬁc thing. But I keep coming back to the fragmentation of
viewability and what people, what audiences and what exposures they see. So
there's a company out there. And maybe it's yours, that is able to pull together at
scale across all the platforms what exposures. And then what impact it has on the
actual behavior. Because in the end, the behavior change, the sales lift, or the brandFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Craig Mineardmeasures are what matters. That's what you do it for. And all the data that we look at
shows that there's a massive amount of variation in any program or any campaign on
the actual sales lift associated with the campaign. So all the targeting, all the work it's
doing, does not have any impact. So if you can ﬁnd a company that's doing that,
then it's highly valuable.
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
Well I love these two public companies, by the way. So I'll say them. But my view on
the television ecosystem is that TV is going to face a lot of headwinds. It will matter
who's running it. And it matters what they do. I mean, you would note -- and just look
at Les Moonves in the last 10 years. I mean, he made a diﬀerence. And so I think -- I
mean, the companies I called out before -- NBCU. So Comcast NBCU, TWX, Turner.
And Viacom -- all three of them are taking at least pioneering steps in making
massive investments in data and technology and new sales organization to sell in a
diﬀerent kind of way. How successful they are, we'll see. But if you look at six, even,
or eight companies there, you've got three that are at least saying, "We don't want to
be caught by the bare behind."
{BIO 16578627 <GO>}
Yes, I'll make -- I'm not going to name a speciﬁc company. But I think I'd build on
Dave's point. I think there's an acute need for some leadership in the TV industry.
And it's speciﬁcally to tell their story. One trivial example is the use of the word TV. I
don't think they can quite ﬁgure out, "Are we TV or are video?" because everyone
loves video. Everyone wants to invest in video companies. The TV networks have the
best video out there. They still have the best video. And they probably will for a
period of time. And yet the story is not a sexy one and it's not a coherent one across
the industry to the advertiser and to the rest of the ecosystem. So I think that's one.
The second one is our view of the future. And we've invested against this in the last
ﬁve or six years, is a combination of highly representative, very high-quality, in-
person recruited panels, where all of the media exposure is measured, not just TV or
not just radio, combined with big data. It's not one or the other. And we do not
believe that one or the other suﬃciently works. And I think the guy to my right
ﬁgured this out many years ago. It was one of the reasons why he started working
with Nielsen and also one of the reasons why he's accumulated the largest
repository of return path data in the world. I think he'd say what he's done is a proxy
for that combination of panel data and return path data. He's not your public --
{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
We don't comment on speciﬁc competitors. I will say the concept of buying across
all diﬀerent forms of media is a very interesting space. And I think there's a lot of
development there.

Dave MorganI just wonder what you guys think in terms of whether WeChat has gotten closer to
the Holy Grail of being able to show an ad impression and then actually provide
payment and track the payments, i.e., they run ads and they can say, "Sales went up
this amount because of it"?
{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
I actually can't comment directly on WeChat stuﬀ.
{BIO 16578627 <GO>}
I think it's a great example. I think, for everyone in the room who hasn't had a look at
it, I think it's worth looking at. There is the problem that Brad talked about, which is
attribution, right? People who are on WeChat are also on many other platforms.
They're also getting many other exposures. And you've always got to be careful
about some of these metrics which say, "If you spend a dollar on our platform, sales
will go up by the following." Because if you add all those claims up, the GDP in
China or the GDP in the US, whatever the geographic territory is, will double or triple
or times 11 in a period of time. So you need that multi-touch attribution and that
comprehensive market view.
One is on the attribution. I mean, TV always seems to get a slack on it. All the new
digital ad guys get asked, "What's your ROIC? What's your ROI? What's your ROI?"
TV just says, "Hi. we're just catching up to them. We're there."
The second is, what's the diﬀerence between, on the privacy issues in following and
tracking in Europe versus US, especially just given all the changes? So two disparate
questions. But --
{BIO 16390685 <GO>}
I'll jump on the ﬁrst. One of the reasons that TV's been behind in the ROI game is
that virtually all of the measurement historically was done in media mix or marketing
mix models, which slipped last year. And was only based on a gross rating point by a
network basis, sometimes broken out by day parts. So there was no granularity in the
data. And then you had to make a human judgment. And so it -- and it didn't care,
because it didn't have to prove itself.
Unidentiﬁed Participant (inaudible ? microphone inaccessible) should be held to the
same standard as digital guys. That's all.
No, no, they're not, because in most cases, it's done for channel, channel driving and
management. And if McDonald's takes the spend down in Milwaukee by 20 pointsFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Unidentiﬁed Participanton TV, they lose three points of market share that week. And they get yelled at and
they put it back up. And so it is held to a diﬀerent standard. It's not been held to an
empirical standard.
Is there anyone else that wants to comment, whether it's the same standard or
diﬀerent standard and why?
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
You know, I think the standard is changing quickly and that television is going to
have to be held to the same standard as digital. So I think we do a ton of the mix
modeling. And I think historically, to my colleague's point, they were retroactive. And
I think going forward in the next 12 months, I think by attributing impact and sales lift
and other measures directly to each and every ad exposure on television, we'll end
up with the same level of measure. Although it may not be view, it will be ROI.
{BIO 16578627 <GO>}
So I think that when it comes to reach exposure, TV has had a much higher standard
than digital ever has -- much higher, since the ﬁrst days, right? As a digital publisher,
I can claim just about anything, or I could until digital ad ratings came along. I could
claim just about anything. And as long as it wasn't completely haywire against a
monthly audience estimate and/or a server log information, I was ﬁne. I went on to
the next campaign.
TV, if I didn't hit the audience as measured by Nielsen, I had to make good. I think
where your point comes in as to around attribution, TV has not historically been held
accountable to move a product -- not explicitly. As Dave said, implicitly it's always
been there, whether a hard-edged form or not.
And the digital folks have been much quicker to go there. But I think you're starting
to see the TV folks catch up. Simulmedia is driving a lot of this. Dave will oﬀer to
advertisers a guarantee and a make-good based on ROI number. And I think you're
seeing players like CBS, with their campaign performance audit, do the same.
The diﬀerence is both of those companies are leaning into independent measures.
So they're not captive metrics. They're not grading their own homework. And that is
where the market needs to go. And when we get everybody to that point, the same
reach metrics and the same accountability metrics, then this whole conversation
goes away.

Who wants the privacy question?
{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
Europe versus US, digital, maybe digital might have a tougher time over the next 10
years in Europe.
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
I was a privacy lawyer in a previous life. I wouldn't be operating in Europe. I just, I
don't think -- I mean, A, you're operating against, you're not going to be able to
operate personalized data businesses in Europe. I mean, you just can't. And you
won't have a predictability against it.
And I should have called out CBS as one of the TV companies before. Dave
(Holback) would kill me for having forgotten that. Their CPA measure was really
strong independent measure. So I'd put that as the four public companies I would
have mentioned.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
Do we have time for one more? Or do we have one more?
You talk about tracking a third-party service to be able to track people, track
conversions. It seems like Facebook has a real advantage of that on their own
because they have the logged-in user. They can follow them across devices. So how
do you straddle that line of a third party coming in and helping you grow the overall
business versus having that competitive advantage?
{BIO 2214725 <GO>}
I think there's no question that we have our identity asset with 1.59 billion people is
an advantage. But as Steve mentioned, people don't want a media company
measuring itself. And so the question -- and what we've done with DAR and TAR and
we've done it with more than just Nielsen, with other companies as well -- is having
third parties come in and leverage some of our assets in order to do the third-party
measurement, because people don't want us measuring ourselves. And so that's
really been our strategy, is using, like enabling third-party measurement by using our
data assets.
Just one last one there. And then we should wrap.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23

Craig MineardMost of the conversation has been about aﬀecting or causing transactions, yet at
least in some of the businesses I've been in, there's an awful lot of advertising that's
done in order to retain customers, particularly when there's recurring revenue
streams, as well as to generate brand loyalty, which leads to transaction down the
line. So how do you deal with the impact that advertising has on both -- on the issue
of loyalty and customer retention as opposed to transactions?
{BIO 16578627 <GO>}
So we can probably all take a crack at that. I think it's a great question. So the
framework that we put in place a number of years ago that's been picked up as a
primary ad sales tool in many major media companies is we provide metrics on three
dimensions. Firstly, how many people did your campaign reach? Those are the
ratings. Secondly, did that campaign resonate? So in other words, did some of the
basic research metrics move brand recall, purchase intent. We use neuroscience as
one of the measures there. Did your brain react to a message? Then last but not
least, to Andrew's point, reaction. What was the ROI? Did the consumer go and buy
more of the product?
And the fact of the matter is diﬀerent marketers lean in diﬀerently to those three
metrics. Some are very, very focused on rates for the reasons you outlined. Others
are exhaustively focused on reaction, on the actual purchase because they're in the
transaction business, because they have fast purchase cycles. And many are still in
the middle.
And I'll tell you, a lot of the automotive guys are still in the middle because they're
building brands over decades, for better or worse. And they recognize that their
campaigns, to be successful, need to continue to further those brands.
{BIO 21415142 <GO>}
Yes, I think I would add that -- we have a set of measures that you build towards each
and every one of those against the actual exposure. So the goal on our side is to
build a real-time measure of sales lift, a real-time measure of the impact on brand
eﬀect, which is still work in progress. Think of it as a penetration. Then an actual
metric of its intent. So in the auto world, if a KPI is, "Hi. did that person then go on to
visit an auto-related site based on exposure?" then that becomes the measure. And
the idea is that, one, you can get the cross-platform exposure. And then you have a
portfolio of measures that are available in real time against each and every exposure
and link it back to the same modeling science that has been used for mix, except do
it in real time. And to do that, you've got to aggregate data in one platform to be
able to measure it in real time. And then adjust, optimize against it.
{BIO 19074979 <GO>}
Well thank you to the panel. I'm delighted that we could get such a terriﬁc group
here today. I really thank you for the support. And thanks to the audience.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2016-02-23
