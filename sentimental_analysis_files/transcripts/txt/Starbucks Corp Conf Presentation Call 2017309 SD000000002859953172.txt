Thank you, sure.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
So maybe if we could just kind of jump right into it. I think you're all very familiar with
the Company, with the brand. Starbucks is a unique and multifaceted consumer-
products company built around core brands, beyond just coﬀee and tea, that span
the retail and consumer-product channels.
So that said, let's just start oﬀ high level. As we look out over the next ﬁve years,
where do you see the biggest opportunities for growth contribution? Maybe we'll
start there, Scott.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. And maybe I'll start internationally and I'll come back to the US.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09

Page 2 of 19What I have to do is start in China. When we look across Asia broadly. But speciﬁcally
in China, the strength of the Starbucks brand has never been better. And you've
seen the numbers. We've had the highest proﬁt growth, the highest revenue growth.
And the highest comp growth from our cap segment almost every quarter over the
last few years. And China being a big piece of that, although increasingly, speciﬁcally
from a proﬁt standpoint since we brought back Japan -- Japan contributing
meaningfully.
So when we look in China and we look at the customer experience and importantly
what's happening in our stores with our partners and how we're bringing coﬀee to
life for our Chinese customers, there's a tremendous amount of momentum.
And I think that has to do with the fact that Starbucks is a well-known brand in China.
But I think more importantly, it has to do with how we're executing around the brand
proposition for Chinese customers.
So again, not a huge coﬀee industry in China when we entered nearly 20 years ago.
But we've been building that over time. It's primarily an afternoon day part. You've
got customers that come in in groups. So ticket is quite a bit higher in the US. And
we've been able to roll out concepts, elevated concepted, like Reserve.
When we rolled Cold Brew in the US, we were able to quickly follow with Cold Brew
in China. And it added a point of comp in the very First Quarter that we rolled it in
China.
So those up-levelled coﬀee experiences are resonating very well with Chinese
consumers. We're opening 500 stores a year in China. It's a big number, a big
country. There's a lot of opportunity there.
And when we look at those stores, every year, not just the top-line contribution from
the new stores is the highest. But the overall proﬁt continues to break records.
And the existing stores -- in some cities when we roll those out, we'll see comps go
down a bit. But they recover very quickly. And overall, despite the fact that we're
growing the portfolio in the 25% range, we're still seeing very strong mid; to upper-
single-digit comps in China.
So the experience there, the things we're doing in the country around coﬀee -- in
Yunnan Province, we've got a Farmer Support Center there. We've invested in a mill.
We're really trying to get local coﬀee production, a lot of local coﬀee production up
to our standards. And we're making a good headwind there. So China is really going
to be the fast-growing market for us. And in many ways, we're just getting started.
Japan is a country that we entered even farther ago than China. It was our ﬁrst
international market outside of North America. Japan has been very proﬁtable for us
since the acquisition. When I go back to the business case, we're exceeding on allFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09

Page 3 of 19fronts, even though comps haven't quite done as well as we'd hoped recently.
Overall revenue, store growth, proﬁtability -- Japan has been very successful for us.
We had a great most recent quarter, where we innovated around both food and
beverage. So we know we have a strong customer proposition in Japan. We have
1,100 stores, a very high-revenue market for us. The unit volumes in Japan, they look
more like the US. So those stores are full of customers. And the slight acceleration
we've had in units has been really proﬁtable. So we're seeing the same types of unit
dynamics in Japan, with a little bit of an opportunity that we're seeing in our recent
store openings around drive-through. So Japan's got drive-through opportunities.
Then EMEA -- as you know, in Europe, Middle East. And Africa -- that has been a
market that we're largely moving license. So over 80% of the stores are licensed.
Practically every new store we open is in a licensed market.
Some of that is the cost pressure. But also in markets like the Middle East, where our
partner Alshaya has -- approaching 1,000 stores -- just the local knowledge around
real estate and supply chain and employment -- and we've been able to see EMEA
system comps in the 3%, 4%, 5% over the last year despite the fact that Continental
Europe is in tough shape economically.
And so across the globe, the Starbucks brand has never been stronger. We opened
over 2,000 stores last year. Only about 30% of those are in the US. So it's very much
an international store-growth story. And the stores are growing proﬁtably. And we
feel really good about international.
So that's international in three minutes or less for Starbucks .
Then domestically -- and we may get into some of this -- you've really got to point to
the innovation that we've got going across a number of diﬀerent spots.
Forever, for 20-plus years now, we've been the leader around beverage innovation.
And obviously around coﬀee. And when you look at coﬀee -- and I'll just use one
example, although I could use many -- if you take Cold Brew, which is a product that
we launched a couple years ago to augment our iced-coﬀee business.
It's -- I personally think it's a smoother, better representation -- some people like iced
coﬀee. I look Cold Brew better. It's cold-steeped for 20 hours in the back of the store
and then served. Increasingly, we're now serving Cold Brew in a tap. Then we've
launched in 600 stores Nitro Cold Brew. And all of that -- and then last summer, we
had Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, which was highly successful.
And so as we've launched Cold Brew, what we've realized is, we have a platform that
we can innovate on. Over the holiday, we had Spiced Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold
Brew -- all using ingredients that are in the store, to add a little bit to the platform
and adding nicely to comps.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09

Page 4 of 19Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Scott MawSo we're continue to innovate around beverage. Iced beverage is growing faster
than hot beverage in Starbucks, even in the most recent quarter, which last I checked
was winter.
So we know iced beverage is on trend. Iced teas are over 10% of our revenue, over
$1 billion in sales, growing faster than the average product. We've seen a point of
comp from tea almost every quarter since we launched Teavana a few years ago.
It's on trend. It's healthy, better for you, easier to attach food. So you're going to see
a lot of things this summer again around iced tea and innovation there, as well as
other cold beverages.
Then food -- ﬁve years ago at Starbucks stores in the US, food was 15% of total sales.
And we said back then, we think we can meaningfully improve food through our La
Boulange acquisition. And now ﬁve years later, you roll it forward, it's 20% of sales.
We ﬁnally broke that level.
And I think there was a lot of people skeptical of whether we could do food,
particularly at the lunch day part, at a scale in our traditionally recognized coﬀee
houses. And in fact, we've grown it at 5 points of revenue.
And as we look forward, we think over the next ﬁve years, it can double. It can get to
25% of revenue. Again, some people are unsure about that. But I just point to the
momentum we have, the opportunities that we have at lunch.
We've innovated recently around sort of a more healthy skew around Sous Vide Egg
Bites. And those have been highly successful. So they're sous vide prepared. One is
the egg white and roasted red pepper. And there's another there's bacon gruyere
cheese. And those are doing extremely well. We've got a gluten-free breakfast
sandwich coming. So there's lots of room in food in the morning day part.
Then at lunch, this spring to early summer we'll test in Chicago an up-levelled fresh
experience -- so made that day, consumed that day. And we'll see how big that can
go.
Then -- almost done with the ﬁrst question . The last piece of innovation I have --.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
You're stealing all my questions (multiple speakers).
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
So the last piece of the question -- I have to just talk brieﬂy about the digital ﬂywheel,
kind of the big corporate name that we talk about mobile, loyalty. And then
payment, which includes our gift card. But increasingly social gifting and things
around payment.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 5 of 19Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Scott MawAnd so you guys all know, we've innovated signiﬁcantly around the app. We now
have nearly 13 million members in our Starbucks Rewards program. We just ﬁnished
the roll-out of real-time suggested selling within the app.
We've seen mobile orders at 8% of transactions, an important metric, which I'm sure
we'll get to. We now have 1200 stores, or so, where that is above 20% at peak, which
shows how well the adoption is. And the scale of that growth has been almost
logarithmic. It was 200 stores in June. Then it went to 600. Now it's nearly 1200.
And so that's a great customer reception. It's putting some pressure on some stores,
which we can talk about. But what that mobile app allows us to do is not only make it
convenient for our customers. But increase the interaction with them.
So when they're in the app, they're interacting with Starbucks. So we can push what
we call a star dash, which is a gamiﬁcation of our loyalty program. And that's been
highly successful. And we've been using big data, one-to-one personalization. And
we've seen a real acceleration in spend per member over the last couple of years.
We now have in the app, given how successful it is, we have favorite orders. So you
can just pull up an order that you have -- that you use all the time.
I've got an order for my family -- I have three kids and my wife. And it's probably 12
diﬀerent items. And before favorite orders, I had to punch all that stuﬀ in and all the
modiﬁcations. And my kids have some crazy modiﬁcations that they like. And now I
just pull that order up. And I go. Favorite stores -- and so we're seeing real
momentum in both the number of new members and spend.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
And just to follow up on that point -- it's early still, right, as far as your digital
ﬂywheel? I don't know what (any of you would) characterize it as. But -- I mean, you
are just now starting to ramp on the personalization, the direct market, etc.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
That's right. It's deﬁnitely early innings.
My view of the change in the Rewards program -- so last April, we went from a
frequency-based program to a spend-based program. And there's all sorts of
ﬁnancial reasons to do that. But we also heard a lot from our customers that -- I
spend more at Starbucks. I do more at Starbucks. I should get more at Starbucks.
We also knew there was a fair bit of transaction-splitting activity, where people would
stand there with a bagel and a coﬀee and split the order to get two stars.
So we went at both those opportunities last April. And when we rolled it, we
expected two things to happen -- spend per member to go up. And the number of
members to go up. Both those things would have been great.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 6 of 19Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Scott MawWhat happened when we made the changes is, it was a lot of change for customers.
So we changed how they earn, how they redeem, what the app looks like, how they
interact with us in every way digitally. And I think there was just a quarter or two
where people were trying to adapt to all that change. And the biggest indicator for
me is, we saw Reward redemptions decrease signiﬁcantly following the change.
So back at headquarters, people were running around saying, hey, we can release all
the star accrual and increase our revenue. And I was like, hey, let's take it easy. We
actually want these things to be redeemed.
And once customers got accustomed to moving from 12 visits and 12 stars to
whatever the visits are, earning 125 stars (and routine) -- once that adjusted, all those
redemptions came right back in line.
We got a quarter or two in it. And that spend-per-member growth, which didn't pop
after the launch like we thought, has now come all the way back up into the
(business case). And by the time we get one year after, it'll be ahead.
New-customer growth was a little bit slower than we expected, as well. But we made
up a big chunk of that gap in the most recent quarter. So that's a long way of saying,
we're in the very early innings. We just got in-app personalization launched within
the last few months. So we're just getting started.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
That's great. And we'll come back to some of digital piece. In the Americas with
same-store sales, as you think about the mid-single-digit target that you've got out
there and the competition of that target, how that looks going forward, thinking
about beverage and tea and food, is there a right way to think about the
contribution -- you outlined everything that's going on -- is there a right way to think
about the contribution from a bunch of those pieces?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think so. It's a good question.
Let's just take 5 as a number to tag around, middle of mid-single digit. I believe we
can do 1 to 2 points from price. Now, we have to be really careful with price. We take
it carefully over time, by product, by geography. And we watch it closely. But we
believe that price can continue. And it's been in that range for the last few years.
We can get 1 point or 2 from food. Now, over the last few years, it's been 2 or 3. But I
think as we look forward -- ﬁrst of all, the numbers are getting bigger. So the math
matters. But I think as we look forward with the success we've had at both breakfast
and lunch, I think 1 to 2 points of comp for food is entirely doable.
I think we can get 1 point of comp from tea on average. Maybe some quarters it
won't be 1 point. But my guess is every year it will be, on average over the year.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 7 of 19Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Scott MawThen we typically get 1 point of comp each year from innovation. Some quarters,
that'll be 2. And some quarters it won't quite round to 1. But that's when we launch
something like Flat White or Cold Brew. For that ﬁrst year following it, we'll consider
that innovation. And so we can get that.
Then the core platform continues to grow in most quarters -- setting aside the most
recent quarter or two. That's espresso, Frappuccino, brewed coﬀee. And so over the
last few years, that's been 1 point or 2 of comp pretty much every quarter.
So you add that up, it's more than 5 (I guess) on the high end. The reality is, in any
given quarter, you don't hit all of them. But on average, we should.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
Great. So I guess thinking about the last few quarters -- on an absolute basis,
phenomenal numbers, a little bit lower than Starbucks is used to seeing. Can you talk
a little bit about the key drags that you've seen over the last few quarters and how
you see those evolving over the next couple of quarters?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. It's a fair question.
If I look at -- let's just take the most recent quarter, which was a 3. We'll pick the low
mark. And again, let's just compare it to a 5, which would be our expectation.
So the ﬁrst thing I want everyone to know is, we're not happy with a 3. We don't try
to explain it away. We don't try to say, hey, it's the environment or weather. That's not
what we're about. We expect a 5. And we're not delivering that.
But to answer your question, we do have some analytics around why we've seen it
slow a bit. And there are three big drivers.
The ﬁrst is, there is a macro impact from restaurant, away-from-home occasions. And
we participate in a big index. And it's a -- it's not a public index (inaudible). There are
tens of thousands of restaurants that go into this index.
And what we know is, we can track ticket and traﬃc -- it's all on a no-name basis. But
we know where we are versus the index. And you can go back years. And there's
always a gap between Starbucks and the index. What happened last March, or so, is
that index went sharply negative. And we went down towards zero.
And so we're -- we've never been immune to that macro index. The correlation isn't 1.
But it's pretty high. And so we know that that's a headwind that's out there.
As we look forward, we're not assuming that's getting better. We're assuming it's
there. And we've got to comp through it. But that's deﬁnitely there. And that's been
there since the slow-down in comps starting last spring.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 8 of 19The second thing is, the math of the comparisons got really hard as we started to
comp against some very, very big numbers in ﬁscal 2015. And so we did 7s, 8s. And
9s for a while. If you go to the two-year comps and look at the two-year stack, they've
been pretty consistent.
Now, we don't talk a lot about two-year comps publicly. We talk about it a lot and we
use it a lot in our modeling within the Company, as you can imagine, because our
expectation is, hey, if last year was a 10, we're still going to do at least a 5. That's the
way we think about it.
But the reality is, the math looking forward, those comparisons get a little bit easier.
We still have to execute. We're not just going to sort of drift our way over those
comps and have good numbers.
But when we look at -- I talked about this, the innovation around the digital ﬂywheel
that's coming this summer and the innovation around all the products -- that's going
to help us leverage some lower numbers from the prior year.
Then the last thing that we talked about just a little bit -- and you and I were talking
about this earlier -- if I could rewind the clock on the earnings call, I think that would
change things a bit.
So what we talked about on the earnings call is, we have a relatively small
percentage, about 1200 of our stores, that had some challenges, particularly in
December, around Mobile Order & Pay. And the reality is on those stores, if you take
a step back is, those stores, even before we launched Mobile Order & Pay, they were
some of our busiest stores.
And it's not capacity constraint, because we look at stores that look like those stores
and they've continued to be some of our highest-comping stores. So we can
continue to drive comps within those busy stores. But for a number of reasons
there's capacity opportunities in those stores.
So we launched Mobile Order & Pay. I'm looking at the same 1200 stores we just
talked about. What we saw when we launched Mobile Order & Pay in those stores is,
they had some of the best transaction growth in the 18 months or so post Mobile
Order & Pay. And even now, where they've seen those transactions ﬂatten and
decline a bit, they're still up signiﬁcantly because of Mobile Order & Pay and some
things we've done around labor.
But what we saw, particularly as we got into the end of the quarter is, those stores
started to have some comp challenges above average. And speciﬁcally what we
were trying to address was the question we were getting, which was -- in Investor
Day, which was early December of last year, we sort of reaﬃrmed that we were going
to have a 4 for the quarter. Then we missed it by a bit. And we had a 3.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 9 of 19Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Scott MawAnd so what we were trying to do is say, hey, look, Mobile Order & Pay is still
positive. But we just saw a little bit at our busiest time in holiday, we just saw a little
bit of pressure. And that's what happened.
What I think happened with the story, or with investors -- and we heard this after -- is,
we were saying that Mobile Order & Pay was a problem for comps. It's additive to
comps. It's just in that ﬂow and in that month we saw some pressure.
Now, the opportunity, though, is signiﬁcant out of the back of that. So we continue to
add stores. So we now have 1200 stores more than 20% at peak -- that number
continues to go up. So we're going to continue to have challenges if we don't ﬁx the
throughput issues.
And so that's the labor improvements that we've done. Those -- we're already seeing
early positive results, not quantitative but qualitative feedback from our stores. We've
got a number of things that we can do on the technology side, a number of things
that we can do on the equipment side. And Adam Brotman, who is our Chief Digital
Oﬃcer. And who built Mobile Order & Pay, has moved to Operations. And he's
helping us ﬁx it.
And so when I look at that -- yes, it's going to help with Mobile Order & Pay. But
some of these things I get excited about because they're just going to help with
throughput broadly. And in most of our stores, we have opportunity with throughput
at peak.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
Yes. And talk about that. Obviously, signiﬁcant sales and traﬃc growth over the years
with the additional of various operational complexities added over the years that
have driven strong sales results. How have you avoided throughput issues in the
past? Is this part of the DNA of Starbucks to work through these issues? Then going
forward, it seems like this can be one of the bigger opportunities that Starbucks has,
not just on the Mobile Order & Pay throughput challenge. But throughput in general
really feels like it could be one of the bigger drivers for comps going forward.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. It's a fantastic question.
We're always working on throughput. That's the reality. I was telling someone earlier,
if you take a store that's coming up for a ten-year lease renewal and it's going to
have a refurbishment -- that store has signiﬁcantly more traﬃc and transactions than
it did at its last ten-year renewal. With a couple points of comp a year, you can get
(the kind of) numbers.
So already, even before what Mobile Order & Pay is doing to increase the
opportunity, we were already looking at those stores and adding ovens, adding
Mastrena machines, improving the workﬂow. If we could improve the space andFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 10 of 19Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Scott Mawseating, we would do all that. That was already in the (bank). That store is doing more
transactions as it is.
With Mobile Order & Pay, we're looking at other things. So a lot of this is in test. And
we'll use parts of it in some of our stores. And some of it we use in all of our stores.
But one of the things we might use in some of our stores is, we've actually opened
some stores with split production. So you walk in, you go to the left-hand side,
there's a Mobile Order & Pay unit with a Mastrena machine and people doing the
hand-oﬀ (plane). And that's where your order is. You go to the right-hand side. And
there's a POS.
And those are some of the things that we'll test that -- I think the Mobile Order & Pay
challenge has lit a bit of a ﬁre around some of that capacity improvement. But it's
always been there.
We look at our staﬃng levels in our stores every day, every quarter, every week.
We're always looking at -- are there places where we could add staﬀ and get the
payback? Are we sub-optimized? How do we get the right staﬀ and the right
partners on the bar so that we can get our customers served?
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
Great. Sticking with the digital ﬂywheel for a minute. Mobile Order & Pay, essentially
roughly 8% or so right now. How has that adoption been relative to your
expectations? Seemingly, it's a robust number to have gone to 8% already. How has
that trended relative to your expectations?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
When I go back and look at the business case, it's almost double what we expected
from a penetration standpoint. And the acceleration -- again, just refresh some
numbers here -- we launched fully nationally on Mobile Order & Pay at the end of
September 2015. It took nine months for us to get 200 stores that had 20% or more
of transactions at peak. The next quarter, September, we were at 600. The next
quarter, December, we're at almost 1200.
So we've got a winner. And so it's running ahead, not only in the numbers of
customers. But the types of transactions. So again, we were talking earlier -- the
business case when we put that together -- we assumed a slightly lower average
ticket, just because you're not in the store and seeing what we're doing with food
and other opportunities. We came in with a ticket that's basically right on top of our
average Starbucks Reward ticket, which was better than we expected.
And now we've launched suggested selling. So as you're building your order (from
earlier) as you're building your order -- for me, when I put my (Clover) into the
basket, if I'm not pulling up a favorite order, the ﬁrst three items that slide in are sous
vide eggs -- that's my favorite; then reduced-fat turkey bacon, because that's my
backup; and then Double-Smoked Bacon Sandwich, because that's my indulgence.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09

Q - Dennis GeigerAnd so we'll continue to get smarter about that. We can do things potentially in the
afternoon when the weather is hot around iced teas and attachments and things that
are a bit lighter. And we're literally just cracking that open from an opportunity with
big data.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
That's great. As it relates to everything you're doing with digital -- I think we've
gotten some questions on this -- eﬀectually just punch card, let's just say. What was
the logic behind that? If you could just speak to that and give us anything you've got
on digital. Why not run the promotions, why not run loyalty strictly through (the
app)?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. It's kind of an analog thing in a digital company. It's a fair question.
The thing I would say is -- we have over time -- I've been here six years and I see it
every year -- we've had a number of promotions that are for everyone, not just
Starbucks Rewards customers. But everyone. And just remember that -- just over
30% of our revenue comes from Starbucks Rewards customers, which means two
thirds comes from other.
And so what we do, is we do Frappuccino Happy Hour. We do a share event in the
holiday. We've done Treat Receipts. We've done Sweet Receipts, where you can
come in the afternoon and get a food item. And we've down this thing we call the
Power Lunch for the last year, where you can put together a number of items for $8
and get a lunch.
And so this is not new for us. The thing that we want to make sure is, as the Starbucks
Rewards program accelerates and as we continue to open up the opportunity of
Starbucks Rewards to more people and get more spend, we've just got to make sure
we remember -- hey, two thirds of our customers are not in the Rewards program.
First priority, get them in the Rewards program. But as we're doing that, we've got to
make sure they have access to deals, they have access to opportunities to get beneﬁt
from Starbucks.
We do it carefully. You're not going to see that running for very long periods of time
or over and over again. But that's some of what we've done in the past.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
That makes good sense. Can you talk a little bit about competition -- we get
questions -- you see all this craft coﬀee popping up all over the place. And even
traditional QSRs getting more aggressive on coﬀee. How does that factor into your
growth strategy? How does that factor into any challenges you may have seen over
the last quarter or two? Any kind of thoughts on the competition?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09

Q - Dennis Geiger{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
We said this in the past. And it holds true -- we're still not seeing any one competitor,
or even a smaller number or group of competitors, being an inﬂuence on our
business, at any time. When they run specials, when they focus on coﬀee, it's just not
a meaningful impact. And that holds.
But what we have acknowledged -- and I think we've acknowledged it with what
we've done with Starbucks Reserve -- is the collective group of independent coﬀee
shops out there. They are doing a lot of what Starbucks has been so good at for so
long. You know, it's that third-place environment, the comfortable place to be. It's an
up-level coﬀee experience.
And so what we know is, when we get our service right, no one can touch us. We
continue to take share. And we have all the way through current. So they're not
taking share from us. But what we know is, if we don't have our service bubbles right
and customers aren't engaged in the right way, they now have options.
And so that's another part of the reason we have some urgency around the
throughput opportunities. And reasons we have urgency around the Reserve brand.
So part of the challenge is, I think, with Starbucks -- there's 25,000 stores across the
globe. And so ubiquity comes into the consumer mindset. It would be easy for
people to forget that we still source, roast. And deliver the highest-quality coﬀee you
can get anywhere in the world. Your local coﬀee shop, international coﬀee shop -- it's
as good as you can get. But for customers, they might not associate that with
Starbucks because we're everywhere.
And so we have to remind them of that. And that's the opportunity with the Reserve
brand. And so you're going to continue to see us do Reserve bars, where you walk
into a Starbucks store and have a bar dedicated to pour-over and Clover and just
that up-level coﬀee experience. Might bring certain recipes and elements in from
our Roastery in Seattle with the 15,000 square-foot Willy Wonka of coﬀee .
Then in Reserve stores, they'll be entire -- but in that same store, you'd be able to
have kind of a normal Starbucks experience. But in Reserve stores, they'll have -- it'll
all be Reserve. They'll be dedicated food, including Princi, which is the Italian bakery
that we own a portion of -- Princi fresh-roasted pastries and pizza on site, a lot of
design inﬂuences from the Roasteries. So copper and wood and all the things that
make the Roasteries so beautiful. Then signiﬁcantly diﬀerent menu options on the
beverage side, as well. Then, of course, we've got Roasteries coming in Milan, which
is exciting, kind of returning to our roots; New York; Seattle; Tokyo; and Shanghai.
And those are -- I think Shanghai is roughly double the size of the Seattle Roastery.
I've seen designs on it. It's gorgeous.

Page 13 of 19A - Scott MawThat's excellent. Shifting to loyalty, just touching on loyalty a little bit more --
arguably the best-in-class loyalty program within the industry, roughly 13 million
active members, I think, or so. You probably have about 75 million Starbucks
customers, generally speaking. How big is that opportunity to enhance that
program? Obviously, you can do a tremendous amount of things with that customer
once they're in the ecosystem. How big is the opportunity? How do you get
customers onto that program at an accelerated space going forward?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
It's a great question. And I'm going to start (to what) I think the lowest-hanging fruit
is and then move back to where the opportunity is bigger but the work is harder.
So one of the things that we have is, we have a fair number of members that sign up
but never transact. And those members have gone through all of the things they
need to do to create a digital relationship with us. And we've got to ﬁnd a way to get
them to transact.
So we've done some tests where we look at some incentives for those to transact,
because typically once someone uses the program a couple of times, we get them
more active. And so that's the ﬁrst thing that we're looking at -- marketing to them.
We're looking at if there are ways we can converse with them digitally in-store. And
again using gamiﬁcation and oﬀers to really light those up. That's the ﬁrst
opportunity.
The second opportunity is, we have a fair number, like all rewards programs
probably, a fair number of customers that lapse and go inactive. So we've set what
we think is a pretty rigorous window -- 90-day active. And when they fall outside of
that, they go into the inactive bucket.
We have been really ﬁshing hard in that pool of customers to try to ﬁgure out why
aren't they engaged anymore. Did they move? Is there a way for them to reengage
in their local Starbucks? Then speciﬁcally, again, using a digital marketing campaign
to try to incent them with oﬀers and games and stuﬀ to come back in to the active
pool.
Then the last one is people that don't have a Starbucks Rewards account but have a
digital relationship with us. So they have an SBC card or they have a digital card.
They're paying with their mobile device. But that isn't registered.
And again, those are -- we've done some things at the POS, although you've got to
be careful with that at peak -- and again, a lot of things in-app or email or digital to
try to get those.
Then the last bucket of those customers that we have no digital relationship with --
and what we've done with a lot of our advertising, both in store and out of store is,
we've tried to reinforce parts of the Rewards program.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09

A - Scott MawSo you might see an advertisement for a product within the store, a beverage within
the store. And we might say. And order ahead with the Starbucks app or. And
download the Starbucks app and sign up for Spotify, etc. And I think that's having
increasing success. But the fact of the matter is, the opportunity is big.
And part of the challenge is awareness for us. So we think we have the best rewards
program out there, as far as not the numbers but the value the customers get for
something that is a frequent transaction for so many of them -- daily Starbucks visit,
weekly Starbucks visit. But only about 50% awareness of the rewards program. So
again, in-store reinforcement of that through advertising is an opportunity.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
That's great. On labor, signiﬁcant investment made in labor over the last couple of
years, in particular. How important is securing and maintaining and keeping that
talent within the store, particularly for Starbucks, given everything that's going on,
given what you mentioned about throughput and the volume that goes through the
box, how important is the labor piece? Then the followup to that is, how do we think
about that investment in labor, in your partners, going forward?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
Yes. First of all, labor is a very ﬁnancial term. But our partners are the best in the
business. And we have the best people in anyone in this space. And that's why our
numbers are so good, period, end of story.
With that said, I understand the spirit of your question. What I would say is, we
needed to make sure that we had the right level of investment. As we came through
2014 and went into the 2015 and we did what you're talking about, we increased
speciﬁcally both wages and then importantly, beneﬁts that mattered to our partners.
So we added a food beneﬁt -- which seems so obvious. But it's a fair bit of money to
add that on shift. But given the focus on food and given what we were asking our
partners to do and how hard they work and the service they provide to our
customers, it was a natural extension.
We added the College Achievement Plan, where we've had thousands of people
sign up; and younger people that work in our stores. And there are a lot of them, are
really excited and encouraged by the opportunities that are provided there through
Arizona State. I've hired a couple of their grads in my ﬁnancial department. It's
fantastic.
And so those are the types of things that resonate with our partners. But what's most
important is, we need to make sure that the wage and beneﬁt investments are front
edge, because we have signiﬁcantly lower turnover (that we're on our front foot
sorry) -- we're signiﬁcantly lower turnover than the industry. It's been that way
forever. When we get the investment wrong, that turnover number starts to move.
And that's not good for us, because then the Starbucks experience is at risk.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09

A - Scott MawSo I'm pretty excited about what we've seen. The reality of the math is -- you know,
we've had 15% to 20% guidance out there for a while. What I've tried to tell people
is, we're still within that range as we look over the longer term.
I think over the next two or three years, given all the things that are going on in
wage, both mandated and some things that we want and things we need to do,
we're probably in the lower half of that range.
Now, last year, I said the same thing. We ended up at 17% non-GAAP EPS, 18% on a
(suggested) basis. That felt pretty good. But I'm just trying to give you some sense,
given that level of investment, the right thing to do -- it's probably going to be
harder to get to the upper end of that range.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
Then just -- while you've mentioned the long-term EPS target -- what's the
philosophy there on long-term guidance? Obviously, you reiterated the 15% to 20%
longer-term. Can you just talk a little bit about the conﬁdence there? A lot of the
questions we get are, look, at this market cap, it's never been done before in
consumer to do 15% to 20% over the long term. Just what kind of gives you the
conﬁdence in doing that over the next ﬁve years. And the key factors that get you
comfortable?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
It's a question I'm getting almost every investor meeting. And I understand why.
What we do every year is, we go through our strategic planning process with the
Board. And in that is our ﬁve-year plan. And that's what supports our long-term
guidance. It's not rocket science. That's what supports what we talk to you about at
Investor Day.
Then when we did that roughly a year ago, a little bit less, we felt really good about
the building blocks. And it's a pretty rigorous process. We're doing bottoms-up
building. We look at things that are going to come in and all the initiatives in food
and digital. And we ask ourselves, can we make the level of investment that we need
to make in our people and in technology to make sure we can accelerate the
Company and deliver the ﬁnancial targets that we have?
And the answer last year was yes. We'll go through that again this year. As I sit today,
I think the answer will be yes. But if any at point in time we think either the top line is
going to start to soften or we need to go further with investments, we'll come and
talk to you guys.
Obviously, what we don't want to do is start to cut investments that put our long-
term growth proﬁle at risk. But what's going on in the middle of the P&L right now
around COGS and opportunities and G&A -- that really helps fund a lot of those
investments.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09

Page 16 of 19Q - Dennis Geiger

Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Scott MawAnd the last thing that I'll say is -- as you can imagine, the very last thing that we'll do
in this thought process is lower our guidance. We will, if for some reason we think it's
the right thing to do. But just internally we hold ourselves to a really high standard.
And that's the very last decision to make.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
Right. Shifting from the long-term guidance (inaudible) to the more near-term
guidance. Solid acceleration in your one-year trend going into the back half of the
year. I think you talked about some of what's coming over the summer, etc. Just a
little more on the key drivers getting you to that same-store sales number in the
Americas, to reaccelerate into the back half, just a little more on how comfortable
you are there and what drives that.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I feel really -- when I look at what's happening around the digital ﬂywheel and things
like suggested selling and favorites that we just rolled out -- customers are just
starting to respond to those in some of our markets. Basically, that's -- on suggested
selling, it's zero in our comp base so far. So that's all upside as we move forward,
because we just rolled it out.
The intelligence around one-to-one marketing and the test and control and the learn
and the speed of big data -- I said we're in the early innings of the digital ﬂywheel.
On one-to-one personalization, we're in the ﬁrst inning. And it's fantastic and it's
driving signiﬁcant revenue. And we've been taking our revenue targets up on that
part of the business because it's so strong. But we're just getting started.
And so as we get to the back half of the year, that part of the forecast is, to me,
bright green. It looks really good. Then we get into the summer months, which for us
is a real sweet spot around iced. We have a number of exciting things coming
around tea. Again, Cold Brew we'll continue to innovate on. You'll see a lot more
Nitro Cold Brew (stores) that we roll out.
And so that compared with the fact that we're not going to have the launch of the
Rewards program (to over) and that was a big focus area -- our execution around
Frappuccino Happy Hour wasn't great. It'll be great this year. We'll get it right for our
partners. I think we feel pretty good about on average over the year mid-single-digit
comps and the acceleration we're forecasting.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
Great. I want to touch on G&A for a minute. First, I guess, separating out G&A
between core and non-core, how you're thinking about that. I think a lot of investors
are curious about the non-core piece. So thinking about that. Then just broadly, the
entire G&A longer term -- how do you think about G&A going forward within that
context?
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 17 of 19Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Scott MawRight. What we want to do is, we want to grow total G&A below the rate of revenue,
which doesn't sound that aspirational. So let me answer your question the way you
asked it, because it's important.
When you split that into two pieces -- core G&A, which is, call it 80% of the total, it's
going to grow at half to rate of revenue. And we were pretty close to that in 2015, the
last time we buckled down on G&A. We weren't close to that last year. We just lost
our focus and didn't deliver.
But what Kevin and I have done from the start this year, in the start in our planning
back in the summer is, we've had that target. And as comps haven't come in as we
expected, we have been tightening that down. He's been a fantastic partner in that.
And we're getting traction in ways that I haven't before in my three or four years
here. And so I feel really good about the core.
The second part is innovation G&A. And that is not a huge category of things we're
(pouring cost) into. It's pretty much all two things -- the digital ﬂywheel, which we
have to continue to invest, given the returns I've seen -- the ROI on our digital
ﬂywheel, it's the highest thing that we have. It's just super-high return.
The second piece is around (siren) retail -- so that's Reserve, Roastery. And Princi.
And that will be a fair bit of growth over the next year or two. But it's because we're
building the team.
We put Cliﬀ Burrows, who had run the Americas business, in that role. He's building
out his team. And we're starting to open these beautiful stores. At some point, the
growth rate will (slow but) we'll continue to invest. And it won't be quite as much.
And so I think this year we have a chance to grow G&A in total less than revenue.
And I feel really good about core at half.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
That's great. We're almost out of time. And I didn't even get to ask you about
everything you're doing on a global basis in CPG. So apologies for that. I just wanted
to quickly touch on another point that we get questions on. In light of the recent
management changes at the Company, can you talk a little bit about the level and
the depth of the talent at the C suite, the conﬁdence that you have that the Company
will continue to be highly innovative, a best-in-class operator? Just real quick, if you
could, just on your conﬁdence.
{BIO 18637895 <GO>}
I think we're in great shape in ﬁnance, I'll start there . The ﬁrst thing I want to do is, I
want to talk about Kevin and Howard. And I'll move quickly because I know we're
short on time.
Kevin has been with Starbucks for over six years on the Board. He's been the CEO
for over two years. And the reality is, the hand-oﬀ that can happen between two
CEOs -- there's a couple ways it can fall down.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2017-03-09
Starbucks Corp (SBUX US Equity)
Page 18 of 19Q - Dennis Geiger
A - Scott MawOne of the big ways is culture. We do not have that issue with Kevin. First of all, he's
a fantastic person that knows the Company very deeply. But he's been immersed in
the Starbucks culture for six years. And so that aspect -- and we all see it. The people
that interact with Kevin, there is zero concern about his ability to understand how we
do things in Starbucks. It's wonderful.
Then if you take the combination of Howard and Kevin, the vision, the opportunity
here is, you take all that entrepreneurial spirit, all that innovation, all that founder-led
passion that Howard brings across the whole business. And you keep that engaged,
primarily in Reserve. But beyond that.
Then you take Kevin, who's run these great big international operations, run a global
company in Juniper, had a big portion of Microsoft. And you take all the things that
he does operationally and from an innovation standpoint, huge technology focus.
He's been so important to our ﬂywheel success. You put those two guys together.
And it could be super powerful. That's the vision.
Beyond that, you've got John Culver, who's been a long-time Starbucks partner. He's
run the entire international business at one point. He was the architect behind all of
the success that we're experiencing now in Asia-Pac and China. And now he's
running global retail, picking up the US business. And we're really excited about
what John brings from deep leadership experience.
Then taking Cliﬀ and how well he knows the brand and operations and taking some
of Howard's vision and bringing it to life with our partners and our customers in the
store -- there's no one better qualiﬁed than Cliﬀ Burrows to do that.
Then you've got people like Matt Ryan, who's completely changed our game
analytically and from a customer standpoint and the things he's been able to do to
operational-ize the ﬂywheel. You've got Adam -- I could go on.
We just got -- we brought Kris Engskov, who ran our EMEA business -- and you know,
three or four years ago, EMEA was losing money. Kris turned it around. He's now
running our US business, really in conjunction with Adam on the store-operations
side. But we're pretty excited about that tandem.
{BIO 19694619 <GO>}
That's great. Well with that, we're out of time. But Scott, thank you so much. Tom and
team, thank you very much for sharing this great story with us. We appreciate it very
much.
