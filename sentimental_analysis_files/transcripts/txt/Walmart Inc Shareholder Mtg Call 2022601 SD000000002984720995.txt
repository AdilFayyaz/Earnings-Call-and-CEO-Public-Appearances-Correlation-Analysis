Thank you, and good morning, everyone. It's my honor as Chair of the Walmart
Board of Directors to welcome you to our 52nd Annual Shareholders Meeting. We
appreciate you joining us today.
This is an important year for us at Walmart. We're celebrating 60 years since Sam
Walton opened our ﬁrst store in Rogers, Arkansas. A lot has changed since then. But
we remain focused on delivering on our promise to help people save money and
live a better life, a purpose that has proved to be essential for customers and
communities around the world as we continue to work through some of the most
challenging times in our history.
Our associates have stepped up again and again working through a global health
crisis, high inﬂation and supply chain disruptions. All while accelerating our eﬀorts to
serve customers in new ways, our strong performance is an indication of the great
people in our stores and throughout the Company. And that extends to Doug and
his leadership team who continue to navigate this complex time. Our people truly
make the diﬀerence.
All the nominees standing for election to our Board of Directors have joined our
virtual meeting. Also joining online are representatives from Ernst & Young Walmart's
independent accountants. The inspectors of election today are from Broadridge
Financial Solutions. Based on their report the majority of the shareholders entitled to
participate in the meeting are represented online. We have a quorum and may
proceed with the business portion of the meeting. Therefore our meeting is oﬃcially
called to order.
It is now 10:32 a.m. The polls are open and will close after the presentation of the last
shareholder proposal. Only shareholders who held shares as of the record date for
this meeting are entitled to vote shares. If you have already voted your shares, there
is no need to vote again unless you wish to change your vote. If you would like to
vote your shares or change your vote, you may do so while the polls are open by
following the instructions on your screen.
Now, I would like to acknowledge the director nominees, including myself who are
up for reelection this year. They are Tim Flynn, Carla Harris, Tom Horton, Marissa
Mayer, Doug McMilon, Sarah Friar, Randall Stephenson, Cesar Conde, Steuart Walton
and Rob Walton. Thank you all for your willingness to continue to serve our
Company.
Stepping oﬀ the board and not standing for reelection as Steve Reinemund who has
made very signiﬁcant contributions to our Company. Steve has served on our board
for 12 years, including as chair of our Compensation and Management Development
Committee since 2017. I've personally enjoyed working with Steve and our board has
beneﬁted greatly from his strategic acumen and his tough questions, always
delivered with style and grace. We're grateful to Steve for everything he hasFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01

Page 3 of 24Doug McMiloncontributed to our Company over the years. We're going to miss him greatly. Thank
you, Steve.
Next, I've asked Walmart President and CEO Doug McMilon, to share an update on
the Company's priorities. Then Rachel Brand, our Corporate Secretary will take us
through the formal business of the meeting.
Doug.
Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for your interest in our
Company. During the last ﬁscal year, we grew sales by 9% grew operating proﬁt by
18%, excluding divestitures, and generated $24 billion in operating cash ﬂow. These
results enabled us to return $16 billion to shareholders in dividends and share
repurchases and invest $13 billion in capital to grow our business. We're grateful to
our associates for their hard work and service to others.
Our purpose is to help people save money and live a better life and they continue to
make that purpose real. They've risen to the challenges of the past two years ﬁnding
new ways to serve the needs of our customers, our members and their fellow
associates through all the twists and turns of the global pandemic.
Our sales performance in the ﬁrst quarter demonstrates that customers and
members count on us to help them save money, especially during inﬂationary times.
We miss the bottom line for the quarter, so we continue to make adjustments to
improve performance as we move through the year. Our strategy is designed to
serve people seamlessly, whether that's shopping in our stores and clubs, picking up
their order, or having it delivered. Globally, our e-commerce business, which
includes pickup and delivery grew to over $73 billion in sales last year. We're saving
people money and time.
Increasingly, will also support their desire to be healthier and improve their family's
ﬁnancial position. There are natural connections between food and health and
wellness, and retail and ﬁnancial services that enable us to serve them more
holistically and strengthen our business model at the same time. So we're building a
customer centric, mutually reinforcing ﬂywheel that not only connects health and
wellness and ﬁnancial services to retail and vice versa.
But it also opens up opportunities for us to serve other businesses large and small.
As examples in the U.S., they can use our fulﬁllment services, Walmart, go local
delivery as a service, or purchase ads through Walmart Connect. Our business
models becoming stronger and more diversiﬁed as we add related businesses and
more customers become members of Walmart plus, Sam's Club, or other forms of
membership around the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 4 of 24Rachel BrandJust as we continue to seek to strengthen our customer value proposition, we
continue to strengthen our associate value proposition. Our goal is to turn even
more jobs into careers by strengthening a ladder of opportunity for our associates.
As of April of this year, the average hourly wage for associates in our stores clubs
and supply chain exceeds $17 here in the U.S., our average starting wage in the U.S.
is now $15.70 and the highest starting hourly wage is $32.
In the U.S., about 75% of Walmart's salaried management in our stores, clubs and
supply chain started out in an hourly role. Beyond pay, we oﬀer a wide range of
beneﬁts including a menu of health care options and free college tuition for
associates through our live better you program. Since launching in 2018, over 75,000
associates have enrolled in the program and 11,000 associates have graduated.
When it comes to helping strengthen communities, last year, our Company donated
$1.5 billion in cash, food and other products. Those gifts went to organizations
working on everything from hunger relief to advancing gender and racial equity. We
remain focused on our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion inside the
Company. And we plan to release an updated report on our eﬀorts to foster
inclusion and belonging in the coming weeks. We're working at scale when it comes
to our planet.
Our goal is to reach 100% renewable energy by 2035 in order to hit zero emissions
across global operations by 2040. In 2017, we launched Project Gigaton with the aim
of reducing or avoiding a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. To date,
our suppliers have reported more than 574 million metric tons of reduced or
avoided emissions. We're also working toward protecting, managing and/or
restoring at least 50 million acres of land and 1 million square miles of ocean by
2030.
This is all part of our goal to become a regenerative Company. It's about placing
people and the planet at the center of our business practices. We believe that the
strongest businesses that performed best for shareholders over time will be the ones
that eﬀectively serve all stakeholder groups, including customers, associates,
suppliers, communities and the planet.
Again, thank you for your interest in our Company.
Now I'll turn it over to Rachel Brand, our Corporate Secretary. She'll take us through
the presentation of the proposals.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
Thank you Doug. As we've done in previous years, we will begin with formal
business and move on to a Q&A session after the meeting adjourns. The rules of
conduct for the meeting are available on the virtual meeting site. Under those rules,
each person presenting a shareholder proposal will have three minutes to speak. A
chime will be played within 30 seconds to remain.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01

Page 5 of 24Unidentiﬁed ParticipantAnd I will ask the presenter to conclude his or her remarks once the time has
expired. Each presenter should limit his or her remarks to the topic of the proposal
being presented. Ten items will be presented for a vote today. The ﬁrst three are the
Company proposals. They appear in the proxy statement as proposals one, two,
three.
The ﬁrst is the election of 11 directors. Information about each director nominee can
be found in the proxy statement.
The second is a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of
Walmart's named executive oﬃcers. The vote on this proposal is advisory, but the
board will consider the results in evaluating our executive compensation program.
The third proposal is to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young as the Company's
independent accountants for the ﬁscal year ending January 31, 2023.
Now, we'll move on to the shareholder proposals. The Company's response to each
can be found in the proxy statement. I'll recognize each presenter when it's his or her
turn to speak for three minutes.
The ﬁrst shareholder proposal appeared as number four in the proxy statement. It
was submitted by the Humane Society of the United States. A description of the
proposals included in the proxy statement. At their proponents requests this
proposal is being presented without an oral statement. The board recommends a
vote against this proposal for the reasons explained in the proxy statement.
The next proposal appeared as number ﬁve in the proxy statement. It was submitted
by Cynthia Murray [ph], who pointed to Nikosha James [ph] to present it. Ms. James
pre recorded her presentation, which we will now play.
My name is Nikosha James [ph] and I used to work at Walmart. Walmart found by
Sam Walton once the key to success is to get out to the store and listen to what the
socialists have to say. He knew that the people working for Walmart are the
backbone of the entire enterprise. Unfortunately, the Walmart does Mr. Walton built
is not the Walmart we see today. Walmart associates Cynthia Murray [ph] had been
gracious enough to see her time to me so I can shed light on my sister story, and the
unhealthy, unsafe culture of fear that exists in Walmart today.
My sister Jenica [ph] was found unresponsive on Walmart bathroom ﬂoor, Sunday,
January 16th, 2022. Jenica [ph] was a faithful Walmart associate for ﬁve years. She
worked at a store in North Little Rock. And she was the type of person standing
walking would have wanted to hear from because she knew the ins and outs of the
store better than anybody. When she went to work on January 16th, she started
feeling sick. But there's a well known fact that workers who call and sick the day out
or have to clock out due to illness, or retaliated against or terminated.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 6 of 24Rachel Brand
Molly BetournaySo, although she felt sick clocking out and going to the hospital was not an option
because she could not risk losing her job. She was a single mother and a
breadwinner of her family. Around the end of our eight-hour shift Walmart security
cameras showed Jenica [ph] going into the rest room one last time.
Almost two hours later, paramedics found my sister unresponsive on Walmart's
bathroom ﬂoor. That night, my sister was pronounced dead. If a pandemic workforce
advisory council had been in place before January of this year, there could have
been policies in place to support my sister needs for emergency assistance. But
that's not our reality.
That's why I'm trying to migrate [ph] into action and calling a Walmart executive to
an active care policy so that associated boards are ﬁnally hear it. And what happens
to Jenica [ph] does not happen to anyone else. The care policy will ensure all
associates are entitled to two weeks of paid sick leave and that their health and
safety needs are respected.
No one should have to work too sick to function and to (inaudible). And in case of
emergency, our associates will have clear protocols, proper support and training on
what to do. It should not have taken two hours for paramedics to be called for my
system.
Lastly, the care policy will ensure associates are working with stakeholders at
Walmart on ﬁnding solutions for the corporation. Remember what Sam Walton said,
the key to success is to listen to what the associates have to say, Walmart needs to be
a healthy and safe place to work, where associates are respected in her. To ensure
the success of corporation and associate, Walmart executives need to enact the
period policies.
Thank you for your time.

Thank you, Ms. James. We all express our condolences to you and your family. While
we disagree with how the circumstances have been characterized, we all agree that
Ms. Perry was a valued member of the Walmart family and is deeply missed.
With respect to the shareholder proposal being considered today. The board
recommends that shareholders vote against it for the reasons explained in the proxy
statement.
The next proposal appeared as number six in the proxy statement. It was submitted
by Clean Yield Asset Management on behalf of Julie Kalish, who was appointed
Molly Betournay to present it Ms. Betournay prerecorded recorded her conversation
which we will now play.

Page 7 of 24Rachel BrandGood morning Mr. Chairman, Board of Directors and my fellow shareholders. My
name is Molly Betournay and I submit the following statement on behalf of my ﬁrm,
Clean Yield Asset Management and the ﬁler of this proposal, Julie Kalish.
Our proposal item number six on the ballot calls on Walmart to report on the risks
and costs to the Company caused by new and emerging state laws that will restrict
access to reproductive health care. We've encouraged the board to consider how
these laws may impact employee hiring, retention and on productivity, as well as
decisions regarding closure or expansion of operations and states with restrictive
laws.
As an employer in all 50 states, including many more access to reproductive health
care is already being restricted and were more restrictions are expected if Roe
versus Wade is overturned. Walmart should consider the impact these laws will have
on its workforce and business.
Research has shown that employees expect and desire comprehensive reproductive
health care coverage. Studies indicate that college educated workers want and
expect access to abortion coverage. And by a two to one margin, employed workers
wish to live in states where abortion is legal and accessible. This could impact
Walmart's ability to recruit employees. The loss of access to abortion care may
disrupt or prevent employees from remaining in the workforce.
Women who cannot access abortion when needed, are three times more likely to be
unemployed than those who do have access. This could impact Walmart's ability to
retain employees. Abortion restrictions are already interfering with women's ability
to work, I'm reducing the talent pool.
The Institute for Women's Policy Research estimates that more than half a million
more women aged 15 to 44 would enter the workforce nationally if all state level
abortion restrictions were eliminated. This reduction in the talent pool is likely to
increase with new restrictive laws. These challenges are particularly relevant for
Walmart, where women comprise 55% of its 1.7 million U.S. employees at 935,000
women.
In our view, a post (inaudible) environment would present Walmart with new
challenges related to hiring, retention, productivity, site location, public policy
positions and other matters. We believe it is in Walmart's best interest to anticipate
likely disruptions to its ability to provide comprehensive reproductive health care to
all of its employees and to take steps to minimize the impact of these disruptions.
We'll wait and see approach is insuﬃcient and not helpful to shareholder
assessments of risk and management quality.
Fellow shareholders, if you have not already cast your vote, please consider voting
yes on item number six. Thank you for your attention.

Page 8 of 24Sue ErnsterThank you, Mr. Betournay. The board recommends a vote against this proposal for
the reasons explained in the proxy statement.
The next proposal appeared as number seven in the proxy statement. It was
submitted by the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration and other co-ﬁlers. Sister
Sue Ernster pre-recorded her presentation which we will now play.
Good morning Mr. Chairman, members of the board and fellow shareholders. I am
Sister Sue Ernster, the Vice President and Treasurer of the Franciscan Sisters of
Perpetual Adoration in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. We are a longtime shareholder of
Walmar.
On behalf of my community and the 21 co-ﬁlers who are members of the interfaith
center on corporate responsibility, I hereby move proposal number seven which
requests that the Board of Directors oversee the preparation of a public report on
whether and how Walmart's racial justice goals and commitments align with the
starting pay for all classiﬁcations of Walmart associates.
My community of women religious is focused on the intersection of racism and
economic justice. The nation is facing record setting ﬁnancial inequality, especially
for people of color and mounting demands for real progress on racial justice.
At the same time, we are experiencing a great resignation with record turnover and
job openings, particularly in the retail industry. As shareholders and people of faith,
we are not comfortable beneﬁting from the Company's record proﬁts. While so
many of the Company's employees must work multiple jobs to make ends meet.
Walmart's commitment to equity inclusion and growth of their associates is rooted in
their value of respect for the individual. This value is underpinned by the Company's
strategic practices and programs which are to be admired. The Company has made
steady progress in promoting people of color and increased philanthropic
investments to advance racial equity.
However, we believe more can and should be done to reduce the racial inequities
and improve economic justice within our Company, which will serve as a catalyst for
the entire retail industry. In addition to being a moral issue, we believe there's a
business case for this proposal. Walmart associates have identiﬁed wages as the
most important element of their compensation.
Higher wages have been shown to improve recruitment and attendance, promote
better health, and reduce turnover and operational problems leading to better
business performance. The Company has recognized that investment in the overall
well-being and growth of their associates have strengthened their workforce and
contributed positively to sales and employee retention.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 9 of 24Rachel Brand
Scott ShepardBoosting wages would also beneﬁt Walmart's reputation and bring the Company in
line with his peers that have raised starting wages to at least $15 an hour. The report
requested by the proponents would help Walmart leadership understand the
economic realities that Company's hourly frontline employees face. We are not alone
in this belief as 13% of the shareholders voted in favor of this proposal last year,
amounting to over 30% of the independent votes.
We urge shareholders vote for proposal number seven. Thank you for allowing me
to speak.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
Thank you, Sister Ernster. The board recommends the vote against this proposal for
the reasons explained in the proxy statement.
The next proposal appeared as number eight in the proxy statement, it was
submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research. Scott Shepard pre-
recorded his presentation, which we will now play.
{BIO 6171736 <GO>}
And it statement opposing our proposal, a company speaks out of both sides of its
corporate mouth and along the way establishes exactly why a non-discrimination
audit remains vital. Kudos to the Company for recognizing at least nominally that it is
illegal and wrong for equity based programs to discriminate against any employees
whether honored with the labeled diverse or not.
What equity means current discrimination now to make up for other discrimination
against other people by other people in the past? And it also means dividing
national wealth and power biracial spoils system with each racial and other identity
based group getting a proportional share in disregard of individual accomplishment.
In supportive equity, the Company expressly contradicts its recognition that all
employees not only have civil rights but have the same civil rights as all other
employees. The opposition statement says that for Walmart equity is when diverse
identity is no longer a determining factor in shaping an individual's life outcome. But
if that meant equality of opportunity, and before the law, and three tiers.
But instead, Walmart is calling for equality of outcome a spoil system based on
forbidden categories of discrimination, which of course means massive levels of
current discrimination on those grounds. This is all that can be meant by the
development for instance, of a ﬁnancial shared values network, built with embedded
and intentional eﬀorts to advance racial equity, and the racism inherent in the center
for racial equity is built right into the name.
It might be good business and accounting to act to help poor and deserving
associates or others who could beneﬁt from extra opportunities they have left. It isFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 10 of 24Rachel Brand
Paul Chesserillegal, racist and immoral to limit that assistance on racial grounds or to devote
shareholder funds in racist ways to create artiﬁcial inequalities of outcome.
Walmart's race real discrimination is further demonstrated by Company training
programs that have told employees that whites are inherently racist, while non-
whites are not and that whites must forever apologize for their skin color and
imaginary feelings of supremacy. That sort of employee training is a naked
discrimination by race. It creates a hostile work environment on racial grounds. It
barely dares employees to sue and to win those suits.
It creates massive reputational, legal and increasingly legislative risks. Walmart's
embrace of equity theory leads it to use shareholder money to fund frankly absurd
actions, such as assessing alternative justice programs that help retailers minimize or
eliminate negative inner individual interactions with law enforcement. Walmart
executives have a duty to minimize the theft of shareholder property, not to spend
shareholder money to keep crooks from standing before the law.
This is all very simple. Equity on its own terms means active discrimination on racial
and other forbidden (inaudible). In its opposition statement, Walmart pays lip service
to the legal fact that all employees have the same civil rights, but then cheers itself
about its embrace of equity based discrimination in myriad ways. Walmart just
doesn't get it yet. This audit is vital to save the Company and the executives
themselves from the massive risks that do and should follow from this new equity
based discrimination.
{BIO 7234302 <GO>}
Thank you, Mr. Shepard. The board recommends the vote against this proposal for
the reasons explained in the proxy statement.
The next proposal appeared as number nine in the proxy statement, it was submitted
by the National Legal and Policy Center. Paul Chesser pre-recorded his presentation
which we will now play.
I'm Paul Chesser, Director of the Corporate Integrity Project for National Legal and
Policy Center.
First, I commend Walmart on at least having an infrastructure on its foundation's
website for users to search and ﬁnd recipients who have received more than
$25,000. Having said that, Walmart now has no excuse to not implement our
proposal because you have the website infrastructure in place.
Now all you have to do is upload donations smaller than the $25,000 threshold that
you've set, and also ones older than two years old. If as you stay you're so proudFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 11 of 24Rachel Brandabout letting your individual stores make their own donations, why can't I go on
Walmart's website and looked up to my local store gave to?
Now, as for the nature of the Company's donations, there's troubling evidence
surrounding Walmart management's decision making and contributions that make
our transparency requests even more urgent. In October, it was revealed that
Walmart had implemented mandatory critical race theory training for its executives,
and the program is recommended for hourly employees.
The Company's admitted it is run this program since 2018. In the program
employees are told that the United States is a white supremacy system designed by
white Europeans quote, for the purpose of assigning and maintaining white skin
access to power and privilege, end quote. It also states that white Americans have
been subjected to racist conditioning that indoctrinates them into white supremacy.
This is the same garbage that slipped elections in the state of Virginia last year from
blue to red.
That's the same state that overwhelmingly voted for Barack Obama twice,
remember? And it wasn't long ago that my organization a longtime Walmart
shareholder confronted CEO, Doug McMilon, about the Company's ﬁnancial support
for race demagogue, Al Sharpton. Are you still funding Al Sharpton, Mr. McMilon?
We haven't forgotten that Walmart co-sponsored his 60th birthday party.
Improving Walmart's transparency about charity would clear something like this up.
These donations and training programs as our friends who sponsored proposal
number eight stated, creates a hostile work environment on racial grounds and pits
employees of diﬀerent races against each other.
Being married 30 years and raising four children, my family shopped at Walmart
consistently over that time period. I can't think of a retailer I've patronized that has
been more pleasantly and harmoniously diverse than Walmart during that whole
time. But now because of a Marxist backlash led by Black Lives Matter Grifters over a
couple of wayward police oﬃcers, many of our major cities have been destroyed
and crime has skyrocketed. Meanwhile, Walmart's solution is to impose a racial spoils
system on its employees and through its charity. This isn't leadership and it isn't
transparency. It's cowardice.
Please vote for proposal number nine.

Management, Mr. Penner and fellow shareholders. My name is Marcela Pinilla, and
I'm a Director of Sustainable Investing at Zevin Asset Management. On behalf of our
clients, we actively factor corporate ESG related risks and impacts into our portfolio
management.
I'm here today to address an important governance issue at Walmart and to formally
move proposal number 10 on the proxy ballot. Our shareholder proposal requests at
Walmart disclosed company policy and procedures governing direct and indirect
lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications, including company payment
amounts used for these activities along with the recipients. We also request a
description of management and the board's decision making process and oversight
on corporate spending.
We have had much constructive dialogue with Walmart to date, and really commend
the Company for the steps it has taken this year to enhance its disclosure of ESG risk
management including its oversight of public policy engagements.
However, we remain concerned that Walmart has not fully addressed the request of
our shareholder proposal by disclosing its actual spending. Walmart is an inﬂuential
company with a large lobbying footprint. Yet a complete picture of its spending to
inﬂuence public policy including payments is unavailable for shareholders.
Corporate lobbying to inﬂuence public policymaking aﬀects all aspects of the
economy. Companies are increasingly playing a public role on these issues through
their association memberships. While there's nothing new about companies
weighing in on public policy matter, doing so without evaluating the impacts on
society, along with business implications in today's world could be riskier than ever.
The absence of corporate spending on third party organizations remains elusive and
therefore adapt that leaves Walmart open to risky alliances.

lobbying spending, yet shareholders currently do not have insight into ﬁnancialFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01

report from the inspectors of election, the preliminary voting results are as follows.
Each director nominee has been elected by a majority of the votes cast. Each of the
other company proposals has passed, and each shareholder proposal has failed to
receive a majority of the votes cast and therefore did not pass. The preliminary
voting results will be announced in a press release later today, and the oﬃcial results
will be disclosed in a ﬁling with the SEC.

And we will answer as many questions as we can during this time. For relevant
questions that could not be answered due to time constraints, the Company will
provide responses on the investor relations section of our corporate website as soon
as possible. Substantially similar questions will be grouped together and responded
to collectively.
Now to our ﬁrst question, which is actually a multi part question. How is Walmart able
to use ESG and its leverage to lower utility expenses of the Company to help the
bottom line? And is the Company overreaching in terms of its investments in India?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01

Kathleen McLaughlin, our Chief Sustainability Oﬃcer, I'll ask you to chime in on the
ﬁrst part of the question as well.
But let's address India ﬁrst. We made our investment in Flipkart and PhonePe in India
in 2018, buying them annual majority share. There were two parts of that business at
the time, I guess really three Flipkart, PhonePe and an apparel business called
Myntra. Flipkart and Myntra work together really closely, I kind of think of that as one
business. And it's the leading e-commerce marketplace in India.
Since we've made the investment things have gone well. And we continue to be
really excited about the performance of the business, the growth rate of the business
and the progress they're making in helping to serve customers in India. This is a
really large market, as everyone knows, it's a fast growing market. And e-commerce
as a percent of total within India is still a relatively low share quite a low share,
actually.
So, we're well positioned for growth going into the future with the e-commerce
marketplace portion of the business.
The other side of that is the PhonePe business, the ﬁnancial services platform, which
has also performed really well extraordinarily high growth rates, we recently shared
some additional metrics as it relates to the phone pay business. Both of those are
increasing in value. And we had a fundraise around not too long ago that that
conﬁrmed that to be the case.
So we see the investment in India as being a good investment in both parts of the
business. And as it relates to it being part of our e-commerce growth, it is absolutely
an important part of our global e-commerce growth. And we learn from the PhonePe
business and Flipkart business as it relates to transforming the rest of the Company
to becoming more of a digital company.
So the expertise, the IP, the talent, the problem solving abilities, of our teams in India
are inspiring further change throughout the entire Company, which is also really
helpful.
As it relates to the ESG work and the utility expenses, Kathleen, I'll come to you next.
{BIO 18336643 <GO>}
Great. Well, thanks, Doug. Yes, I think it's a good question to underscore the
connection between ESG and value for the Company. There are a couple of things
that we're doing related to energy that helped create value. So one is energyFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01

perhaps even earlier, and our strategy includes both new ﬁeld -- new facility design
and construction as well as retroﬁt (technical diﬃculty) conditioning, also
refrigeration and other categories such as plug loads.
Second, as our existing buildings and equipment age, we aim to replace or upgrade
the older equipment with the latest in high eﬃciency technology.
And then ﬁnally, we also use technology to monitor and optimize the energy use in
our buildings. So for example, we've installed energy meters and thousands of our
facilities around the world. And of course, this allows our energy managers to
monitor energy consumption almost real time at our retail stores and distribution
centers.
And that data is used in several ways. So, compiling monthly store reports, triggering
variance alarms, diagnosing equipment problems, validating performance of new
equipment, tests, and so on. All of that helps us power our facilities with less energy.
And of course, that ends up on translating into lower utility bills.
At the same time, we've also been working hard on reducing emissions and
transitioning to 100% renewable energy. That's a long stated goal. And as of the end
of calendar year 2020, we were at 36%. Having our facilities powered by renewable
energy, worldwide, or electricity, it's I should say.
And that includes 600, on site and oﬀ site renewable energy projects in 10 diﬀerent
countries. In January 2022, the EPA, the United States, the Green Power Partnership
top 30 retail ranking had us in there as one of the major renewable energy
purchasers in the country.
And so, we've been doing a number of things are on site and oﬀ site. And most
recently, in 2021, we contracted to purchase additional renewable energy as an
example, including 50 megawatts of 129 megawatt community solar project in New
York, and that's going to supply renewable energy to 36 facilities. That's just one
example.
So, over time, transitioning to renewable energy, we think in the context of long term
energy markets, and so on is a value creating play. And it's completely in line with
our goal to get to zero emissions in our own operations by 2040.

And Diana Marshall is also here, she's an Executive Vice President running the
southwestern portion of the United States for Walmart U.S. and we interpret this to
be a Walmart U.S. question certainly sounds like one, Julie. Would you mind
responding?
{BIO 16771003 <GO>}
Thank you, Doug. I appreciate that. We've continued to focus on making Walmart,
the best place to start your career and to advance as we think in terms of the
opportunity. And in so doing that we've created a ladder of opportunity for the work
that we do within our stores, we want our associates to have the opportunity to
advance not only with our company, but also within the store that they work in.
And so that would include areas that we are focused on that are growth areas. OGP,
being one of those areas Online Grocery Pickup, if you're not familiar with the term.
And we want to continue to make sure that we have associates focused on that. It is
not unusual for us to rally around some of the work within the store if we see
increased volumes, we've created a team based structure.
So we have dedicated teams to certain parts of the store and the work. But when we
do see increased volumes, then we will rally around that and ask the associates to
focus on that so that we can make sure that our customer experience is taken care of.
I would encourage this associate to speak with their local managers in that facility if
there are further concerns as it relates to that.
Thanks, Julie.

We'll go to our next question. Why can't Walmart raise wages further, especially
during these tough times? Other companies are raising their wages and $15 is not
enough. It's not enough and not a livable wage.
Now, I'll respond ﬁrst and then Donna Morris, if you'd like to chime in you certainly
can.
We've been raising wages for quite some time now. And I'm happy to do that and
proud of the progress that we've made over the last few years. I expect that we'll
continue to increase wages as we respond to the market if that's where the market
moves. But as Julie mentioned earlier, we don't just think about the wage rate.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01

purchase plan, our 401(k) and our investments in tuition free education, we're
looking at holistic program, trying to create an environment where people want to
take on more responsibility, ideally move into a position of management. As I
mentioned earlier, 75% of our store managers in the U.S. started out in hourly roles.
I also mentioned earlier that we're now to the point where our average hourly wage
for associates in our stores, clubs and supply chain exceeds $17 here in the U.S., and
our average starting wage in the U.S. is now $15.70. So that's come up quite a bit.
And, again, we're happy to see that.
Productivity is also important. We think about that at the same time. And as Julie
mentioned, we evaluate these jobs and basically decide what the minimum target
and top end should look like, for the range of those speciﬁc positions.
Donna, anything you want to add?
{BIO 16617461 <GO>}
Thank you, Doug. I would just add that we're continuing to increase the facility start
rates, and those investments do continue. The starting facility start rate today is at
$12. But the average is over that. It's over $15 an hour. And so, that's very much
dependent upon the market, and the competition in that market.
We have also continued to invest in our Sam's Club associates starting wages, which
now start at $15 and can go up to $32. Our fulﬁllment centers and our distribution
center associates start at $16 and go up to $28. And as Doug mentioned, one of our
ultimate goals is to provide a pathway of opportunity, ideally within Walmart, and
hence the investment in learning and development. And once again, reinforcement
of the over 75,000 associates that have pursued increased education through our
Live Better U Program.
We are sensitive to the fact that we're in an inﬂationary environment, and know that
our associates are feeling that as well. We have been making some other
adjustments that are speciﬁc to certain roles in the Company and continue to
consider other options going forward as we get feedback from our store associates.

feedback from the associates that are living it as well. So, really proud of how we're
working through that and trying to continue to improve the processes.
John Furner would be disappointed if I didn't mention him too. He leads our
Walmart U.S. team and has almost 30 years of experience himself.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Great, we'll go to our next question. It's a statement and a question. Thank you for
your leadership during such a challenging time. Could you please share an update
on our retail pricing strategy in the current inﬂationary environment? And if we have
any traﬃc elasticity risk as a result of increasing consumer prices? Thanks again.
Yes, those of you that follow the Company closely will know that our purpose is to
save people money and help them live a better life. And from the time that I moved
from the working a store into the home oﬃce, I was taught to manage margin mix in
a way to lower prices and to help drive value for customers and sales productivity.
This unique environment in the U.S. is not completely unique to us as a Company
because of our experience in South America, Mexico and other places where we've
had inﬂationary pressure in the past. It is in the U.S. unusual and has moved faster
than what we were anticipating as we started the year.
So, we've been spending a lot of time working with our merchants having
conversations about how to approach diﬀerent pricing decisions and making an
eﬀort to do things like keeping our opening price point items that are related to
food categories as low as possible. We're paying attention to the price of milk and
eggs of course as we always do, but also thinking about cans of tuna and macaroni
and cheese and ramen noodles and other items that customers are looking to more
so or some customers anyway looking towards more during this period of time.
So, we'll do our best to manage what happens with retail pricing as we continue to
have cost increases from some suppliers and also have higher costs as it relates to
things like fuel. The team has a lot of experience managing these things across the
entire company and we're sharing that experience and expect to go through this
period of time performing well as customers look to us for value.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01

That's a topic that's come up on recently in recent store visits. I don't know the actual
date for Walmart U.S. Diana, do you?

Hi, Doug. Actually, they can expect to see through the entire year. We continue each
quarter to add new workgroups. We're making some updates in this quarter actually,
that we're really excited about adding new capabilities and, and more
enhancements really simplify the associate experience. So, it will happen throughout
the year as we move it forward.
It's exciting to get the new handhelds into people's hands and move away from the
TCs and I think they the demand for apps will continue to be high, which is good. We
think we've designed some pretty good ones lately.

Okay. Thanks, Doug. I just would like to just reconﬁrm every year we look at our pay
ranges across the country and make adjustments as approved -- as appropriate. We
are very speciﬁc to those local conditions. We also acknowledge that there's the
ladder of opportunity that we have talked about. And so, our associates have the
opportunity to grow their career and grow their compensation through the ladder, in
addition to within the range. And also like to acknowledge again that this past year
we adjusted the compensation of over 1.2 million associates.
I just add that we value our long term associates greatly. As I mentioned earlier, a
bunch of us are long term associates and we appreciate when someone's serving
the Company for ﬁve, 10, 15, sometimes, Greg and I are signing certiﬁcates for
associates with 40, 45 years of experience. Occasionally 50 here in the U.S., and they
obviously are super important to the success of the Company and understanding
where their compensation levels are as important to us.

Doing well. I got to be there in January and had a chance to visit with the

Financial Oﬃcer for international we were just down at a meeting with our
international associates that are here in town for shareholders week, and my ears still
are ringing from the Canadian team because they brought cowbells to the meeting.
They were very excited.
The stores that I saw, it looked really good. The ﬁnancial performance of the business
has been strong. And strategically they're working on their ﬂywheel. They're building
new businesses and putting them together in a way that's exciting. Appreciate the

Our next question. What is the plan -- what is the wage plan for produce meat
departments in particular, knowing that this is one of the busiest areas in the store
with heavier and more sophisticated workloads? It seems like this area is below
Walmart's average wage at $12 per hour.
Julie, do you want to go ﬁrst?
{BIO 16771003 <GO>}
Like as we mentioned earlier, we are very detailed and deliberate on our focus with
wages and that would include the produce and the meat departments. They are very
important aspects of our business as we think in terms of fresh perception and the
skills and the abilities, capabilities that we need to develop within the stores. So we
look at this not only as we look at the overall starting rates for the stores, but we look
at speciﬁc areas and capabilities within the stores, and make sure that we maintain
that investment and that we're competitive within the markets that we serve.
Obviously meat would not be below other areas. If there's a speciﬁc instance there
where someone's got a concern, please reach out and talk to someone in your
leadership area or reach out to one of us.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Our next question. Do current fuel costs provide any additional impetus to consider
a transition to at least a partially electric ﬂeet for Walmart's massive logistics
operations?
Yes, I'm excited about the electriﬁcation of transportation. And we've got
commitments out there, I'm just speaking to the U.S. There are other things going on
an international, Omer, you're someone could chime in. But I'm here in the U.S.,
we've got several commitments out to buy electric vans for last mile delivery
capability. I hope that things progress to the point that we can be testing things with
tractors, we've got a few orders out there and commitments to try and help drop
some innovation there as well.
But I think the place will see it ﬁrst, it's with EV vehicles, vans in particular running last
mile from stores into neighborhoods.

done a fantastic job with for the Company. And yes, cash ﬂow would be one of our
concerns from the ﬁrst quarter.
{BIO 17414705 <GO>}
Yes, that's a good question. The ﬁrst quarter is always a bit of an anomaly, one,
because of the way our bonus structures work in the stores and in the home oﬃce,
those are paid out in the ﬁrst quarter. And there's other payments that we make
during the quarter that are unique to that quarter. But we also in the ﬁrst quarter,
operating income was a little lower than we had anticipated, and our inventory was
higher than we anticipated. So as we buy inventory, obviously, that uses cash.
I'm not concerned about that we will work through the inventory that we have in the
stores excess inventory over the next quarter two, Some of the timing that happened
in Q1 will reverse out in Q2 and Q3. So, I'm not concerned about what happened in
Q1. And just to point out, again, the ﬁnancial, the incredible ﬁnancial stability of the
Company, we're double A rated credit company. And we still have over $10 billion of
cash on the balance sheet.
So good question, but I think you'll see that turnaround Q2, Q3.
{BIO 1749900 <GO>}
Great. Our next question. Will Walmart ever bring Walmart academies to Canada for
early associates to grow their careers?
Donna, would you like to take that one?
{BIO 16617461 <GO>}
We actually Doug, and thank you for this question are actively looking at how we
might be able to bring live better you to our frontline associates in Canada. Clearly
the education system is diﬀerent in the country. And the access to education, in
terms of the cost is diﬀerent than what we see here in the U.S. making it somewhat
more accessible for some of our associates. Nonetheless, we are encouraged and
excited about that prospect.
We do have education and training programs in every market where we operate
around the world. They're now all branded Walmart Academy over time, there may
be some consistency there too.

Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)
Page 23 of 24A - Doug McMilon
A - Daniel Binder
A - Greg PennerNot as much as we'd like as it relates to inﬂation, if I can categorize that as a supply
chain issue, it has been quite a couple of years as it relates to the supply chain. Here
in the U.S., we buy about two-thirds of what we sell. Here in the US. It's either grown
or made here. So the other third comes from China, India, Mexico, Canada primarily.
And we did see during the pandemic pressures from the U.S. supply chain in protein
categories and some of the other areas. And you all know about what happened
with the ports as it relates to imports.
So during the pandemic, with people being at home more, we saw a greater level of
demand for an extended period of time, call it two years that really stretched supply
chains both domestically and as it relates to imports just focused on the U.S. And
then during the ﬁrst quarter other things happened, including the war in Ukraine that
drove up costs related to fuel further than they were already and put more pressure
on things like grains. So our support wires that were already feeling some pressure
and had been talking to us about cost increases, some of which we had received,
continue to feel more intense pressure.
And so, today when I think about supply chain concerns, I'm less worried about
what's happening with container ﬂow, and more concerned about what's happening
with inﬂation itself. Some of the costs that we were talking about earlier related to
cashﬂow showed up with container storage and things like that during Q1 for
Walmart U.S. and for Sam's Club U.S. in particular. And so, those things are fairly
short term, and they'll pass through in the next few quarters as we work that out.
So I think demand will stay fairly strong. We'll have a successful sales year and we
increased our guidance by a little bit after releasing our Q1 results or as we released
our Q1 results. But we do think that that inﬂationary pressure is something we should
all be keeping an eye on particularly for some of our customers.

We'll go to our next question. Does Walmart have the wherewithal to establish its
own real estate investment trust, otherwise known as a REIT as a separate Company?
{BIO 5585986 <GO>}
Right, because this is something used to be a little more popular probably 10, 15
years ago, where companies would separate the real estate out into a separate
company, and then lease it to the operating company. You don't see it quite as much
as they used to see it. As a company, we're always looking at the best way to operate
the business.
We own the vast majority of our real estate, there are times we lease assets, we own -
we have minority interest in companies, we own majority of some public companies,
there's a lot of diﬀerent things that we look at, and how to run the company and how
to own those assets. And as we've gone through it, the real estate investment trust is
just not something that that has made sense for us and for shareholders.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2022-06-01
