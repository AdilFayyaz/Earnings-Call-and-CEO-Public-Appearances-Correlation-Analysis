I'm Brad Zelnick. I'm the software analyst here at CrÃ©dit Suisse. And we are truly
delighted to have with us today Jason Zander from Microsoft Corporation for our
software keynote this morning. Jason is Executive Vice President of Microsoft's Azure
business. He's been with Microsoft since 1992, started out in engineering. Before
Azure, I think you ran the Visual Studio business.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
That's correct.
Questions And Answers
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
And really, really excited to have you. Why don't we get comfortable? Format of
today's presentation is going to be a ﬁreside chat. And we're going to see what we
can learn about Microsoft's eﬀorts in the public cloud. So Jason, maybe just to open
it up, get to my notes. But I know what I wanted to ask you, Microsoft's mission
statement, it's quite bold. And every time I open up your ﬁlings or listen to Satya
speak. And I'm reminded to empower every person in every organization on the
planet to achieve more. With that, I just think boundless opportunity. But as it relates
to Azure, what is unique about Azure that best enables you to deliver on this very
bold vision?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And thank you, Brad, for having me here today as well. Good morning,
everybody. I would say there are several things that I would point out. But I want to
start oﬀ from an Azure perspective and I'd really push on hybrid. Hybrid is something
that we have made part of our product plan since day 1. And some of that comes
from the fact that we had 20 years experience providing software into data centers,
the data center and enterprise environments. And then we've done the hyperscaleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27

A - Jason Zandercloud. And so that's a really great solution that we have and we've done everything
full spread on hybrid. We also have a very broad portfolio. So going even beyond
Azure, we, of course, have Oﬃce 365. When you think about how one uses that, I
have Azure-acted directory. So I have identity, I have security, et cetera. And the
products all come together. So the Microsoft Cloud, have a look at Oﬃce 365,
Dynamics and the identity that underpins all of these, all of these things compose
well. The last thing I would say is it's not even really a technical diﬀerentiator. But we
are a software company. And one of the key things I always tell potential customers
and partners, we're not your competition. We're here to help support you in a world
where -- I think a lot of customers that I talk to, they don't want to get technology on
one hand from a provider and have that provider turn around and compete with
them on another. And so to us, just being at the core and having that breadth, that
hybrid, those are diﬀerentiators that I think resonate.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Excellent. And if we think about your global presence, 54 global regions, the largest
presence in the marketplace as I understand it. As we think about the various data
centers that comprise those regions and we think about that driving your success, is
there a theoretical limit to the number of regions that we should expect? And how
do you think about the decision to expand further into diﬀerent areas?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
And this one is kind of region how we've gotten into cloud as well. I mean, with 54
regions worldwide, these are the big hyperscale regions that we run all these big
workloads in. Now we do this in order to get close as possible to your potential
customers as well as your employees. And so being able to be in these regions
around the world is super important. Also having more region counts helps us with
things like data sovereignty. Now if you think about our history in cloud, one of the
key reasons we need to do that, we're doing Oﬃce 365. And we're one of the ﬁrst
big commercial SaaS services out there, the most popular one out there today. And
it turns out if you're doing people's e-mails and SharePoint document, et cetera, you
need to be close and you need to have that kind of coverage. And so we've done
that worldwide thing since day 1. If you think about it, if I was a retailer and I was only
serving a couple of markets, I don't really need that. So I start oﬀ with a smaller
footprint. If I was just doing search, you don't need full coverage. In fact, even with
Bing, we really only have about 5 regions around the world that we run Bing out of.
We have full coverage. But it's just -- if I'm shredding the Internet and you're
searching for a laugh out loud cats, I don't need to worry about having one in
Luxembourg, right. So you can just basically service it that way. So our history is kind
of rooted in that. That's one of the other ways we chose to diﬀerentiate because we
needed it. We recognized customers and ISVs with worldwide reach needed it. And
so from a theoretical limit, right now, 54 regions is the ones we've announced. We
do have more that are underway that we haven't disclosed yet. I expect us to
continue to do that. There is a point at which, probably don't need to put a data
center in every single location that would be cost prohibitive. And we have good
solutions in regions like the European Union and U.K. after Brexit and things like that
as well. Then we move into things like Azure Stack, which allow people to get down
to the very last mile. If you want one in the basement of Parliament, we can hook you
up.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27

Helpful. And Jason, as we think about your CapEx investments, I think everybody,
many in this room, we look and listen very carefully to what Microsoft is doing and
where it's allocating its capital. But speciﬁc to the Azure business and the build-outs
that you do, can you maybe talk a little bit about your capacity planning process?
How its evolved over time? And how the approach and cycle time might be diﬀerent
today versus what it was years ago?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And let's look at it at a top level. I mean, I think the interesting thing from a
business perspective, the TAM here is just huge. I mean, it's a tectonic shift. 26 years
at Microsoft and I lived through DOS to Windows and I lived when Oﬃce was
created. This might be the biggest one I've seen and even with that kind of
background. So the TAM is actually huge. And we are, no question, taking share and
growing, which is fantastic. And so we do expect that our capital spend, our CapEx
will continue to rise because we're meeting that demand. I need to go do that. The
other thing to remember is, when I build out for Azure, I'm also doing it on behalf of
the Microsoft properties. So when we expand these data centers, all the servers we
put in, the networking connectivity that we do, we're also serving Oﬃce 365. We're
even serving Xbox. I mean I can watch kids come home on the East Coast and go to
the West Coast because I can see when Xbox kind of picks up and then you have to
go do your homework. And then it drops down there and then all of a sudden
California, it's up again. So we're supporting all of these kind of platforms. So that
capital spend is for all us. But it's built on top of, Azure's the core. Then of course,
there are customers that aren't Microsoft properties that are running on top of it. So
expect that to go. Now your question was then around eﬃciencies and how are we
dealing with this. And so we're absolutely, every semester, do semester planning. I
book new wins on COGS improvements. That includes things like tidying up our
supply chain, our capacity planning, getting better and better at ﬁguring out what
the windows are in long-range positioning and kind of your 101 kind of stuﬀ on that.
And I would say we've grown so massively that we're also now trying to grow those
internal systems we get more and more eﬃciencies over time. So we've continued to
go do that. There's lots of diﬀerent angles in there you can pick apart.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Is there any rule of thumb to think about $1 spend today versus $1 ﬁve years ago or
ﬁve years from now and the productivity that you would expect to get out of it?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. No. We absolutely the kind of -- the real core of that is are we getting more
eﬃcient? And the answer is, absolutely, right. We're absolutely getting more eﬃcient
as we go through. A couple diﬀerent things we do. One, like I said, shortening lead
times and being able to do a better job of predicting where capacity comes through
is something we concentrate on heavily. We have won some pretty massive deals. I
mean, I'd say the cloud has transitioned. And we had cases where people would
come in and run risk management, they do 100,000 cores and kind of run those
through. But you're now getting into the largest enterprises that are replacing entireFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 4 of 15Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jason Zanderdata centers. That winds up being a huge shift. So we do a lot of intentional planning
and getting eﬃciencies on that. Then within the ﬂeet itself, we look at the
combination of utilization, our power utilization, et cetera. We have machine learning
algorithms that we run internally to optimize all this stuﬀ. So we're making maximum
usage of that. Plus we do a lot around our SKU mix and things like that as well so we
can get the best possible planning. We'll even do this, of course, at a worldwide
scale. So all of those things are actually part of what we're doing for eﬃciencies. And
we'll get better and better and better over time.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
And just to pivot to a diﬀerent topic that is I know on just about everybody's minds.
In the headlines all the time is security. And security is clearly an important design
criteria for any cloud service and it's becoming more and more topical and part of
Microsoft's message. And no matter how much we spend on security, some
estimates, $80 billion, $90 billion, $100 billion a year, we continue to wake up to
these breaches. What is Microsoft seeing speciﬁc to Microsoft Cloud as your
responsibility? How much of this is opportunity in its own right versus something that
needs to be inherent in your platform?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And this is a super important one. Obviously, security has never been more
important, especially as we have even more connectivity devices around the web
and they wind up taking even more control over some of our everyday functions that
we all interact with. Now I think the estimates that I've seen are in 2020, the world
economy could get hit by about $1 trillion worth of impact from cybersecurity. Wow.
Okay. So we need to make sure we're all doing a very, very good job on that. From a
Microsoft perspective, we spend about like $1 billion in R&D. That's all of our
professional engineers, men and women that are working on these tasks. We have
over 3,500 full-time employees, they only do security. Our digital crimes unit and all
the rest that kind of stuﬀ that we do. 3,500 full-time employees that are there. Now
one of the interesting things to think about from security from a Microsoft
perspective, we see a lot of unique signals around the globe. We see, for example,
everyone using Oﬃce 365. We have to produce security technology to protect our
own customers and our own products. So we invest in that. We have 1.2 billion
sockets out there with Windows, we see that as well. And you probably have seen
Microsoft publicly work with law enforcement agencies around the world to take
down the illegal botnets, phishing sites and all those sort of bad actors. It's, again,
part of that security investment that we do. Now from a cloud perspective, think
about how old those signals. And we get about 6.5 billion signals a day. We pull all
of those signals in that we see for our own products on the public net as well as
things from the client, the botnets and all the rest of that stuﬀ. And we include it in
our own data and analytics. We run machine learning algorithms over it. We ﬁgure
out bad patterns and anti-patterns. And that's how we protect our own properties,
Oﬃce and Xbox. Then we turn around and make those, your market question, we
take some of the same tech to protect our own customers and we make some of
those products that are available for our customers so they can also have those
advanced protection as well. So that's -- those are just some examples of some of
the things that we invest in. And as you pointed out, I mean the bar is going to
continue to go up.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27

Q - Brad Alan Zelnick{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
In terms of monetizing that investment, can we expect increasingly we'll see you
going after security dollars earmarked within a customer budget versus monetizing
just through the adoption of customers feeling more conﬁdent in Oﬃce 365 and
Azure and all the various cloud services that you oﬀer? Implicit versus explicit, sorry.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Sure. No, absolutely. Yes. And I think you should think of this as, over time, is we'll
continue to evolve. And so in some ways, security is just table stakes, right. You have
to have security in your cloud. And we do. It's going to be built in. So as you see the
kind of re-factoring of the kind of value proposition that the cloud brings. I mean
you're no longer worrying about your hardware, you're no longer worrying about
the underlying management, that just comes with. Of course, a certain element of
security has to just come with. That's the table stakes part of this. And we provide
that as well. So some default protection, it's just got to be in there. People can take
advantage of it. And that would be something, as you point out, would be
recognized more through people leveraging Infrastructure-as-a-Service and our as-
a-service oﬀerings from database to PaaS. That's just a core part of what is built in.
Now that said, today, if you're protecting -- if a CIO is looking at her portfolio of how
she's running your data center, chances are she's actually leveraging 12 separate
products from lots of vendors, stitching a bunch of these stuﬀ together and trying to
ﬁgure out how to go make all of that stuﬀ work. And you're paying for those
products that are there. A certain amount of that value will waterfall into that's just
part of what the cloud provides. But there is a lot of advanced threat analytics that's
available for that. And we expect that people can and will want to be able to do that.
So our strategy here is twofold. One, you'll see us introduce products. I mentioned
Azure Security Center, there's also -- Oﬃce has a threat analyzer as well for O365.
There's a bunch of this technology that we expect that customers will want that value
because it helps protect them and, in some cases, simplify that portfolio that was
mentioned. Now I also a very strong ISV ecosystem. So those 12 products that our
CIO was using in her data centers, it turns out in this Hybrid state where we expect to
see Hybrid across the board, we want to make sure we're meeting her where she is
and then also working with those ISVs so they can bring their products along as well.
So I think you will see us core table stakes. We have some more of our own
diﬀerentiated oﬀerings that we think simplify the world and really do a good job
managing out there. But then we're also going to have that healthy ecosystem that
helps everybody bridge that gap. Then for those ISVs, to also modernize their
products.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Excellent. Thank you. So much. In your opener, Jason, you talked about hybrid as
being a distinct attribute and diﬀerentiator for your oﬀering. And as I also think
about Intelligent Cloud, that's often talked about in the context as well of intelligent
edge. Many talk about edge computing being the next generation of growth and
opportunity in technology, more broadly. And as we think about edge, there are
going to be various players. There are going to be horizontal winners. There are
going to be speciﬁc specialized edge players like security edge players, et cetera.
And I've heard from Satya all the way and down through the rest of the organization,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 6 of 15A - Jason Zanderexamples like precision agriculture, precision medicine. Can you talk a bit about the
edge opportunity as you see it today? Why is it so important? And why is Microsoft
so well positioned to capture it?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. That's a great one. And you'll see our world view at Microsoft. And we've used
this framing for the last couple of years, actually. And I think you captured it quite
well. We took a world view of the Intelligent Cloud and the intelligent edge. Why do
you do that? I think one thing you need the cloud on the back end is really kind of
your substrate. I mean it knows who I am no matter what device I'm using, if it's my
phone or tablet or my car. I mean so the cloud helps with that, gives us that global
reach, that maximum processing power. The edge, as you point out, is all diﬀerent
sorts of form factors that we have available for that. And so that could be anything
from, again, the devices that we're carrying, the stuﬀ on the table and in your bag,
out to things like the sensors that are running this building. I mean all of those things
can be part of that edge. The intelligent piece has to come down to -- do we do
believe that it has to be smart. I mean you can't just have a bunch of signals coming
oﬀ of dumb devices. We'll have sensor measures. Those things have to be there. But
we also want smarts at the edge. My favorite example of this, if you think about self-
driving cars, like there's a point at which we want enough smarts on board so that if
that car sees a red bouncing ball come out in front of it, it hits the brakes right away,
just like you would as a driver because there's a high probability there's a kid
coming out right behind it. Like, I don't want that making a round-trip to the cloud to
ﬁgure out, should I hit the brakes? Is that okay? I mean, like, no. I mean, like, do it
right then and right there. And so I think that intelligence piece is something that's
super important. So that's a topical taxonomy. And let's mention the kind of hybrid
aspect of this because I think that plays in and maybe we can come back to the
edge, if that's okay. From a hybrid perspective, what does this mean? It means that
you're going to have, again, think about that edge taxonomy. I am going to have this
hybrid kind of solution and this is, again, been part of our solution since day 1. And
we think that hybrid is super important, that's identity, it's your data, it's your security
and then it's also the form factors. It's not just can I run a couple of software
applications here or there, it's got to be all those things put together. And that's
been a core part of what we've done. Our hybrid oﬀerings are actually really, really
strong. And again, it comes from 20 years of experience of having actually done
software for data centers and we're structurally positioned quite well no matter what
that mix looks like our customer. In particular, I will tell you one really great example.
We are seeing -- we have the single Azure Hybrid Beneﬁt. What that means is you
can take your SA license for Windows Server or SQL Server, you can run that on
premises. But you can also bring it with you to the Azure cloud. And only the Azure
cloud. And if you look at that from a pricing perspective, that means running that
workload with that SA, Amazon could be up to 5x more expensive for that same
workload, right. And so I'm seeing this really good dynamic in the market, which is
there's a lot of people that have server workloads that might be running SQL Server,
they're on the 2008 product lines. And those are coming to end of service. And so
having a lot of conversations with customers right now about, well, how do I
modernize? Do I just like upgrade it in place on my existing equipment? Or but I was
also doing a data center migration. And if I can come along and give you Azure
Hybrid Beneﬁt, I can help you actually pull that tech forward, you can actually run it
ﬂexibly and much, much cheaper. Then I'm seeing a whole bunch of companies thatFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 7 of 15Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jason Zanderare now starting to zero in on, gosh, maybe this is a great time to move those
workloads, get them modernized up to the latest version, kind of get an evergreen
solution plus the cloud with the savings, a great combination. So those are just some
examples. And then Azure Stack is both sides. Let me stop there on the hybrid
because I want to get back to your edge question.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Please.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Okay. So from the edge -- so that's the basis. I wanted to go hit that just so you can
see how that lines up. Now with that in the background, okay. So now I've got this
combination of the cloud, I've got the hybrid components that I can run with my own
data centers, now we can get into things like Azure Stack which is, again, our third-
generation appliance that we've actually done. I joined Azure in 2012 and we already
had that as part of our strategy back then which has been there since day 1. So now I
can start getting to this edge thing. Let's take a great example, like a connected
factory. It's one of my favorites because if you think about a factory, it's out there and
running it. Stopping a production line in the factory could cost me $1 million a
minute or an hour, depending from what you're doing. But it could be really, really
expensive to be able to do that. And so now like let's get an IoT scenario. When I
come back onto the edge, I can have a combination of my controllers and things on
the ﬂoor, hooked up. But I can put an Azure Stack on the shop ﬂoor, make sure that
everything is nice is connected. Even if there's a ﬁber connection, massive storm,
hurricane, I don't know, something like that, my factory keeps running. And because
of the intelligent edge part, I'm also doing a lot of the AI and the machine learning
locally, that we've actually got people doing production manufacturing. Jabil is a
good example. They put cameras on their production line. They actually take
pictures of components as they go through the diﬀerent manufacturing stage and
they use ML models to actually look at what should it look like and what isn't. So
image recognition. And they'll actually ﬂag defects early and ﬁx the line as it goes.
That's a great example of intelligent edge right there. But now I get Azure Stack
components. And those things come together. Then of course, those same
machines, the things that are running in the factory, I can upload all the logs into the
public cloud, the hyperscale cloud, cheap storage, lots of compute and I can start
running big analytics jobs to tune my production runs. Like is it worse manufacturing
in Germany, in the middle of December, if it's been cold for ﬁve days in a row. It
depends upon your factory and your materials. But I can make those decisions and
tune it. So when you put all this stuﬀ together, I believe we have this really awesome
solution for all of this. It all dovetails quite well. It's been part of the strategy since
day 1. And I mentioned the industrial one because we absolutely have a lead in
industrial IoT with Azure IoT. We've got over 70 major partners if you look at things
like Schneider and Johnson and GE and Siemens and all the rest of these folks that
do that part of the house. Then also companies, I mentioned Jabil, the Cummins and
even coﬀee makers and stuﬀ like that, that do this in factories. So that's kind of like
the world view. Now applied to smart cities and smart buildings and smart
everything. And it kind of lights out. It sounds like the possibilities become endless.
It's really cool. I love it.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27

As it all comes together. And I appreciate the consistency of Azure Stack with a very
seamless experience as it relates to an Azure Cloud and the customer beneﬁt that
they get with Azure Hybrid Beneﬁt, as it all comes together and enables customer to
adopt the architecture that's best for them based on their requirements and
constraints, I know every investor in this room and whoever's listening in has made a
bet on what that rate and pace of cloud migration looks like. When we look back at
3, ﬁve years, 10 years down the road, how much of the enterprise estate will be "on-
premise" versus in "the cloud" however you deﬁne that? I'd be curious, from all the
data that you look at, all of your experience, what is your world view on where -- I
mean we just saw IBM make a massive acquisition in Red Hat. And one of the
justiﬁcations being, hey, only 20% or so of the enterprise today lives in public cloud,
what are your thoughts here?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And this is one -- and I mentioned this hybrid taxonomy, like we actually view
this, again since day 1, as more of a persistent hybrid state. We've never viewed this
as snap your ﬁngers and then some number, you're -- everybody's in the hyperscale
cloud. In fact, this factory example that I gave, smart city critical infrastructure, that's
an example. You're always going to be in the hybrid mode. And we've always
anticipated and expected that, that would be there, that's why it's been our strategy
since day 1 and we've made that investment. So from that perspective, we're going
to help customers meet whatever that demand looks like. I think there's places
where what I'm seeing is people really looking at the hyperscale clouds as a great
way to go run their workloads. And they're seeing the cost savings, there's hybrid
beneﬁt I mentioned, keeping up-to-date, being able to actually save money, those
are things that are absolutely driving that growth in the hyperscale piece. Then from
an on-premises side, like I mentioned all the way down to sometimes sovereignty or
disconnected scenarios, those things, you're absolutely going to want to run things
that way. The good news. And if you think about evaluating our product portfolio
and how we're operating, we're structurally set up well for all of it. We've been doing
the on-prem stuﬀ for 20 years. A lot of the world's workloads run on our software.
And so the fact that we have those assets and we have parlayed that as part of our
strategy into the cloud with symmetry between them really sets us up to be -- we're
the ﬁrst-class thing. You mentioned some of the M&A activity, in some ways, what I'm
seeing now is a lot of folks that, frankly, did a lot of hybrid washing originally that
have a slide on it. But it really just meant put your workloads in my data center and
then we're happy. And there's a title that says hybrid. But not really hybrid. And I'm
starting to see some of those -- some validation actually back on our strategy with
some of the moves that we've made. So I think you're seeing a lot more in market
where people are now trying to get back to where we started with hybrid. In some
cases, vendors that never actually made it into the hyperscale public cloud. In other
cases, hyperscale cloud companies going through partnerships to try and ﬁgure out,
"Well okay, great. How do I backtrack and get some of the stuﬀ onboard?" And so
you'll see more and more of that coming through. In some ways I just view that as a
validation of the strategy we've been on since day 1. Now with respect to the IBM
and Red Hat, which was the last comment that you made from there, what I would
tell you is we've got a really good relationship with Red Hat. That's been going really
well. We've got great adoption of RHEL to Enterprise Linux. We actually createdFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27

Microsoft site. So if a customer calls up, they have an issue, you're going to talk to
both of us. You don't have to get phone tagged. That's the unique thing that we've
had with Red Hat. We have a ton of mutual customers and we're going to keep
supporting our customers. So frankly, from that perspective, the news doesn't really
change that. We're going to keep up with that momentum. We're going to keep
supporting our customers.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
On the topic, Microsoft has embraced open architecture over the last several years in
a way that 5, six years ago, I think, nobody could have imagined. Why is this so
critical to the strategy?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. It's -- and we have. And hopefully, people are seeing this kind of cultural
transformation with Microsoft. It's with kind of our attitude, how we work with
partners. And in some ways, I think of again, with the beneﬁt of a couple of decades
at the company kind of a maturation of how we've won of just wisdom kind of
gained, I hope. And I hope people see that. I would say part of this, also, is I want to
make sure from an open source perspective, we are going to meet our customers
where they live and they're absolutely using open source. That's important. I want to
make sure I've got a ﬁrst-class solution for them. And we do. Now we have a higher
run rate now for Linux creates and virtual machines in the public cloud. It's massive.
So that means we're going to support things like the operating systems. But also the
middleware, the developer stack, the DevOp tools, all the parts of the stack that
need to be there. We're also -- and this surprises people sometimes, we're also a
huge contributor to open source. In fact, there's over 16,000 full-time Microsoft
engineers that contribute into GitHub. It's actually the highest of any corporation out
there. So you can see that. And so we've actually really embraced that. We're
supporting the entire thing. Again, I think it's really about that customer choice that's
enabling it. And really, at the end of the day, the platform we're having you go
towards is the cloud. And we want to make sure all of your workloads run on top of
it.

Just while we're the topic -- thanks, Jason. The relationship that you've had in
embracing Red Hat in open source and Linux, speciﬁc to the IBM deal, is there any
thoughts in terms of what impact that may or may not have and the way that you
think about Red Hat going forward as an IBM company?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And as I say, we have a huge overlap, I believe, with customers. And that was
what really drove us to have this deeper relationship with Red Hat where, if you look
historically, maybe it wasn't such a deep relationship over the last few years. It's been
actually really great. We've had really good programs on that. And so given that we
have those mutual customers in there, then we're absolutely going to continue to
support those customers. I believe Red Hat is going to want to be able to do theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27

happens. And so as far as we're concerned, that means we're full steam ahead on
that part of the partnership. And if things change over time, we'll reevaluate. But for
right now, we want our customers to know -- our mutual customers to know, we're
absolutely full steam going to support you.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Excellent. Just to pivot, a slightly diﬀerent question. KPIs, metrics that you use to run
the business. Other than what we can see externally, what are the key measures of
success for the Azure business inside of Microsoft?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. And we've got a ton. But here's what I would say, the number one thing I want to
look at is our customers happy with the platform and are they experiencing that.
Now one of the ﬁrst things we would then measure from a business perspective is
consumed revenue. Because if you think of it from cloud services, we're more
interested in when people are actually using it, the meters are spinning because
we're solving problems. So we'll absolutely look at the consumed revenue. And that
is a stat that we publish. You saw a 76% growth in Q1 on Azure revenue growth that
comes through. And that's an example. Again, that's recognized because people are
using it, not any kind of commit. So that's number one and I also measure that one
internally. Now if you look at the internal side of what we do, we'll also look at a
combination of, am I making customers happy on the platform. So I've got existing
customers, is their usage starting to increase which would mean and be a sign of a
healthy customer relationship where they're moving more workloads, they're ﬁnding
more value on the platform. We want to make sure that, that goes up. We're also
going to track, from a business perspective, the mix of services that people use. So
as they get more and more into their cloud journey, if they're able to then take
advantage of some of the services we have, Database as a Service or Platform as a
Service, then how is that usage increasing because that's also a good sign of that
healthy thing. Now for me, internally, owning product as well. There's a few other
ones that are super interesting. I measure satisfaction. I'm very, very customer
obsessed. I want to make sure that they're happy. We look at Net Promoter Score to
make sure that our customers, like would you recommend this to your friends? Yes.
It's the same thing on the kind of client side. But we do the same thing for
commercial here. I want to make sure those things are going quite well as well. And
of course, the other metric that we would look at is net customer additions. So if I've
got healthy customers and they're growing and their mix is healthy, are we actually
adding new customers as well? Those are the sort of things that we track internally.
And I won't even get into all of the perf and stress and a whole bunch of other
engineering stuﬀ that's like 2 inches oﬀ the deck. I do that once a month with the
entire division. It's a lot of fun. We call it fundamentals. We always say we put the fun
in fun day. Engineers love it. It's great. But anyway, from a business perspective, for
this audience, those topical ones are the ones that I think are most relevant.

Page 11 of 15A - Jason Zandergone ahead and adopted, you've got premium services, data services, we've talked
a little bit about IoT at the lower levels, you've got infrastructure. Can you maybe just
talk a little bit about the adoption pattern and the economics of customer that goes
all the way up and graduates to Nirvana of Layer 7, or however you think about the
world. And the economics of that customer, the stickiness of that relationship and
how we should think about that and the various adoption curves.
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Layer 7 is your networking dev background showing up. Okay, I can see that.
Software engineers recognize that one. Now I mean -- so obviously, we're going to
meet customers exactly where they are. So the infrastructure, if they just want to
come in, they just want to get some hardware, compute networking storage,
absolutely support that. Like the as-a-service things that we've got, Database as a
Service, PaaS, Azure IoT, media. And then also AI and ML. So prebuilt services for
facial recognition and speech and text and all those kind of stuﬀ. What those things
do is they actually take away a lot of the TACs that you otherwise use as a business to
get things going. So you think the beneﬁt that one gets, like take the data solutions,
those are great. We do things like automatic backup and point-in-time recovery, like
we make sure all those things just work. We keep you patched and up-to-date. Those
are things that cost you today because you're probably spending a lot to your
personnel time on actually making sure that goes. If the service just does that for
you, now I get that beneﬁt. So you get less kind of toil that comes through and now I
can actually get that through. So there's a very good value there that we ﬁnd as
customers move up into those higher-level services that they can actually save
money, if you're from an all-up perspective. And that's good. Now from a business --
if you're evaluating our business, of course, these services are structurally higher
margin and they're also stickier. And so what that means is we hope that it's a win-
win. Our customers get a better solution that actually saves them money on the way
in which they operate their overall estate and they can actually take that savings and
apply to new things. From our business perspective, since you're looking at
Microsoft, again, structurally higher margins, kind of a stickier environment, happier
customers, again, NSAT, et cetera, then all these things kind of come together. Now a
couple of great examples on this one, SQL-managed instance, awesome example. I
can take SQL Server including 2019, which is the latest version, it has a bunch of big
data tech just built in. I can run that on premises. The SQL-managed instance allows
me to take those same apps and move those up into the public cloud. And when I
land those things there, we'll take care of all that toil, those backups and patching
and all that kind of stuﬀ just happens. A great example of that. Also again, there's
end-of-life service support, fantastic impetus for people to make that move. But also
things like Cosmos DB. This a worldwide NoSQL database, ﬁrst of its kind out there.
And today, it's actually a lot of work for the engineers to go set up. Say I want to run
something in 3 continents, you've got to do a lot of work to make sure that data can
get replicated around the world and fast and keep the customers up and running.
Cosmos DB, I just go in the portal, create a Cosmos DB, start writing data. We do all
of it for you. Very unique, very diﬀerentiated, ﬁrst-to-market with that kind of solution,
great example. On the analytics side, SQL DW G2, cheaper and faster than Redshift,
a great solution there as well, all wrapped into the AI stack. So that's how we kind of
think about the structure and where it comes through and there's a lot of really, really
nice product oﬀerings in there.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27

Just a related question. If we think about, as measured by win rates or insights that
you have in data on your customers, your success in Microsoft and historical
Microsoft-centric customers running a ton of SQL Server in the data center versus
Oracle or whatever the alternative might be versus non-Microsoft-centric versus
greenﬁeld-type cloud prospects, any commentary just in terms of success in mix?
And what -- it would seem naturally Microsoft-centric accounts are easier to kind of
welcome in the door. But any commentary along those lines?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
And I have -- and I should -- and thank you, it's a good thing to point out. We do
support all of the platforms and all of those other vendors that you mentioned
before, even when I have something that I compete with in that category like
relational databases. And so -- and I have customers, to be clear, they don't use a lick
of Microsoft Software except Azure. They're 100% Linux. They're 100% Java or they're
using MySQL or PostgreSQL. They were using Oracle. It's 100% non-Microsoft stack.
The only thing they're using is our cloud for that. And like I mentioned, our run rate
on Linux virtual machines is actually higher now than Windows Server machines that
are coming through. And so we absolutely support all of it. Very healthy mix. I'm very
excited about that because they're always -- you wouldn't want people to think of us
as just the Microsoft stack cloud. That's not actually what we are. We support
everything. And I think our healthy run rate and mix has proved that. Then on top of
that, as we point out, the fact that we did actually create all of that other software and
there's a lot of companies out there, high percentage of companies running
Microsoft Server or running SQL Server as well, that makes us a natural home. So
having that awesome third-party support, open source support and then also being
a natural home for Microsoft workloads, I think this is a great balance.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Then from a vertical perspective as well, I imagine there were some obvious
synergies and areas of opportunity, retail, for example, being one, right?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Absolutely. Retail is a really good one, actually. As I mentioned before, I think a lot of
the customers that we have, they don't want to go spend money and get technology
from a provider that turns around and uses that money to compete with them. And
so you're actually seeing a lot of companies. And the more verticals that you start
seeing covered by some of these other -- some my competition, the more they
become the competition of people they're otherwise serving. And so I see more and
more inquiries come in. So those verticals are absolutely there. We just ﬁnished up
Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We had really, really major companies we work
with, ASOS in the U.K., Walmart, jet.com, just a whole set of big retailers that had a
fantastic kind of holiday shopping season they went through, another great example.
But there's a lot more in ﬁn sector, in manufacturing and energy, take a pick.

Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jason ZanderAwesome. In terms of the supply chain, as we think about infrastructure sourcing,
can you talk a little bit about how those decisions get made when you design in a
speciﬁc chipset or whatever that component might be, what's the philosophy behind
choosing A versus B?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes, great question. And there's kind of 2 angles that I think about this in. The ﬁrst
one is just supply chain 101, capacity management 101. I mean anybody, done your
MBA, done any of that kind of work, I mean, we have to make sure we're absolutely
great at that. And we've had massive, massive scale really, really fast. We keep
building the systems up. And this is big scale business. This is not something where I
can just get oﬀ the shelf components and just go run it. So we're also building those
systems. And the nice advantage on a hyperscale cloud is I can build software for
capacity and the supply chain work that we do. And I can actually have that work very
well with the control fabric that runs the ﬂeet, which means I can get signals
immediately and it all just kind of comes together in an integrated way. From a
vendor perspective, normal kind of hygiene, we pick from multiple vendors. We
make sure we're doing the good job from a sourcing perspective. We've also had
open source projects here. We have this project called the SONiC, which is basically
-- it's a networking thing we contributed back. We ran that on top of switches. I don't
have to pay high premiums for switching inside of the data center because we did
SONiC. We open sourced it. We made it available. I can run it on equipment. So as
examples on the software side where we can reduce cost and I'm not going to pay
high margin. And frankly, you'd never do that with your own data center. It'd be cost
prohibitive. But when you're running at my scale, you do. From a hardware
perspective, then we also partner with a lot of the hardware manufacturers. We buy -
- there's enough scale. You buy 1 million of something, not only do you get a
discount. But you can also probably inﬂuence the design. And we'd actually do that.
And we also do some of our custom hardware as well. We do things like we've
deployed FPGAs across the ﬂeet for networking. And we actually -- I have a whole
silicon design team, that's virtually all they do. They design hardware. They design
silicon. Happens to be the same group that also does things like HoloLens and they
do the Surface. And they actually do that for the rest of it. Same team also works in
our data centers to ﬁgure out, okay, what is the silicon improvements we should put
in the data centers as well. So we have all of those.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Can you talk a little bit more about the advantages of using FPGAs and going that
deep into the design?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
Yes. FPGA is really, really cool. I mean a ﬁeld programmable gate array. So what that
really means is I have hard burned in silicon, fastest kind of performance, software at
the top, probably a little bit slower. FPGAs are right down here. They kind of come in
just on the top of that. Key thing is it gives me ﬂexibility. I can actually go oﬀ and do
additional tweaks. But I get hardware-level speeds, not as fast as burnt in silicon. But
the next notch up. We can leverage this for networking. We get 100-gigabit
connectivity for all of our virtual machines and we can continue to improve that. WeFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2018-11-27
Microsoft Corp (MSFT US Equity)
Page 14 of 15Q - Brad Alan Zelnick

Q - Brad Alan Zelnick
A - Jason Zandercan also leverage it for things like AI. So for example, our Brainwave project
leverages FPGAs and does a really awesome job at things like image recognition,
fantastic. So we can go make those go. Then of course, from a silicon design
perspective, the more of those algorithms that we run at FPGAs as they get
hardened, then we turn around to the silicon team and we turn that into a custom
silicon, custom ASICs. We'll actually load that up into the ﬂeet and then we actually
make more real estate available on our chips to do the next set of algorithms for the
next set of wins.
{BIO 16211883 <GO>}
Awesome. And by the way, I recently read about some of your eﬀorts looking at
building subsea data centers. And it wasn't intuitive to me. I would just assume that
it's a lot less expensive to build a data center on top of solid ground terra ﬁrma.
What are the advantages you see there? And is this a science project? Or are we
going to wake up one day and everybody's going to have data centers with
SpongeBob underneath the sea?
{BIO 20468487 <GO>}
In your pool or your backyard with boat drinks. Yes. No. I think -- so this particular
project, this is Project Natick is the code name for it. And this is a research project to
be clear it. And so our Microsoft Research folks are pulling this back together. And
what they really have done is they've taken the actual data center and put it under
water, like literally, like in oﬀ the coast of Scotland is the most recent one the guy
dropped in. A couple of diﬀerent things that, that does, one, 50% of the world's
population actually lives near water. I mean this is actually near a coastal line of some
sort, which means that access to cities, you can put the data and compute capacity
very, very, very close. You also, of course, have natural insulation and you have
potentially perpetual energy oﬀ of waves and everything like that. This also gives us
some experience on the lights-out perspective. So for example, just to be clear, we
don't actually can go greenlight Johnny Quest in the scuba gear to go down and ﬁx
a hard drive. We don't do that. So there's a lights-out kind of opportunity where you
have to ﬁgure out how can I run that hardware with a minimal amount of any touch.
In fact once it's down, no one touches it until it's done and decommissioned. And I
think if you think about that in our, essentially, production which are on terra ﬁrma
and near-cheap energy and stable ground and everything else. So those are the
massive 2-square-mile sites that we build up, then even that experience that we gain
from this helps us do a better job operationalizing the ﬂeet and doing a really great
thing. And as we start doing more and more innovation, we're starting to ﬁnd that,
that even dovetails with stuﬀ we do around quantum computing and other things as
well. That knowledge we gain is actually quite interesting.
