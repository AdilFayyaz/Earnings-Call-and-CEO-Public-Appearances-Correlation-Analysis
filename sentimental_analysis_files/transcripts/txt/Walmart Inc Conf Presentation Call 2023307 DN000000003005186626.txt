Well, good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us at our 44th Annual Institutional
Investor Conference. For those who don't know me, I'm Bobby Griﬃn, cover
Consumer Hardlines, Retail here at Raymond James. And this morning we're pleased
to be hosting a ﬁreside chat with Walmart.
With us from the company are EVP and CFO, John David; Senior Vice-President and
Investor Relations, Steph Wissink; and Senior Director of Investor Relations Kary
Brunner. First, all three of you guys, I appreciate the support and thank you for being
here, you guys been long supporters of this conference.
I'm pretty sure everybody in this room knows what Walmart is, but just quickly, if
anybody doesn't. It's the world's largest retailer, over 10,000 stores, over 600 billion
in revenue across really multiple countries in the world, 70% of the revenue comes
from the US between the Walmart US concept and Sam's Club with about 30% from
the international locations.
So with that, we'll kind of dive right in. John David, thanks again for being here
though.
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
It's good to be here. Thank you.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
So clearly a lot of cross currents in the environment right now, but Walmart delivered
another solid fourth quarter. So maybe just to get us started. Can you talk about
some of the initiating takeaways and what you're seeing from your consumer and
kind of where the consumer is today?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-07

Sure, well, clearly the consumer is being discerning, given some of the inﬂationary
pressure. We see a shift from general merchandise to grocery. We've also seen a
notable shift in terms of share gain for us in grocery. I think very importantly, we're
seeing convenience really resonate in this environment as well. One of the things we
talked about on the last conference call, earnings call was that our scores were,
consumer mindshare around convenience we're actually on par with price right now,
which is a ﬁrst for us and so we're quite excited about that.
But, yes there is obviously, people are projecting each day like when and if we'll go
into a recession, we're very cautious, we recognize that there's a lot of uncertainty in
the environment right now. But I think importantly, we're a company that positioned
well in any type of environment. If the consumer is going to continue to be
pressured with less disposable income, we think our value proposition resonates. On
the other hand, if we get into a better economy that has more growth behind it, a lot
of what we're doing really placed to that importantly around convenience and some
other things that we're doing in that area.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
I'm going to maybe dive in a little bit more, you guys with the last quarter release
ﬁscal 2024 guidance, kind of what it -- inside that guidance what's assumed from --
kind of some consumer behavior, even inﬂation side of things. And then as a second
part, always retail investors remember that the inventory challenges that happened
in calendar year 2023, so how is the team planning from an inventory standpoint this
year?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Sure. Well, our guidance assumes that inﬂation or let me put it this way that prices
stay high. We're not necessarily suggesting that they continue to increase at the rate
that they have, but the overall price levels will remain high. And so that puts us given
our categories with inﬂation, a little north of 3% for us for the year. And then it's very
dependent upon category, food is persistently high and particularly when you look
at year on two year stacks, general merchandise has started to actually deeply in
some categories and then we're seeing some disinﬂation in other categories.
But to your point on inventory, we feel like we're in a much, much better position
with our inventory relative to where we were a quarter ago, but certainly relative to 9
months ago. Our inventory level was ﬂat at year end and actually down 3% in the US.
There are still some problem areas, I'd point out electronics, home, apparel,
continued to be ones where we're seeing the eﬀect of discernment by the consumer,
where they're being selective with some of those higher price point items, because
more of their disposable income is being spent on food.

John David RaineyAnd then we're going to come in the last two quarters, I think in 4Q roughly 50%-ish
or nearly 50%-ish of grocery gains were higher income customers, maybe even a
little higher in 3Q. Can you talk about what you're seeing from those customers on
the shop and the other side of the store and then I think more importantly is, what
opportunities are there to retain those customers? Because some of them might be
newer to Walmart?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Sure. Well, we have seen about 50% of the share gain was with higher income
consumers in the last quarter, in the prior two quarters that was north of 70%, so
really excited about our value proposition resonating with them. But to the point, I
mentioned earlier Bobby, convenience really matters. And I'll give you an indication
of one of the growth areas of our business, but it's delivery from a store. We talked
about this a little bit on the earnings call. Delivery from store has tripled in volume,
almost tripled in volume over the last two years and in the month of January was well
over $1 billion for us.
And that tells you that consumers and our value proposition is resonating with them.
And again convenience is something that appeals to every income demographic,
and so we're certainly leaning into this area with a lot of the investments that we're
making, a lot of the changes in the business mix that we have leaning more into e-
commerce and things like that. That I think will hopefully enable us to retain that
consumer over the long-term.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And Walmart is also -- obviously, 60% of sales or so from grocery, but a huge
General Merchandise business too, there's many diﬀerent categories when there,
we've seen some pull-forward behavior in the pandemic obviously. But when you
look inside the categories, you're starting to see some of the durable goods maybe
show some signs that we're getting through kind of what I would label as maybe two
over-earning phase and starting to level out from a demand point?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Well, there still pressure as I noted in certain categories of General Merchandise.
And if you look at the impact to our P&L last year, probably the two biggest almost
pronounced areas were around markdowns and the mix change in our business
from GM to grocery. That persist or continues into this year, not to the same
magnitude on a year-over-year basis, as what we experienced last year. But we're
certainly expecting that to continue and that's a hard thing for us to ﬁgure out,
because that's somewhat dependent upon consumer behavior and how they react
to higher inﬂationary categories.
But pulling up a little bit, I would say this is a big opportunity for us going-forward.
We are more dependent on our grocery sales today than GM. But one of the things
that we're doing is with our expanding marketplace and growing that. That allows us
to sell more third-party merchandise, to have more assortment, which tends to carryFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-07

John David Raineya higher-margin at least in the US in grocery. So again this is another way that the
composition of our P&L will change over-time.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And then for -- and then I guess, maybe to switch gears. Let's move on to another
very important topic, supply-chain for Walmart. I guess, maybe ﬁrst to start is kind of
recap where we are in the supply-chain today? And costs coming down,
containership cost coming down and we're getting back close to -- I don't want to
use the word normal, but somewhat close to normal again and then we can kind of
build-oﬀ that?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes, a lot of the supply-chain pressures that we faced last year created some one-
time costs that are somewhat tailwinds this year. Certainly, when you look at
categories of supply-chain, shipping, trading [ph] whatever it is, we've seen as much
as a 50% decrease in some of those categories. So that all gives us -- beneﬁt to our
P&L probably more pronounced in the ﬁrst-half of the year, on year-over-year basis
than the second-half of the year as things started to correct a little bit more. But I
think supply-chain is sort of a bigger area that we're investing in and when we talk
about supply-chain for us like, the back of our stores, what we're doing in our
eCommerce fulﬁllment centers things like that, we're investing a lot to drive some of
the beneﬁts over the longer-term.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And before I may move on to that. I mean it seems like we have some puts and takes
obviously within 2024, you guys supply-chain costs coming down. I think there's a
LIFO headwind that we're going be facing as well, cautious consumer, anything else
before we kind of move into some long-term initiatives that you'd like to maybe ﬂag
to keep in mind?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes, so we continue to invest in our associates. We announced another investment
about 6 to 7 weeks ago, certain of our associates within the US. That has some year-
over-year pressure, but as the appropriate thing to do for our business. You noted
the tailwind of supply-chain mix continues to be. I think the biggest uncertainty for
us, because of its dependency on what happens with consumer behavior. But
longer-term, we're focused on what we can execute on and what we can control. As I
noted, I think we're a company that stands to do really well at any type of economic
environment.
And I think some of that is obscured this year, by some of the pressures in our
business. But we really like what we're seeing in our business and what the next few
years hold.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-07

And then, maybe I switch to go back to the supply-chain side of things and really
kind of the future of it. From an automation standpoint, if and when I think about, I
think about you guys kind of the back into the stores, the near kind of the DCs, the
eCommerce fulﬁllment side of things. So maybe, let's talk about each one kind of
what's changed and what excites you about the opportunity on each side of it?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes, well above all things of ﬁrst impressions coming to Walmart, eight or nine
months ago. This is one that stands out to me as quite notable. And speciﬁcally, what
I'm referring to is, how advanced we are in some these areas and these investments
that we're making have considerable improvements for not only our cost, but the
way that our associates work. If you take some of our eCommerce FC, like we take a
12 step process down to a ﬁve-step process. This is better for our associates, less
manual labor-related to that. It's also more eﬃcient and the more that -- more
eﬃciency we get there, it actually improves the economics around our eCommerce
channels.
So that's quite exciting. But for me, when I look at something, I'll give you an
example like a Perishable DC. And we make a certain investment around automation
there and we have projections around the improvements that will make in terms of
throughput, cases per hour. And what's exciting for me, is since we put these in-
place, we're actually seeing that the throughput is signiﬁcantly better, almost 50%
better than what we had assumed in some cases that directly translates to a higher
IRR or ROI related to that. So these are investments that beneﬁt not only our
associates, but the investor well, as we see our the eﬃciency comes through our P&L.
And the ones that we actually frankly want to do more, because there's a very-high
return on these things.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And then we're kind of maybe use a baseball analogy number, what inning are we at
in for these investments in? One of the questions we get a lot is, is a table stakes is to
keep costs under control or does it actually ﬂow into the bottom-line where we kind
of changes the algorithm maybe in the business?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes, we do think it's the latter that this has the opportunity to signiﬁcantly improve
over the coming years. We've made a lot of investment over the last several years,
we'll continue to invest in these high-return areas that have a very clear payback. But
I think we're in a diﬀerent spot than we were 5 or 10 years ago, where we clearly had
some gaps that we needed to address, whether it'd be in pricing or investments in
our associates. And so as we sit here today, we'll continue to invest, but we're at this
inﬂection point, where we are beginning to see the beneﬁts of these investments.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-07

John David RaineyAnd we hope that you will be able to as well in terms of operating income growth at
a higher-rate than sales or return on investment increasing again. I think the last year
has obscured some of the progress here. Notably, I talked about the mix change in
our business that aﬀects that. But we're seeing good improvement this year and
quite excited about what next year and a few years after that goes.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And is some cross learnings. I guess, across the diﬀerent geographies are as well as
business as you know, ﬁnally whether do things more eﬃcient within Walmart US that
can translate into international trans into Sam's Club understanding that Sam's,
diﬀerent business in terms of packaging size and stuﬀ?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes, there's a lot of learnings from each of the businesses. I'll give you an example
Sam's, they do a fantastic job with their scan and pay technology. Roughly one in
four customers that shop at Sam's shop by scanning their items individually. That's a
great digital penetration and ﬁscal footprint and I'd argue probably as good as
anyone that you see out there. So excited about those learnings, there is a lot of
automation that Sam's is doing in-stores.
We're in clubs rather, where we're going, we've got automated bots that are going
down the aisle and basically checking whether things are in-stock or out-of-stock
what needs to be replenished. And that just provides a better overall experience for
the associates that are working there, (inaudible) introduced on that more mundane
those mundane task. But also drops to the bottom-line as well. Internationally, we
have a lot of synergies in the supply-chain area, particularly what we're doing around
purchasing as well and so trying to leverage the best of all these various segments to
make the whole ecosystem better.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
I think is a great segue into kind of the proﬁtability of Walmart and kind of where that
can go in the future. So I mean, I guess maybe ﬁrst, let's take a step-back, coming oﬀ
a year of -- one of the lower Walmart US margins, we've talked about some of the
headwinds, but then I guess, what is the path to rebuild on some of those headwinds
and then we can dive into I think really the more exciting part of some of these
alternative proﬁt streams that you guys are developing?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Sure. Well, there is two big areas that I think if I were investor would be a big part of
my thesis to invest here. One is the improvement in unit economics that we're
making by some of the supply-chain automation, which is appreciable where we've
got a lot of the ﬁxed-cost in-place. But the other areas, which you alluded to Bobby,
with the business mix change of our company changing over-time. Today, the vast
majority of our overall proﬁts are attributable to in-store brick-and-mortar in the US.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-07

John David RaineyIf you fast-forward ﬁve years, we're much less dependent upon that as an income
stream than some of these other faster-growing parts of our business.
So, as we began to grow marketplaces more, have more sellers come to our
platform that are showing third-party merchandise. We have a fee for that, if we fulﬁll
that, we also have a fee for that as well. The more we are doing that more advertisers
want to spend advertising dollars on our platform. Certainly that resonates with
consumers right now. These are faster-growing higher-margin parts of our business.
That just mathematically, change the composition of our P&L to where our operating
margins want to go up over-time.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And maybe, let's say, this one is a little bit more open-ended, but there is a lot of
unfamiliar, let's dive into couple, you've the global ad business fulﬁllment services,
membership. There's a health-care initiatives as well? There's probably some
payment opportunities too. So maybe which one or two excite you the most and
then I'm sure, I'll have some follow-up questions on that?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes, so they all exciting and they're actually hard to isolate because of the inter
dependencies in all of them. And the common thread to all of them is a greater
digital engagement with our consumer. I think that's where we have not advanced as
much as others perhaps in the past. We've built our business over 60 years, which
has largely been a physical footprint. We've got 10,000 stores across the world, half
of which approximately or in the US. But if you consider the future of retail being
omni and we certainly are big believers in that. That physical footprint is an
enormous advantage, where we have just taken in the US, almost 5,000 stores that
are within 10 miles of 90% of Americans.
Going back to this ﬁrst point around convenience, this really resonates with
consumers and it allows us to have these distribution points as consumers lean more
into e-commerce over-time. So they're all very interrelated and if you take
advertising, the more eyeballs that are coming to your digital platforms, the more
advertisers want to spend money. Advertising margins typically range in the 70% to
80% range. I think for a lot of companies and so this again is a faster-growing part of
our business with a higher-margin, which changes the composition of our P&L over-
time.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
I guess really two follow-ups. One, Walmart is always been intently focused on the
customer, lowering prices, giving the best-value. So how do you scale these
businesses with that in mind, where it works in that way? And two, how do us
investors kind of grade the progress of these businesses ﬂowing into the P&L?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-07
Walmart Inc (WMT US Equity)

Bobby Griﬃn
John David RaineySure, we're happy to talk a lot more about this at our upcoming Investor Day next
month. And so we'll give you a glimpse into some of the progress here. But our
value proposition has always been around saving money and living better. And I
think very clearly, we've demonstrated, the save money part has certainly over this
current-period that we're in, as consumers are ﬂocking to value. The living better
means a lot of things to, that gets into convenience in some of these other areas that
we're focusing on. That allow us to tap into a demographic that is maybe a little
diﬀerent than what people have historically thought is the one that skews towards
Walmart.
So we'll continue to monitor progress with numbers of sellers on our marketplaces,
the number of SKUs. We've got over 400 million SKUs on our marketplace right now,
which is quite exciting when you think about the growth that we've seen there over a
period of time. The example that I gave earlier with perishable DCs and just -- I'm
sorry, not perishable DCs with scheduled delivery growing tripling in the last couple
of years. These are data points that I hope gives some indication of how our
progress is just going in these areas.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And then as you're starting to really scale, as you're starting to see more outside
company has come and want to partner with them, then you take the membership
for example, we saw Paramount come in, are you starting to see the Walmart, what
are the 230 million customers a week, does it so pretty big dataset covenant there?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Well, in the battleﬁeld that we're on, I think scale really matters. I think it really, really
matters and both in terms of distribution for consumers and things like that, but
scale, but gets eﬃciency in this area. When you think about some of the eﬃcient or
some of the investments that we're making. And you're right, our customer-base
covers a lot of America and so people want to partner with us. And my
understanding some of the changes that we're making to appeal to a much broader
customer demographic than we have historically.
When we look at some of the advances we made in Sam's recently that skews
towards a more digitally inclined demographic, a younger demographic and so
we're quite excited about what we're seeing in these areas of our business.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And when you look at these business is starting to become a bigger piece a party to
get sets up the enterprise to be able to kind of grow the EBIT faster than sales and a
wider variety of economic environments than maybe historically?

John David RaineyYes, so we've been public with this algorithm for lack of a better term, of having 4%
sales growth with operating income higher than that. We're not immune to the
economic pressure, so it's tough to say that. Yes, we can absolutely commit to doing
that in any economic environment. I don't think any company can say that. What
we're seeing though is that, we're positioned to succeed over a multi year period
with those types of numbers. I think and we'll talk more about this at Investor Day,
but the opportunity is far in excess of that, particularly on the operating income line.
When you look at the returns that we're seeing around some of these investments
that we're making.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And I guess I wanted to follow-up on your comments from the last call about
growing the absolute dollars of free-cash ﬂow. And I guess maybe put that in the
context of capital spending or are some of these capital investments starting to hit
what I guess you deem as an inﬂection point with ROI is really starting to accelerate?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
That's true. And to me that's like a really exciting thing as a CFO, because many
times when you undertake a big capital investment, you're kind of holding your
breath to see, is it going to have the returns that we had expected. And what we've
done, we've already started some of these capital investments. And as I noted, like
what's the perishable DC example, we're seeing the returns that are actually better
than what we expected, which give us conviction that we need to scale these things
and it will have the payback that we want, so quite excited about that.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
All right. And then maybe, we got about 10 minutes left, so a couple of other topics. I
want to hit, also it came (inaudible) talking about Sam's. Sam's has been put in some
pretty impressive performance starting to grow units again. So maybe talk or what
you're seeing there and kind of what the opportunity is to start growing clubs again?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes. So we are quite proud of what Sam's has done over the last 3 years, for 12
consecutive quarters we've had double-digit comps. And we just noted that we're
expanding our stores again with 30 stores that we're adding over the next several
years or 30 clubs, I shouldn't say. And look, when you had three consecutive years of
double-digit comps. I think that supports making a metered appropriate investment
in this part of the business. We'll be disciplined here, we're not going to get-out over
our SKUs. This is a multi year investment, but there are so many things that are going
so well in Sam's, I talked about the scan and pay technology, there's many other
examples of that where we're just, we're quite pleased with the progress that we're
making.
And I think it demonstrates that the value proposition around Sam's is really
resonating with customers consistently. This is not just in a deﬁned period over theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2023-03-07

Bobby Griﬃnlast 12 months where we've seen higher inﬂation. This is consistent performance
year-after, year-after-year.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And then let's talk about international for a little bit. First, it seems like a lot of the
heavy-lifting on the international portfolio may be behind us. So we've exited a few
markets and wanted to do kind of agree at that and see it the same way. And then
two, for the hyper-growth markets, how does the team approach balancing; a, the
long-term opportunity that these markets can lead to with the China, India, verse the
near-term pressure could be to invest in that market in kind of weight adjusting
those returns?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Well, ﬁrst I'll say, just broadband and capital allocation. And this is not necessarily
with respect to international, but with the entirety of the Walmart ecosystem. We're
always looking to maximize valuation and the return on the dollars and so that
includes divesting as you've noted that we've done some in the past. And investing
in some areas and we will continue to be very disciplined with both those going-
forward to make sure that we have a portfolio of products and segments that
maximize the valuation of the company. So I think that's very important for us.
You noted, China and India, really excited about both those markets, excited about
what's going on in our other markets as well. But those are two markets that certainly
are faster-growing. India we have Flipkart and PhonePe, I was in India just last year,
right after I started Walmart to meet with those teams and understand what they're
doing. And both really exciting opportunities, both have large portions of market-
share there. And I think the opportunity and what I guess believe India is going to be
the largest market in the world this year surpassing China, it's a really promising
opportunity in the future.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And then I think Sam's (inaudible) some really strong success in China. China is
reopening, I think you're seeing a kind of a shift in consumer spending there. Maybe
towards consumables like we've seen here in the US, can you maybe talk about a
little bit of what you're seeing in the early stages of the China reopening?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes, so it has been really good. Our Sam stores in China are two of our biggest and
best stores in the entire club network. Quite impressive with what's going on over
there and a huge opportunity. And that really appeals to the value proposition, but
they are slightly diﬀerent than what it is here, appeals to little diﬀerent customer
segment as well that resonates.

John David RaineyAnd then time maybe for one or two more topics. But ESG focus for everybody, but I
think one thing that does get losses the actual amount of time, Walmart does take
into focus on its associated with that stuﬀ. So I guess, maybe two-part question here
is, kind of what are some of the near and medium-term initiatives and what are one
or two things that maybe we as investors are missing from the ESG front end that
Walmart's intently focused on?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes, while ESG encompasses a lot of diﬀerent areas, but being the largest private
employer in the world. Certainly, I think the area that's we're talking about and most
notable is around our associates. And we've made a lot of investments there and the
focus has been on hourly wages. But we're quite proud of the complete suite
beneﬁts and compensation that we provide, our associates and the way that we view
this as we're providing careers not just hourly jobs. We're a people led business, we
focus a lot on some of these supply-chain automation investments and the
technology that we're doing. But fundamentally, we are people lead and we believe
that that's been a diﬀerentiator for us. And we will continue to invest appropriately in
our associates to make sure that, that continues to be a diﬀerentiator for us.
{BIO 20417938 <GO>}
And maybe kind of where we are labor environment? It seems like every couple of
months we see a retailer announced some type of a wage increase of where we are
kind of in that kind of ongoing pressure more in 2023, maybe a little less than 2022,
you got any comments around that?
{BIO 17599063 <GO>}
Yes, six or seven weeks ago, Bobby, we made an announcement about some
investments that we're making in our associates within our US stores in certain
geographies to make sure that they're being paid appropriately for the work that
they have. And this is going to be an ongoing focus of ours. We'll have wage
investments virtually every year. I can make sure that our people are compensated
appropriately and this is a cost of doing business. I mean, fortunately for us, because
we're balancing that with these other investments in our business, we can still do that
while seeing dollars fall to the bottom-line and margins growth.

Okay. And then maybe in closing here, I've got to two or three minutes left, but
relatively new here to Walmart, joined from an outside ﬁrm. Just kind of what excites
you most about the enterprise strategy. And I guess, I'll put it in two-parts, most
analysts always like these two important questions. Let's talk about what excites you
most of the next 12 to 18 and then maybe the long-term as well?

John David Rainey12 to 18 months there is, look there's a lot of uncertainty and I don't think anybody
has got a very clear picture of what's going to happen. I think that we're positioned
really well, because as I noted, we're going to beneﬁt in virtually any environment.
And so I feel like we're safe and secure in that sense and the downside is pretty
limited. But longer-term and look, this has a lot to do with why I came to Walmart.
I've got a ton of conviction in the path that we have. I am a believer that retail is
going to be omni, even more so in the future. And when you think about the set of
assets that are required to be successful as an omni retailer, having that physical
footprint, but also a strong e-commerce presence and very importantly, having scale
I think is a diﬀerentiator for us. And I like the assets that we have in the cards in our
hand and we're looking forward to plan them.

Very good. Well, I appreciate the time. Thank you again for the support and look-
forward to watching the progress.
